Its outgoing chairman, Terry Burns, fought hard to stay on, but the government declined to extend his tenure. Charles Gurassa, the deputy chairman of easyJet and a seasoned executive, has been appointed to take his place. What qualifications does Gurassa bring to the table? He boasts an impressive track record, having served as chairman, director, or non-executive director of 27 companies since 2003. Gurassa has a wealth of experience, but it's largely in the private sector. Prior to his current role, he was a director of leisure services at British Airways and has experience in the travel industry. However, he has no experience in television, apart from watching Richard Branson sell Virgin Mobile to NTL and overseeing the sale of LoveFilm to Amazon. He's skilled at selling companies, not producing TV content. Ofcom and Downing Street have endorsed Gurassa's appointment, replacing a chairman who was a late convert to the Awkward Squad. It's possible that David Cameron will follow a similar precedent when selecting a new BBC chairman. Heaven help the ideals of independent public service. We can only hope that Mr. Gurassa will uphold these values, but it's hard to hold our breath.\"",

The recent stock market rally, sparked by the Bank of Japan's interest rate cut, has brought relief to many in the financial community. Oil prices, which plummeted to $27 a barrel just a fortnight ago, have risen to $34. However, investors are concerned that governments and central banks have yet to grasp the true extent of global economic weakness. The situation is precarious, with China's private debt levels reaching dangerous heights, Europe's banking system still reeling from bad debts, and consumers worldwide exhibiting nervous behavior. When central banks acknowledge the importance of cheap money, investors rejoice, but when they suggest the world is recovering, investors panic. The recent reaction to the US Federal Reserve's smallest possible interest rate hike sent American consumers scrambling to stash their savings. New car sales declined in December, and consumer sentiment dipped in January, following a weak fourth quarter. The Fed noted that even a small rate hike would likely be ignored by US consumers, who are resilient. The Bank of Japan's interest rate cut is another sign of global economic weakness. Tokyo aims to generate domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and has introduced a negative interest rate to deter foreign funds and encourage domestic spending. The move has had the desired effect, with the yen falling against the dollar. We'll need to wait and see how this affects domestic demand. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has put aside its hopes of following the Fed's lead. Governor Mark Carney's recent speeches suggest a more cautious tone. Given the Federal Reserve's potential struggles to increase interest rates, it's unlikely that the UK would consider a rate hike. A rate hike would cause the pound to surge, making exports uncompetitive and leaving domestic businesses vulnerable to cheap imports. Carney is aware that the recent closure of the Scunthorpe steel plant is just the beginning of potential consequences.",

The 5p charge, introduced in October, applies to thin-gauge bags with handles from large retailers, with revenue going to charity. However, Card Factory claims it's not charging for bags without handles, citing a clarification from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. While the retailer still offers some bags with handles for the standard 5p fee, it has removed handles from thousands of bags to provide customers with a free alternative. The bag tax was introduced in England to align with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, which already had similar levies in place. Since the tax was introduced, retailers like Tesco have reported significant reductions in single-use bag usage, with Asda noting a decline of over 90% in Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.

The school's headteacher, Owain Hyett, explained in a letter to parents that the school will be completely chocolate-free, including the staff room and office, to ensure the pupil's safety. Parents have been asked to remove all traces of chocolate from their children's bags and to avoid packing chocolate products in their lunches. The catering department is working to replace chocolate products on the school menu, and staff will be responsible for ensuring that all areas of the school remain chocolate-free. The decision has sparked controversy among some parents, who feel that they were not consulted and that the ban is too broad. One parent questioned the practicality of the ban, asking how staff would enforce it and whether they would have to inspect lunchboxes for chocolate. The ban is part of a growing trend of schools accommodating children with severe allergies. Many primary schools and nurseries have already implemented bans on nuts due to the rising prevalence of nut intolerance among children. National regulations have prompted many schools to prohibit crisps and chocolate from being brought into lunchboxes due to health concerns. A primary school in Kent has taken this step, banning fruit juice from being brought in due to its high sugar content.",

EDF directors were set to meet this week to approve a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, but a final decision has been pending since October. China's state nuclear firm CGN agreed to take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping. However, EDF executives have delayed a final decision due to funding issues, according to French financial journal Les Echos. The company is reportedly seeking help from the French government to find new backers to join the project alongside CGN. Although directors are scheduled to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, no decision is expected until the next meeting, which will take place before the release of final results on February 15. EDF has declined to comment on the matter. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, and the UK government has faced criticism for agreeing to pay EDF £92.50 per unit of electricity, more than double the market rate. A group of EDF employee-shareholders has also urged the company to abandon the Hinkley project, citing concerns that it could put the company's survival at risk. Green campaigners argue that any fresh delay highlights the flaws in a deal intended to kickstart a new generation of nuclear power in the UK. The EDF board is clearly rattled by this crucial investment decision, said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace. This delay could signal the end of Hinkley. EDF managers and employee representatives on the board are concerned that the project is too risky and too expensive. He also criticized former Chancellor George Osborne for defending the Hinkley project.",

The company argues that increased fees to enter the newly privatized Newcastle port will significantly impact coal producers' profit margins. Glencore's appeal comes amid declining share prices and job cuts in its zinc production operations worldwide. The company is challenging a 2015 decision by the then-acting treasurer, Mathias Cormann, who declined to declare the port's fees as excessive. If successful, the appeal would allow Glencore to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration, potentially leading to lower port fees. The tribunal battle will focus on technical issues related to competition laws, but also touches on privatization and price increases. Glencore argues that the port's unconstrained pricing and monopoly over access create uncertainty for coal producers and acquirers in the Hunter Valley. The company claims that the port's monopoly power will significantly impact coal producers' profit margins. The Australian government has yet to respond to Glencore's application. The case will test the limited types of review available to the Australian Competition Tribunal in \"access\" cases.

A vacant front basement in New Eltham, south London, was put up for sale, marketed as a redevelopment opportunity for investors willing to take a risk on securing necessary planning consents. Due to the lack of access, potential buyers were informed that there would be no internal viewings, as the space required excavation before it could be inspected.

Labour's Gareth Thomas and Conservative MP Steve Baker argue that this would bring more direct ownership and accountability to the broadcaster, rather than the current system, which allows for excessive government interference. In a letter to the Times, Thomas and Baker wrote that the BBC is a \"public service\" broadcaster, but its ownership and accountability are unclear. They argued that the BBC Trust, which is responsible for governing the broadcaster, is accountable to no one, creating a vacuum that allows government interference to occur. Thomas and Baker believe that the current proposals, which would give the government more control over the BBC, do not address the issues of ownership and accountability. Instead, they propose mutualizing the BBC, which would give licence fee payers a direct say in the organization's governance. \"Becoming members and owners of the BBC would enable TV licence holders to address the ownership deficit. As members, they would elect representatives to hold the executive management accountable for their actions. Key issues like executive compensation and resource allocation would be decided at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) that would be open to all members, either in person or online. This would fill the accountability gap and provide a strong defense against political interference. Mutualising the BBC would not only lend credibility to the licence fee, but also foster a sense of unity between the BBC and its audience, which is essential for the BBC's success.\"",

The prevalence of racism in the media is often linked to the lack of diversity within the industry, which has remained stagnant over the years. In 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders found that the media reported and wrote from a predominantly white perspective, with fewer than 5% of editorial staff members being African American. According to statistics from the American Society of News Editors, in 2015, only 4.7% of newsroom employees were African American, despite making up 13.2% of the US population. Hispanic people comprised just 4% of employees in 2015, compared to 17.4% of the US population. The problem is not a lack of qualified minority candidates, but rather three obstacles that hinder their entry into the media industry: inexperience on campus newspapers, the prevalence of unpaid internships, and a lack of social capital to gain access to hiring networks. A new civil lawsuit against the New York Times this week draws on statistics related to representation, citing a 2014 study by the Women's Media Center, which found that New York Times reporters were 3.5 times more likely to cite men as sources than women. In 2015, the Women's Media Center released a report for the second consecutive year, revealing that the New York Times had the largest gender gap in bylines, with only 32% of articles written by women compared to 68% written by men.

This unseasonable warmth is a clear sign of the devastating effects of climate change. The country has been breaking temperature records left and right, with February being the hottest month on record and March shattering that record shortly after. In fact, March 2016 was the warmest March on record in Australia. The Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook predicts above-average temperatures will continue across the country at least through May.\n\nAccording to David Karoly, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, climate change has increased the likelihood of March breaking temperature records in Australia by at least seven times. \"The previous record had a one in 43-year chance of occurring naturally, but now it happens about once every six years due to human-caused climate change,\" Karoly said. \"This is evidence that climate change is already happening and increasing the risks of extreme heat.\"\n\nBlair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology notes that while April may not set a new record, it will still be much warmer than normal. Throughout May, there is an 80% chance that temperatures across most of the country will be warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. By June and July, coastal regions will continue to experience unusually warm weather, but temperatures will return to normal in central and southern Australia.\n\nThe current warm spell is partly due to the monster El Niño event that occurred in 2015, which spread warm water across the Pacific Ocean. However, this is happening on top of the background of global warming, Trewin said. In an El Niño year, the world tends to experience extreme temperatures, while in other years, temperatures are merely above average. \"La Niña events were typically followed by normal or slightly cool global temperatures.\"",

The Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, led by former National Highway Traffic Administration administrator David Strickland, aims to bring autonomous vehicles to US roads nationwide. The coalition argues that self-driving cars will reduce crashes by 94%, as human error causes most accidents.

This could pose a challenge for personal injury lawyers, who are already concerned about the technology. Accident lawyer Daniel Vega worries that the lobbying group may unfairly protect tech companies and app makers over human car owners, leaving drivers responsible for accidents. Statistician Susan Paddock notes that testing self-driving cars is challenging, and consumers must become comfortable with uncertainty before adopting the technology. \"Even if autonomous vehicle fleets travel 10 million miles, it's impossible to draw statistically significant conclusions about their safety and reliability.\" \"Uncertainty persists, and I'm unsure how the general public will react to this technology.\" Strickland emphasized that the coalition's goal is to establish a single, national policy for self-driving cars, rather than navigating state regulations. \"The widespread adoption of self-driving vehicle technology will undoubtedly lead to safer and less congested roadways in America.\" To facilitate deployment, a clear, federal framework is essential, and the Coalition will work with policymakers to identify effective solutions.",

Committee chairman Frank Field plans to summon Green to testify before MPs as part of the inquiry. The collapse of BHS into administration will see the PPF take on the company's pension scheme. The retail sector suffered another blow with the collapse of clothing retailer Austin Reed, threatening over 1,000 jobs. Green and Dominic Chappell, who purchased BHS from Green for £1 in 2015, are facing scrutiny over their management of the retailer. Calculations reveal that Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments, and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of BHS. BHS paid out £25m to Retail Acquisitions, led by Chappell, in the 13 months following the sale. Labour MP John Mann has called on Green to repay £400m in dividends paid out of BHS or relinquish his knighthood.

A simple and honourable solution is for Green to repay the dividends, live up to the name of his new yacht, or surrender his knighthood. The committee must examine the Pension Protection Fund and how the transfer of BHS's pension liabilities will affect the levy increases imposed on other eligible employers to fund the scheme.

Total lending reached £17.1 billion, a 64% increase from the same period last year and the highest figure since April 2008. In a rush to beat the deadline, buyers hastily closed property deals, while remortgaging by existing homeowners also surged, driven by the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. The average mortgage loan size reached a record high of £184,200, surpassing the previous peak of £158,000 in April 2008. However, the lending figures reveal an increasingly imbalanced financial landscape, with borrowing by manufacturers for investment plummeting while buy-to-let speculation has soared. Lending to manufacturing companies, which had been growing at an annual rate of 12% in 2014, has come to a standstill, while construction lending is also declining. Meanwhile, personal borrowing on credit cards continues to rise, with British households making 223 million purchases in March, valued at £12.6 billion. Mortgage brokers are bracing for a decline in lending in April, citing the rush of transactions in March. While some predict a decline in the housing market, others believe that the EU referendum could benefit first-time buyers.

A successful northern powerhouse requires stronger, more productive cities, and the government's initiative has the potential to significantly impact the north-south divide. To increase the chances of success, policymakers should address the skills gap in northern cities and enhance transportation within them to boost productivity. Local policymakers should be granted more autonomy to tackle the unique skills and transportation challenges they face.

Ball, who works under the pseudonym Docubyte, developed a fascination with retro computers and began the project to celebrate them. He notes that it's rare to find machines that you can touch and interact with today, as most computers are now touch screens. Ball believes that pre-Apple era computers are often overlooked as design pieces, and his nostalgia for their aesthetic led him to seek out and photograph a range of machines from the latter half of the 20th century. He found the machines at the Science Museum in London, the Dresden Technical Collections, and the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, and then painstakingly enhanced the images with his colleagues at INK studio to make them look new. The retouching is crucial to the piece. The series features eye-catching machines like the Harwell Dekatron, the world's oldest functioning computer, and the Control Data 6600, often called the first \"supercomputer.\" Ball says that the machines look nice, but he would also like to create a comprehensive book about computing history. With a touch of poignancy, he notes that each of his images, rendered as a jpeg, is about 5mb in size – larger than any file that the individual computers could sustain. They're lovely in their outdatedness.\n\nWith a touch of understatement, he notes, those old things are charmingly out of date.\n\nIn a restrained and unpretentious manner, they possess a certain beauty in their obsolescence.",

The Commons work and pensions select committee will launch a comprehensive inquiry into the issue, likely to begin in the autumn. The spotlight has fallen on workers' occupational pensions due to BHS's collapse and Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result of the collapse. The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain's largest defined benefit plans, is facing cuts to facilitate a sale. The scheme has liabilities of almost £15 billion and a deficit of £700 million. The chair of the committee stated that the British Steel pension scheme's troubles are evidence of a broader threat to occupational pension schemes. The committee's case study on BHS is highlighting how such schemes are struggling due to rising life expectancy and record-low returns on capital. \"Pension law and regulation must adapt to the issues of the future, rather than the problems of the past,\" the chair said. \"We should not be under any illusions that British Steel is a special case. The entire savings edifice is at risk.\" The Labour MP noted that 11 million workers have private defined benefit pensions, but more than 5,000 of the associated pension schemes are in deficit, with a total shortfall of £805 billion. \"This will be a major inquiry that will consider radical solutions to one of the great problems of our time,\" he added. The committee will present a unique and free theatrical experience in London, featuring interviews with senior BHS executives and Dominic Chappell, and Sir Phillip Green will appear a week later.",

McFarlane warned against overlooking Europe as a market as businesses strive to establish broader international connections. \"The relationships with the EU will need to be repaired,\" he said, expressing hope that any outcome would benefit the UK's membership. Ahead of a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron and Business Secretary Sajid Javid, McFarlane's comments aimed to alleviate concerns that the political crisis would spill over into the economy and trigger a recession. Cameron reportedly urged businesses not to become \"fixated\" on the EU, but instead to focus on building relationships and generating sales in other markets. McFarlane acknowledged that the outcome of Brexit talks with the EU is uncertain, but emphasized that London remains the financial center for Europe. \"Europe's capital markets are not in Frankfurt, Paris, or Dublin; they are in London,\" he said, adding that English will continue to be the language of business. The UK is not expected to begin negotiations with Brussels until autumn at the earliest, and possibly not until next year, after a new prime minister is chosen. The talks to reach a deal on new trading terms are scheduled to take at least two years. HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint advised bankers to be cautious in making demands in the wake of the Brexit vote, which he described as a rejection of the \"expert class.\" The bank's CEO emphasized that its headquarters would remain in London and that there would be no return to the lax regulatory environment of the past. He noted that negotiations with the EU could potentially lead to adjustments to certain rules. Flint pointed out that the financial system's resilience was evident this week, as markets functioned smoothly despite a significant surge in trading volumes, which was a testament to the robust shape the system was in since the 2008 financial crisis. Following the recent Brexit vote, which sent British banking stocks plummeting, Harriett Baldwin, a junior finance minister, sought to reassure the City of London by highlighting that banks maintain substantial reserves and the Bank of England is prepared to take action if needed.

Carpetright's new financial year started poorly, with UK like-for-like sales declining 7.6% in May before rebounding to a 6.3% increase in June. According to Walsh, the current atmosphere is unusual, with consumers not behaving predictably. It's too early to gauge the full impact of the referendum on the company. Walsh has been working to revamp the retailer, introducing a new store design and customer service improvements. Research shows only 50% of surveyed customers would consider shopping at Carpetright. This year, the company will invest £10 million in refurbishing 100 stores and introducing a new staff uniform. Carpetright has also expanded its product range to include hard flooring, which has proven popular. \"Carpetright still has a long way to go in its transformation, but we're clear on our direction and confident in our plans,\" said Walsh.

Asda's sales plummeted by 5.9%, its worst performance on record, while Tesco's sales dropped by 1.3%, the best performance among major chains. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to thrive, with sales increasing by 11.5% and 13.8%, respectively, and their combined market share reaching a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is poised to surpass the Co-op and become the UK's fifth-largest supermarket. The latest figures do not include the period following the referendum, but analysts believe the decision to leave the EU will likely bolster discounters further. The immediate economic uncertainty is unlikely to cause a significant drop in grocery volumes, but may lead to higher prices and increased demand for discounters. Major supermarkets may benefit from a rise in prices, which have dropped by 1.4% over the three-month period. Store closures contributed to the decline in sales at Tesco and Morrisons, as the companies adjust to changing shopper habits. Supermarket sales experienced a surge in the four weeks leading up to June 18, driven by a boost in sales of snacks, beverages, and gourmet items during the Euro 2016 tournament.

The Confederation of British Industry's latest report shows that the balance of retailers reporting sales increases minus those reporting decreases fell to 4% in June, down from 7% in May. While some retailers experienced an uptick in sales, others reported slower growth or declines. Retailers anticipate a sales improvement in July, with the balance expected to shift to -10% from -5% in June. The CBI noted that retail sales reported weak growth in the year to June, exceeding expectations of a modest decline. Orders placed with suppliers decreased in June, although at a slower pace than the previous month. Internet sales growth slowed in the year to June, falling below the long-run average, but is expected to rebound strongly in July. The survey suggests that consumers were cautious in their spending in the run-up to the EU referendum, but did not completely abstain from spending. A major question now is how well or poorly retail sales will perform in July following the UK's vote to leave the EU. After the Brexit vote, it's likely that consumer spending will be heavily impacted due to increased uncertainty, potentially higher unemployment, and reduced purchasing power. A separate report from Lloyds Bank found that consumer spending on essential items decreased again in May, although at a slower pace than in previous months. Spending on essentials has been declining for 18 consecutive months, with a 0.4% year-over-year drop in May.

On a \"trading\" level, excluding certain expenses, the newspapers lost just £3.74m last year, bringing them close to breaking even. However, the print titles were still shut down in March, as the company sold off the i and shifted its focus to digital-only publishing.

The seven directors of the subsidiary company that runs the Independent saw their pay more than double from £387,000 to £831,000.

The broadcaster's share price plummeted by over 20% on Friday and continued to fall by more than 5% in early trading on Monday. By midday on Monday, ITV's share price had dropped to 164p, a significant decline from its pre-Brexit price of 220p and its one-year high of 280p. Investors' concerns about the impact of Brexit on ITV's advertising revenue have driven the company's market capitalization from £9 billion to around £6.5 billion in the days following the EU referendum. City analysts are now speculating that ITV could become a takeover target due to its declining share price and the UK's currency crash, which has seen the pound fall 10% against the US dollar. According to Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum, the increased likelihood of a takeover bid comes from the historical and present interest of major US media companies in the UK market. Whittaker believes that not only established media giants but also new media and tech companies may be interested in making a bid for ITV. NBC Universal, which owns the production company behind Downton Abbey, has been rumored to have had an interest in bidding for ITV in the past. John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, has a 9.9% stake in ITV, and Malone is also a major shareholder in Discovery, which has acquired European assets including Eurosport and the TV rights to the Olympics. Whittaker has recommended that investors \"buy\" ITV's stock, citing the company's undervalued price following Friday's share price fall. Despite the post-Brexit vote, the fundamentals of ITV's business remain unchanged. Even if we assume a significant decline in advertising revenue similar to the post-Lehman crisis, ITV would still appear undervalued with an attractive dividend yield. In fact, even in a worst-case scenario, ITV's stock price would still be considered cheap. Liberum's analysis compared the 8.3% decline in TV advertising in 2009, triggered by the global recession following Lehman Brothers' collapse, to the 8.7% fall in 2010. Meanwhile, media stocks continued to decline, with Sky falling by almost 3%, Trinity Mirror (owner of the Daily Mirror) dropping 10%, the Daily Mail declining by almost 4%, and WPP decreasing by 2.3%.",

After almost four years of development and testing, he launched his Filament bespoke carbon frames to the public. Since then, he hasn't stopped building.

London ranks fourth, despite having a large number of millionaires living in affluent areas like Mayfair, which account for only one in 29 of the city's citizens. Edinburgh has an estimated one in 67 of its inhabitants with assets worth over $1 million. Dublin, a surprise entry into the top 10, has a higher density of millionaires than many other European capitals, with most earning their wealth from the city's thriving tech industry. Dublin's tech scene has attracted talent from both Europe and the US, contributing to its high number of millionaires. Monaco continues to add more millionaires per capita than any other city, with a 6% increase in density since the last ranking two years ago. Credit Suisse's annual research on global wealth has found that inequality is growing worldwide, with half of the planet's wealth now held by just 1% of the population. The middle class has been disproportionately affected, with the very rich benefiting at their expense.

The company's parent, Centrica, attributed the decline to increased competition among energy suppliers and the expiration of long-term contracts. The decline in customer numbers was partially offset by a rise in June, according to British Gas. Energy analyst Claire Osborne noted that British Gas's market share is being eroded by smaller and larger suppliers alike. British Gas is the only major supplier to have lowered its standard gas prices three times since the start of last year. Despite this, its best deal remains more expensive than the cheapest option on the market. Centrica reported a 6% decline in operating profit at its UK home business, falling to £635 million. The company's total revenue fell 13% to £13.4 billion. Centrica has implemented £141 million in cost cuts and plans to achieve £750 million in savings by 2020. The company is currently reducing its workforce by 6,000 jobs, with plans to cut 3,000 staff by the end of the year. CEO Iain Conn described the first half of the year as challenging, but the company has responded strongly and made significant progress.

According to Olivetree Financial data, compiled for FT Money, FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 company directors made more than £18.5m in share purchases between June 23 and July. This is the largest amount of individual director buys in at least 10 years. The sectors most affected by the Brexit news - banks, housebuilders, retailers, and travel companies - saw the largest director purchases. Many boardroom directors have benefited from these deals as the stock market rebounded following the initial dramatic falls. The majority of these transactions took place in late June and early July. The largest single transaction in the FTSE 100 was made by the Darwazah family, Hikma Pharmaceuticals' founding shareholders, who purchased £3.3m of shares the day after the Brexit vote. Tony Pidgley, chairman of Berkeley Group, bought nearly £800,000 of shares on June 27 and has seen their value increase by 15% since then. Lloyds Banking Group saw the most director purchases, with 21 directors buying shares worth over £750,000. Provident Financial was second, with seven directors buying nearly £1.5m of stock, followed by Vodafone, where five directors purchased £1.4m of shares.

Business Secretary Greg Clark welcomed the announcement, describing it as \"great news for the UK economy.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU, McDonald's is pushing forward with its expansion plans. The company's CEO, Paul Pomroy, emphasized that all new jobs will be permanent, with a mix of full-time and part-time positions. McDonald's has faced criticism for its use of zero-hours contracts, but is now offering staff the option to switch to fixed-hours contracts.\n\nThe company's decision to revamp its employment policy was driven by feedback from workers, who reported difficulties in securing loans, mortgages, and mobile phone contracts due to the uncertainty of their employment status. Pomroy stated that the company considered delaying its expansion plans after the EU referendum, but has instead chosen to accelerate its growth.\n\nPomroy drew parallels with the last recession, saying that he has learned a great deal from it and is now focused on positioning McDonald's as an \"employer of choice\" in the UK.

Italy's economy has stagnated for over two decades, characterized by sluggish growth, declining competitiveness, and high unemployment. The resulting non-performing loans have ballooned to €360 billion, equivalent to 18% of all outstanding loans, crippling Italian banks. While non-performing loans are a symptom of the problem, they do not cause it. Unlike Greece, Ireland, and Spain, Italy did not experience an economic boom before the 2008-09 financial crisis, and its performance has been consistently underwhelming. As a result, the economy is 10% smaller than it was before the crisis, and unemployment is high, particularly in southern Italy. Before joining the euro, Italy could have bolstered its competitiveness by devaluing the lira, but that option is no longer available. This creates a significant risk: a European slowdown following Brexit, combined with Italy's already weak economy, could lead to bank failures and small investors being forced to absorb losses. If the Five Star Movement, which has pledged to hold a referendum on leaving the euro, were to come to power, the possibility of Quitaly cannot be ruled out.

Specifically, 12% of agents have reported a decline in asking rents over the past 10 days. While Arla's report suggests that the rental market has thus far responded to Brexit in a calm manner, the organization warns that continued uncertainty could lead to turbulence in the coming months. David Cox, managing director of Arla, emphasized the need for the new government to prioritize housing and the rental market, citing concerns that a lack of certainty could lead to institutional investors pulling out of the market, ultimately impacting tenants by reducing supply and increasing rents.\n\nThe report also found that almost 36% of Arla members have reported a reduction or no change in the number of prospective tenants looking for properties. Notably, overall supply and demand for rental accommodation increased in June, with prospective tenants seeing a 12% average increase and properties on agents' books rising by an average of 3%. According to Cox, the key takeaway from the Brexit vote is that supply and demand remain a significant issue in the rental market. If supply continues to dwindle against growing demand, renting will become more difficult and expensive for tenants, regardless of the eventual implications of Brexit. A recent report by the Taxpayer's Alliance recommends slashing stamp duty on homes by half and eventually eliminating it altogether. The report argues that the current tax is exacerbating supply shortages and driving up rents for tenants. Specifically, it suggests abolishing the 3% surcharge on buy-to-let and additional homes, warning that investors will likely pass on the costs to tenants, further increasing rents.",

In 2015, there were 6,700 applications for new retail developments, a decline from 7,360 in the previous year. This represents a nearly 50% drop from the pre-recession peak of 11,900 applications in 2008. The report highlights the ongoing challenges faced by shopkeepers as consumers increasingly turn to online shopping. Despite efforts by traditional retailers to expand their online presence, many are struggling to keep pace with online-only brands. The report suggests that the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote could exacerbate these challenges, with potential negative impacts on the UK economy. According to Aimee Barrable of EMW, the continued success of online retailers has led to a decrease in the appetite for new shop openings. Many retailers instead opt to develop their online services or repurpose existing space. The recent high-profile closures could lead to an increase in available retail space, potentially attracting retailers looking to expand their high street presence. Some retailers may delay committing to new shop developments until the economic impact of the Brexit vote becomes clearer. Last week, official statistics showed a 0.9% decline in retail sales between May and June, exceeding the 0.6% decline expected by economists. While the decline was partly attributed to inclement weather, the figures also hinted at the impact of the Brexit vote on consumer spending.",

The firm received a severe reprimand and must pay £750,000 towards the FRC's costs. The fine was reduced from £3.5 million after mitigation and a settlement discount. PwC admitted that its conduct fell short of expected standards in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC stated that PwC had insufficient audit evidence regarding the loan loss provision and failed to identify inadequate disclosure of the impairment policy in the financial statements. The watchdog said that the disclosures were not in compliance with accountancy rules. PwC acknowledged that certain aspects of its 2007 audit did not meet expected standards. Audit quality is a top priority for PwC, and the FRC's annual audit quality assessments have shown a trend of improvement in its work over several years. Gareth Rees QC, executive counsel to the FRC, stated that the substantial fines imposed reflect the seriousness of the audit failings and will send a strong signal to the audit community about the importance of upholding high standards of professional conduct in audit work. PwC and its audit engagement partner, Simon Bradburn, were sued by Cattles, which alleged that the accountants acted negligently in their auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis. Cattles claimed that the loan book of Welcome was weaker than stated in PwC's audit. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of creditors to Cattles, which lent to people with poor credit histories and entered into a financial restructuring scheme in 2011. The original fine of £3.5 million would have been the largest ever. PwC was also criticized for its auditing of Cattles and Welcome Financial Services, which led to a financial crisis.",

This modern twist on an ancient riddle is sure to captivate partygoers and puzzle enthusiasts alike. Three friends head to a carnival with a 1.2-liter jerry can filled with rum punch. Upon arrival, they decide to split the drinks among three separate sound systems. To do so, they must divide the punch equally among themselves. Fortunately, they brought two large bottles to aid in the task. However, they soon discover that these bottles lack measurements. One of the friends finds an empty 50cl Red Stripe can and a 15cl vial marked 'rave juice' on the ground. A nearby water tap allows them to clean the can and vial. Using only these vessels and the knowledge that the jerry can initially held 1.2 liters of punch, how do the friends manage to divide the punch into three equal portions?

However, proponents of this idea should consider real-life examples. Is a child who excels in math but struggles with written communication a \"clever\" child or not? What about one who is skilled in reading and writing but has a talent for art and craftsmanship? Or a refugee who performs poorly on the 11-plus due to limited English proficiency? Is a child who barely passes the test because they missed weeks of school due to homelessness truly \"clever\"? Or one who barely scrapes by with private tutoring? The idea of categorizing children into \"clever\" and \"not clever\" is nonsensical, as is the notion that two types of schools are needed to provide different forms of education.\n\nI was thrilled to read Michael Liversidge's letter about his academic achievements despite his poor O-level performance. I was a student at the same school, which had direct grant status at the time, and my father was one of Michael's history tutors. Shortly before our O-level exams, I recall overhearing him refer to several of my classmates as \"nice guys, but not very bright.\" One of them, Chris Penny, went on to work at GCHQ, where he claimed to be a cleaner, although his funeral attendance last year suggested a more significant role. Another, Matthew Harding, left to become a tea-boy in a finance house, but he eventually owned the business and Chelsea football club. Good grades on academic exams are a clear indicator of academic aptitude, nothing more.\n\nThe selective school system not only resulted in the majority of students being rejected at age 11, but it also segregated children within families. In 1958, I took the 11-plus exam and was accepted into a grammar school, while my twin brother didn't pass and attended a secondary modern. Although I didn't excel enough to continue in the sixth form, I transferred to a further education college instead. There, I met someone who shared with me that he had also failed the 11-plus. His parents were so concerned about the social stigma associated with the local secondary modern that they sent him to a school in a neighboring town, whose uniform was unfamiliar to their neighbors.",

Analysts are revising their growth forecasts for the third quarter, ranging from 0.4% to 0.5%. The upward revision to growth in the second quarter has bolstered hopes of avoiding a recession. Prior to the Brexit vote, the economy had significant momentum, and while it will likely slow in the second half of 2016, it will not experience two consecutive quarters of declining output. The government received less welcome news, as the UK's balance of payments deficit widened to 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016. The deterioration in the UK's trade performance was the primary driver of this increase, highlighting the imbalance in the economy. In essence, domestic producers are struggling to keep up with consumer demand. The post-Brexit decline in the value of sterling will make exports more competitive, but it will also curb consumer spending by making imports more expensive. Turning around the balance of payments will be a significant challenge, regardless of the outcome of the referendum. The Bank of England may reconsider cutting interest rates again in November, given the economy's resilience in the face of Brexit. The current interest rate of 0.25% is already at a record low, and the bank may be hesitant to reduce it further. The Bank of England may choose to conserve its resources for future use, allowing Chancellor Philip Hammond to take the lead. Despite the recent positive growth news, stimulus measures in the autumn statement still seem likely. This is because the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote is likely to have a more significant impact on long-term business decisions rather than consumer spending. Hammond would be wise to temporarily pause deficit reduction during the two-year Brexit negotiation period, using the extra £30 billion to fund public investment. This approach would have a double benefit: it would help maintain economic growth and ensure that growth is more balanced.",

Gone are the cassette tapes and plastic eyes, replaced by a 4GB hard drive and animated LCD eyes. Wicked Cool Toys is reviving the classic toy after an early prototype was showcased at the Dallas Toy Fair. The toy is scheduled to launch in 2017, with Wicked Cool Toys co-president Jeremy Padawer sharing the news with YouTube's Mommy and Gracie Show.\n\nThe company is targeting original fans of Teddy Ruxpin, now grown up and becoming parents, who are nostalgic for the toy that was first launched in 1985. The toy was an instant hit, selling $93 million worth of units in its first year and eventually selling over 8 million units and 11 million books. Teddy Ruxpin was one of the best-selling toys of the 1980s, alongside Polly Pocket, Glo Worm, Pound Puppies, and Glo Worm.\n\nThe original Teddy Ruxpin came with a slot for cassette tapes, which the toy would \"read\" to children while moving its eyes and mouth. The toy's creator, Ken Forsse, also wrote an accompanying fantasy world, following Teddy and his best friend, a caterpillar named Grubby, as they battled monsters and villains in a quest to find magic crystals. These stories were featured in the toy's accompanying story tapes and a 65-episode TV cartoon series.\n\nThe latest version of the toy comes equipped with a 4GB hard drive, capable of storing 40 stories, and can be paired with an iPad app, allowing children to read along as the toy narrates the stories. The toy's plushy hand features a button for navigating between stories, while a button in its foot enables a sing-along mode. For those seeking a blast of 80s nostalgia, the original Teddy Ruxpin commercial is available to view.",

The department store's underlying profits fell 46% to £5m, excluding interest payments, tax, and one-off items. The decline in profits was attributed to increased online delivery costs and a decrease in sales of House of Fraser's own brands. Total sales remained steady at £573.5m, but established department stores experienced a 2.5% slump. Meanwhile, underlying sales showed a 0.9% increase, driven by a 17.8% rise in online sales. House of Fraser's CEO described the trading environment as \"extremely volatile\" and attributed the profit slump to a combination of factors, including record temperatures and Brexit uncertainty. Shoppers are now more likely to buy products to wear immediately, rather than waiting for sales, and consumer confidence concerns about the impact of Brexit on household finances are also a contributing factor. To combat these challenges, House of Fraser is introducing new brands and concessions. Despite struggling, House of Fraser's performance stood in stark contrast to the impressive results of online retailer Boohoo.com, which reported a 40% surge in sales and a 129% increase in pre-tax profits. Boohoo.com's success can be attributed to its ability to attract 28% more customers and increase the average transaction value as it expanded its presence in Europe and the US, while also broadening its product offerings.",

Summer bookings excluding Turkey increased by 4%, but a 40% decline in trips to Turkey resulted in a total booking decrease. Continental Europe was heavily impacted, particularly among German tourists who shunned Turkey, while UK bookings rose by 1%. Thomas Cook has been severely affected by terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Egypt, and Turkey since summer 2015. Bookings from Belgium also decreased following the terrorist attacks on Brussels in March. The company warned in July that it had slumped to a quarterly loss and would miss its annual profit target. Thomas Cook's CEO, Peter Fankhauser, stated that the travel industry is experiencing the most turbulent period he has seen in his 30-year career. Despite the challenges, Thomas Cook's shares rose 4% to 73p. Group bookings were in line with expectations, with customers shifting their focus from Turkey to destinations such as the Balearic and Canary islands, the US, Bulgaria, and Cuba. Fankhauser noted that the summer season has progressed largely as expected, with customer demand remaining strong except for Turkey, where demand remains volatile. He also mentioned that sales for the winter season are in line with last year's figures, while summer 2017 bookings suggest that customers are booking early to secure their preferred destinations and hotels. Demand for holidays among UK consumers appears to be unaffected by the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote on June 23. The winter season has also started well in the UK, with bookings up 8%.",

What is the next number in the sequence: 23, 9, 20, 14, 14, 9, 20, 6,...?\n\n2. The series appears to be a code, where each term is the first letter of a monarch's name. For example, Mary I corresponds to the first letter \"M\", George III corresponds to the third letter \"G\", and so on. Why might Henry I be a fitting conclusion to this series?\n\n3. What comes next in the sequence: 2.1, 3.5, 3.3, 2.3, 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 1.8,...?\n\n4. What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 2, 9, 12, 70, 89, 97, 102,...?\n\nThe solutions to these puzzles are:\n\n1. The answer is 19, as the numbers correspond to the alphabet positions of the first letters of the words in the question.\n\n2. The code is indeed a clever one, as it spells out the word \"monarch\" when each term is taken to represent the first letter of a monarch's name.\n\n3. The sequence appears to be related to the layout of a QWERTY keyboard, where each term corresponds to the row and column position of a letter in alphabetical order.\n\n4. The answer is 112, as each number in the sequence is one less than the corresponding number when viewed upside down.\n\nBill, the creator of these puzzles, shares an interesting anecdote about how he came up with the fourth puzzle. He was approached by a Cambridge mathematician who was about to compete in a puzzle-solving competition against Oxford. The mathematician asked Bill to come up with an original puzzle for the informal portion of the contest, and Bill's creation was the result. Although no one was able to solve it, everyone agrees that the puzzle is fair and logical.\n\nI'd like to express my gratitude to Bill once again for allowing me to use these puzzles.

Simpson, who has spent five decades at the BBC, including his current role as world affairs editor, told The Guardian that the BBC and the National Health Service should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups. He believes that both sides of the House of Commons frequently attack the BBC because it refuses to conform to their party lines. Simpson's strongest criticism was reserved for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, whom he accused of being involved in the Hutton affair and colluding with Rupert Murdoch. \"It's astonishing to see the British prime minister cozying up to someone who has no interest in Britain, is deeply opposed to Britain, and is hostile to the country's main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. He believes that most governments he has worked with over his 50-year career at the BBC have a \"disgraceful political obsession\" to cut down the BBC. \"I'm not saying that cuts can't be made, but it's the brutality and ideological fervor with which they're implemented that's disturbing,\" he said. Simpson also criticized the government's decision to keep the BBC underfunded since 2010, saying it's \"absolutely disgraceful.\" He expressed his disapproval of the draft BBC charter, which requires the corporation to reveal the salaries of staff earning over £150,000, saying it's just a way for the government to demonstrate its control. Simpson made these comments just three days after being released from the hospital, where he had been treated for kidney failure caused by a reaction to eating kedgeree. \"It's acceptable for individuals like myself, who receive favorable treatment. However, as you progress down the hierarchy, it becomes significantly more challenging. People are anxious about their job security... there's a harsh environment, particularly towards junior staff members.\" After a brief holiday to recharge, I'll begin filming the Panorama special. I plan to travel to Iraq, Russia, China, and possibly the US, and I'm eager to visit a particularly troubled region like the Congo. Initially, there was a plan for a short series, but BBC commissioners rejected it. \"They told me that we don't want current affairs journalists covering current events,\" I was informed. \"I believe what they meant was that nowadays they prefer to feature celebrities like Joanna Lumley.\" My latest book, We Chose to Speak of War and Strife, is a tribute to the foreign correspondents of yesteryear, who I believe are a dying breed.

He has been deliberating on whether to stick to his original plan or stay until 2021.

The British Infrastructure Group (BIG) has declared that the time for excuses from mobile network providers is over, citing the unacceptable state of mobile connectivity in some areas of Britain. In a report, the MPs argued that it is unacceptable that some parts of the country still have poor mobile coverage, while visitors from abroad can expect better reception due to their networks' national roaming capabilities. The group proposed an amendment to the government's digital economy bill, which would allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that fail to meet targets set in a 2014 agreement. Under that agreement, the four major network operators (MNOs) pledged to invest £5 billion in improving coverage across the UK by December 2017 in exchange for the government not introducing national roaming. However, the BIG report found little evidence to suggest that the mobile sector will meet its targets to provide coverage to 90% of the UK's geographic area, and is calling for a progress update by the end of 2016. According to Shapps, \"If you have a foreign SIM card and use it in the UK, you'll get better coverage than if you were using one of the UK's companies. It's astonishing.\" The MPs also urged customers to be able to terminate their mobile agreements without penalty if their operator fails to provide a satisfactory level of coverage in their area. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport stated that it understands the inconvenience of poor mobile coverage, which is why it has made it mandatory for each mobile network operator to provide coverage to at least 90% of the UK by the end of next year. Mobile phone operators claim they are working diligently to enhance coverage, with an EE spokesperson saying that while the report acknowledges the importance of increased mobile coverage for a digital Britain, it neglects the significant advancements in mobile coverage since 2014.",

Google's ad revenue jumped 18.1% to $19.82 billion, accounting for 89.1% of its total revenue, with paid clicks increasing 33%. However, the average cost-per-click fell 11%, down from a 7% drop in the previous quarter. Analysts had predicted a 7.9% decline. The decline in cost-per-click is attributed to the shift from desktop to mobile devices, where ad space is limited and cheaper. Google is expected to capture 56.9% of the global search ad revenue market in 2016, with $52.88 billion in revenue. Google's \"Other Revenue\" segment, which includes its cloud business, saw a 38.8% increase, while Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" generated revenue of $197 million but reported an operating loss of $865 million.

The project received a significant boost with a US$300 million deal between Sirius Minerals and Hancock Prospecting.

The panel cited a 2015 study by the National Union of Students, which found that UK university rent increased by 18% over two years, reaching an average of £146 per week. The industry growth of private providers was attributed to the rise.

The awards will continue to prioritize the student experience.\n\nJenny Killin, welfare officer at the University of Aberdeen students' association, expressed her concerns about the \"real student experience\" being a choice between paying bills or buying food. She emphasized that students are accumulating huge levels of debt, primarily to benefit private businesses. Killin tweeted an open letter to Property Week, highlighting that students' maintenance loans barely cover the cheapest rooms at some institutions. The letter emphasized that students cannot celebrate or award a \"for-profit sector\" that is failing many of their peers.\n\nThis development follows a series of university rent strikes and demonstrations coordinated by student activists over the past year. A recent blog post in the Guardian features an anonymous student activist who argues that rent strikes are more than just a complaint about rising student housing costs. Rather than being seen as entitled students complaining about paying rent, the activist contends that the real issue is that high rents are preventing poorer students from accessing higher education.

        "Text": "Nils Pratley's article (\"PM needs to stand firm on executive pay ratios\", 29 November) reveals that directors are attempting to water down Theresa May's initial proposal to shed light on employee pay ratios. May has consistently supported her government's austerity policies, which have had disastrous consequences for the most vulnerable members of our society since 2010. Now is the time for her to honour her commitment. What's the risk in requiring companies to publish the details of every employee's contract, including terms of employment, pension contributions, share options, severance terms, and other benefits? Not all executives are self-serving, but many are. The boards of our leading banks and financial institutions, often collaborating with unsavoury characters, created the problems we're facing today. It's time for business leaders to take responsibility and demonstrate that they treat their employees fairly. How many can honestly say that they do?\n\nGreg Clark's statement on BBC Radio 4's Today programme (\"We are not going to make it happen\") is disconcerting. He claimed the government doesn't want to \"overturn what has been a successful system\" that has the confidence of businesses worldwide. But what constitutes success? It certainly hasn't been beneficial for workers, whom the government is supposed to represent. Democracy shouldn't be limited to votes from self-serving entities. We should also consider the success of worker representation in Germany and other European countries.\n\nTo join the debate, email guardian.letters@theguardian.com.

Murdoch invested $100 million in Theranos between 2014 and 2015, when the company's valuation was soaring due to its promise to revolutionize blood testing with low-cost finger pricks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Murdoch was part of a group of wealthy investors who pumped $632 million into Theranos's latest funding round, valuing the company at nearly $9 billion. Before investing, Murdoch toured Theranos's laboratories in Palo Alto and inspected its proprietary devices. However, the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp, published a series of investigative stories questioning the accuracy of Theranos's testing and management techniques. The WSJ investigation led to a government investigation that found the company's practices put patients' lives at risk. As a result, Theranos's CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, was banned from the blood testing business for two years, and the company was forced to shut down its labs. The company is now facing both criminal and civil investigations by the US attorney's office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some investors have launched a lawsuit against the company, claiming they were misled, and hope to attract others to join the suit. Other high-profile Theranos investors include billionaire Riley Bechtel and Cox Enterprises. The company also secured big names for its board, including Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, both former secretaries of state. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal uncovered a shocking revelation: Tyler Shultz, the 26-year-old grandson of former Secretary of State George Shultz, was the whistleblower who came forward with concerns about Theranos. Shultz, who joined the company in 2013, left Theranos in 2014 after his warnings were dismissed. Neither News Corp nor Theranos chose to comment on the matter.",

The petition, led by Usdaw's general secretary John Hannett, will be delivered to Arcadia on Wednesday. Green had previously promised to address the pension scheme's issues during a parliamentary hearing in June, but has since failed to reach an agreement with the Pensions Regulator. Hannett emphasized that Green needs to contribute more than £250m to the scheme, calling any less \"derisory\". He urged Green to \"do the right thing\" and fulfill his promise, stating that anything less would be unacceptable for former staff who spent their careers at BHS. The petition includes comments from BHS workers, such as \"This man's greed is unbelievable and I worked for him.\" The collapse of BHS in April led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a £571m pension deficit.

His parents' stories shaped his early life: his father began working in the mines at 12, while his mother, an avid reader, received a pre-school education from the library on the estate where she worked as a housekeeper. The family moved to Coventry in 1940 due to unemployment in Durham, where they faced wartime challenges.

As part of the agreement, Sumitomo will acquire the trademark rights to the Dunlop brand overseas and its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Mike Ashley acquired Dunlop Slazenger in 2004 for an estimated £40 million. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is synonymous with sports such as tennis, squash, badminton, and golf. Sports Direct stated it no longer has the resources to manage international brands and needs to focus on its core UK businesses. The Dunlop business generated a pre-tax profit of £4 million on sales of £41.8 million. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has a tyre business and a sports division that produces tennis and golf equipment. The company already owns the rights to the Dunlop brand in other markets. Sports Direct has faced challenges, including criticism of its working practices and weak trading. The company reported profits had more than halved to £71.6 million in the six months to October 23. The company's chairman attributed the decline to an \"extreme political, union and media campaign\" against the company. An undercover investigation revealed Sports Direct workers were being paid below the minimum wage. The company has been compelled to pay £1 million in back wages to employees and provide staff with guaranteed working hours. As a result, Sports Direct's stock price has plummeted by more than half over the past year. The retailer's profit margins have also been significantly impacted by the pound's sharp depreciation following the Brexit vote.

As president of Germany's Bundesbank, Weidmann believes the Italian government should carefully weigh whether to rescue the bank if it's financially troubled. Weidmann emphasized that the bank must be financially healthy at its core for the measures planned by the Italian government to be effective. He stressed that funds cannot be used to cover expected losses and all aspects must be thoroughly examined. Weidmann made these comments in an article published in German newspaper Bild. The ECB has taken a tough stance with Monte dei Paschi, refusing to grant the bank extra time to find private investors. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan after the bank failed to secure €5 billion in private investment. The plan involves dipping into a €20 billion fund to prop up the bank. Monte dei Paschi's poor performance in the ECB's \"stress tests\" prompted the government to take action. The stress tests revealed that Monte dei Paschi was in a weak financial position. The bank was instructed to improve its finances by the end of the year or face being wound down. Weidmann stressed that the rules are intended to protect taxpayers and place responsibility on investors. He believes state funds should only be used as a last resort, which is why the bar is set high. Monte dei Paschi's troubles began to mount after the 2008 banking crisis, when it made a costly acquisition. The deal ultimately contributed to the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Monte dei Paschi's financial woes escalated three years ago, when it sought a €4 billion bailout amid a scandal over derivatives contracts and allegations of fraud. The bank has since returned to the government for funding after talks with private investors fell through.",

Frustrated customers of the west London-based car hire booking firm have taken to social media to report the issue. Tom Richards tweeted, \"I'm cancelling my rental car, keeping my money, and being given no other option just two days before I fly home for Christmas.

The website was still operational, but it appears to have stopped taking new bookings. Many customers may have used the booking agent website through TravelSupermarket, a popular travel comparison site. The company also partnered with several other major online travel businesses. The Christmas period is typically one of the busiest for car hire operators, and many customers may be unable to pay for their car hire a second time. TravelSupermarket removed Atlaschoice from its listings three weeks ago, citing missed payments and lack of response. If you booked a car through Atlaschoice, you're advised to contact the car supplier to confirm whether your booking has been paid for and will be honored. You should also reach out to your bank card provider. For credit card users, Section 75 rights will protect them, as the card provider is jointly liable for the booking cost if it exceeds £100. Debit card users may face more difficulty in getting a refund, but they may be eligible for a chargeback scheme. Unfortunately, Atlaschoice did not respond to the Guardian's requests for comment.",

The company, which owns Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, unexpectedly announced it would not put its new pay policy to a vote at its annual meeting. The policy would have increased Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m per year by expanding bonus opportunities.

Mark Carney cautioned that these untested lenders could trigger the next financial crisis if they fail to repay their loans, leaving customers with substantial losses. He also highlighted the risk of cyber-attacks stripping customers of their digital money, leaving them without traditional regulatory protection.\n\nCarney's warning comes after a similar warning from Adair Turner, who cautioned that losses on internet-based loans could make even the worst bankers appear like lending geniuses. Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney noted that digital money could potentially allow millions of people excluded from mainstream banking to access loans securely. However, he emphasized the need for authorities to focus on financial regulations, lending rules, and operational and cyber risks to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nIn the UK, fintech lenders have become increasingly popular, accounting for around 14% of new lending to small and medium-sized businesses last year. These lenders typically offer loans with funds provided directly by investors, similar to securitized loans used by banks before the 2008 financial crisis. Carney cautioned that the rapid growth of online lending could lead to emerging vulnerabilities that regulators would need to address.\n\nThe UK is expected to become a global leader in online lending, putting pressure on the Bank to adopt regulations that protect customers without stifling the industry. The growth of online lending has been hindered by the volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin, which has limited its adoption due to concerns about its value and security.

Under the new rules, news organizations will need to provide justification or demonstrate editorial value before posting such stories to the service. Snap is planning to introduce a new tool in February that will enable publishers to age-gate their content, presenting different stories to users under and over the age of 18.

Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on affordable arbitration was a major hurdle, as editors argued it would be a final blow to a struggling industry. This created a litmus test for MPs and ministers, who were uncertain how to proceed. As a result, the culture, media, and sport committee has given Ipso, a non-Leveson-compliant regulator, a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. If Ipso fails, recognition will pass to its rival, Impress. The choice between the two schemes is clear: Impress charges £75 upfront for a three- to six-month process, while Ipso offers super-silky barristers for a downpayment of £300, with potentially much more to follow. A key difference is that Impress caps arbitrators' fees at £3,500, regardless of the outcome, and does not charge legal costs if the plaintiff wins. This has raised concerns among local newspapers, who fear financial losses. Ipso, on the other hand, has more flexible costings and obligations, but its fees are higher and less transparent. The question is, can we get hard data to help make a decision? The answer depends on whether the demand for arbitration is as high as its proponents claim. So far, no one has taken advantage of the arbitration option, despite its availability. It may be that ordinary complaints regulation is sufficient, or that no-win-no-fee solicitors have cornered the market. But can't we gather more information before making a decision? Can arbitration develop a single, comprehensive approach that applies universally?",

While I do not have firsthand knowledge, I am aware that the local Rotary Club branch is active, although I am uncertain about trendy coffee shops or nightclubs. Notably, there is a Starbucks in Walton-le-Dale. Are there any unsavory characters lurking in abandoned buildings? I do not believe so, as the council website does not mention such occurrences. However, there are plans for an Ikea, which may be an attractive feature for some young people. So, why would they choose to reside here? Well, it is relatively affordable, with an average house price of £157,000, which is £138,000 cheaper than the national average. Additionally, it appears to offer a range of benefits, including employment opportunities, green spaces, and a surprisingly high proportion of residents in their 20s and 30s.

If you are seeking a location closer to London, however, you may be out of luck – the south-east did not make the top 50, and property prices in the capital are four times higher than in South Ribble. Consequently, it is no surprise that South Ribble is the top choice. Just do not ask me when to put out the bins – that is a local secret! The recycling bins are labeled specifically: blue for glass, cans, and plastic bottles; green for paper and card; brown for garden and food waste; and grey for non-recyclable materials.

The courses covered economic and social history, and students presented papers on collective bargaining and global politics. I first met Peter in 1966 at Sheffield University's Department of Extramural Studies, where he had recently joined six months prior. Peter was committed to fostering students' independent thought and understanding, recognizing adult education in the social sciences as a collaborative process rather than mere instruction. Throughout his life, Peter touched and enriched the lives of many, leaving a lasting legacy through his work with the union-backed Society of Industrial Tutors. Born to Austen Smith and Isabel Reed, Peter was the son of a junior school headteacher in Sunderland. After leaving school, he studied economics at Manchester University and began teaching liberal studies at Stockport College of Technology in 1962. That same year, he met his future wife, Helen Naughton, while working for the Labour party in a north Manchester constituency. In 1965, Peter joined the extramural program at Sheffield University, and he and Helen married the following year. He played a key role in the Sheffield Vietnam campaign and led a large contingent to the famous anti-war protest outside the US embassy in London's Grosvenor Square in 1968. In 1969, he became principal lecturer and head of liberal studies at Teesside Polytechnic, where he served on the governing body and helped the institution achieve university status in 1992. Peter and Helen settled in Stockton-on-Tees in 1970 and lived there for over 40 years. He joined the Open University in that year, teaching social sciences and politics part-time for 45 years until his retirement in 2015. Even in retirement, Peter remained a dedicated advocate for justice and peace. A skilled athlete, he continued to excel at squash well into his 70s.

Additionally, since we currently have a joint will, which is not recognized under UK law, we will need to create individual wills that \"mirror\" each other, with identical provisions.

Currently, as joint tenants, when one of us passes away, the surviving spouse will automatically inherit the property and have the right to live in it until their own death, without the need for a will to specify this.

The boot space is ample for my needs, but I wouldn't dare try to transport anything larger than a shopping bag. The front seats offer generous leg room, while the rear seats are a bit cramped. The Fiat Tipo's design is so retro that it's reminiscent of the 80s, when it was common for not all family members to be equally comfortable. The turbo diesel engine is a different story.

In England and Wales, personal insolvencies totalled 24,531 between January and March, a 6.7% increase from the previous quarter and a 15.7% jump from the same period a year earlier. This marks the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014. The rise in insolvencies coincides with a challenging period for UK households, as rising inflation and stagnant pay growth continue to squeeze incomes. The annual inflation rate has reached 2.3% and is expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the effects of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote begin to manifest in higher prices. Meanwhile, regular pay growth has slowed to 1.9% compared to a year earlier. Joanna Elson, CEO of the Money Advice Trust, expressed concern over the insolvency figures, stating that growing household debt and increased pressure on budgets from inflation are cause for worry. Individual voluntary arrangements accounted for 59% of personal insolvencies, debt relief orders made up 25%, and bankruptcies accounted for 16%. Adrian Hyde, president of R3, noted that while borrowing rates remain at record lows, rising inflation and slowing real wage growth will restrict people's financial flexibility. Despite a few years of stability, personal insolvency rates are still relatively low, and the recent uptick in bankruptcies has been modest. However, the steady increase in personal insolvencies may signal that the post-recession surge in consumer borrowing and spending is beginning to plateau. The official statistics only tell part of the story, as hundreds of thousands of individuals on debt management plans are not included in the numbers.

Krafcik emphasized the importance of the trial, stating that the early riders will play a crucial role in shaping the development of self-driving technology, which has the potential to transform various areas, including personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics, and more, making our lives and cities safer, more convenient, and more accessible. The trial is currently more like a subsidized taxi service than a fully open self-driving car release, with a test driver in each vehicle to monitor the rides at all times. Households that apply don't need driving licenses or the physical ability to take control of the car. Waymo's corporate history is varied, having originated as a Google subsidiary called X Labs, which was spun off and rebranded as Waymo in 2016. This spin-off marked a new direction for the company, which had previously focused on building a fully autonomous car. Now, Waymo is taking a more collaborative approach, partnering with existing manufacturers like Chrysler to add self-driving features to production vehicles.",

However, this notion is not supported by substantial evidence. Would you rather be regarded as creative geniuses, like Paul McCartney and Michelangelo, who are also left-handed? Research on handedness has uncovered a range of fascinating facts. For instance, men are more likely to be left-handed. Studies have also suggested that left-handed college graduates earn more, and that low birth weight, mental illness, autism, cerebral palsy, heart disease, and certain types of cancer are associated with left-handedness. On the other hand, the notion that left-handed people die younger is a myth. Left-handed individuals have an advantage in sports, as their opponents receive less practice against them. Additionally, they might be worse drivers, according to a survey conducted by a car insurance company. While this survey may be flawed, it's still worth discussing. The survey found that 28% of left-handed drivers had received a speeding ticket, compared to 19% of right-handed drivers. For parking tickets, the figures were 26% for lefties and 23% for righties. Over a 60-year driving lifetime, left-handed drivers caused an average of nine accidents, compared to eight for right-handed drivers. Interestingly, left-handed drivers were slightly less likely to have damaged their own car (35% vs 38%) and slightly more likely to have passed their driving test on the first attempt (53% vs 49%). It's essential to note that this phenomenon may not be related to the skill level of left-handed individuals. It's possible that cars and roads were simply designed with right-handed people in mind. I've often thought that's the reason I receive so many parking tickets. Some might agree. If you're sympathetic to the cause, you could chant 'Rights for lefties!' and avoid making snide comments like 'Next, they'll be demanding equal marriage rights…'",

The bonus, part of a five-year incentive plan, will be shared among the company's three co-founders and its finance chief. The four directors will receive £40m each in shares, while the remaining 32% will be distributed among 20 senior managers. The executives can sell shares to cover their £70m income tax bill but must retain at least half of the remaining shares for at least two years. The directors have a history of retaining their shares, having only sold them to cover tax bills in the past. The bonus plan is designed to align the interests of the directors with those of shareholders, with £3.5bn returned to investors over the five-year period. Melrose Industries has a track record of buying and turning around struggling manufacturing businesses, and its share price has soared from 42.97p five years ago to 236p on Wednesday. The company was founded and floated on the stock market in 2003 by Miller, Roper, and Peckham, who invested about £3m in the business. With its share price expected to rise further, Melrose Industries is likely to rejoin the FTSE 250 index soon. Despite declaring a statutory loss of £69.3m last year, the company made an underlying pretax profit of £96m, with revenues of £889m. The bonus payouts are among the largest in City history, but pale in comparison to the £70m compensation package awarded to WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell in 2015. A new three-year incentive plan, set to begin on Thursday, was approved by 83% of shareholders at the company's annual meeting earlier this month. This plan includes several \"shareholder-friendly\" provisions, such as malus clauses, which allow share payouts to be clawed back in certain circumstances. The size of the payout will depend on how much executives improve acquired businesses and successfully sell them. Last summer, Melrose acquired Nortek, a US company that manufactures kitchen stove hoods and extractor fans, for £2.2bn.",

The airline's response has been widely panned, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded and experts accusing BA of failing to meet their needs. The value of British Airways' parent company, IAG, has taken a significant hit, with £500 million wiped off its value. Crisis-response expert Paul Charles is baffled by BA's slow response, saying, \"You need to respond within an hour with a clear statement on what's happening.\" BA's CEO took seven hours to release a video message on Twitter, a delay Charles calls unacceptable. Charles believes BA's strong brand can recover from this crisis, but notes that it's being eroded by the airline's poor response. He warns that a lack of crisis planning can lead to a decline in an airline's brand. United Airlines faced a similar crisis when it initially blamed a passenger who was dragged off an overbooked plane, but later apologized and improved its response. The airline's stock price recovered as a result. Malaysia Airlines was nationalized after the loss of two planes in 2014, highlighting the severity of the consequences of a crisis in the airline industry. According to Charles, airlines and airports have a unique ability to fascinate the public and media, which can amplify even minor crises. Effective crisis management plans typically involve clear command structures and a list of key stakeholders that the CEO personally contacts. Charles has handled his fair share of crises, including a single complaint about the food on a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London. The complaint, which went viral in 2009, was made by an anonymous passenger who sent an email to Richard Branson with photos of his meal and a humorous review. Charles recalls that the company responded quickly and turned the situation around by offering the passenger a role as a food tester for future menus.",

After seven years of tracking the elusive Cape York palm cockatoos in northern Queensland's unspoiled wilderness, scientists finally captured the extraordinary behavior on camera. The footage shows 18 male cockatoos delivering over 130 drum solos, each with its own unique pattern and flair. Most performances took place in front of females, with males adding embellishments like calls, blushing, and raised feathers to win them over. Researchers observed the birds preparing their drumming tools and then banging out sequences of 27 to 92 beats, showcasing their impressive rhythmic skills. The birds' drumming styles varied greatly, ranging from rapid-fire strikes to more laid-back, repetitive beats. According to a study published in Science Advances, the cockatoos' drumming behavior shares key elements with human instrumental music, including the manufacture of sound tools, consistent performance contexts, and individual styles. The researchers liken the birds to solo artists or drummers in rock bands, who have an internal sense of rhythm and generate the motor pattern to create the beat. This behavior is remarkable, as tool manufacture is rare in the animal kingdom and is usually linked to foraging for food.",

As he stood by a tree laden with pods, a favorite snack of parrots, he waited patiently for the birds to arrive. His persistence paid off when a group of half a dozen parrots flew in, their striking red fronts and blue wing tips unlike any species he had previously encountered in the area. The parrots' distinctive calls, unlike any on record, left Gómez Garza in awe. \"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" he exclaimed. \"The different noise belonged to a different parrot.\" Gómez Garza, an ornithologist and veterinarian, was thrilled to have discovered a new species of parrot. The international team of scientists published research on the newly discovered blue-winged Amazon parrot, or Amazona gomezgarzai, in honor of its discoverer. The parrot measures 25cm in height and boasts a loud, short, and repetitive call reminiscent of the soundtrack to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of its calls eerily imitates that of a hawk, a natural predator of parrots. Scientists speculate that this mimicry may serve as a deterrent, scaring other birds away and leaving more seeds, fruit, and flowers for the parrots to feast on. After obtaining permission from the Mexican authorities, Gómez Garza captured a male and female parrot for further study, collaborating with Tony Silva at the University of Florida and Pawel Mackiewicz at the University of Wroclaw. DNA tests revealed that this new species evolved from the white-fronted parrots (Amazona albifrons) native to the region approximately 120,000 years ago. Due to the parrots' rarity, the tests were performed without causing them harm. \"In recent history, I believe this is the first time a scientific description has been completed without the species being threatened with extinction,\" said Gómez Garza. He noted that conservation plans are already underway to protect the species. Mackiewicz estimated that there are likely fewer than 100 blue-winged Amazon parrots remaining, making conservation efforts a top priority. According to Gómez Garza, parrots worldwide are vulnerable to habitat destruction. While the international illegal trade of parrots has decreased in recent years, it still persists locally for certain species. Gómez Garza emphasized that raising awareness will be crucial in saving wild parrots globally.",

        "Text": "A new report reveals that credit card lenders are targeting individuals struggling with unaffordable debt levels, prompting a call for the UK's financial watchdog to intervene. According to Citizens Advice research, nearly one in five people struggling with debt have had their credit card limit increased without their request. The charity is urging the Financial Conduct Authority to ban the practice, which has raised concerns about a surge in lending. Unsecured lending has reached levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, prompting warnings from the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn, threatening financial stability.\n\nCitizens Advice CEO Gillian Guy emphasized that irresponsible lending practices are exacerbating debt problems, such as offering more credit to people who already have thousands of pounds in unpaid debt. She urged lenders to act responsibly and direct struggling borrowers towards free and independent advice and support, rather than offering them more credit.\n\nThe report found that people with long-term outstanding balances are more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users experiencing an increase in their limit over the past year without requesting it, compared to 12% of all credit card holders. Credit card debtors are also more likely to fall into long-term debt and struggle to pay off their debt compared to those with personal loans.\n\nOne pensioner who sought help from Citizens Advice was repeatedly contacted by firms offering more credit cards despite being unable to afford minimum repayments on her existing debts. She used these credit cards to pay essential bills and ended up with 21 credit cards and debts totaling £70,000.\n\nCitizens Advice has helped 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems in the past year. According to the Bank of England, total consumer debt grew by 10% in the year to June, reaching almost £201 billion. The outstanding debt has not reached such levels since December 2008, with £68.5 billion, or over a third of the current total, attributed to credit card debt.\n\nThe rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance, and personal loans prompted the Bank of England to require banks to bolster their financial standing earlier this year. The Financial Conduct Authority is developing new regulations to safeguard consumers from debt spirals, with a focus on curbing the high costs of overdrafts and scrutinizing the booming car loan market. The regulator is planning to compel companies to reach out to customers struggling with persistent debt issues after 18 months, asking if they can accelerate their repayment plans. Those who continue to struggle would then be placed on a repayment plan. The watchdog estimates that 3.3 million people have become trapped in a persistent credit card debt cycle.",

The BBC lost 62% of its staff when it relocated to MediaCity, with redundancy packages worth £48,000 per person, compared to £27,000 for relocation. The Office for National Statistics, which moved from London to Newport, saw a 90% reduction in its London-based staff. Only 620 Channel 4 employees, who are commissioning and support staff, are affected by the move. If 62% of Channel 4 staff do not relocate to Birmingham, the company would face a £20m redundancy bill, £7m in relocation costs, and additional expenses to hire new staff. Defections at the Office for National Statistics would likely increase these costs. Channel 4 would incur a total of £35m in costs, a significant burden for the company struggling with declining advertising revenue. The move is also seen as a political show, with the government seeking to exert control over a state-created asset and ultimately degrading it in the process.",

You don't need to use a claims handling company that will take a 30% cut of any compensation you're awarded. Are you eligible to claim mis-sold PPI? If you took out a consumer loan, store card, credit card, or mortgage between the 1990s and 2000s, you might have been mis-sold PPI. Review your old loan and mortgage statements for any mention of insurance that covers your payments if you become unemployed due to illness, accident, or redundancy. If you've lost your statements, check your credit report, which lists all your loans, mortgages, and debts from the past six years. Many lenders will tell you if you call them and ask if you had PPI. PPI was often mis-sold because the insurance was not made clear to you, or you were not aware you had it, or the adviser did not explain significant exclusions under the policy. If you had to pay for the PPI upfront, the adviser did not make it clear that the insurance cost would be added to the loan and that you'd be paying interest on it. If you answered no to any of these questions, you may have a valid claim. To make a claim, use a free template letter from Which? or Moneysavingexpert, print it out, fill it in, and send it off. If your complaint is upheld, the company that sold you the policy should try to put you back in the position you would have been in if you hadn't taken out PPI. You may also be entitled to statutory compensation, which is usually set at an interest rate of 8% of the refunded amount. If your claim is rejected, carefully review the assumptions made by the bank and revisit your lender if you believe these assumptions are incorrect or that you've been unfairly treated. If you still feel the offered amount is unfair, you can seek assistance from the free Financial Ombudsman Service to dispute your bank's decision. Note that the deadline for submitting your complaint is August 29, 2019. Failure to submit your complaint by this date will result in it not being considered.",

The agreement was reached with BHS's liquidators, FRP Advisory, and will drop legal action filed against Green's company. The liquidators of SHB Realisations, formerly BHS, have reached an agreement with Arcadia Group regarding several matters, including the floating charge dated April 14, 2015. As part of the agreement, over £30 million was released from reserves held in relation to Arcadia's secured claim and will be used to pay BHS unsecured creditors. The floating charge will also be released. The settlement avoids a lengthy legal battle between Green and BHS's liquidators. Green has agreed to pay £363 million to rescue the BHS pension scheme, avoiding another legal battle with the pension regulator. Dominic Chappell, who led the consortium that acquired BHS for £1 in 2015, is to be prosecuted by the pensions watchdog for failing to provide information for an investigation into the sale. Chappell's company, Retail Acquisitions, acquired BHS and later collapsed, resulting in the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of £571 million. The Pensions Regulator is prosecuting Chappell for failing to comply with three notices for information issued under section 72 of the Pensions Act 2004. Failure to provide such information without a reasonable excuse is a criminal offence that can result in a fine.

This strategy was unveiled on Thursday in the Department for Exiting the European Union's final summer policy paper, ahead of talks in Brussels on Monday. The government argues that its leading role in electronic commerce justifies special treatment from the EU in setting future standards. The regulation of online data has become a contentious issue globally, with technology companies and national security agencies facing criticism for compromising personal privacy. Since the Edward Snowden revelations, tensions between the EU and US have been strained. The UK paper proposes exempting Britain from European adequacy tests and instead entering a permanent harmonization agreement to ensure stability. The government believes it would be in both parties' interests to recognize each other's data protection frameworks, allowing free data flows between the EU and UK. The government won't disclose how it would maintain mutual recognition if standards diverge, but hopes to establish a shared policy process. This concession may be fiercely resisted by Brussels negotiators, who view it as limiting their autonomy to set EU rules. The government's approach could be a clue to its approach in other areas, such as financial services, where it seeks a lasting mutual recognition deal. The government declined to comment on how a potential EU deal would address differing standards with the US. However, it noted that current EU-US regulatory harmonization is limited, which could become an advantage if it can negotiate separate deals.",

As a sound engineer at Iraqi TV and radio, Saad played a crucial role in establishing reputable recording studios in Baghdad. He dedicated himself to teaching music at the Institute of Hope, a school for children with sensory impairments, developing innovative methods to reach his students. One of his most cherished projects was the music and ballet school he helped establish in Baghdad in 1968, where he served as a key staff member and played a significant role in directing the institution. Many students still fondly remember him, and his three children and four nieces and nephews are proud graduates of the school. Born in Baghdad, Saad was the fourth of six children to Mahmood Jasim Hikmat and Kadria Raoof Al-Attar, who worked for the Iraqi government. From a young age, Saad demonstrated a natural talent for music and the accordion, which his father encouraged. After completing his high school education, Saad was admitted to the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad in 1952, where he studied music with both Western and Iraqi teachers. He graduated as a skilled pianist, accordion player, and piano tuner, and further honed his craft through travels to Italy, Greece, Poland, and the former USSR. Saad had a deep appreciation for jazz, and his encounter with Duke Ellington in the 1960s was a highlight of his career. The Duke was impressed by Saad's talent, and his compositions, which included songs, school marches, and a ballet, blended elements of Western music. While Saad was not one for public performances, he was always willing to lend his skills to a good cause. In 2003, Saad relocated to Amman, Jordan, where he continued to share his passion for music. He spent his time in Amman teaching music privately and volunteering to teach at the Institute of Light, an organization that supports visually impaired children. He leaves behind his wife, Rasmiya Mohammad Ali, a dedicated social worker, and their three children, Basheer, Omar, and Fatima.",

According to Michio Inamura, Nissei's executive adviser, Pepper could fill the gap when a human priest is unavailable. Funeral organizers can even customize Pepper's appearance by dressing it in a Buddhist monk's robe and live-stream the ceremony for those who cannot attend in person. Buddhist priest Tetsugi Matsuo expressed interest in seeing if Pepper could convey the \"heart\" aspect of religion, which he believes is the foundation of faith.

The growth rate of personal bank deposits has slowed to its lowest annual rate since the financial crisis, with a mere 2.2% increase in August, the weakest month since May 2009. This decline is partly attributed to £1 billion being withdrawn from cash ISA accounts, as tax changes allow individuals to earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free. According to UK Finance, households are saving less each month, rather than borrowing more, as the growth in personal deposits has slowed alongside a slowdown in consumer credit borrowing. Annual growth in credit card borrowing slowed to 5% in August, down from 5.3% the previous month, while personal loan and overdraft usage fell by 1.6% on an annual basis. Overall, the annual growth in consumer credit slowed from 1.9% in July to 1.5% in August. Despite a decline in consumer confidence due to rising prices and Brexit uncertainty, retail sales growth suggests that shoppers have not yet cut back on spending. Retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August, following a revised 0.6% increase in July. There had been concerns that consumers were increasingly relying on credit cards and loans to fund their spending habits. However, the falling rate of bank deposits also indicates that consumers are drawing on their savings. According to the latest ONS figures, the amount of household money available for saving has fallen to an all-time low in the first three months of this year. The amount being set aside as savings has slipped to 1.7% of disposable income, a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. A year ago, this rate was more than three times the current rate. The purchasing power of British consumers is expected to face further strain due to inflation, with the Bank of England predicting that the consumer price index (CPI) will reach a peak above 3% in October. As of August, the CPI inflation rate stood at 2.9%, driven by the increasing cost of importing fuel, clothing, and food. The Bank of England has kept interest rates unchanged this month, but warned that it may raise rates for the first time in a decade as early as November to combat rising inflation.

A report from key UK banks, law firms, and fund managers proposes a \"bespoke\" free trade deal that would allow British and EU-based financial companies to sell products and services without tariffs, taxes, or quotas in each other's markets. The agreement would include a new joint dispute resolution body, comprising judges and independent experts, to resolve any breaches. If the UK loses its \"passporting\" rights, British pensioners and EU consumers could face dire consequences, including potential difficulties in paying out personal pension or insurance contracts. To address these concerns, the International Regulatory Strategy Group has developed a plan for a free trade agreement. The report, launched in Brussels, suggests that setting up the free trade area would be straightforward, given the similarity of EU and UK regulatory regimes. The plan is ambitious but would benefit the entire continent. If London loses its status as the world's leading financial hub, activity would likely shift to New York or Singapore, rather than within the EU, resulting in losses for businesses and families. The proposed agreement mirrors the free trade area agreement between Canada and the EU, which aims to grant financial institutions reciprocal access to each other's markets in the future. The report's starting point is that both the EU and the UK have expressed a desire to secure future arrangements for free trade in financial services. An enhanced free trade agreement is technically and legally feasible and would form a dedicated financial services chapter within a broader EU-UK agreement. The proposal includes a forum of regulators that would collaborate on a joint response to new global standards, as well as involvement in supervision and enforcement, with regular meetings.

Collins has written to Zuckerberg after suspicions arose that Russian \"actors\" used Facebook to interfere in British politics. Facebook, with 32 million users in the UK, has already provided evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election to US Senate committees. The company disclosed that an influence operation believed to be based in Russia spent $100,000 on adverts promoting divisive messages over two years. In a letter to Zuckerberg, Collins stated that the committee is investigating the phenomenon of fake news and its impact on political discourse. He requested details about adverts and pages paid for or set up by Russian-linked accounts, including spending and views. The committee has called for more evidence by November 7th and asked Facebook to take a strong stance on fake news. Facebook updated its software in January to prevent false news from appearing in its \"trending topics\" section. The new algorithm considers not only user sharing but also reputable news organizations publishing about a topic. In April, a pilot program was launched to help users identify fake news, but it only ran for three days. Despite efforts, Facebook's UK fake news combat efforts lag behind those in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. According to Collins, he is not convinced Facebook has sufficient fact-checkers to scrutinize disputed content.",

The former CEO of the Financial Services Authority had initially requested to give evidence in private, and this decision was made public after five media organizations applied to the court to learn more about the \"special arrangements\" in place for his testimony. Mr. Justice Norris made his ruling after hearing the application from the media organizations on the fourth day of the case. The case, brought by approximately 6,000 Lloyds investors, seeks £600 million in compensation, claiming that they were not informed about loans made to HBOS when they voted to approve the takeover in November 2008. The claim is against Lloyds and five of its former directors, including Sir Victor Blank and Eric Daniels, who are contesting the claim. Lloyds announced the HBOS deal in September 2008, just after Lehman Brothers collapsed, marking the beginning of the financial crisis. The UK government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group but has since sold its remaining shares. In his ruling, Mr. Justice Norris emphasized that he is not conducting a public inquiry into the events of 2008. The case is expected to run for 14 weeks, with Sants scheduled to testify in December. The FSA has since been replaced by the Financial Conduct Authority. Blank and Daniels are set to testify in the coming weeks, along with three other former directors named in the case: Tim Tookey, Helen Weir, and Truett Tate.",

The document sets the stage for a shareholder meeting on December 19, demanded by activist investor TCI, which seeks to remove the company's chairman, Donald Brydon, over his handling of Rolet's departure. TCI, which had previously opposed Rolet's departure, dropped its objections after the LSE announced that Rolet would leave immediately, a year earlier than planned. The document urges shareholders to support Brydon, stating that non-executive directors unanimously agreed in October to implement a smooth succession plan for Rolet. It notes that shareholders had been asking about Rolet's future plans, as he had offered to step down if the merger with Deutsche Börse had gone ahead. The document also reveals that aspects of Rolet's operating style were considered by the board when developing the succession plan, but did not provide further details. TCI had initially called for Rolet to remain CEO until 2021, but the document suggests that there was uncertainty about his willingness to stay, which had negatively impacted his relationship with the board. The LSE had been urging TCI to reconsider its call for a shareholder meeting after bringing forward Rolet's departure date and announcing that Brydon would not stand for re-election at the 2019 AGM. The row prompted an intervention by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, whose comments appear to have accelerated Rolet's departure.",

Throughout his life's work, he dedicated himself to establishing pioneering institutions that championed the intelligent and innovative application of science and technology to create a more sustainable and equitable world. His impact extended globally, and his kindness and enthusiasm inspired a vast network of colleagues and friends. Born in Harden, West Yorkshire, to Evelyn (nee Brooke) and Herbert Oldham, Geoff was the son of a NatWest bank manager. He attended Bingley grammar school and studied geology at the University of Reading, later being accepted for further studies at both Cambridge and Toronto universities. Following his wedding to Brenda Raven in September 1951, they embarked on a journey to Canada just 10 days later. Geoff earned his PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto and worked in oil exploration, focusing on South America. However, he soon became disillusioned with the work and began to think about how he could use his skills to make a more meaningful difference. This led to a career change, during which he conducted research on science and technology in China and other Asian countries. As deputy director of SPRU from 1966 and later as its director from 1982 to 1992, Geoff drove policy research on science and technology in developing countries. He challenged the prevailing approach, which relied heavily on transferring technology and science from wealthy countries, and instead advocated for a greater emphasis on building the capacity of developing countries to create their own. Geoff also played a key role in establishing the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC) in 1970, which has been hailed as the \"jewel in the crown of Canadian aid.\" He then led the science and technology policy program at IDRC, fostering policy research across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In recognition of his contributions to science, Geoff was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1990. After leaving his position as director of SPRU, Geoff remained actively engaged in various advisory roles, including high-level positions with the United Nations, the IDRC in Canada, and with ministers of science and technology in China. He also became a dedicated champion for addressing gender disparities in science and technology, collaborating with international initiatives such as GenderInSITE. Throughout his career, Geoff played a significant role in shaping the field of science and technology policy research, leaving a lasting legacy on the organizations that fund, conduct, and utilize it. Geoff is survived by his loving wife Brenda, their children Keith and Janice, and their 10 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

Ofsted has reported a significant decline in inspection outcomes for smaller, fee-paying schools, particularly faith schools. Latest figures show that 49% of private faith schools inspected by Ofsted were judged to be less than good at their most recent inspection, while 26% were deemed inadequate. Ofsted's report on non-association independent schools reveals a four percentage point decline in the proportion of schools judged good or outstanding. The decline is described as \"stark\", with the proportion judged good or outstanding decreasing from 79% in 2014 to 60%. Ofsted attributes the decline to the introduction of new standards three years ago that focus on leadership and fundamental British values. Since the Trojan horse affair in Birmingham in 2014, all schools have been required to teach and reflect British values. The new standards assess requirements related to written policies on the curriculum, the quality of teaching, and the spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development of pupils. A higher proportion of weaker faith schools are failing to meet these requirements compared to schools with no faith. Specifically, 81 out of 139 independent Muslim schools were found to be less than good at their most recent inspection, while 39 were deemed inadequate. Over half of the 58 Jewish schools inspected received a rating of less than good. The decline in ratings was also attributed to Ofsted's takeover of inspections at faith schools. Ofsted is concerned that struggling schools are taking too long to improve and has expressed particular worries about safeguarding, which was found to be ineffective in 17% of inspected schools. In contrast, independent special schools are making notable progress, with 78% of them rated good or outstanding, up from 74% in 2014. Only 9% of these schools were judged inadequate, compared to 19% of other independent schools.",

The majority of this cost is attributed to the \"repatriation tax,\" a measure designed to encourage multinational corporations to bring back the trillions of dollars they hold overseas to avoid tax. Goldman Sachs reported profits of $7.4 billion last year, stating that the enactment of the tax legislation will result in a reduction of around $5 billion in its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017. Two-thirds of this reduction is due to the repatriation tax, while the remaining third is attributed to the implementation of the territorial tax system and the revaluation of US deferred tax assets at lower corporate tax rates. The tax overhaul will lead to a decrease in its earnings, primarily due to the repatriation tax and the implementation of the territorial tax system.\n\nThe recent tax overhaul in the US, approved by Congress last week, includes significant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals. The reduction in corporate tax rates, from 35% to 21%, is intended to encourage multinational corporations to repatriate their cash from overseas. According to Citigroup, US companies are estimated to hold around $2.5 trillion in capital overseas. Companies had previously maintained that they had a responsibility to their shareholders to keep this money abroad rather than bringing it back to the US and paying large tax bills.\n\nThe tax overhaul will allow Apple to repatriate its $252.3 billion foreign cash reserves without incurring a significant tax burden. Apple's large amount of untaxed profits held overseas has become a major political issue and a challenge for the company. Amgen, a drugmaker, has stated that it expects to pay between $6 billion and $6.5 billion to repatriate its cash to the US. Goldman Sachs has also reported that the rest of the $5 billion reduction in its profits will come from the cost of implementing the territorial tax system and changes that will make it more difficult for companies to deduct past losses from future tax bills. Barclays has estimated that the change to \"deferred tax assets\" will cost it around £1 billion. The tax changes were implemented under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who praised the bill as \"great for hardworking workers\".

The Met Office forecasting service predicts that global temperatures will exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels between 2018 and 2022, potentially breaching the 1.5C threshold set by the Paris climate agreement in 2015. Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the Met Office, noted that continued warming from greenhouse gases and natural variability could cause a temporary spike above 1.5C in the next five years. Global temperatures have been steadily rising over the past 20 years, with each of the last three years exceeding the 1C threshold. Last year was the second hottest on record, with no significant boost from the El Niño effect. The 1.5C threshold was set as an ambitious target at the Paris climate conference because scientists believe a world warmer than that would be prone to extreme and unpredictable climate events, leading to consequences such as droughts, habitat loss, food insecurity, and mass migration. Previously, some predictions suggested the threshold would not be breached until the 2040s. However, Met Office scientists emphasize that a single year of temperatures above 1.5C does not necessarily indicate a sustained period of warmer temperatures.

The plan, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), is expected to result in around 1,000 job losses. According to sources, staff will be transferred to surviving restaurants wherever possible. Prezzo is one of several high-street restaurant chains to announce restructuring plans due to challenges such as rising business rates, increased staff costs, and fragile consumer confidence. The crowded casual dining sector is also experiencing stiff competition. Prezzo's directors believe the company is in better shape than either Byron or Jamie's Italian, having made a profit of £5m last year and holding £11m in cash reserves. However, the CVA will still reshape the business, cutting out less profitable restaurants to reflect declining sales. A CVA involves creditors agreeing to forgo some of what they are owed by a business rather than risk it going out of business altogether. When a restaurant chain is facing financial difficulties, a common solution is for landlords to accept reduced rent payments. A Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) requires the agreement of creditors who collectively hold a claim of more than 75% of the company's outstanding debt, with the remaining 25% being bound by the same terms if the CVA is approved.",

UK universities occupy a third of the top three positions globally, primarily in the arts and humanities. In contrast, UK universities have only topped the world's lists for engineering and technology subjects twice, whereas they have consistently ranked among the top three in arts and humanities subjects.

To secure the best rates, savers must lock their money away for a fixed period. Charter Savings Bank is offering a 2.25% interest rate on its five-year fixed-rate ISA, up from 2.11%. Virgin Money is offering 1.66% on its two-year fixed-rate ISA. Some individuals now view cash ISAs as unnecessary, as the first £1,000 in interest earned on savings is tax-free for basic-rate taxpayers and £500 for those on the higher rate. The only strong argument in favor of cash ISAs is that the money will remain tax-free indefinitely. Alternatively, shares-based ISAs offer a wide range of options, including index trackers that aim to match the gains and losses of indices like the FTSE 100, with fund managers like Vanguard, Legal & General, and Fidelity offering low fees, often below 0.1% per year.",

Over four months, emergency dispatchers have received approximately 1,600 accidental calls from the centre, with no one on the other end. According to police dispatcher Jamie Hudson, these calls have been coming from Apple and are taking up valuable seconds away from real emergencies. The refurbishment centre handles Apple devices, including iPhones and Apple Watches, which recently gained 4G connectivity in some models, allowing them to make emergency calls without requiring a phone or internet connection. Dispatchers have reported hearing people in the background discussing Apple devices, maintenance, and repairs, but it's unclear how the calls are being triggered. The calls began shortly after the release of iOS 11 in September, which introduced an \"Emergency SOS\" feature that can automatically call emergency services and contacts through a series of gestures. Apple devices can trigger the emergency call feature in different ways, such as rapidly pressing the power button five times on older iPhones or pressing and holding the power button and volume button on iPhone 8 and X models. On the Apple Watch, pressing and holding the power button is enough to trigger the emergency call. Apple said it is aware of the 911 calls originating from its Elk Grove repair and refurbishment facility and is working with local law enforcement to investigate the cause and prevent future incidents. Ottawa County dispatchers reportedly contacted local news station WNEM to express frustration over the fact that Apple Watch users were making 10 accidental calls per week. Meanwhile, Tolland County issued a warning to smartwatch owners after noticing a surge in unintentional wrist-dials. Additionally, some Apple HomePod users have been left annoyed by the device's tendency to leave unsightly marks on their furniture, with some even joking that they don't want to be told to \"oil my wood\" in response to the issue.",

Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to unveil the results of a consultation on updating the tax system to reflect the nature of digital businesses in next month's spring statement. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride emphasized the need for digital companies to pay \"fair\" levels of tax, suggesting a system where tax is levied based on where companies earn their revenue. Stride noted that digital companies are generating significant value in the UK, but the current tax regime is not taxing these activities fairly. He expressed the government's desire to move towards a fairer system. Treasury sources revealed that the government's first preference is to reform the international tax system through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, but if progress cannot be made at the global level, the UK would implement unilateral changes. Large digital companies have faced criticism for paying very little tax in the UK, often through complex avoidance schemes. Facebook, for example, paid just £5.1m in corporation tax in the UK last year, despite revenues nearly quadrupling to £842.4m. The OECD's efforts to reform its tax policies have been hindered by a disagreement between countries. Some nations, such as the United States, want to impose higher taxes on internet companies, while others, like Luxembourg and Ireland, prioritize attracting foreign investment. Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's director of tax policy, recently expressed frustration, stating, \"Countries are left with a sour taste in their mouths because there's no consensus on taxing the profits of digitalized companies.\" A recent report proposes increasing taxes on companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Apple as a potential means of funding a universal basic income.",

The report shows that emissions from the National Electricity Market decreased in January, reaching their lowest levels since 2004, largely due to the federal large-scale renewable energy target.\n\nEnergy expert Hugh Saddler analyzed the consumption and output of electricity from the Hornsdale Power Reserve, which includes the Tesla battery, and found that it follows a consistent pattern, charging overnight when wind generation is abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices are at their peak.\n\nWhile only 30% of the battery's 100MW capacity is devoted to trading, the rest is used to stabilize the energy system by maintaining the grid frequency at 50 Hz and 240 volts. Despite its relatively small contribution to demand smoothing, the battery still provides a valuable service, demonstrating the important role energy storage can play in the system.\n\nThe battery effectively time-shifts wind generation, exploiting the difference in wholesale energy prices throughout the day, providing critical power at the critical moment. The world's biggest battery, in SA, is working in harmony with wind farms.\n\nPeak wind production is the cheapest way to charge the battery, which stands ready to fill demand gaps if they emerge. The battery charges up overnight, when prices are low, and then hits the grid at the right time to keep price spikes lower than they would be otherwise.\n\nThe Australia Institute's report also found that emissions from the NEM decreased to 152.8 Mt of CO2-equivalent in January, the lowest level since 2004. Despite relatively flat demand, the decrease in coal-fired power generation was driven by the increased output of large-scale renewable energy projects and the decline of Australia's aging coal-fired power station fleet. However, energy expert Hugh Saddler emphasized that with the renewable energy target nearing completion, Australia urgently needs a post-2021 energy policy to reduce its reliance on coal in the National Electricity Market.",

The Office for National Statistics revised its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter down to 0.4%, missing economists' forecasts. The revised figure was attributed to lower-than-expected production and a decrease in consumer spending, which was influenced by price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker performance in the final quarter of the year led to a downward revision in the UK's overall growth rate for 2017, which was revised down from 1.8% to 1.7%, the weakest rate in five years. As the global economy continues to recover, the UK is falling behind other major economies, including Germany, France, and the US. According to Darren Morgan, a small number of revisions to various industries contributed to the downward revision in quarterly growth. Services continued to drive growth at the end of 2017, but consumer-facing industries slowed due to price rises, which squeezed household budgets. The UK economy's reliance on consumer spending for growth has decreased, as households have become more reluctant to spend due to falling real pay and inflation outpacing wage growth. Household spending grew by just 0.3% in the fourth quarter and by 1.8% in 2017 overall, the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012. Businesses also appeared hesitant to invest, with business investment remaining flat in the final quarter of 2017. The downward revision in growth came a day after the ONS released figures showing a surprise increase in unemployment in the three months to December. The disappointing economic data presents a potential challenge for the Bank of England, which had previously hinted that it may raise interest rates as soon as May. However, Samuel Tombs believes that the latest GDP figures indicate the economy is still fragile and does not require another rate hike so soon.",

The changes come after a tumultuous two weeks for the company, still reeling from the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. A unified privacy dashboard, previously discussed by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is now a reality. In a blog post announcing the changes, two Facebook executives acknowledged that the company has more work to do to enforce its policies and educate users about their data choices. They noted that users have been complaining that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that the company must do more to keep people informed.

The 48-second video was recorded in April 2016 but only recently uploaded online. Biologists from the WCS describe the footage as the \"first documented video of a wild elephant exhibiting such behavior,\" leaving scientists and experts puzzled.\n\nAccording to the WCS, the elephant may have been using charcoal, which possesses toxin-binding properties that could have medicinal value for the animals. Charcoal is also a natural laxative and is commonly found in forests after wildfires, lightning strikes, or controlled burns. While elephants have not been observed blowing ash before, animal self-medication is a relatively common phenomenon in the animal kingdom.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that other animals engage in self-medication, such as red colobus monkeys in Zanzibar, which consume charcoal to counteract toxic substances in their food. Bonobos have also been observed swallowing leaves with rough surfaces to remove parasites from their systems. Additionally, red and green macaws eat clay to kill bacteria in their systems, and pregnant elephants in Kenya are believed to eat leaves that may help expedite the delivery process.\n\nIndia is home to more than 27,000 Asian elephants, which comprise about 60% of the global population, according to a 2017 census.

The scam occurred between 2003 and 2008 and involved Lynden Scourfield, a former HBOS employee responsible for overseeing struggling businesses. Scourfield was bribed by David Mills, the owner of a financial consultancy, to load loans onto struggling companies and refer them to Mills's business.

This raises the question of why we schedule important exams during this time, when distractions like sports tournaments and heatwaves are common. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow students to take their exams online when it's most convenient for their learning and comfort? Changing the academic year is a complex issue. Schools, large firms, universities, and even the law courts follow a similar September-to-July schedule. The UK government may find it difficult to argue for changing the system when they themselves benefit from it. The UK's exam marking system relies on students taking tests at the same time, but it has a significant benefit: scores required for a given grade change each year based on average scores. Fortunately, if a sweltering summer temporarily impairs children's cognitive abilities, they shouldn't suffer any lasting consequences. And if this summer proves to be another unremarkable, rainy British summer, they can breathe a sigh of relief.",

The sale could involve around 10% of the bank, generating approximately £3 billion, but would still result in a significant loss for taxpayers. The Treasury's long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return RBS to the private sector, but the current share price may delay this decision. RBS's value has decreased by about 12% since the government last sold off shares in 2015, and the government is prepared to write off a significant portion of the £45.5 billion it spent on the bailout. UK Government Investments declined to comment on the potential sale. According to a Sky News report, bankers and investors are expecting an announcement as early as this week, with one fund manager stating that the City is \"abuzz with speculation\" about an imminent sale. The government's decision to resume its share disposal plan was facilitated by a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. Chancellor Philip Hammond has stated that the agreement will allow the government to proceed with the sale, which has already led to a sharp increase in RBS's shares. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the government will raise £15 billion from the sale of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is set to hold its annual general meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, which will be buoyed by the bank's first annual profit since the crisis and its promise to resume paying dividends. Tensions are running high due to a scathing report exposing widespread mistreatment of small businesses by RBS following the financial crisis. The bank's recent decision to shut down 162 branches and eliminate 800 jobs has further stoked discontent. RBS has declined to comment on the matter.",

A stark example of this is Burnt Yates school in north Yorkshire, a small rural primary school with excellent facilities and a dedicated trust, which will cease operations at the end of the academic year. Despite its rich history dating back to 1760, the school was unable to find an academic partner to take it over, and its efforts to merge with other schools were unsuccessful. The school's demise can be attributed to a series of poor decisions by the local authority, culminating in a poor Ofsted report that sealed its fate. The community rallied around the school, but ultimately, the lack of funding meant that closure was the only option. I blame Michael Gove's academies plan, which has led to the erosion of local accountability and the loss of schools like Burnt Yates, which would still be thriving if it weren't for his policies.\n\nRegarding the civil servant quoted in Michael Rosen's letter, I must correct the record. The department does publish data on sponsored academy primary schools, which have been forced out of local control. The statistics show that these schools, along with free schools, consistently underperform compared to average schools. This is not surprising, given that sponsored academies tend to have a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. What is more concerning is that, despite having more time to improve, the results of these schools do not show any significant improvement. As a former primary school governor in Cornwall, I can attest to the devastating consequences of the academies program. The governors were dismissed, the headteacher was pushed out, and the school was effectively taken over by a neighboring institution. According to the latest SATs results, the ACE academy chain's performance has fallen even further below average. Last year's results at other ACE schools were only marginally better. The lack of effective oversight has enabled ACE to expand its network by taking on more schools and opening a new free school, despite its modest academic achievements.",

Paleontologists found tiny fossilized skin flakes on a crow-sized microraptor, a meat-eating dinosaur with wings on all four limbs. Similar flakes were also found on two other feathered dinosaurs, beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, as well as a primitive bird called confuciusornis. The fossilized skin flakes are the only evidence scientists have of how dinosaurs shed their skin. Unlike modern reptiles, which typically shed their skin in large sheets, the feathered dinosaurs shed their skin in tiny flakes. According to Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork, \"This is the only fossil dandruff known. Until now, we had no evidence for how dinosaurs shed their skin.\" Images taken with an electron microscope show that the fossilized dandruff is extremely well-preserved and almost identical to that found on modern birds. The skin flakes are made up of tough cells called corneocytes that are rich in the protein keratin. The study suggests that dinosaurs with feathers evolved skin to cope with their plumage as far back as the Middle Jurassic period. \"Even in the early stages of feather evolution, they had already adapted their skin to this more modern structure,\" McNamara said. The fossilized remains of the animals were found in rock formations in northeastern China. Beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, which grew to over 2 meters in length, were significantly larger than the 1-meter-long microraptor. Unlike modern birds, the dinosaur dandruff cells lacked fat, suggesting that the animals did not generate as much heat, possibly because they were not capable of flying long distances or at all. Many dinosaurs with feathers were not skilled fliers. \"Rather, their feathers had multiple functions, including keeping them warm, blending in with their surroundings for camouflage, and potentially showcasing their vibrant colors to attract mates with dazzling displays.\"",

Sainsbury's Bank was informed and raised an indemnity against Santander to recover the money, but told me that my credit file wouldn't be corrected until the issue was resolved. Although the Santander account has been closed, the bank loan still appears on my credit report. This situation seems to be a blatant disregard for my right to have inaccurate information corrected.\n\nThe high cost of relying on two large financial institutions to communicate is evident in this case.

The National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report stated that the vehicle's guidance system detected the pedestrian, a 49-year-old woman, six seconds before impact, but the emergency braking system was not activated due to concerns about \"erratic vehicle behavior\". Instead, the system relied on the human backup driver to intervene, but it did not alert the driver to the impending danger. The vehicle was traveling at 43 miles per hour when it struck the pedestrian, who was pushing a bicycle across a boulevard in Tempe, Arizona. The report revealed that the sensors detected the need to brake 1.3 seconds before impact, but the brakes were not applied until after the fatal collision. The backup driver told NTSB investigators that she was monitoring the self-driving interface at the time of the accident. In response to the incident, Uber has suspended testing in Arizona and will focus on more limited testing in Pittsburgh and California. The company is also conducting an internal review of its self-driving vehicle program and has brought in a former NTSB chairman to advise on its safety culture. The NTSB's preliminary report is intended to provide an initial analysis of the incident, rather than assign blame. An expert in liability law suggested that the incident highlights the need for greater regulatory oversight in the testing of self-driving vehicles. \"States must exercise extreme caution when establishing and regulating these programs to avoid a patchwork of 50 different systems.

The retailer described the past year as \"extremely challenging\" and noted a 3.6% decline in sales at its established UK stores for the year ending April 28. Carpetright's trading has been severely impacted in the first eight weeks of the current financial year, particularly due to the withdrawal of products by some suppliers and the hot weather, which has kept customers away.

Prior to 2010, life expectancy in Britain had been steadily increasing, with men born in the 1920s and 1930s enjoying unusually long and healthy lives. This increase in lifespan has had far-reaching impacts on various aspects of life. The trend of increasing longevity has come to a halt, according to a recent analysis by the Office for National Statistics. The reasons behind this sudden halt are unclear, but potential factors include austerity measures, reduced NHS spending, flu outbreaks, rising obesity and diabetes rates, and the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity. The study's findings are concerning, as they indicate that the trend towards improving life expectancy has slowed significantly. The slowdown began in the second quarter of 2009 for men and soon after for women. Between 2011 and 2013, and again between 2014 and 2016, only a small number of local authorities in England showed statistically significant increases in life expectancy. This is a stark contrast to the equivalent period 10 years earlier, when many more local authorities reported significant increases in life expectancy. Other concerning data from the weekly register of deaths in England and Wales this year adds to the worrying trend. The statistics reveal that the number of deaths is significantly higher than the average over the past five years.

If they can afford to buy a property without using the scheme, it would make more sense. According to the Help to Buy Buyers' Guide, if you can already secure a 90% mortgage, you should carefully consider whether a Help-to-Buy equity loan is right for you. There may be better options available.\n\nHelp-to-Buy can be a good option if you're looking to buy a new-build property from a registered house builder and need the 20% equity loan to complete the purchase. However, it's not suitable if you don't want a new-build Help-to-Buy home or don't need government assistance. Unlike the government bonuses paid into Help-to-Buy and Lifetime ISAs, the Help-to-Buy equity loan is not free money. Although there's no interest to pay in the first five years, you'll need to pay a monthly management fee of £1. After five years, interest will start to be charged on the loan.\n\nThe primary concern with an equity loan is that if house values increase, so does the amount you'll need to repay, either when you sell the property or make a voluntary repayment (incurring a £200 administration fee). Furthermore, interest rates on Help-to-Buy mortgages are less competitive than those for standard mortgages. Considering my sons have mixed opinions about the Help-to-Buy scheme and are under 40, I recommend they opt for the free government funding that comes with saving in a Lifetime ISA for property purchase.\"",

The deal covers 470,000 acres of assets, including fields in the Permian Basin in west Texas, the Eagle Ford in south Texas, and Haynesville in east Texas and Louisiana. Analysts have praised the deal, with Eagle Ford being considered the most valuable due to its scale and economics, and the Permian offering the greatest long-term potential. BHP purchased the fields in 2011 but has struggled to make them profitable, leading to their sale last August. BP believes its approach will differ from BHP's, bringing $350 million in synergies from its other US operations and capital efficiencies. According to Bernard Looney, CEO of BP's upstream division, the acquisition gives the company access to some of the best acreage in the best basins, including the Permian Basin, which is considered the most-talked-about oil play in the world. Following the deal's completion, BP's US production is expected to increase from 744,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 885,000 boe/d.

Fever-Tree's rapid growth can be attributed to the soaring popularity of premium gin, which has doubled UK sales to £1.2 billion in the past six years, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. A YouGov poll found that gin is the most beloved spirit in the UK, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favorite. Riding the wave of gin's popularity has transformed Fever-Tree into one of the UK's fastest-growing major companies, making co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow multi-millionaires in the process. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005, naming it after the colloquial term for the cinchona tree, the bark of which produces quinine, a key ingredient in tonic water. Since the company's stock market float in 2014, Rolls has sold shares worth over £150 million, while Warrilow has sold shares worth £41 million. They still own 14% of the company, a stake worth nearly £600 million, and received payouts of over £630,000 on Tuesday after the group increased its dividend by 40%. Fever-Tree's shares jumped by as much as 15% to an all-time high of £39.87, driven by profits rising by a third to £34 million in the first six months of the year, on sales up 45% higher to £104 million. The shares settled back to give the company a stock market value of £4.2 billion, still more than 30 times its value when it floated four years ago. Fever-Tree reported particularly strong performance in the UK over the Christmas period, with an \"impressive rate of sales growth,\" but noted that it still has room to expand. Warrilow noted, \"While this milestone is impressive, we still have a substantial opportunity ahead of us across all our regions as Fever-Tree continues to shape the mixer category's future.\" Additionally, Fever-Tree announced two new distribution agreements: one in the US with Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, a leading wine and spirits distributor, and another with Grupo Damm, a Spanish company that produces Estrella Damm, a well-known beer from Barcelona.",

The trial will take place within the company's depots, where the bus will operate autonomously until necessary laws are changed to permit passenger transportation. The bus is being adapted with technology similar to that used in a recent trial of driverless pods in Greenwich, south-east London. According to Stagecoach, the bus will be able to park, refuel, and navigate to wash points without human intervention. The company believes that wider adoption of self-driving buses could lead to safer and more efficient operations, as well as increased space within its depots.\n\nEven when the bus is on public roads, the sensor system could provide earlier warnings to other road users, such as cyclists or pedestrians, who may be in blind spots or approaching unexpectedly. Sam Greer, Stagecoach's UK bus engineering director, described the project as exciting and potentially transformative, stating that it could improve safety and efficiency within depots and, in the long term, revolutionize bus travel.\n\nThis move by a traditional bus operator using a full-size vehicle could mark a significant step towards the wider adoption of autonomous vehicles in the UK, where smaller pods and shuttle vehicles have been used in public spaces. In contrast, passenger services using small driverless vehicles have been trialed in France, while China has tested larger driverless buses on major city roads in Shenzhen. The trials in Greenwich suggested that passengers may be more receptive to larger autonomous vehicles for public transportation than smaller pods. While driverless trains have been in operation for some time, researchers found that users had concerns about sharing vehicles with strangers, with 85% of participants expressing comfort with autonomous technology but only 46% willing to ride-share. Many respondents indicated that they were not willing to pay a substantial amount above the standard bus fare to use autonomous driverless pods.",

The company's name was derived from their successful completion of the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire a year later. Aston Martin made its international racing debut in the 1922 French Grand Prix, but faced financial struggles and was rescued in 1926 by a group of investors. The company developed a reputation for engineering and design, competing in the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars increased in the 1930s, with a record 140 cars built in 1937. In 1947, English industrialist David Brown acquired the company, expanding operations and relocating production from Kensington to Feltham. The company moved its production base again in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. The iconic Aston Martin DB5 was introduced in 1963, and its famous partnership with James Bond began a year later in the film Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery. Bond has since driven an Aston Martin in several films, including GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Skyfall. The company changed hands several times in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1987, Ford Motor Company acquired a 75% stake. The DB moniker, inspired by David Brown's initials, was revived with the introduction of the DB7 in 1993, the year Ford took full ownership of the company. Aston Martin opened its first purpose-built factory in Gaydon, Warwickshire, in 2003. The company returned to racing in 2005 with the DBR9, a race car based on the DB9 road car. In 2007, Aston Martin was sold to a consortium of two Kuwaiti investment houses for nearly £1 billion. Today, Aston Martin is one of the world's leading sports car manufacturers, thanks in large part to the efforts of its current CEO, Andy Palmer. Palmer has successfully transformed the company by updating its product range and guiding it back to profitability after a period of financial losses. The company is poised to make its stock market debut in London later this year, with an initial public offering that is expected to value the company at £5 billion.",

The investment aims to help the companies catch up with rivals in the autonomous vehicle market. The partnership will leverage technology from both companies to create purpose-built Toyota cars for Uber's ride-sharing network starting in 2021. Toyota's investment values Uber at $72 billion, despite the company's significant losses in 2017. According to Toyota's executive vice-president, the agreement marks a significant milestone in the company's transformation into a mobility company. The deal marks a significant step towards Uber's revival of its self-driving business, which was halted following a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona. Under the new agreement, Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota's Guardian technology, which offers automated safety features. The companies plan to integrate the combined technology into Toyota's Sienna minivans for use on Uber's ride-hailing network starting in 2021. The partnership will put Uber and Toyota in competition with major players in the autonomous vehicle market, including Waymo. Uber's CEO described the deal as the first of its kind for the company. Our goal is to deploy the world's safest self-driving cars on the Uber network, and this agreement is another significant step towards making that a reality.

According to Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, students tend to \"take their foot off the gas\" after accepting unconditional offers, which do not require specific A-level grades. Buchanan believes that students will carry their academic achievements with them throughout their careers and thus should be motivated to work hard. He is calling on universities to only offer unconditional places to students who have been interviewed or whose schools have provided additional information. Historically, only a small number of students received unconditional offers, but the government's removal of the cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities to expand and compete aggressively for students and tuition fees. While there is limited evidence on the impact of unconditional offers on students' final grades, private school heads have long been concerned about the potential impact on their school's results and league table rankings. Some employers place significant weight on A-level grades when recruiting for graduate trainee programs, which means that students who underperform may struggle in the job market. The HMC's call follows that of Education Minister Sam Gyimah, who in July criticized the rise in unconditional offers as \"completely irresponsible to students\" and urged universities to limit their use. Typically, universities make conditional offers, specifying the A-level grades required to secure a place. However, in a more competitive market, unconditional offers have become more common, even among research-intensive institutions in the Russell Group. According to Ucas, 7% of the 950,000 offers made this year were unconditional, with roughly one-fifth of the 250,000 applicants to English universities receiving at least one such offer. Ucas noted that unconditional offers were more prevalent for older students who already held qualifications, as well as for those applying to creative arts courses who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties. University vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers, citing their benefits in allowing for earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation.",

The results, broken down by ethnic group, gender, and free school meal eligibility, reveal that white boys receiving free school meals are the lowest-achieving group, with only 62% meeting the required standard. Although the results show a two percentage point improvement from last year, disadvantaged white boys still lag behind their peers. Overall, 82% of pupils met the expected standard, a one percentage point increase from 2017. Chinese girls not receiving free school meals were the highest-performing group. The phonics screening check involves pupils reading 40 words aloud, with a pass mark of 32. Pupils who do not meet the standard will retake the check at the end of year 2, by which time 92% are expected to meet the required standard. Fewer than half (44%) of pupils with special educational needs reached the pass mark, compared to 89% of pupils with no identified SEN. The Department for Education also published provisional results for key stage 1 teacher assessments, showing a slight drop in the number of six- and seven-year-olds reaching the expected standard in reading and maths. The government reported that 163,000 more six-year-olds are on track to become fluent readers than in 2012. However, the test remains controversial, with 85% of heads believing it should not be compulsory and 65% of teachers wanting it scrapped. A representative of the More Than A Score campaign group stated that the phonics check is a waste of valuable teaching time and instead of fostering a love of reading, children are spending months being drilled on nonsensical words solely to prepare for a test.

Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three companies, has been in detention for 10 days and may be charged with a crime after his detention is extended for another 10 days. The arrest has raised questions about the future of the alliance, which has been led by Ghosn since its inception. While Nissan and Mitsubishi quickly removed Ghosn as chair of their respective boards, Renault chose not to do so and has allowed him to remain as chairman and CEO. The alliance's leadership, excluding Ghosn, met in Amsterdam for an operational review, which was scheduled before the arrest. The meeting focused on operational issues, including research and development, basic components, and technology sharing. A separate meeting of the Renault-Nissan BV board would be required to remove Ghosn from his position.

The penalties stem from failures in systems designed to prevent money-laundering and protect problem gamblers. Casumo must pay a penalty package of £5.85 million, while Videoslots will pay £1 million instead of a financial penalty. Daub Alderney was previously fined £7.1 million. In a separate case, CZ Holdings surrendered its license to operate in the UK after the regulator launched an investigation. Six other firms are still under investigation. Additionally, three individuals had their licenses to serve as directors of gambling companies revoked, four were issued warnings, and three are under investigation. The total payout exceeds the largest fine previously handed out by the Gambling Commission, which was £7.8 million to online casino firm 888. Secretary of State Jeremy Wright warned that online operators ignoring their duty to protect players will face consequences. He emphasized that protecting vulnerable consumers is the top priority and that gambling operators must adhere to robust requirements to safeguard players and prevent money-laundering. The Gambling Commission has become stricter in its enforcement over the past two years, issuing millions of pounds in fines to companies like William Hill, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, and SkyBet for failures related to money-laundering and problem gambling. CEO Neil McArthur urged online casino operators to \"sit up and pay attention\" and take responsibility for properly applying their policies and procedures. He emphasized that operators must have a deep understanding of their customers and ask the necessary questions to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. Anyone in a position of authority should be aware that the commission will take regulatory action against businesses that fail to comply and hold individuals accountable if they are responsible for an operator's shortcomings.",

These businesses refuse to accept paper currency and instead require customers to pay with debit or credit cards. Some business owners argue that cashless transactions are quicker and easier, but City Councilman Ritchie Torres believes this practice disproportionately affects low-income individuals and people of color who may not have access to bank accounts or credit cards. Torres argues that a cashless business model has an exclusionary effect on the impoverished, the homeless, and the underbanked. According to Torres, nearly 12% of New Yorkers do not have bank accounts, and many people struggle to maintain an account due to minimum balance requirements, fees, or lack of proper ID. Unauthorized immigrants, in particular, may face significant barriers to opening a bank account. Torres believes the proposed ban is necessary to prevent a \"gentrification of the marketplace\" and to ensure that all individuals have equal access to goods and services. He sees this as a new frontier of anti-discrimination law, one that addresses the unequal impact of cashless transactions on marginalized communities. However, Andrew Rigie, head of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, argues that there should be a balance between the benefits of cashless transactions and the need to ensure that all customers have access to goods and services. While cashless restaurants may offer operational and worker safety benefits, they should not discriminate against individuals who do not have credit cards.",

US President Donald Trump warned China that he plans to impose higher tariffs on Chinese goods, sending stock markets in London and New York plummeting. Trump's comments made it highly unlikely that he would heed Beijing's call to refrain from increasing tariffs starting next year. The move would raise the existing 10% US import tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from January 1. Economists warn that if the US-China trade war escalates further, the global economy could suffer significantly over the next decade, potentially losing up to 2% of GDP growth by 2030. The ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond their borders, with no real winners in a globalized economy. Trump's comments also suggested that Apple products could be subject to tariffs, sparking a sell-off in Apple shares. Recent developments, including the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, have helped to cool tensions between the White House and other countries. Despite previous optimism, Trump has recently hinted at imposing higher import tariffs on China. Meanwhile, he has dampened expectations of a trade agreement between the UK and the US if Theresa May secures parliamentary backing for her Brexit deal. The US government is also examining car imports on national security grounds, which could potentially lead to higher tariffs on European-made vehicles.",

In November 2016, attackers gained access to Uber's cloud servers using stolen credentials and downloaded 16 large files containing sensitive information. The compromised data included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and location information, as well as drivers' weekly pay, trip summaries, and in some cases, driver's license numbers. The breach was caused by inadequate information security measures and was exacerbated by Uber US's decision not to disclose the attack. The Information Commissioner's Office found that this was not a typical bug bounty scenario, as the hackers maliciously exploited the vulnerability and stole personal data. As a result, none of the affected individuals were notified of the breach, and the company only began monitoring accounts for fraud 12 months later. The potential fine was reduced due to the fact that Uber's European branches were not informed of the breach, and there was no evidence that the compromised data was misused. Uber US was ordered to pay $148 million for failing to notify drivers about the breach. We have implemented numerous technical enhancements to strengthen the security of our systems and made significant changes to our leadership structure to ensure transparency with regulatory bodies and customers. We have appointed a chief privacy officer, data protection officer, and chief trust and security officer.

The timing of the breach meant that we were subject to the Data Protection Act 1998, which capped the financial penalty at £500,000.

The InSight probe is set to touch down gently on Elysium Planitia, where it will analyze seismic activity on the red planet. Despite sending numerous probes to Mars, more than half have failed, with the final stages of landing proving notoriously challenging. The Martian atmosphere's thinness, equivalent to just 1% of Earth's, poses a significant hurdle, as there is little friction to slow down a spacecraft. This has contributed to past failures, leaving NASA engineers on edge as they guide their $800 million InSight craft on a 300 million-mile journey to a 15-mile-by-6-mile target zone. If InSight navigates this precise keyhole, it should land squarely in the middle of Elysium Planitia. However, it will still require a heat-resistant capsule, parachute, and rockets to slow down from 12,000mph to 5mph and ensure a soft and safe landing after a seven-minute descent. The most recent attempt to land on Mars was made two years ago by a European probe, which unfortunately crashed on the planet's surface. Despite this, NASA remains optimistic about the mission's success. The InSight mission aims to help scientists understand the early evolution of Mars and other planets in the solar system, including Earth, by using instruments to probe deep beneath the planet's surface and measure temperatures and seismic activity.",

In a recent experiment, scientists excised heart parts from both river and cave-dwelling Astyanax mexicanus fish, discovering that while river fish successfully regenerated tissue, cave fish developed only scars. The salamander's remarkable ability to regrow a lost tail to its full length involves a complex process of cell migration and gradual regeneration over several weeks. The regenerated tail is fully functional and identical to the original, with the spinal cord and nerves fully restored. The axolotl, a salamander relative, boasts even more impressive regenerative abilities, capable of regrowing not only its tail but also its limbs, skin, and almost any other body part. Researchers have found that each time a limb is removed, it regrows almost perfectly, making the axolotl a valuable subject for studying human limb regeneration. Starfish can regrow arms that detach from their central disc, and some species have even been observed to regrow an entire body from a lost arm. To accomplish this, starfish store nutrients in the detached arm until they can regrow their mouth. The sea cucumber has a remarkable ability to rapidly mend its organs, regrowing damaged parts and healing deep wounds in as little as a week. This remarkable skill is crucial for the sea cucumber, as it often jettisons certain organs as a distraction technique to defend itself against predators like crabs and turtles.",

According to accounts filed at Companies House, Odey received £1.5m from Odey Asset Management in the year ending April 5, a 72% drop from the previous year's £5.5m. The hedge fund reported a 52% decline in profit to £8.8m, mainly due to Odey's bets against the pound and UK retailers not yielding immediate results. Odey Asset Management has taken a £149m short position against UK shops, banks, estate agents, and property companies. Despite this, the fund has performed exceptionally well in recent months, as the pound has continued to fall and the share prices of several British businesses Odey bet against have plummeted. The fund has gained more than 50% so far this year, including a 7% return in October, making it one of the world's top-performing hedge funds. Last month, the fund made millions from a bet against Intu, whose shares dropped 42% after a proposed takeover collapsed. Odey also benefited from a £33m bet against Debenhams, whose shares have declined by 85% over the past year. Odey was a prominent supporter of the Brexit campaign and donated almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit efforts.

Richard Hyland, a Twitter user, sarcastically remarked: \"What a perfect time for Amazon's Alexa to crash - just when people might want to register new devices, play music, or access recipes.\" Alexa functions by sending voice commands from an Amazon Echo device to a server, where a computer interprets them, and then sends the instructions back to the Echo. The device then plays music, reads the weather, and performs tasks such as turning on lights. Around lunchtime, Amazon's customer service account tweeted that some Echo devices in Europe had experienced intermittent connectivity issues over the past two hours, but assured customers that the issues had since been resolved.

Official statistics showed that the economy rebounded from the cold winter earlier in the year, as consumers splurged during the World Cup and a prolonged heatwave. However, more detailed data revealed that consumers, burdened by rising utility bills and transportation costs, had to rely on their savings to maintain their spending habits, as their disposable income remained stagnant. According to Rob Kent-Smith, statistician at the ONS, households have spent more than they earned for an unprecedented eighth consecutive quarter, raising concerns about their ability to sustain their spending and drive the economy. Recent surveys have fueled concerns that consumer spending is losing momentum, with several high street retailers reporting dismal sales in November. The online retailer Asos's surprise profit warning has added to these concerns, as analysts had grown accustomed to web-based operators weathering the spending downturn. Business investment has declined for the third consecutive quarter, a trend not seen since the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. This cumulative effect is expected to reduce GDP growth in the final quarter of 2018 to nearly zero. The Bank of England attributed the decline in business investment to Brexit uncertainty, although the risk of border disruptions has led to increased spending on warehousing and port capacity. Companies are stockpiling goods at their highest level since 2016, suggesting they are under pressure to build large inventories in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit.

This figure surges to a remarkable 40% for mothers of two children. Researchers from Manchester and Essex universities analyzed biological data from 6,025 UK participants to investigate the impact of working hours and family conditions on stress levels. The study, published in Sociology, found that working from home or having flexible hours had no significant effect on women's chronic stress levels. However, reducing working hours had a positive impact on stress levels. Work-family conflict is a significant contributor to increased psychological strain, stress, and decreased wellbeing, particularly for parents of young children. The study's findings are based on 11 biomarkers that measure the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems. Chronic stress, resulting from repeated stressful events and combinations of social and environmental stressors, can have a significant impact on overall health. Women working full-time with two children had biomarkers indicating chronic stress, including hormone levels and blood pressure, that were 40% higher compared to those with no children. Women working full-time with one child had 18% higher levels of stress than those with no children. Flexible work practices aim to help employees achieve a better work-life balance, which should reduce work-family conflict. While reduced-hours flexible work arrangements did help moderate the relationship between family and work stressors, there was limited evidence that flexible work arrangements were associated with lower chronic stress responses. Notably, reduced work hours could lead to lower chronic stress markers for fathers.",

According to the latest report from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly distributive trades survey, retail businesses increased their stock-to-sales ratio in January to its highest level since February 2008. The report reveals that retailers anticipate a decline in demand and have built up inventory in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit at the end of March. As the UK's exit from the EU remains uncertain, a growing number of companies are intensifying their plans for a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit. Luxury carmaker Bentley and retailers such as Dixons Carphone and Pets at Home have announced measures to secure their supplies in the event of disruptions at British ports. We're seeing early signs of companies preparing for a no-deal Brexit, with some wholesalers reporting that they're stockpiling in case the UK exits the EU without a deal. January sales volumes stabilized after a challenging festive trading period, but were still below average for the time of year, marking one of the worst periods since 2011. Sales of clothing, footwear, and leather goods, as well as hardware and DIY items, declined, while grocers and online sales reported increased volumes. The CBI predicts a more optimistic outlook for the coming month, with retailers expecting sales volumes and orders to rise in the year to February. Retailers should be experiencing a surge in sales right now, thanks to the increasing pace of real wage growth and the ongoing growth in employment. However, the heightened uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which is reflected in the sharp decline in consumer confidence surveys towards the end of last year, is prompting consumers to be more cautious in their spending habits.",

According to a report from TV measurement body Barb, Netflix now has 9.7 million UK subscribers, compared to Amazon's Prime Video service, which has around 4.9 million users. The report reveals that Netflix added 2.2 million new subscribers in the year to the end of the third quarter 2018, more than double the 1.1 million subscribers Amazon gained during the same period. Netflix's growth has been driven by a $13 billion budget for producing and licensing TV shows and films. While Netflix remains the most popular streaming service, Amazon has managed to attract a significant number of subscribers with families who have young children. This may be due to Amazon's unique offering, which bundles its video service with its Prime subscription package, which includes perks such as one-day delivery and access to Amazon Music. The report suggests that the presence of young children and the convenience of on-demand content and next-day delivery may be enticing families towards Amazon. The UK's three largest subscription video-on-demand services - Netflix, Amazon, and Sky's Now TV - have added 3.45 million customers over the year, taking their combined total to 16.2 million. This represents a 27% annual increase and is more than the number of subscribers to traditional pay-TV packages from providers such as Sky, BT, Virgin Media, and TalkTalk. Sky's Now TV, in particular, has seen a significant increase, adding almost 200,000 customers to reach a total of 1.6 million subscribers. According to Barb's report, there has been a significant surge in the number of UK households that subscribe to two or more paid streaming services, increasing by 40% year-on-year from 2.8 million to 4 million. In the third quarter, nearly 12 million UK households had access to at least one of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Sky's Now TV, representing a 22% year-on-year growth. The report also highlights a notable increase in the daily viewing time on services like Netflix, which rose by 17% year-on-year to 46 minutes. Interestingly, the 16- to 24-year-old age group spends significantly more time watching content each day, averaging 63 minutes.",

The Resolution Foundation's study found that the retail industry has the highest rate of redundancies, with a sharp increase in shop closures across the country. Major high street retailers have announced job cuts and store closures, exacerbating the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The decline in consumer spending, fueled by inflation following the Brexit vote, and changing shopping habits have contributed to the struggles of traditional stores. The study revealed that 31% of retail workers who lose their jobs end up unemployed, compared to 26% across all industries. Two in five former retail workers are unemployed for at least six months, with younger workers facing greater risks. The report found that three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30, despite this age group making up only a third of the retail workforce. According to Daniel Tomlinson, life has become tougher for those leaving retail, who are more likely to find themselves unemployed – and for longer, too. Policymakers cannot reverse the shift towards online shopping, but they can and should focus on supporting those most affected. The study found that there has been a long-term decline in retail employment in the UK since 2003, with the number of jobs shrinking from 10.8% to 9.5% of the overall workforce. Britain now has a lower proportion of workers in wholesale and retail compared to Germany. Despite multiple rounds of job cuts, the job market has adapted by creating new opportunities in industries such as hospitality and social care. The retail sector remains a low-paying industry, with an average hourly wage of £8.80, approximately a third lower than the average pay across the entire economy.",

The consumer group advises travelers to pack essentials like food, water, and nappies to survive prolonged delays. Alicante airport, serving popular resorts like Benidorm, is expected to be severely affected, with visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote, and Málaga likely to experience significant delays. Which? estimates that an extra 90 seconds processing each UK passport could add five hours to the processing time for a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers. Alicante airport is vulnerable due to its high volume of UK arrivals, processing up to 10 planes from the UK in an hour. In total, 2.9 million British passport holders pass through the airport each year. Portugal has announced plans to introduce special UK lanes at Faro airport and Funchal, but Spain has yet to confirm its position. Travel editor Rory Boland warns that airports can be chaotic even in normal circumstances, and a no-deal Brexit could lead to extremely long queues. Until a deal is reached or airports announce alternative arrangements, travelers should prepare for lengthy queues and pack accordingly. The analysis was based on data from the European Tourism Association. According to the UK government's official advice, British tourists would not be entitled to use designated lanes for EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals in a no-deal scenario. They may be required to present a return or onward ticket and face additional checks to ensure sufficient funds. Despite potential challenges, Aena, Spain's largest airport operator, does not anticipate chaos this summer, citing the high stakes involved. Aena believes that once the initial uncertainty is resolved, UK traffic can continue to thrive in both the short and long term.",

The FTSE 250-listed company has revealed that it is actively discussing the disposal of assets exceeding its £500 million target for 2019, following the sale of £570 million in property last year at an average price 7% below its book value. The company is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Advisors, which owns a 5% stake, to accelerate its disposal plans after a 9.3% decline in property values in 2018. Hammerson's tenants include Patisserie Valerie, House of Fraser, and New Look, which have all been affected by the decline in the retail sector. Hammerson's CEO, David Atkins, acknowledged that 2018 was a challenging year, particularly in the UK, due to tenant failures, structural shifts in retail, and a more cautious consumer.

The tour marks the centennial anniversary of British explorer Howard Carter's sensational discovery of the boy pharaoh's tomb in 1922. \"Come and see them while you can,\" urged Mostafa Waziry, secretary general of the Egyptian ministry of state for antiquities. \"Visit them before they return to Egypt forever.\" The exhibition will showcase a gold-inlaid miniature coffin containing the king's liver, a gilded wooden bed with lion feet, and a gilded wooden shrine depicting intimate scenes of royal domestic harmony. One of two life-sized guardian statues of the king will make its debut outside of Cairo. Unfortunately, Tutankhamun's famous golden death mask will not be part of the show. The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb is considered one of the most significant archaeological finds in history. When some of these treasures left Cairo for a 1972 exhibition at the British Museum, a record 1.6 million people visited, resulting in chaotic queues.

Epic Games has confirmed that it has suspended its ad campaigns on the Google-owned platform, joining Nestlé in temporarily halting its advertising on the site amid the latest controversy surrounding inappropriate content. A YouTube user named Matt Watson recently posted a video exposing a \"wormhole\" that leads to a softcore pedophile ring on the site. The video demonstrated how, with a new YouTube account, users can easily find videos filled with provocative comments about children. Watson stated in the video, \"Pedophiles are trading social media contacts, sharing links to actual child pornography in YouTube comments, and trading unlisted videos in secret. YouTube's algorithm, due to a glitch in its programming, is facilitating their ability to do this.\" The scandal poses a significant challenge for YouTube, as the videos themselves are not necessarily problematic. Most of the videos feature young girls engaging in innocent activities, such as playing, exercising at home, or participating in gymnastics. The issue lies in the comments section, where YouTube users have left sexually suggestive messages and shared tips on how to take compromising still images of the children while pausing the videos. After watching a few such videos on a new YouTube account, Watson described how the site's algorithm would serve up an endless stream of videos featuring apparently underage children with inappropriate comments in the comments section. Many of these videos were also accompanied by ads from major brands like Nestlé, Fortnite, and Disney. The reaction to the story from the broader YouTube community has been mixed, with some prominent YouTubers accusing Watson of overreacting and criticizing him for going public with his claims that pedophiles were using the site's comments section. In response to the latest allegations, a YouTube spokesperson stated, \"We condemn any content that endangers minors as abhorrent and have clear policies prohibiting such content on our platform. We have taken swift action by deleting accounts and channels, reporting illegal activity to the authorities, and disabling comments on tens of millions of videos that feature minors.

However, the statistics published last week are consistent over the 44-year period covered, using an internationally agreed definition of unemployment and unaffected by changes in the benefits system.

The sharp losses on European and Wall Street stock exchanges followed data showing weak economic growth in the European single currency bloc in the first quarter of 2019, dispelling hopes of a rebound from a weak finish to last year. Economists attributed the poor industrial output figures to a slowdown in China and the global economy, raising the prospect that growth for the rest of 2019 would be weaker than expected. The New York stock market slumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped 2% and markets across Europe suffered steep losses. The IHS Markit flash purchasing managers' index for euro area factory output showed that output contracted the most since December 2012, a period marked by the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis. Analysts attributed the decline to disruptions caused by Brexit, but noted that faltering demand for exports amid the US-China trade dispute had a more significant impact. Germany's manufacturing sector recorded its steepest decline in output in seven years, with new factory orders deteriorating to the greatest extent since the financial crisis. Germany's industry woes are linked to China's slowing economy, triggered by US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on Chinese goods in a bitter trade standoff with Beijing. Chinese car sales fell for the first time in almost 30 years last year, a significant blow to several German car manufacturers, which rely heavily on China as their largest export market. Germany narrowly avoided recession last year, and the PMI index, compiled by surveying around 5,000 companies across the euro area, showed that Germany and France were the worst performers. Other parts of the eurozone recorded stronger growth. The survey suggests that the economy is expected to grow by around 0.2% in the first quarter. The bigger picture is that the eurozone economy is still moving at a slow pace, with Germany's manufacturing recession and Italy's broader downturn holding the region back.",

Do you firmly grasp it to demonstrate enthusiasm? Do you take it gently to show respect? Or do you opt for something unique, like a secret handshake? According to Nilesh Dosa, a youth mentor at Ernst & Young, schools are falling short in teaching young people the essential skills they need to succeed in interviews, including proper handshaking techniques. \"We're producing academically talented students who lack the fundamental skills for the workforce,\" he says. Etiquette consultant Jo Bryant agrees, emphasizing that a strong handshake is crucial in making a good impression. \"You can have all the qualifications in the world, but if you enter an interview with poor body language, eye contact, and a weak handshake, you won't get the job,\" she warns. \"Your interviewer needs to like you and want to be around you.\" So, what is the correct way to shake hands? Bryant advises: \"Maintain eye contact, be firm, and ensure your palms are together. Avoid bone-crushing, but also don't be too limp - that's a sign of underconfidence.\" She notes that a handshake that's too limp can feel like an empty gesture, while one that's too firm can be seen as arrogant. And what about sweaty hands? Unfortunately, they're hard to avoid, but Bryant suggests striking a balance between confidence and humility to make a positive impression. \"When interacting with someone, you can discreetly wipe your hands before meeting them, not in their presence. Avoid using dominating body language, such as placing your hand on top of theirs or clasping their forearm. Bryant advises being natural and not trying too hard, as this can come across as wooden. To improve your handshaking skills, she recommends practicing with a friend and seeking feedback. This may seem unusual, but it's similar to how you would practice other social skills. Just as you would with any other skill, you can practice handshaking with a friend and get feedback on whether you're doing it correctly.\"",

The sale, expected to be completed by the end of June, includes the Newcastle Herald, the Land, and Queensland Country Life. The company will retain a commercial relationship with the new owners and will continue to print some of its metropolitan mastheads in regional areas. According to Hugh Marks, CEO of Nine, the sale aligns with the company's strategy to exit non-core businesses and focus on its digital assets. Marks stated that Nine will continue to work with the new owners where there are mutual benefits to both parties.\n\nAntony Catalano, the former boss of Domain, had previously attempted to block the sale of Fairfax to Nine by buying up to 19.9% of Fairfax shares. The deal includes $10 million worth of advertising for Nine in ACM properties over the next three years. The ACM group of newspapers was previously owned by Rural Press and was sold to Fairfax Media in 2007 for $3 billion.\n\nMarks had flagged the potential sale of the community papers soon after the merger with Fairfax last year. Nine is still in the market to sell its remaining former Fairfax properties, Stuff and Events. Marks told staff that Catalano and Thorney Investment Group saw the \"future potential\" of the newspapers, which no longer fit into Nine's national advertising strategy. He said the change in ownership is a positive development and sets the company up for success in the future.\n\nMedia, Entertainment and Arts Alliance media director Katelin McInerney urged Catalano and Thorney to prioritize job security, fair working conditions, and editorial independence. There are approximately 650 editorial staff employed across the country by the ACM group, and McInerney emphasized the importance of respecting the individual audiences for each masthead and providing local news, information, and entertainment to the communities they serve.",

Despite being dismissed by some as a fringe belief, the US Navy is taking the phenomenon seriously, reportedly developing guidelines to encourage pilots to report \"unexplained aerial phenomena\" without fear of ridicule. From now on, we'll refer to these events as \"unexplained aerial phenomena\" rather than \"unidentified flying objects.\"\n\nThe concept of alien abductions gained popularity in the 1990s through TV shows like \"The X-Files,\" leading many to believe in extraterrestrial life. However, it was revealed that the characters Mulder and Scully were fictional, leaving some to wonder how people continue to claim alien abductions. The answer is straightforward: people are mistaken. Or is it?\n\nDr. Young-hae Chi, a lecturer at Oxford University, takes the alien abduction theory seriously, despite not being a psychologist or materials scientist. He teaches Korean at the faculty of oriental studies and has spoken at conferences about the topic. In a 2012 lecture, he disputed the notion that visiting aliens have sinister plans to take over the world, instead proposing that their secret breeding program to create alien-human hybrids is a noble effort to save humanity from environmental disaster.\n\nDr. Chi has written a book expanding on his theories, but critics may question whether he has any concrete evidence to support his claims. While the recent warming of the Earth is well-documented, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of an alien breeding program. Some alleged alien abductees claim to have experienced \"sexually oriented actions with aliens or other human abductees under mind control,\" but I remain skeptical. Apparently, some recall seeing jars containing hybrid toddlers and fetuses on the alleged alien spaceships. I acknowledge that these individuals may have undergone a traumatic experience, but is there any concrete evidence to support the existence of aliens? Unfortunately, the lack of detectable evidence may be due to the fact that aliens allegedly reside in a different dimension. This sounds similar to the concept of ghosts, which are also often associated with unexplained phenomena. While it's true that \"the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence,\" I believe it's also important to consider the quality of the evidence presented.",

The license was considered the most valuable TV license since Channel 5 in 1997. London Live's glamorous launch party in 2014 featured high-profile guests, including David Cameron, George Osborne, Elizabeth Hurley, Hugh Grant, Naomi Campbell, Ralph Fiennes, Tracey Emin, and Anna Friel.

This breakthrough suggests that scents could be used to influence food choices, such as adding a subtle aroma to make food taste sweeter and reduce sugar intake. When driving at night, many people experience motion-induced blindness, where red lights temporarily disappear if they glance at oncoming traffic. This phenomenon occurs when the brain ignores visual information presented against a moving background. A striking connection exists between hearing and vision in speech perception, known as the McGurk effect, where the auditory and visual components of a syllable can create the perception of a third sound. The sight of cutlery significantly impacts how we perceive the flavor of food, with research showing that yoghurt tastes sweeter when eaten with a white spoon compared to a black spoon. There is a surprising crossover between smell and sound in human perception, with experiments revealing that people consistently pair specific smells with certain instruments and pitches. For example, a piano is often associated with a fruity scent, while brass is linked to a musky odor. This phenomenon is thought to be caused by the olfactory tubercle, an area of the brain that responds to both auditory and olfactory stimuli.",

Environmental groups argue that the shortfall in Adani's water permits is evidence that the company's readiness claims are unfounded and intended to exert political pressure on decision-makers. Public records show Adani holds two short-term water permits, which expire in April and June, allowing the company to extract a combined 1775 megalitres of water.

Lock the Gate's Carmel Flint stated the new information suggests Adani lacks necessary water permits, further evidence its claims of being ready to start work are false. Adani claims it has the necessary water permits for mining operations, but did not address the project's construction phase specifically. The company mentioned alternative potential water sources, including groundwater, rainwater, and recycled water. Former Queensland government general manager Tom Crothers stated the amount of water Adani could access without additional permits would be a mere \"puddle\" and far from sufficient to make up for the shortfall.

The company initially sought damages of around $150,000 from each farmer, claiming they broke the law by sourcing and dealing the potatoes. However, when the case went to court in Ahmedabad, India, PepsiCo offered to settle the dispute amicably. The case has sparked outrage among farmers and others, who fear PepsiCo is using its influence to interfere with India's food supply. Several farmers' groups in India have come together to protest the court action. PepsiCo claimed that the farmers who grew its patented potatoes without permission were hurting the interests of many people who work with the company to produce potatoes for its Lay's crisps. The company supplies seeds to these farmers and subsequently buys back the potatoes. In a statement, a PepsiCo spokesperson said, \"PepsiCo is India's largest process-grade potato buyer and one of the first companies to work with thousands of local farmers to grow a specific protected variety of potatoes for our Lay's crisps.\" The company's spokesperson later clarified that they were forced to take legal action as a last resort, and are deeply committed to resolving the issue. The recent controversy has stirred up memories of the drought, with some commentators expressing concerns that PepsiCo may be using the legal system to punish individuals who use the same groundwater used in their products. As one journalist, Ravi Nair, pointed out on Twitter, \"Let's hope PepsiCo won't sue people for using the same groundwater used in Pepsi.\" The role of foreign companies in producing and selling food in India is a contentious issue, particularly when it comes to genetically modified crops. According to Kapil Shah, an activist defending the farmers, the case is about \"India's seed sovereignty, food sovereignty, and country sovereignty.\" He added that it's spreading panic among farmers. Ambubhai Patel, vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers' association linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), said they are lobbying the government to support the accused farmers and punish those harassing other farmers.

Research reveals that the dominant commercial cultivar grown in Hawaii originated from a single tree in southern Queensland in the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was established using a single cultivar from Australia, which was repeatedly cloned, resulting in a lack of genetic diversity. This lack of diversity has led to concerns about crop productivity, disease resistance, and the ability to grow macadamia trees in new areas. Researchers hope that their findings will lead to the discovery of wild trees and more \"novel genes\" that could improve the crop.\n\nBy analyzing genetic markers, researchers from the University of Queensland and Southern Cross University traced the origins of Hawaii's macadamia industry back to Queensland. They found that the Hawaiian cultivar had distinctive gene markers in common with a small crop of trees in the Mooloo area, near Gympie, which is 160km north of Brisbane. Historical records show that seeds from these trees were taken to Honolulu in 1896.\n\nDespite being found in a narrow band of subtropical rainforest, Australia's native macadamia trees have a rich genetic diversity compared to commercial crops. This means that there is hope for discovering diverse genes in Australian forests and even in backyards. The researchers found that there is a strong geographic pattern to the diversity of macadamia trees, with all the diversity coming from south-east Queensland and northern NSW. The Hawaiian germplasm is very narrow, meaning it has only come from one locality.\n\nThe researchers also found that some unique genetic markers in commercial trees could not be matched with known wild trees. This could be due to the loss of diverse genes in the wild through land clearing, or it could be that they continue to exist in domestic cultivated plants. According to him, some of the lost diversity might be found in cultivated plants, parks, gardens, or backyards. The oldest known cultivated macadamia tree is located in Brisbane's city botanic gardens, which was planted in 1858. Hardner emphasized the importance of focusing on forest conservation, citing climate change and land clearing as major concerns. He noted that about 90% of the wild macadamia population is found on private property, highlighting the need to identify and prioritize unique gene pools for conservation. Since macadamias are only a few generations removed from their wild ancestors, they still have a lot of potential for improvement through selective breeding. Australia's macadamia industry is significant, with the crop accounting for 14% of the country's total horticultural exports in 2017.",

Born in Coventry, Norman was the son of Florence and Cyril Dewis. His education was cut short when his father died in 1934, forcing Norman to find work. He worked at Humber and Armstrong Siddeley before joining the Royal Air Force during World War II. After being medically discharged, Norman worked as an Air Ministry inspector. In 1945, he joined Lea-Francis as chief tester, and later moved to Jaguar in 1952 as a test driver and development engineer, a role he held until his retirement in 1985. Norman played a key role in the development of Jaguar's disc brakes and participated in several races, including the 1952 Mille Miglia. He set a speed record in 1953 and was one of the Jaguar D-type drivers in the 1955 Le Mans. Norman was involved in the development of the E-type and XJ13 racing car prototype. After retiring, he served as a global ambassador for Jaguar, wrote his autobiography, and was honored with an OBE in 2015.

The idea that women will govern the world and potentially the galaxy is not far-fetched. It's possible that men have had their time and it's now women's turn to take the reins. According to this theory, women will either quietly eliminate men in their sleep or leave them behind as they colonize space. However, this raises the question of how they plan to reproduce without men's involvement. The answer is that the interplanetary matriarchy only needs a supply of frozen sperm to get started. While it's possible that men might resist this plan, new research suggests that frozen sperm can survive in space with no adverse effects. Scientists have found that by subjecting sperm samples to weightlessness, they can collect and store it for future use, raising the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth, allowing the matriarchy to impregnate themselves as needed.\n\nThe absence of sexist remarks and stereotypes could contribute to a more cohesive and efficient all-female space mission. In contrast, all-male missions in the past may have been plagued by similar issues. NASA reportedly conducted a secret study on long-term space travel, suggesting that to prevent conflicts, the crew should consist only of individuals of the same gender - either all men or all women. The study concluded that an all-female crew would be a better option, as men might argue over who should be in charge. This is a pattern observed throughout human history. While an all-female spacecraft would likely still see some romantic entanglements, at least the risk of pregnancy during a space flight would be eliminated. One could joke that the sperm would be safe, but it's unlikely that the men on board would declare themselves kings of the ship once the women departed.",

This development is significant for female astronauts, as future Mars missions may involve all-female crews. Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut, mentioned an unreleased NASA report that recommended all-male or all-female crews due to better team cohesion. A small study analyzed sperm samples exposed to microgravity using a small aerobatic aircraft and found no significant differences in characteristics. The study's lead author emphasized that further research is needed to understand the effects of space conditions on sperm.

Kal Kandola, a 49-year-old resident, expressed his discontent to the Telegraph, stating, \"We're regulars at Waitrose and are very unhappy about this. As a landlord in Wollaton, I'm concerned about the potential impact on house prices, as our area is known for being affluent.\" Research by Lloyds Bank found that homes near Waitrose enjoy a 12% premium, worth £43,571, due to the \"Waitrose effect\". However, local residents' worries may be unfounded, as Lloyds' research indicates that homes near budget supermarkets like Lidl have seen a 15% increase in value over the past four years, outpacing those near Waitrose. In fact, homes near Lidl are worth £5,411 more than similar properties in the area. Discount stores like Lidl and Aldi have gained popularity among affluent shoppers, with Lidl and Aldi now controlling nearly 14% of the UK market, according to Kantar analysts. This shift has seen them overtake Waitrose, which has traditionally been associated with middle-class shoppers. Housing market expert Neal Hudson believes the supermarket switch is unlikely to significantly impact house prices. \"The presence of a Waitrose is just one factor among many that affects property values,\" he said. \"Other factors, such as changes to a school's catchment area, are much more likely to impact prices.

The pilots' union, Balpa, can now schedule strike dates with two weeks' notice, but has decided to wait until after further talks with the airline. The airline had argued that the strike ballot was invalid, but the high court rejected this claim on Tuesday. The ballot, which was announced on Monday, saw 93% of BA's 4,000 pilots vote in favor of taking industrial action over a rejected three-year pay deal. Despite being legally entitled to call a strike, Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said the union will not set dates until after further talks with the airline at Acas this week. Strutton emphasized that the airline has admitted that even one day of strike action would cost more than what the pilots are asking for, and urged the airline to negotiate on pay and rewards. A BA spokesman expressed disappointment with the court's decision and stated that the airline remains open to talks, adding that it will continue to pursue all avenues to protect customers' holidays this summer. The pilots had sought an above-inflation pay settlement, including a profit share scheme, arguing that they took pay cuts during the financial crisis and should now benefit from the airline's recovery. BA, which carried up to 145,000 passengers a day, had offered a 11.5% pay increase over three years, which Balpa disputes. The airline pointed out that a similar pay offer had been recommended by other trade unions to their members.

Pizza Express reported a 7.7% decline in underlying profits to £32.4 million for the six months ending June, and opened only two new branches during the period.

Six weeks after the rejection, we received an enforcement notice.

This sudden change in rules creates a trap for builders and undermines the purpose of permitted development legislation. The government's guidance is clear that L-shaped dormers are permitted, and at the time of our application, Lambeth council accepted this.

Cannabis is now legal in Canada and 10 US states, as well as the District of Columbia. Philip Morris International has also diversified its business, investing in Juul-rival iQOS, a device that heats tobacco rather than burning it. The device is now available in 48 markets worldwide and will be launched in the US next month. Philip Morris International has about 11 million iQOS users globally. In July, the company lowered its earnings forecast and warned of lower demand and declining shipment volumes. Rival British American Tobacco completed its takeover of Reynolds American Incorporated in 2017, creating the world's largest tobacco company. The merger was also prompted by declining sales and the growing popularity of e-cigarettes and vapes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1.1 billion people smoked tobacco in 2015. WHO estimates that smoking claims the lives of around 6 million people annually. Despite public health efforts, tax hikes, and regulatory measures, smoking rates are decreasing in many parts of the world. However, the World Health Organization notes that smoking is on the rise in the eastern Mediterranean region and across much of Africa. Following confirmation of the talks, Philip Morris International's (PMI) shares plummeted by 8%, while Altria's shares surged by nearly 8%.",

        "Text": "\"The headline 'Single polypill reduces risk of heart attacks and strokes, study finds' should have been more nuanced, incorporating absolute rather than relative risk-reduction figures. The reported 34% reduction in major cardiac events is based on a 2.9% chance of benefit over five years for individuals, with no impact on mortality. Archie Cochrane, a pioneer in evidence-based medicine, emphasized that we should ask three questions of any intervention: can it work, does it work, and is it worth it? While the relative risk reduction provides insight into population benefits, it's the absolute risk reduction that answers the crucial 'is it worth it?' question. Many patients might hesitate to take a medication if they're told there's a 97% chance they won't benefit from it over five years and it won't improve their life expectancy. Considering the differences between the UK and rural Iran, where the study was conducted, as well as the risk of over-medicating healthy patients and potential side effects, it's unclear whether the polypill is worth the effort. Only by examining absolute risk-reduction figures can we make an informed decision. It's not surprising that medical researchers often prioritize big pharma, but the notion of promoting a polypill as a broad solution to prevent illnesses in large populations takes this approach to a new level. What's particularly concerning is the composition of this pill. If it's implemented universally, the aspirin component may harm many patients who are prone to bleeding. Additionally, including substances aimed at lowering 'bad' cholesterol is misguided. Experts widely agree that high cholesterol levels are not a disease in themselves, but rather an indication of increased oxidative stress in the body's cells. Therefore, instead of treating a single biomarker with medication, it's more effective to address underlying chronic diseases by focusing on the root causes: unhealthy lifestyles and nutrition.\"",

Unfortunately, it won't be that easy, as Waitrose has announced the closure of its dedicated reduction bays in some stores.\n\nThe decision to close the bays is reportedly aimed at helping staff manage stock and reductions more efficiently, but an anonymous Waitrose worker claims the stress had become too much, especially near closing time. The worker described the atmosphere as a circus culture where people, many of whom can afford to pay full price, fight over discounted items.\n\nSo, where can you find these incredible bargains now? According to Waitrose, reduced items will remain in their usual locations, allowing customers to choose between a discounted product and its full-price equivalent. However, bargain hunters will need to search the entire store for yellow labels to find the deals.\n\nIt seems many people are eager to snag these bargains. Some, like Kelly Eroglu, have even written about their strategies, including how to feed a family for a week with just £20. With the daily reduction phases now in place, shoppers who are willing to put in the effort can snag some amazing deals. The quest for bargains can get intense, but let's not forget that it's not worth risking serious harm. Has anyone ever been killed or seriously injured in the pursuit of a discounted cottage pie?

This controversy was sparked by an ill-considered reaction to a single complaint, not Munchetty's understandable comment.\n\nOf course, future BBC journalists won't be hired based on their impartiality about their personal experiences of racism.

Over 1,000 people lost their jobs when the company went into administration earlier this week. Wrightbus's failure marks the UK's second significant insolvency of the week. The company had been searching for a buyer, but talks with Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by JCB heir Jo Bamford collapsed at the end of last week. Former director Jeff Wright is calling for an end to the intimidation. There have been sinister developments involving threats to the lives of Wright family members, and I'm asking all elected representatives and influential community figures to help put an end to this intimidation and fear. The closure of Wrightbus has been devastating for its loyal and skilled workforce, and the loss of the company has been shattering for the Wright family, who have nurtured it for over 70 years. Generations of families have worked alongside ours over the years, and this is deeply and personally felt by everyone. The company is committed to providing its administrators with all necessary information to establish a future plan for the bus manufacturing operation. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson ordered iconic red Routemaster buses from Wrightbus during his time in office. Trade unionists have criticized Johnson for not doing enough to save the ailing firm. The company's collapse came after Johnson told parliament that his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus. A government source has denied giving any such assurances. A source with knowledge of the company's board has also disputed reports that the government has offered support. Ballymena has faced significant job losses in recent years. A Police Service of Northern Ireland spokesperson stated: We do not disclose information about individual security measures, and no conclusions should be drawn from our silence.

Knowles appeared on Fox News's The Story on Monday, where he launched a scathing attack on Thunberg. This was not the first time a Fox News personality had criticized Thunberg, as Laura Ingraham had previously compared her to the characters in Stephen King's horror story. Thunberg had given a powerful speech at the United Nations summit, accusing world leaders of betraying young people by failing to take action on the climate crisis.

His successor, Harriet Green, was paid £4.7 million for less than three years, plus a share bonus worth an additional £5.6 million. She donated a third of the bonus to charity after the tragic deaths of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning in Thomas Cook accommodations. Green also claimed £80,000 annually to cover her hotel expenses at the five-star Brown's hotel in London. Peter Fankhauser, who was at the helm when the company went bankrupt, received £8.3 million, including £4.3 million in bonuses. Labour's shadow chancellor urged Thomas Cook bosses to \"examine their consciences,\" while the party's shadow minister called on them to return their bonuses. Meanwhile, international hedge funds that bet against Thomas Cook profited from its collapse. Nearly 11% of the company's shares were \"shorted\" ahead of its collapse. Two hedge funds, TT International and Whitebox Advisers, made up the bulk of the shorts, holding around 7% of the company's shares. Hedge funds other than Thomas Cook are poised to reap a significant gain from their investments in credit default swaps, a type of insurance that provides a payout when a company fails to meet its debt obligations.

The retailer has partnered with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders over £30 in interest-free instalments. Clearpay, an Australian fintech company, has gained popularity among millennials on tight budgets, along with its rival Klarna. Many of M&S's competitors, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services, and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shoppers, including families with young children. M&S says its customers are increasingly seeking ways to spread the cost of larger purchases, and the Clearpay service enables them to do so by spreading the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800, and customers can manage their payments through a phone app without needing to apply for credit. Unlike traditional credit products, fintech firms like Clearpay and Klarna make money by earning commission on the sales transaction, although some also offer interest-bearing products. Shoppers who use these plans tend to spend more frequently, making it an attractive proposition for retailers like M&S, where clothing sales are declining. Over 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports, and Boohoo, work with Klarna, which has more than 3 million British customers. Clearpay, which launched in the UK just three months ago, has already gained over 200,000 active customers. However, not everyone is a fan of this form of credit. Simon Wolfson, CEO of Next, has expressed concerns that it might be dangerous, saying that there is a difference between spreading the cost and just deferring it.

The investment will be divided into two phases, with €100 million dedicated to new renewable energy projects and the second phase focusing on carbon removal through reforestation and responsible forest management. Inter Ikea Group has already invested significantly in sustainability, with plans to spend at least €3 billion. Since 2009, the company has invested in renewable energy, owning wind turbines and solar panels in 14 countries, and has also invested in forest land. Ingka Group, which operates 374 Ikea stores, has made efforts to reduce its environmental impact, including investing in plastics recycling and textile recycling. According to Inter Ikea Group's chief sustainability officer, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial in limiting climate change, but removing existing carbon from the atmosphere is also essential. The company believes it can make a positive impact through its integrated supply chain, global presence, and expertise in forestry and climate issues.",

By Monday, one of the suspended workers, Rebecca Rivers, had been fired, with reports suggesting that three other Google employees had also been let go. Rivers, a software engineer who had been involved in internal protests against the company's work with US Customs and Border Protection, announced her termination on Twitter. According to an internal memo, three other Google employees were also fired on Monday, with the company citing \"clear and repeated violations of our data security policies\" as the reason. Google confirmed the memo's accuracy but declined further comment. The firings sparked immediate allegations of retaliation from current and former Google employees. Meredith Whittaker, one of the walkout organizers, described Rivers' firing as \"craven retaliation\" on Twitter, while Stephanie Parker, a current YouTube employee, called the terminations \"inhumane\" and \"illegal\". Whittaker and another organizer, Claire Stapleton, had previously left Google after alleging they were retaliated against by management. At the rally, Rivers expressed pride in her actions, stating everyone has the right to know what their work is used for. The public protest and firings are the latest signs of growing labor unrest at Google, which has seen an increase in employee activism over the past two years. Many employees have been demanding a say in how their work is used and their rights as workers. Google employees have voiced discontent with several projects, including a contract to supply AI technology to the US Department of Defense's drone program, a censored search engine for China, and cloud services to the fossil fuel industry. A notable example of employee dissatisfaction was the walkout by approximately 20,000 employees over the company's handling of sexual harassment cases. Many employees have also spoken out about Google's extensive use of subcontracted workers, who often have fewer rights and benefits than regular employees. A group of worker-organizers published a strongly-worded Medium post on Monday night, expressing outrage at the company's actions. They accused Google of illegal retaliation against employees who are exercising their right to organize, describing it as \"classic union busting\" and vowing to resist it.",

Commissioned by State Street Global, the 4-foot bronze sculpture of a defiant young girl was intended to promote a fund investing in companies with diverse gender representation. Overnight in March 2017, the original Fearless Girl appeared in downtown New York, standing opposite the Charging Bull statue near Wall Street. The sculpture quickly became a sensation, drawing crowds of selfie-takers. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren used the statue to promote her policies. Sculptor Kristen Visbal has since created multiple copies of Fearless Girl, which now stand in cities such as London and Oslo. However, State Street took legal action to stop the Fearless Girl from spreading further, seeking to have a statue removed from Federation Square in Melbourne. State Street argues that the replicas violate its trademark and dilute its message. According to the New York Times, State Street's lawyer claimed that Maurice Blackburn used the Fearless Girl campaign to promote itself. State Street has also sued Visbal for making other copies, citing trademark violations. Visbal's lawyers argue that State Street's moves are designed to \"rob her of making a living from her art.\" The statue has been a mixed blessing for State Street, raising its profile but also highlighting its own record on gender equality. In October 2017, State Street paid $5 million to settle charges that it had underpaid about 300 women in its employ.

Social media has been flooded with outrage over universities' attempts to deter students from joining picket lines and reporting striking lecturers.\n\nLast February, the largest ever industrial action in UK universities took place, with lecturers and staff participating in a 14-day strike.

While the NUS supports the strike, not all students agree, with many criticizing the lecturers. Within hours, a petition was launched to demand reimbursement for lost contact hours, with students concerned about the impact on end-of-term grades. Some feel they're paying tuition fees and expect a full term of teaching, while others are frustrated about lost time and potential grade effects.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that frustration is mutual between staff and students. Both parties feel universities are becoming impersonal and poorly run, with staff treated like employees rather than educators. Instead of directing anger towards lecturers, we should focus on the institutions forcing them to strike. Tuition fees aren't solely spent on tutors' salaries; academics' pay has fallen by 17% since 2009.\n\nMore than half of academics are on temporary contracts, adding to their daily stress and contributing to poor mental health among higher education staff. The UCU reports a 15% gender pay gap and a decline in pensions due to USS changes. Under these conditions, it's unrealistic to expect students to receive the best education.\n\nAs NUS vice president Claire Sosienski-Smith noted, \"Students won't be happy about missing lectures, but they're not happy about studying in institutions where staff are underpaid and overworked.\" It's not accurate to assume this strike will damage our university careers. Many lecturers are ensuring students won't be abandoned, leaving pre-prepared work and tips to help make the most of lost time.\n\nLecturers demonstrate a genuine concern for their students' academic well-being. It's a testament to their dedication that they undertake such a demanding role without adequate recognition. The strike's success hinges on universities recognizing students stand firmly behind their lecturers and acknowledge the need for change. As students, we have a crucial role to play in sustaining these strikes, maintaining pressure for fairer working conditions.

For several years, scientists have been intrigued and perplexed by these sudden, low-frequency radiation events, which release more energy than the sun in a day and vanish instantly. Known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), these enigmatic signals appear randomly and without warning, leaving astronomers uncertain about when or where they will occur next. Over 60 FRBs have been recorded to date, with the only consensus being that they are unlikely to be extraterrestrial greetings. A groundbreaking discovery was made a year ago when scientists identified a repeating radio signal and traced it to a dwarf galaxy 3 billion light-years from Earth. Further observations suggested that the burst was generated by extremely powerful magnetic fields, effectively ruling out the possibility of alien laser signals. A team of astronomers from several Canadian universities has now announced the discovery of a second repeating radio signal. The team's breakthrough came last summer, shortly after activating the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope in British Columbia.

Pew Research Center focused on Facebook due to its significant role in the global media ecosystem.

The report highlights that nearly 500,000 land species are at risk of extinction due to threats to their natural habitats. The Sundarbans, a 4,000-square-mile region in Bangladesh and India, is home to the world's largest mangrove forest and a diverse ecosystem that supports hundreds of animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. However, 70% of the region is only a few feet above sea level, making it vulnerable to climate change impacts. Researchers predict that the warming planet will decimate the few hundred Bengal tigers remaining in the region. By 2070, the study concludes that there will be no suitable tiger habitats remaining in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. The findings rely on climate scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Climate change has already had a devastating impact on the world's endangered mammals, with a recent study finding that it has harmed almost half of them. The new report's lead author and colleagues examined the risks to the tiger population beyond sea level rise, which accounted for only 5.4-11.3% of the projected habitat loss in 2050 and 2070. They found that other climate-related factors were more significant threats to the Sundarbans' tigers. Since the early 1900s, habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal trade of animal parts have contributed to the global tiger population decline. A recent study has discovered that the Bangladesh Sundarbans will likely experience a decline in its population due to an increase in extreme weather events and changes in vegetation. As the Sundarbans flood, the likelihood of conflicts between humans and tigers will rise. According to Dr. Mukul, \"Many unforeseen consequences could arise. The situation could worsen significantly if a cyclone hits, a disease outbreak occurs, or a food shortage develops.\" A landmark report by the United Nations's scientific panel on climate change warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rate, the Earth's atmosphere will warm by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2040.",

Paul Oetken wrote in his decision, \"The court recognizes that the SALT cap is a distinct provision, but the states have failed to prove that it oversteps Congress's broad authority to impose taxes.\" The lawsuit was joined by three other states: New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland. The cap on state and local tax deductions, previously unlimited, was introduced in the 2017 tax law to offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the cap and related provisions are expected to generate nearly $700 billion in revenue over the next decade. Independent analyses suggest that even in high-tax states like New York, most residents received a modest tax cut under the 2017 law. Other provisions of the law, such as reduced marginal tax rates, offset the loss of the deduction for many families. The state and local tax issue poses an awkward challenge for Democrats, who are seeking to restore a tax break that primarily benefited high-income earners. Prior to the cap's implementation, households earning $200,000 or more accounted for roughly half of the nearly $600 billion in state and local tax payments deducted on federal tax returns. However, Democrats argue that the SALT cap unfairly penalizes states with progressive tax policies, making state and local taxes more expensive for residents. This could hinder states' ability to raise taxes, particularly on wealthy residents, and increase pressure to cut spending. In their lawsuit, the four states claimed that the SALT cap constitutes an impermissible attempt by the federal government to influence certain states' tax policies.",

This acquisition comes as the company aims to diversify beyond its core ride-hailing service, following a rocky initial public offering in May. Despite slowing growth in its core business, Uber is focusing on expanding its food and freight delivery services, as well as entering new markets such as bicycle and scooter rentals. Cornershop, operating in Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Canada, will now be integrated into Uber's platform, with plans to expand into additional markets, including the United States. \"We're delighted to partner with Cornershop and look forward to working together to bring grocery delivery to millions of consumers on the Uber platform,\" said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's CEO, in a statement.",

Green disclosed that the company is on track to achieve profitability by late 2021, excluding certain expenses. During the latest earnings call, executives reiterated their commitment to achieving operating profitability. The shift in focus towards profit comes as Lyft's losses were largely driven by stock-based compensation costs and payroll tax expenses. Excluding these costs, Lyft's operating loss was $121.6 million for the quarter, a less severe outcome than Wall Street estimates. Lyft's stock surged nearly 1.5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday. CFO Brian Roberts attributed the company's strong revenue performance, stating, \"We significantly exceeded revenue expectations.\" Roberts also emphasized Lyft's dedication to achieving profitability by a specific date, a rare approach in the industry. Earlier this year, Lyft had predicted record losses as it prioritized growth, but the company has since adjusted its strategy in response to a shift in sentiment towards prominent tech startups.",

Despite the difficulty in tracking the frequency of these devastating storms due to limited records, which date back only about a century and a half, researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery by compiling a 1,500-year history of hurricanes in the Bahamas. According to their findings, hurricane activity has fluctuated significantly over time, with recent activity in the Bahamas being relatively low compared to historical highs, despite intense activity in other parts of the Atlantic. The scientists attribute these fluctuations to changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, as well as volcanic activity. Following the destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian, a geographer describes this historical record as a \"wake-up call,\" noting that we are still in the early stages of understanding hurricane patterns and processes within the context of long-term history. Blue holes, formed when carbonate rock erodes and collapses, are revered by divers for their deep, clear waters and are also important repositories of scientific data.

Unlike humans, who lose only one set of teeth in their lifetime, dinosaurs frequently shed tens or even hundreds of sets due to their unique dental habits. Herbivorous dinosaurs, which needed to chew through tough plant material to sustain their large bodies, often replaced their teeth frequently. However, researchers were surprised to discover that a carnivorous dinosaur, the only known cannibal, replaced its teeth even more frequently than some herbivores. The dinosaur's habit of chewing on the bones of its prey may have contributed to its rapid tooth replacement rate, scientists hypothesized. The findings were published recently in the journal PLoS One and focused on several meat-eating dinosaurs, with Majungasaurus crenatissimus emerging as the star of the study. This 20-foot-long apex predator, which lived on what is now Madagascar around 70 million years ago, left behind a remarkable fossil record, including several complete skeletons, hundreds of fragmentary skeletons, and tens of thousands of shed teeth. \"This is quite unusual,\" said Michael D.

Williamson, whose hiring in March triggered a contentious online discussion about what views are acceptable in mainstream publications. The controversy revolved around Williamson's extreme stance on abortion, which he advocates should be punished as premeditated homicide, potentially with the death penalty. This hardline view was initially expressed in a 2014 Twitter exchange and ultimately led to his departure from the magazine. After hiring Williamson, Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg initially defended him, stating that he didn't want to judge individuals based on their worst tweets or isolated statements. However, Goldberg later reversed his stance, citing a podcast episode from the same month in which Williamson elaborated on his anti-abortion views, which he deemed more than just trollish.",

The whale, still growing, was unusually underweight, as adult sperm whales typically reach up to 120,000 pounds. A necropsy revealed that the whale's stomach and intestines were clogged with 64 pounds of trash, including plastic bags, ropes, netting, and a plastic drum, which it was unable to digest or pass through its system. This caused severe inflammation, leading to the whale's decline and eventual death. Sperm whales, which dive to great depths to hunt squid, often linger near the surface, making them vulnerable to ingesting floating debris that may be mistaken for food. Unfortunately, pollution in the ocean has devastating effects on wildlife, particularly in areas where buoyant debris accumulates in \"islands\" of trash that float above or just below the surface. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to contain at least 87,000 tons of plastic. As plastic pollution continues to grow, some scientists believe it may have a greater impact on animal populations than climate change. In 2008, two whales were found on a beach in Northern California with bags and netting in their stomachs, likely discarded by fishermen. One whale's stomach had ruptured, and the other, which had consumed over 160 pounds of trash, likely starved to death as the garbage obstructed its stomach. The authorities in Murcia have released the results of a necropsy conducted by the El Valle Wildlife Recovery Center as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the impact of plastic and trash in the coastal region's waters. Volunteers are working to clean up local beaches and are urging the public to be more mindful of their plastic waste disposal. It's crucial that we address this issue through both cleanup efforts and education, making sure our citizens are aware of the importance of protecting our environment.",

By analyzing loggerhead turtle genetics, researchers found that the turtles swim in a large loop from their nesting grounds in North Carolina and Florida to North Africa before returning to nest on beaches within a 40-50 mile radius of their birthplace. The study proposes that turtles imprint the unique magnetic signature of their home beach, a process known as geomagnetic imprinting. According to Dr. Kenneth Lohmann, this knowledge is vital for restoring sea turtle populations to areas where they once thrived before being driven to extinction.

A single cloud of spores can spread over 40 miles or more from its source, according to a 2017 study published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology. The gypsy moth is the adult stage of a caterpillar species that poses a significant threat to tree canopies, introduced from France in 1869. The gypsy moth's feeding habits are more destructive to trees than those of native tent caterpillars, which it resembles. A fungus specifically targeting gypsy moths was first detected in the Northeast in 1989, and efforts to introduce it as a biological control measure began as early as 1910. In 2000, a coordinated program was launched by 11 states and the US Forest Service to combat the gypsy moth infestation. While the program has not completely halted the spread of the moths, it has significantly slowed their advance. The Cornell researchers hope to harness the natural fungal predator to control the gypsy moth population and reduce reliance on insecticides.",

This phenomenon, known as the Leidenfrost effect, has been observed by cooks and scientists alike. German doctor Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost first described the effect in his book on water properties in 1756. French scientists have recently made a new discovery about the behavior of these skittering drops. When the droplets are small, the heat from the pan causes them to tilt and rotate, propelling them to roll. This phenomenon was previously unknown because scientists hadn't attempted to pin a water droplet to a precisely flat surface before. The clear color of water makes it difficult to see the liquid's movement. It was previously thought that the droplets moved due to air currents or sliding down a slope, but new research shows they can move independently. \"It's surprisingly simple,\" said David Quere, a scientist at Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris. \"The drop is running away, and it has a little motor inside, which is surprising.\" Quere and his colleagues published their findings in Nature Physics this week. To observe the Leidenfrost effect, droplets of water were placed on a very flat, very hot, nonabsorbent surface held in place by a needle. The surface must be at least 400 degrees Fahrenheit for the effect to occur. Some recipes use this test to determine whether a pan is hot enough. Large drops have a flattened shape, resembling puddles. Within each drop, two convective cells rotate in opposite directions, canceling out each other's motion. The flow within the drop was visualized using tracers mixed with the water. As the water evaporates, the droplet shrinks and becomes nearly spherical, allowing for only one convective cell to exist. When the needle is lifted, the smaller droplet speeds away in the direction of its convective spin. The researchers' next step is to guide the droplets through channels or temperature gradients. There are still fundamental phenomena to be explored, such as why the surface temperature must be significantly higher than the boiling point for the drops to levitate. Interestingly, there is currently no clear answer to this question.",

In 1995, astronomers made a groundbreaking discovery when they found a star in the constellation Pegasus wobbling due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive instruments that detect subtle changes in starlight caused by an orbiting planet. As a planet orbits its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again, a phenomenon that can be detected by these advanced instruments. The Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, revolutionized the field of exoplanet hunting by discovering thousands of planets. Unlike earlier methods, Kepler searched for small dips in starlight caused by a planet passing in front of its star. Kepler's findings were astounding, revealing a diverse range of exoplanets. In recent years, astronomers have made significant progress in directly imaging exoplanets, capturing blurry but tantalizing glimpses of alien landscapes. We've also discovered a free-floating planet and signs of planets being born. The next generation of planet hunters is now on the horizon. On April 16, 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, will launch and spend two years scanning the entire sky for minute dips in brightness caused by nearby alien worlds. TESS is equipped with four cameras that can cover a 96-degree swath of the sky. As a planet hunter, TESS's discoveries can be further studied by the next generation of telescopes on Earth and in space. If fortunate, TESS may uncover planets with lakes, oceans, and atmospheres rich in chemicals, allowing us to detect signs of habitability or even life. The Milky Way is estimated to harbor more planets than stars, with a vast diversity that remains largely unexplored. In our quest for life and meaning in the universe, our own planet remains the ultimate benchmark.",

New findings about a small, icy world beyond Pluto have strengthened this idea. Astronomers led by Scott S. Sheppard from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington revealed the orbital details of this new world, nicknamed the Goblin. The world, officially designated as 2015 TG387, was first spotted during a systematic search for new worlds in the outer solar system, including the hypothetical Planet Nine. Three years of additional observations were needed to fully understand the world's orbit. The astronomers have submitted a paper detailing their discovery to The Astronomical Journal. The newly discovered world, estimated to be around 200 miles wide, is currently about 7.4 billion miles from the sun, or roughly 2.5 times farther away than Pluto. Its closest approach to the sun is relatively close to its current distance.",

This partnership between ants and antimicrobial bacteria has been in existence for tens of millions of years, according to a recent discovery by Dr. Currie and his team. The key evidence came from two 20-million-year-old ants found trapped in amber in the Dominican Republic, which revealed specialized pockets on one ant's head and gas bubbles on the other. \"It's as if the ants are mobile pharmaceutical factories,\" said Dr. Currie, a co-author of the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This finding suggests that ants preceded humans by tens of millions of years in partnering with microbes to produce antibiotics. Dr. Hongjie Li discovered the bacteria in the amber ants while inspecting the specimens using a scanning electron microscope at the Smithsonian Institution. \"It was a surprise to me,\" Dr. Li said. The team combined this finding with data on 69 other ant species to reconstruct the ant's evolutionary tree, which indicated that ants established their partnership with bacteria tens of millions of years ago.",

Researchers have found significant differences in the diets of urban and rural rodents, with city rats enjoying a more varied and stable diet than their rural counterparts. By analyzing the remains of brown rats that lived in and around Toronto between 1790 and 1890, scientists discovered that city rats thrived on the abundance of human waste, while country rats struggled to survive. According to Eric Guiry, an archaeologist at Trent University, city rats had a significantly higher proportion of meat in their diet. The difference is evident in their bones, noted Guiry. Guiry and his co-author, Michael Buckley, are pioneers in the field of paleoproteomics, which uses ancient bone proteins to gain insights into an animal's behavior. Guiry's interest in applying this technique to rats was driven by a desire to learn more about human populations in the 1800s without having to analyze human remains. The research has practical implications for cities seeking to better manage their rodent populations.",

The lander's seismometers, designed to measure marsquakes, picked up vibrations in the air, which are essentially sound waves. The winds, blowing at a moderate 10-15 miles per hour, caused the lander's solar panels to vibrate, and the seismometers recorded these vibrations. The process is similar to how humans hear sound, with the solar panels acting like the eardrum, the spacecraft structure like the inner ear, and the seismometers converting vibrations into nerve signals. The recorded vibrations have a frequency of up to 50 Hertz, audible to humans as a low rumble. NASA has created a version of the recording that boosts the sounds by two octaves. The sounds evoke the feeling of wind or ocean waves, but with an otherworldly quality. A second instrument, an air pressure sensor, detected sound vibrations, although at a much lower frequency audible only to certain animals. The air pressure sensor's readings, sped up by a factor of 100, raise the pitch by over six octaves. The instruments are not sensitive to higher frequencies, so the sounds are lower in frequency. On Mars, the air is incredibly thin, making it more conducive to low-frequency sounds. The Viking landers detected some wind noise, but the recordings were made at lower sampling rates and didn't pick up any sounds at audible frequencies. The Viking seismometer detected movements of the spacecraft, but it would be a stretch to describe them as sounds. NASA attempted to send microphones to Mars on the Mars Polar Lander spacecraft, but it crashed during landing. The Phoenix Mars lander was equipped with a microphone, but it was left turned off to avoid any potential problems during landing.",

According to Hartmann, there are two routes by which we perceive our own voice when speaking. The first path is the same one we use to perceive most other sounds, where sound waves travel through the outer, middle, and inner ear. However, because our vocal cords vibrate when we speak, a second internal path is created, where those vibrations are conducted through our bones and directly excite our inner ears. This internal path emphasizes lower frequencies, making our voice sound deeper and richer to ourselves, Hartmann explained. However, this explanation doesn't apply to everyone. John J. Rosowski, a Harvard Medical School professor and researcher specializing in the middle ear, provided additional insight. He suggested that individual variations in perception may arise from the nuanced ways sounds are perceived by the inner ear within the two pathways outlined by Hartmann. \"There are multiple paths that these vibrations take to reach the skull,\" Rosowski noted, \"including the vibrations of the skull itself, which can vary.\"",

Despite this, scientists have found that meteorites that fall on Earth are not similar to asteroids that pass through our neighborhood. According to Philipp R. Heck, curator at the Field Museum of Natural History, \"That's what everybody would have expected,\" but planetary scientists were surprised to discover that the most common types of meteorites on Earth are not common in space. A recent study published in Nature Astronomy shed light on the mystery, revealing that mineralogical evidence in some meteorites pointed to a massive collision in the asteroid belt around 466 million years ago. Dr. Heck estimates that during this time, skywatchers would have seen about 100 times more shooting stars than we see today. To investigate meteorites that landed on Earth before this collision, Dr. Heck and his colleagues turned to ancient limestone from Russia, which is around a million years older. They extracted 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite from almost 600 pounds of rock. These crystals remain unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, allowing scientists to determine that 41 of them originated from space and were once part of specific types of asteroids. The mix of meteorites from this ancient period was strikingly different from what we see today, with more than a third belonging to a type called primitive achondrites, compared to less than half a percent today. The findings align with the growing understanding that the composition of meteorites is shaped by the history of asteroid collisions in the asteroid belt, rather than the proximity of asteroids to Earth's orbit. The new paper opens up new avenues of research, including the origins of achondrite meteorites, which may not all share the same origin.",

This finding contradicts the prevailing assumption that marine mammals, renowned for their remarkable diving abilities, have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve energy and oxygen.\n\nTo conduct the study, the team collaborated with trainers to prompt the marine mammals to engage in distinct behaviors, such as resting, swimming in a straight line, or diving to swim through hoops. The animals' breathing, oxygen intake, heart rate, and swimming patterns were measured across various settings. The results indicated that there was little disparity in energy expenditure between resting and swimming at average speeds.

According to figures released on Friday, Uber's ride-hailing service experienced a substantial increase in gross bookings, reaching $20 billion in 2016, more than double the amount from the previous year. Net revenue, which accounts for the costs of paying drivers, reached $6.5 billion. Despite its growing business, Uber remains unprofitable. The company reported an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding the cost of its Chinese subsidiary, Uber China. This loss is attributed to significant investments made in developing its operations in China, which were ultimately sold to Didi Chuxing last year. The release of these financial figures, previously reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by Uber, marks the first time the company has publicly disclosed its financial data. While some information about its financial performance has leaked in the past, and the company typically shares quarterly updates with employees and select investors, this is the first time the figures have been made publicly available.

To gain a deeper understanding, I consulted Chris Heinonen, AV staff writer at The Wirecutter, a reputable website owned by The New York Times that reviews and recommends products. Sound bars can be quite pricey, even surpassing the cost of a TV. So, why would anyone opt for one? While \"need\" might be an exaggeration, sound bars have gained immense popularity because they effectively address two significant issues related to TV viewing and music listening. Unlike older tube-style TVs, which had ample space for speakers, modern flat-panel displays are notoriously cramped, leaving little room for sound reproduction. As a result, smaller speakers struggle to produce high-quality sound. Furthermore, the limited space on the front of the TV forced manufacturers to relocate speakers to the bottom or back of the panel. Concurrently, people shifted from playing music on CDs to streaming it on their computers and phones. Sound bars, with their sleek, compact design, eliminate the need for additional cables or equipment, featuring built-in Bluetooth (or AirPlay) for seamless wireless music playback.",

Despite human-drawn boundaries, wolves roam freely across the region, undeterred by human attempts to restrict their movement. A recent study published in Wildlife Monographs suggests that efforts to control wolf populations outside the preserve have had detrimental effects on the wolves living within it. The study reveals that when Alaskan authorities were culling wolf populations outside the preserve, the survival rates of wolves within the preserve were lower than usual. This underscores the importance of communication and cooperation between wildlife managers within and outside preserve boundaries, with potential implications for wildlife management programs worldwide. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has invested millions of dollars since the 1990s in an intensive predator management program, initially using sterilization and later shooting and killing hundreds of wolves from helicopters. Despite decades of effort, the program has failed to significantly increase the population of the Fortymile caribou herd in the surrounding lands, which still only peaks at around 50,000 to 60,000, down from an estimated hundreds of thousands in the 1970s. Research suggests that these efforts may not be effective in increasing caribou numbers in the area. Over 22 years of monitoring wolves in the preserve using radio collars, researchers led by John Burch, a National Park Service wildlife biologist, found that wolf survival rates decreased during lethal management outside the preserve. \"Every single wolf pack left the preserve,\" Dr. Burch noted, as the state only targeted wolves outside the preserve, while many wolves that ventured outside the preserve were shot and killed.",

Typically, they feed on these mice, but a new study suggests that the surge in tick-borne disease may be linked to a decline in traditional mouse predators. If mice were scarcer, larval ticks might feed on other mammals and birds that don't carry diseases, or they might struggle to find their first meal. Ticks require three meals to reproduce, and humans are only at risk of contracting diseases from ticks that have previously fed on infected hosts.\n\nTo test this theory, lead researcher Tim R.

Buildings named for David Bibb Graves, a former governor of Alabama and grand cyclops of the KKK's Montgomery chapter, can be found at Auburn, the University of Alabama, and at least nine other universities, including two historically black schools, Alabama A&M and Alabama State University. Meanwhile, Middle Tennessee State University's board of regents voted to remove Nathan Bedford Forrest's name from Forrest Hall, believed to be the KKK's first grand wizard, after years of student protests.",

While some may think that microwaving a sponge kills its tiny inhabitants, this is only partially true. The weak bacteria may be eliminated, but the strongest, most potent, and potentially harmful bacteria will survive. They'll multiply and occupy the empty space left behind by the dead. And your sponge will become even smellier and more unpleasant, leading you to regret not simply throwing it away, according to a recent study published in Scientific Reports.\n\nBacteria are everywhere, so it's no surprise that a kitchen sponge would be a breeding ground for them. However, previous research had underestimated the quantity and diversity of bacteria found in sponges. By analyzing DNA and RNA samples from 14 used sponges, microbiologist Markus Egert and his team at the University of Furtwangen in Germany identified 362 different species of bacteria living within them. The researchers were amazed to find that the microbes occupied such close quarters with incredible density: approximately 82 billion bacteria per cubic inch. \"This density is similar to what you'd find in human stool samples,\" Dr. Egert noted. \"There may be no other places on earth with such high bacterial densities.\"",

Envision a mouse attempting to evade a cat by moving erratically and unpredictably, thereby increasing its chances of survival. Similarly, in humans, this type of behavior is linked to creativity and cognitive complexity. However, understanding the human mind's capacity to generate randomness is a complex task. Recently, a team of researchers from Europe conducted a series of experiments to measure human random choice-making abilities. They discovered that, on average, individuals are most adept at producing random results around the age of 25. The team designed five tasks to test randomness, including simulating random coin flips, guessing the next card in a shuffled deck, and arranging a grid of black and white boxes to appear random. Over 3,400 participants from 4 to 91 years old took part in the experiment. The researchers utilized software to analyze participants' responses and identified the sequences that were most challenging for the computer to predict as the most random. By analyzing participants' performance against various factors, including age, sex, and educational background, the researchers found a strong correlation with age. Performance improved from childhood to the mid-20s and remained relatively high until the 60s, after which it began to decline. However, Dr. Zenil noted that even in older adults, there may be trade-offs that compensate for decreased randomness, such as increased experience and knowledge.",

Sometimes we fail to cry when we should, and other times we cry without apparent reason. Amidst this emotional complexity, it's refreshing to consider the straightforward explanation behind why onions make us tear up. Onions release a chemical called lachrymatory factor, which irritates our eyes when it reacts with other substances. Simply peeling an onion won't cause our eyes to water, but chopping, cutting, crushing, or smashing one will. This is because the onion's cells break open, allowing two previously separate substances to combine and form a potent chemical irritant. According to Josie Silvaroli, an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University, this chemical reaction is similar to tear gas, as it releases a gas that hits the eyes and sensory nerves, causing them to tear up. The lachrymatory factor evolved as a defense mechanism to protect onions from microbes and animals, including humans. When an onion is damaged, it triggers this defense mechanism, releasing the chemical reaction as its cells break down.",

Following years of conservation efforts by the Chinese government, including the restoration of bamboo forests and the establishment of national reserves, the panda population has made a remarkable comeback. In September 2016, the pandas were officially removed from the endangered species list, with an estimated population of 1,864 - excluding cubs. This marks a significant increase from the low of around 1,200 in the 1980s. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature warned that climate change and other factors could still devastate the pandas' habitat in the long term, rendering any population surge a temporary victory. The fragmentation of the panda population, now confined to just six mountain ranges and 30 isolated groups, is also a major concern. According to Dr. Ouyang and her colleagues, Chinese conservation efforts have had a positive impact on panda habitats in recent years, and planned changes are expected to reduce pressures on the pandas and their habitat in the short term. However, infrastructure development, tourism, and other human activities could undermine these improvements. The researchers recommend several steps to prevent the pandas from becoming endangered again, including improving connectivity between isolated panda populations by building habitat corridors, reducing habitat fragmentation, establishing \"ecological red lines\" to physically separate panda habitats from human development, expanding panda preserves, and restricting tourism in national parks containing pandas.",

On Thursday, Twitter acknowledged that it had inflated its monthly user numbers since 2014, after mistakenly counting data from third-party apps. The revelation came as the company reported a narrower net loss in the third quarter and a 14% increase in daily active users. However, the disclosure may further tarnish Twitter's reputation, which is already under scrutiny for its handling of Russia's election meddling, abuse, and harassment on the platform, and concerns about slowing user growth worldwide. Twitter discovered that its measure of monthly active users had incorrectly included figures from third-party apps using Digits, a software-development program. As a result, the company reduced its monthly active user count by 2 million for the first and second quarters of this year and by 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Twitter was unable to reconcile the figures for periods before last year's fourth quarter due to its data-retention policies. The company reported a 4% increase in monthly active users from the same period last year, with 330 million users, up from 326 million in the second quarter. Twitter reported a net loss of $21.1 million for the quarter, compared to a $102.9 million loss for the same period last year. Revenue declined 4% to $590 million.",

Avrich claims the original film, titled \"Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project,\" was watered down, and he now feels a moral obligation to rework it due to the sexual harassment and rape allegations against Weinstein. Speaking from Ottawa, Avrich stated that he wants to expand the documentary beyond its initial 11-minute conclusion, which focused on Weinstein's behavior as a sexual predator. However, Avrich must first resolve the issue with IFC Films, a division of AMC Networks, which acquired the distribution rights to his documentary in 2010. Avrich has long alleged that IFC requested edits to the film and ultimately decided against a theatrical release to appease Weinstein, who was a powerful figure in Hollywood at the time. IFC has consistently denied these claims, releasing a statement that said: \"The film was made available on various platforms, including Netflix, iTunes, and our own streaming service. We believe we provided suitable distribution for the documentary, as we do for the six to eight documentaries we distribute annually.

As it expanded, it sent out dark, twisted tendrils called rhizomorphs to explore the underground darkness and forage for sustenance. Today, this enormous organism covers an area the size of three Central Parks beneath the Oregon soil, potentially weighing as much as 5,000 African elephants. Known scientifically as Armillaria ostoyae, this behemoth is affectionately referred to as The Humongous Fungus, and it's officially recognized as the largest known terrestrial organism on the planet by the United States Forest Service. However, its impressive size comes with a deadly drawback: it's a highly destructive forest pathogen. While none have reached the same colossal proportions, other Armillaria species are also prevalent in North America, Europe, and Asia, causing root rot disease in forests, parks, orchards, and vineyards. What sets these fungi apart is their ability to send out stringy rhizomorphs that target weak trees, colonize their roots, and ultimately kill and consume them. A team of international scientists, led by Hungarian researchers, has made a breakthrough in the fight against these fungal giants. In a recent study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, they uncovered the genetic secrets behind Armillaria's remarkable ability to develop its unique rhizomorphs, grow to enormous sizes, and excel at killing host plants.",

To conduct the experiment, 37 adolescents aged 12 to 15 spent nine days in a lab, adhering to a strict schedule to regulate their sleep-wake cycles. This allowed researchers to focus on the circadian clock's impact on the body, including metabolism.

These extraordinary 'trees' aren't plants at all, but rather intricate homes built by Christmas tree worms on coral reefs around the world. These marine creatures construct their tubes using calcium carbonate secretions and emerge to feed, reproduce, and breathe using their branchial crowns. As you snorkel through the waters, keep an eye out for these vibrant, spiral-shaped cones that resemble miniature decorated firs. According to marine biologist Orly Perry, these 'trees' are \"really pretty, very colorful, very festive, and Christmassy.\" Most of these worm 'trees' grow no more than an inch from the tube's opening, but they make up for their small size with dazzling displays that resemble the work of a skilled candymaker. In the Gulf of Aqaba, near Eilat, Israel, Perry has observed many of these 'trees' displaying a kaleidoscope of colors, including purples, greens, and whites. Unlike other creatures, Christmas tree worms don't burrow into the coral; instead, they latch onto dead spots or wounds and begin constructing their tubes. By synchronizing their tube growth with the coral's growth, the worms ensure that their homes remain stable and accessible. Once settled, these worms stay put for up to 30 or 40 years, unable to relocate. The locations where these larvae settle are not arbitrary; they appear to have a specific preference for certain coral species, often opting for less aggressive ones. In optimal environments, the worms are able to grow to their full size. According to Mrs. Perry, this phenomenon is reminiscent of human behavior: \"If you're comfortable in a place, everything is happy, and that's true for these worms too. Their size is directly impacted by their habitat choice.\" Some species within the Spirobranchus genus have a fondness for artificial surfaces, while others have been found to thrive on specific types of coral. Mrs. Perry discovered a potentially new species in the Gulf of Eilat that has a peculiar affinity for plastic buoys and metal surfaces on piers and staircases. It's possible that the larvae are drawn to these preferred habitats by signals emitted by older worms that have successfully colonized similar locations in the past.\"",

However, a recent study published in Veterinary Pathology has identified two cases of cancer in naked mole rats housed in zoos.

To explore this, researchers at two Minnesota forest sites monitored the respiration rates of 10 tree species from boreal and temperate forests over three to five years. The trees were subjected to two conditions: ambient temperature and a 6-degree warmer temperature, achieved using heating cables. To examine long-term temperature adaptation, the scientists compared three factors: carbon dioxide release in ambient conditions, carbon dioxide release in the warmer conditions, and carbon dioxide release during short-term exposure to the warmer temperature. The analysis revealed that trees acclimated to warmer temperatures increased their carbon dioxide release by a significantly smaller amount than trees exposed to the same short-term temperature increase.",

The documents, published by the Center for International Environmental Law, suggest that the industry had a deep understanding of climate change as far back as 60 years ago. According to Carroll Muffett, the environmental law center's director, Exxon's predecessor, Humble Oil, was aware of rising CO2 levels and the potential for global warming as early as 1957. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies, and other organizations formed a group called the Smoke and Fumes Committee to monitor pollution research and use science to undermine environmental regulations. Muffett believes that this committee's actions would be echoed in later efforts to discredit climate science. The Center for International Environmental Law's work was first reported by Inside Climate News, which has previously published stories suggesting that Exxon Mobil understood the risks of climate change from its own research and used that knowledge to plan activities such as Arctic drilling. Exxon Mobil's own research also funded climate denial groups until the mid-2000s. The investigations have led to a surge in activism against the company and the energy industry, with the hashtag #exxonknew. Attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, have demanded information from Exxon about its internal research and funding of climate denial. Inside Climate News announced that its article on Wednesday is the first in a series based on the environmental law center's work and documents. Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers dismissed the new allegations as absurd. Exxon Mobil is pushing back against an investigation into its knowledge of climate change, claiming that the inquiry is not credible. The company is being investigated by four attorneys general, including Claude Earl Walker, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islands, who is working with a private law firm. Exxon Mobil filed a response in Texas, accusing Walker and his team of misusing their power and violating the company's constitutional rights. The company argues that it has no physical presence in the Virgin Islands and therefore is not subject to the jurisdiction of the island's courts.",

In my latest book, \"Educating a Diverse Nation\" (Harvard University Press), co-authored with Clifton Conrad, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we outline the lessons from MSIs that all faculty members can apply to their teaching practices. These institutions assume students' potential for success, rather than viewing students of color through a deficit lens. They also teach in a way that focuses on students' needs, rather than the professor's convenience.

For some, this may be accompanied by other sensations: a sudden pain in the back, a kick in the lower abdomen, or an urgent need to use the restroom. These symptoms are reminiscent of those experienced by individuals who have passed a kidney stone, a condition that may surprisingly be triggered by certain roller coasters, according to a new study. Researchers created a silicone cast of the inside of a kidney to study the effects of roller coasters on kidney stones. The study found that moderate-intensity, rattling roller coasters may dislodge small kidney stones in the outer ducts of the kidney and propel them towards the ureter, a tube connecting the kidneys and bladder. The study suggests that riding these roller coasters could be a potential treatment for patients with kidney stones five millimeters or less in diameter. Dr. David Wartinger, a professor emeritus, was inspired to conduct the study after treating multiple patients who had passed kidney stones after visiting an amusement park. A patient in particular stood out, who passed kidney stones after each of three consecutive rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Disney World. Dr. Wartinger and Dr. Marc Mitchell created a 3D-printed silicone cast of a patient's kidney, filled it with kidney stones and urine, and rode the roller coaster 20 times, observing the movement of the kidney stones. A recent study found that the back of a roller coaster is a more effective spot to dislodge a small kidney stone, with a success rate of 64% compared to 17% at the front. Each year, over 300,000 Americans seek emergency care for kidney stones, often due to severe pain caused by a large stone lodged in their ureter. However, it's unlikely that a roller coaster ride would provide relief for those with larger stones.

If you're aware of having a small kidney stone and are interested in trying the roller coaster method, it's recommended that you consult with your urologist.

After a seven-month search, Gray successfully raised $1.3 million by applying for and reusing essays on leadership and community service, while avoiding scams. During his time at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Gray turned his experience into a social enterprise, developing an app called Scholly that matches students with personalized lists of scholarships. Scholly quickly rose to the top of the iOS App Store after Gray pitched it on \"Shark Tank.\" In just three years, Scholly has been downloaded over a million times and has helped students secure more than $50 million in scholarships. Now 25, Gray has been recognized as one of Forbes's \"30 Under 30\" and Oprah Winfrey's \"SuperSoul 100.\" Gray initially felt the need to leave his hometown to pursue a career in technology entrepreneurship. He wanted to break the cycle of poverty and create a better life for his younger brother and sister. Gray's success has been both surreal and emotional, as he has been able to achieve his goal of helping a large number of people. Initially, Gray's goal was not to become a billionaire, but rather to make a positive impact on his community. During his time at Drexel, Gray was surrounded by students from diverse backgrounds, including those from affluent families who still required financial assistance.",

The Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, where chemicals like DDT and Agent Orange were once produced, has contaminated the surrounding waterways, allowing toxic substances to seep into aquatic animals' bodies. Despite the toxic environment, some aquatic animals have miraculously survived, including the Atlantic killifish, a small, silver fish that has adapted to thrive in this polluted ecosystem. According to a recent study published in Science, the killifish's ability to survive in polluted waters is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation. Researchers first discovered the fish's tolerance to toxic waters in the late 1990s and have since found that distinct populations of killifish have independently developed similar genetic adaptations to survive in highly polluted areas along the Atlantic coastline. The new study reveals that evolution can occur independently in different populations and that similar genetic changes can emerge in response to extreme environments. According to Diane Nacci, a biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency, the study provides a valuable example of how animals can adapt to rapidly changing environments. The researchers, led by Noah Reid, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Connecticut, compared the genomes of 384 killifish from polluted and less-polluted areas, finding that a single genetic pathway was responsible for the pollution tolerance in all regions, although with slightly different patterns of genetic changes in each population.",

The boat will take you just offshore, and you'll dive in to witness the breathtaking sight of \"fish clouds\" above. For the best view, consider an early morning dive, but the sardines are present daily. Unlike the famous sardines in South Africa, the Philippine sardines are a year-round attraction. The sardines' unique schooling behavior, known as a \"bait ball,\" may confuse predators and help them survive. However, it's not foolproof, as a 2010 video showed a thresher shark using its tail to stun and devour the sardines. The sardines' presence near Cebu's beaches remains a mystery, as they were previously unknown in the area until recently. According to Dr. Oliver, the science on the populations of these fish is lacking, and it's unclear why they've emerged in such numbers. The sardines may not be permanent residents, but Dr. Oliver believes they've found a niche in the area. It's possible that a small number of eggs drifted into the waters and thrived due to the presence of few predators and ideal conditions. The sardines seem to migrate between locations, such as Pescador Island and Moalboal's shores. If this setup were to change, they may disappear for good.",

The strategic objective of Panther, Jay Z's company, is to expand globally and scale up Aspiro's platform, technology, and services. Jay Z's interest in Aspiro may be driven by his desire to tap into the niche market of high-fidelity digital music. Aspiro's WiMP and Tidal services, available in a few European countries and the US, respectively, offer lossless audio formats that are significantly higher in quality than those of Spotify and most other streaming services.

Its nasal horn was longer than Triceratops', and it featured two small horns above its eyes. A striking feature was a radiating frill, comprising large, pentagonal plates resembling a crown, situated atop its head. Researchers at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Canada have named their discovery Regaliceratops peterhewsi. The team initially stumbled upon the fossilized remains protruding from a cliff along the Oldman River in southeastern Alberta about a decade ago. Like other horned dinosaurs, Regaliceratops likely evolved during the late Cretaceous period, spanning from 65 million to 100 million years ago. The nearly complete skull of Regaliceratops has been described in the latest issue of the journal Current Biology.",

This decision follows a 2010 petition filed by Jane Goodall, The Humane Society of the United States, and other organizations to eliminate the distinction between captive and wild chimpanzees. Under the new classification, captive chimpanzees in the US will receive the same protections as their wild counterparts. The new regulations necessitate permits for biomedical research, interstate trade, and the export and import of captive chimpanzees, issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The changes will take effect on September 14, following a 90-day grace period that begins on June 16. However, the regulations do not require permits for private ownership or use of chimpanzees in the entertainment industry, according to Dan Ashe, director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Ashe explained that the previous distinction conveyed a mixed message to the public, implying that chimpanzees were not in urgent need of conservation efforts.",

For example, some campus debit cards impose extra fees when students use their PINs to make purchases, unlike traditional checking accounts. Furthermore, some accounts may charge steep overdraft fees for debit transactions, as reported by the Center for Responsible Lending in a recent study. To sidestep these fees, students must carefully review their account terms and use it in a way that minimizes expenses. Always read the fine print, advises Meredith Turner, chief governmental officer with the California State Student Association. While adjusting to campus life can be overwhelming, students should take a few minutes to familiarize themselves with their bank accounts' rules. Take the time to set yourself up for financial success while in school, Turner suggests. To avoid an account with excessive fees, students should ideally consider their financial aid options and manage their personal funds before arriving on campus. If you already have a bank account, have your financial aid directly deposited into it, she recommends. According to estimates from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, more than half of new college students already have a bank account.",

According to Jesse Slome, women typically account for approximately two-thirds of long-term-care insurance claims paid annually. Last year, insurance companies paid out $7.5 billion in claims. As a result, women will now pay several hundred dollars more per year in long-term-care premiums compared to men. Women will pay an average of $1,225 per year for a policy providing $164,000 in current benefits without inflation protection, while men will pay $925. The difference is even greater if you opt for a policy with 3% annual inflation protection, compounded annually. The association found that a typical single woman will pay an average of 12% more than in 2013. Couples who buy a policy together may experience varying premium increases depending on the insurer. Genworth noted that its gender-specific pricing only applies to single policies. Insurers typically offer significant couples discounts, and the average premium for couples with inflation protection has risen by about 3% from last year. When considering long-term care insurance, it's essential to explore ways to secure the lowest premium possible. Consumers should shop around as premiums for similar coverage can differ significantly among insurance providers. Insurance broker Rose Clayton recommends that women keep the additional premium cost in perspective. While clients may initially be disappointed to learn that women pay a higher premium, it's not a deal-breaker. Instead, it serves as a reminder to plan for their golden years. A visit to a nursing home or assisted living facility can starkly illustrate the impact of women's longer lifespan.",

These laws were a condition of Education Department waivers from the No Child Left Behind law, which governs how states receive federal education funding.

The accord, aiming to eliminate most tariffs over the next few years, was signed in Beijing during a state visit by Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir. The two economies, with Iceland's GDP of $14 billion and China's GDP of $7.3 trillion, are vastly mismatched, with trade between the countries being relatively small, totaling $402 million in 2011. While Iceland cannot offer significant new market growth, it could help China gain more influence in the Arctic region, which is becoming increasingly accessible due to global warming and polar ice retreat. China is seeking to join the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body promoting cooperation in the region, as a permanent observer. Iceland, a member of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area, will not grant China backdoor access to the European market through this trade deal. The country had been negotiating EU membership but suspended talks in January due to domestic opposition. If Iceland were to join the EU, it would have to terminate its bilateral trade deals, according to the EU trade commissioner's spokesman. The two governments also issued a joint statement calling for cooperation on human rights, gender equality, labor issues, Arctic affairs, geothermal development, culture, education, and tourism.

Just a few months ago, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.5 percent, near a historic low.

This week, authorities announced that four executives of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation are under investigation. According to the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of China, three oil executives - Li Hualin, a deputy general manager of China National Petroleum; Ran Xinquan, a vice president of PetroChina; and Wang Daofu, the chief geologist of PetroChina - are suspected of serious disciplinary violations and are currently undergoing investigation by an anti-corruption agency. PetroChina confirmed that the three executives were under investigation and had resigned due to personal reasons. A day earlier, authorities announced an investigation into Wang Yongchun, a deputy general manager of China National Petroleum, for suspected disciplinary violations. The investigations suggest that the Communist Party's efforts to combat corruption extend beyond the government to powerful state-dominated industries.

The government will not require additional one-time austerity measures in the 2014 budget, which will be presented this month. The budget will be based on an improved forecast for 2014, with projected growth and unemployment rates that are more optimistic than previously expected. Spain's economy has been in a state of recession since the construction bubble burst in 2008, but 2014 is expected to mark the beginning of a recovery. The European Commission granted Spain more time to meet its budgetary targets in May, given the severity of the recession. Spain's deficit is expected to fall to 6.5% of gross domestic product in 2014, down from 7% in 2013 and the initial target of 4.5%.",

If you and your spouse reside in a state where same-sex marriage is recognized, the application process should be straightforward. However, an unresolved question remains regarding couples who were legally married in one state but relocated to another state that does not recognize gay marriage. The Social Security Administration uses a \"place of residence\" standard to determine spousal benefits. The agency has instructed its staff to accept and hold applications pending further legal clarification. We're awaiting guidance, and we're hopeful, said Susan Sommer. The agency is also holding other types of applications pending further clarification. Notably, Mary Bonauto expressed encouragement regarding the case of 83-year-old Herb Burtis. Burtis had applied for survivor benefits after his husband's death in 2008. Although his initial claim was denied, he became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, and is now receiving the extra payment. Bonauto stated that there is every reason to expect that the agency will eventually process and pay survivor benefits to other eligible same-sex applicants. To qualify for spousal retirement benefits, you typically need to be at least 62 years old and have been married for at least 12 months. For the survivor's benefit, you must be at least 60 years old and have been married for at least nine months. If you meet the age and duration requirements, Bonauto recommends applying for benefits, despite any uncertainties. You can apply for spousal retirement benefits online at www.ssa.gov. However, you will need to visit a local Social Security office to apply for survivor's benefits; be sure to schedule an appointment in advance. GLAD suggests bringing a copy of your marriage license, civil union certificate, or domestic partnership certificate, as well as a copy of your spouse's death certificate, to your office visit. If you have questions, you can contact the regional communications director for your state, whose contact information is listed on the Social Security website.",

The fortunes of new tech graduates and retiring lawyers fluctuate, but those with considerable capital, essentially the already wealthy, have fared well during the economic recovery. According to economists, the 1% tends to be resilient, particularly during bad times. A study by Treasury economists found that a quarter to a third of individuals in the 1% in a given year remained in that bracket for the following five years. As a result, the profile of wealth in the United States has remained relatively unchanged before and after the recession. The typical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white, and male, said Mr. Friedman. Warren E. Buffett exemplifies this profile, with his net worth increasing by approximately $10 billion over the past year due to his cash reserves and appetite for acquisitions. The tech industry has created hundreds of new top earners, mostly men, although often younger. David Duffield of Workday and Elon Musk of Tesla, among others, have benefited from the tech boom. Meanwhile, fields like finance, medicine, and energy continue to generate significant wealth, with financiers and business owners dominating the ultra-high-net-worth category. Three interconnected economic phenomena - stocks, houses, and loans - have driven the boomerang effect among the country's top earners, economists said. The rich suffered significant losses when the markets plummeted in 2008 and 2009, but those who held on or invested after then have been rewarded. The recent market gains have boosted the earnings and net worth of Americans who own stocks, primarily through vehicles such as mutual funds. However, the wealthy have benefited significantly more. According to Edward Wolff, a New York University economist, the top 10% of households hold more than 80% of the value of stocks, either directly or through investments like mutual funds. In addition to capital gains from selling their shares, shareholders have also benefited from the surge in dividend payments. Many companies paid out large dividends, totaling around $260 billion, before taxes on unearned income increased in January. Another factor contributing to the wealth gap is housing. Wealthier Americans tend to have a smaller portion of their net worth tied up in their homes, so the nationwide decline in housing prices had a less significant impact on them. However, after prices dropped and credit markets relaxed, many of them were able to purchase homes as investments.",

In response, businesses have scaled back their spending on capital investments, such as computers, delivery trucks, and equipment, likely due to concerns over higher tax rates and government cutbacks. However, some economists believe that businesses will increase spending if Congress provides clarity on fiscal policy, reducing the risk of severe tightening. Businesses must have a list of projects they'd like to pursue, but have been delaying due to uncertainty. Once they have a clearer understanding of the future, including tax rates, they'll be able to revive those plans and implement them. Improved access to credit can make capital expenditures more attractive and accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been increasing in recent months, and the share of small business owners struggling to meet their credit needs has been declining. Corporate profits reached a record high in the third quarter, adjusted for inflation, and companies have accumulated significant cash reserves that can be used to invest in equipment or hire staff if they feel confident about the recovery. In contrast, consumers are still not financially flush, particularly since their disposable income has been stagnant or declining in recent months. However, consumers have made significant progress in reducing their debt, either by paying it down or having it written off through default, and they are also feeling more affluent due to the stabilization of the housing market. The country has finally cleared the excess housing inventory from the bubble years, and housing prices and construction are now on the rise. The pace of household formation is increasing, as young adults are finally moving into their own homes, as well as other Americans who had previously lived with family or friends.
