Prior to his current role, he was a director of leisure services at British Airways and has experience in the travel industry. However, he lacks experience in television, except for watching Richard Branson sell Virgin Mobile to NTL and overseeing the sale of LoveFilm to Amazon. He excels at selling companies, not producing TV content. Ofcom and Downing Street have endorsed Gurassa's appointment, replacing a chairman who was a late convert to the Awkward Squad. It's possible that David Cameron will follow a similar precedent when selecting a new BBC chairman.

The recent stock market rally, triggered by the Bank of Japan's interest rate cut, has brought relief to many in the financial sector. Oil prices, which plummeted to $27 a barrel just two weeks ago, have risen to $34. Investors are concerned that governments and central banks have yet to grasp the true extent of global economic fragility. The situation is precarious, with China's private debt levels reaching alarming heights, Europe's banking system still reeling from bad debts, and consumers worldwide exhibiting nervous behavior. Central banks' mixed signals have investors on edge, as they acknowledge the importance of cheap money, but also suggest the world is recovering. The recent reaction to the US Federal Reserve's smallest possible interest rate hike sent American consumers scrambling to stash their savings. New car sales declined in December, and consumer sentiment dipped in January, following a weak fourth quarter. The Fed noted that even a small rate hike would likely be ignored by US consumers, who are resilient. The Bank of Japan's interest rate cut is another sign of global economic weakness. Tokyo aims to generate domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and has introduced a negative interest rate to deter foreign funds and encourage domestic spending. The move has had the desired effect, with the yen falling against the dollar. We'll need to wait and see how this affects domestic demand. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has put aside its hopes of following the Fed's lead. Governor Mark Carney's recent speeches suggest a more cautious tone. Given the Federal Reserve's potential struggles to increase interest rates, it's unlikely that the UK would consider a rate hike. A rate hike would cause the pound to surge, making exports uncompetitive and leaving domestic businesses vulnerable to cheap imports. Carney is aware that the recent closure of the Scunthorpe steel plant is just the beginning of potential consequences.",

EDF directors had been set to meet this week to approve a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, but a final decision has been pending since October. China's state nuclear firm CGN agreed to take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping. EDF executives have delayed a final decision due to funding issues, according to French financial journal Les Echos. The company is reportedly seeking help from the French government to find new backers to join the project alongside CGN. Although directors are scheduled to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, no decision is expected until the next meeting, which will take place before the release of final results on February 15. EDF has declined to comment on the matter. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, and the UK government has faced criticism for agreeing to pay EDF £92.50 per unit of electricity, more than double the market rate. A group of EDF employee-shareholders has urged the company to abandon the Hinkley project, citing concerns that it could put the company's survival at risk. Green campaigners argue that any fresh delay highlights the flaws in a deal intended to kickstart a new generation of nuclear power in the UK. The EDF board is clearly rattled by this crucial investment decision, said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace. This delay could signal the end of Hinkley. EDF managers and employee representatives on the board are concerned that the project is too risky and too expensive.

The company's appeal comes amid declining share prices and job cuts in its zinc production operations worldwide. Glencore is challenging a 2015 decision by then-acting treasurer Mathias Cormann, who declined to declare the port's fees as excessive. If successful, the appeal would allow Glencore to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration, potentially leading to lower port fees. The tribunal battle will focus on technical issues related to competition laws and the impact of privatization and price increases. Glencore argues that the port's unconstrained pricing and monopoly over access create uncertainty for coal producers and acquirers in the Hunter Valley. The company claims the port's monopoly power will significantly impact coal producers' profit margins. The Australian government has yet to respond to Glencore's application. The case will test the limited types of review available to the Australian Competition Tribunal in \"access\" cases.

Thomas and Baker contend that the BBC is a \"public service\" broadcaster, but its current ownership and accountability structure is unclear. They propose mutualizing the BBC, which would give licence fee payers a direct say in the organization's governance and address the ownership deficit. As members, they would elect representatives to hold the executive management accountable for their actions and decide key issues like executive compensation and resource allocation at an open Annual General Meeting.

Hispanic people comprised just 4% of employees in 2015, compared to 17.4% of the US population. The obstacles to diversity in the media industry include inexperience, unpaid internships, and a lack of social capital. A new lawsuit against the New York Times cites a 2014 study, which found that reporters were 3.5 times more likely to cite men as sources than women.

This unusual warmth serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of climate change. The country has consistently broken temperature records, with February setting a new record and March shattering that record shortly after. In fact, March 2016 was the warmest March on record in Australia. The Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook predicts above-average temperatures to persist across the country until at least May.\n\nClimate scientist David Karoly at the University of Melbourne notes that climate change has increased the likelihood of March breaking temperature records in Australia by at least seven times. \"The previous record had a one in 43-year chance of occurring naturally, but now it happens about once every six years due to human-induced climate change,\" Karoly said. \"This is evidence that climate change is already happening and escalating the risks of extreme heat.\"\n\nBlair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology states that while April may not set a new record, it will still be significantly warmer than normal. Throughout May, there is an 80% chance that temperatures across most of the country will be warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. By June and July, coastal regions will continue to experience unusually warm weather, but temperatures will return to normal in central and southern Australia.\n\nThe current warm spell is partly due to the massive El Niño event that occurred in 2015, which spread warm water across the Pacific Ocean. However, this is happening on top of the backdrop of global warming, Trewin said. In an El Niño year, the world tends to experience extreme temperatures, while in other years, temperatures are merely above average. \"La Niña events were typically followed by normal or slightly cool global temperatures.\"",

Led by former National Highway Traffic Administration administrator David Strickland, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets aims to bring autonomous vehicles to US roads nationwide. The coalition claims that self-driving cars will reduce crashes by 94%, as human error causes most accidents. However, experts warn that tech companies may gain legal protection over car owners in the event of a crash. This could pose a challenge for personal injury lawyers, who are already concerned about the technology. Accident lawyer Daniel Vega fears that the lobbying group may unfairly protect tech companies and app makers over human car owners, leaving drivers responsible for accidents. Statistician Susan Paddock notes that testing self-driving cars is challenging, and consumers must become comfortable with uncertainty before adopting the technology. Paddock emphasizes that even if autonomous vehicle fleets travel 10 million miles, it's impossible to draw statistically significant conclusions about their safety and reliability. Strickland stresses that the coalition's goal is to establish a single, national policy for self-driving cars, rather than navigating state regulations. The widespread adoption of self-driving vehicle technology will undoubtedly lead to safer and less congested roadways in America. To facilitate deployment, a clear, federal framework is essential, and the Coalition will work with policymakers to identify effective solutions.",

The total lending figure of £17.1 billion marked a 64% increase from the same period last year, the highest figure since April 2008. In a hurry to beat the deadline, buyers hastily closed property deals, while existing homeowners also surged, driven by the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. The average mortgage loan size reached a record high of £184,200, surpassing the previous peak of £158,000 in April 2008. However, the lending figures reveal an increasingly imbalanced financial landscape, with borrowing by manufacturers plummeting while buy-to-let speculation has soared. Lending to manufacturing companies, which had been growing at an annual rate of 12% in 2014, has come to a standstill, while construction lending is also declining.

A successful northern powerhouse demands stronger, more productive cities, and the government's initiative has the potential to significantly impact the north-south divide.

As Docubyte, he developed a fascination with retro computers, creating a project to celebrate their uniqueness. He notes that hands-on interaction is rare today, as most computers have transitioned to touch screens. Ball believes pre-Apple era computers are often overlooked as design pieces, and his nostalgia for their aesthetic led him to photograph a range of machines from the latter half of the 20th century. He found the machines at the Science Museum in London, the Dresden Technical Collections, and the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, then meticulously enhanced the images with his colleagues at INK studio to make them appear modern. The retouching is essential to the piece. The series showcases striking machines like the Harwell Dekatron, the world's oldest functioning computer, and the Control Data 6600, often referred to as the first \"supercomputer.\" Ball says the machines look attractive, but he'd also like to create a comprehensive book about computing history. With a hint of poignancy, he notes each image, rendered as a jpeg, is approximately 5mb in size – larger than any file the individual computers could handle. They're lovely in their outdatedness.\n\nThose old things are charmingly outdated, he notes with a touch of understatement. In a restrained and unassuming manner, they possess a certain beauty in their obsolescence.",

The Commons work and pensions select committee will launch a comprehensive inquiry into the issue, likely to begin in the autumn. The spotlight has fallen on workers' occupational pensions due to BHS's collapse and Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result of the collapse. The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain's largest defined benefit plans, is facing cuts to facilitate a sale. The scheme has liabilities of almost £15 billion and a deficit of £700 million. The chair of the committee stated that the British Steel pension scheme's troubles are evidence of a broader threat to occupational pension schemes. The committee's case study on BHS is highlighting how such schemes are struggling due to rising life expectancy and record-low returns on capital. \"Pension law and regulation must adapt to the issues of the future, rather than the problems of the past,\" the chair said. \"We should not be under any illusions that British Steel is a special case. The entire savings edifice is at risk.\" The Labour MP noted that 11 million workers have private defined benefit pensions, but more than 5,000 of the associated pension schemes are in deficit, with a total shortfall of £805 billion. \"This will be a major inquiry that will consider radical solutions to one of the great problems of our time,\" he added. The committee will present a unique and free theatrical experience in London, featuring interviews with senior BHS executives and Dominic Chappell, and Sir Phillip Green will appear a week later.",

HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint advised bankers to be cautious in making demands following the Brexit vote, which he described as a rejection of the \"expert class.\" Flint noted that the financial system's resilience was evident this week, as markets functioned smoothly despite a significant surge in trading volumes. Following the recent Brexit vote, Harriett Baldwin, a junior finance minister, sought to reassure the City of London by highlighting that banks maintain substantial reserves and the Bank of England is prepared to take action if needed. Baldwin stated that financial markets are capable of withstanding challenges, adapting quickly, and finding new opportunities.

CEO Wilf Walsh expressed caution over the referendum's impact on consumer confidence, citing challenging trading conditions. Despite reporting a 33% increase in underlying profits, the company's shares dropped to 216.88p before recovering to 225p. Carpetright's new financial year got off to a poor start, with UK like-for-like sales declining 7.6% in May before rebounding to a 6.3% increase in June. According to Walsh, the current atmosphere is unusual, with consumers not behaving predictably. It's too early to gauge the full impact of the referendum on the company. Walsh has been working to revamp the retailer, introducing a new store design and customer service improvements. Research shows only 50% of surveyed customers would consider shopping at Carpetright. This year, the company will invest £10 million in refurbishing 100 stores and introducing a new staff uniform. Carpetright has also expanded its product range to include hard flooring, which has proven popular. Carpetright still has a long way to go in its transformation, but we're clear on our direction and confident in our plans, said Walsh. The UK's EU exit will likely increase Carpetright's sourcing costs, as 75% of its materials come from mainland Europe.

Asda's sales dropped by 5.9%, its worst performance on record, while Tesco's sales fell by 1.3%, the best performance among major chains. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to thrive, with sales increasing by 11.5% and 13.8%, respectively, and their combined market share reaching a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is poised to surpass the Co-op and become the UK's fifth-largest supermarket. The latest figures do not include the period following the referendum, but analysts believe the decision to leave the EU will likely bolster discounters further. The immediate economic uncertainty is unlikely to cause a significant drop in grocery volumes, but may lead to higher prices and increased demand for discounters. Major supermarkets may benefit from a rise in prices, which have dropped by 1.4% over the three-month period. Store closures contributed to the decline in sales at Tesco and Morrisons, as the companies adjust to changing shopper habits. Supermarket sales experienced a surge in the four weeks leading up to June 18, driven by a boost in sales of snacks, beverages, and gourmet items during the Euro 2016 tournament. Beer, wine, and spirits sales jumped 6.2% year-over-year during this period, while crisp and snack sales rose 4.2%, marking the industry's first monthly sales increase in nearly a year.

The Confederation of British Industry's report reveals a significant drop in the balance of retailers reporting sales increases minus those reporting decreases. While some retailers experienced a surge, others reported slower growth or declines. Retailers anticipate a sales boost in July, with the balance expected to shift to -10% from -5% in June. The CBI noted that retail sales reported weak growth in the year to June, exceeding expectations of a modest decline. Orders placed with suppliers decreased in June, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month. Internet sales growth slowed in the year to June, falling below the long-run average, but is expected to rebound strongly in July. The survey suggests that consumers were cautious in their spending before the EU referendum, but did not completely abstain. The question now is how well or poorly retail sales will perform in July following the UK's vote to leave the EU. After the Brexit vote, consumer spending will likely be heavily impacted due to increased uncertainty, potentially higher unemployment, and reduced purchasing power. A separate report from Lloyds Bank found that consumer spending on essential items decreased again in May, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.

The company plans to achieve this by opening 25 new restaurants, extending operating hours, and introducing new services. Business Secretary Greg Clark welcomed the announcement as \"excellent news for the UK economy.\"\n\nDespite uncertainty surrounding the UK's EU exit, McDonald's is pressing ahead with its expansion plans. The company's CEO emphasized that all new jobs will be permanent, comprising a mix of full-time and part-time positions. McDonald's has faced criticism for its use of zero-hours contracts, but is now offering staff the option to switch to fixed-hours contracts.\n\nThe company's decision to revamp its employment policy was driven by feedback from workers, who reported difficulties in securing loans, mortgages, and mobile phone contracts due to employment status uncertainty. The CEO stated that the company considered delaying its expansion plans after the EU referendum, but has instead chosen to accelerate its growth.\n\nThe CEO drew parallels with the last recession, saying that he has learned a great deal from it and is now focused on positioning McDonald's as a \"premier employer\" in the UK. The company's decision to create new jobs and expand its operations is seen as a vote of confidence in the UK economy and a demonstration of its commitment to the country.\n\nAs CEO, my role has become slightly more demanding, but it was already a challenging job. McDonald's employs over 110,000 people in the UK and has added more than 15,000 to its workforce in the past five years, making the recent expansion plans a significant acceleration of our growth.",

Italy's stagnant economy has been marked by slow growth, declining competitiveness, and high unemployment for over two decades. As a result, non-performing loans have ballooned to €360 billion, equivalent to 18% of all outstanding loans, severely impacting Italian banks. Non-performing loans are a symptom of the problem, not its cause. Unlike Greece, Ireland, and Spain, Italy did not experience a significant economic boom before the 2008-09 financial crisis, and its performance has consistently been underwhelming. As a result, the economy is 10% smaller than it was before the crisis, and unemployment is high, particularly in southern Italy. Before joining the euro, Italy could have boosted its competitiveness by devaluing the lira, but this option is no longer available. This creates a significant risk: a European slowdown following Brexit, combined with Italy's already weak economy, could lead to bank failures and small investors being forced to absorb losses. If the Five Star Movement, which has pledged to hold a referendum on leaving the euro, were to come to power, the possibility of Quitaly cannot be ruled out. In the event of a Quitaly, the single currency would likely collapse.",

The report reveals that 12% of agents have reported a decline in asking rents over the past 10 days. While the rental market has responded calmly to Brexit so far, the organization cautions that continued uncertainty could lead to turbulence in the coming months. David Cox, managing director of Arla, emphasizes the need for the new government to prioritize housing and the rental market, citing concerns that a lack of certainty could lead to institutional investors pulling out of the market, ultimately impacting tenants by reducing supply and increasing rents.\n\nThe report finds that almost 36% of Arla members have reported a reduction or no change in the number of prospective tenants looking for properties. Notably, overall supply and demand for rental accommodation increased in June, with prospective tenants seeing a 12% average increase and properties on agents' books rising by an average of 3%. Cox notes that supply and demand remain a significant issue in the rental market. If supply continues to dwindle against growing demand, renting will become more difficult and expensive for tenants, regardless of the eventual implications of Brexit.\n\nA report by the Taxpayer's Alliance recommends slashing stamp duty on homes by half and eventually eliminating it altogether. The report argues that the current tax is exacerbating supply shortages and driving up rents for tenants. Specifically, it suggests abolishing the 3% surcharge on buy-to-let and additional homes, warning that investors will likely pass on the costs to tenants, further increasing rents.",

In 2015, there were 6,700 applications for new retail developments, a drop from 7,360 the previous year. This represents a nearly 50% decline from the 11,900 applications in 2008, prior to the recession. The report highlights the ongoing struggles faced by shopkeepers as consumers increasingly turn to online shopping. Despite efforts to expand their online presence, many traditional retailers struggle to keep pace with online-only brands. The report suggests that Brexit uncertainty could exacerbate these challenges, with potential negative impacts on the UK economy. According to Aimee Barrable of EMW, the success of online retailers has led to a decreased appetite for new shop openings. Many retailers instead develop online services or repurpose existing space. Recent high-profile closures could lead to increased retail space, attracting retailers seeking high street presence. Some retailers may delay new shop developments until the Brexit vote's economic impact becomes clearer. Last week's retail sales statistics revealed a 0.9% decline between May and June, exceeding economists' 0.6% expectation. The decline was partly attributed to inclement weather, but also hints at Brexit's impact on consumer spending.",

The firm received a severe reprimand and must pay £750,000 towards the FRC's costs. The fine was reduced from £3.5 million after mitigation and a settlement discount. PwC admitted its conduct fell short of expected standards in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC stated PwC had insufficient audit evidence regarding the loan loss provision and failed to identify inadequate disclosure of the impairment policy. The watchdog said the disclosures were not in compliance with accountancy rules. PwC acknowledged certain aspects of its 2007 audit did not meet expected standards. Audit quality is a top priority for PwC, and the FRC's annual audit quality assessments have shown a trend of improvement. The substantial fines imposed reflect the seriousness of the audit failings and will send a strong signal to the audit community. PwC and its audit engagement partner, Simon Bradburn, were sued by Cattles, which alleged PwC acted negligently in their auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis. Cattles claimed the loan book of Welcome was weaker than stated in PwC's audit. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of creditors to Cattles, which lent to people with poor credit histories and entered into a financial restructuring scheme in 2011.

Analysts are revising their growth forecasts for the third quarter, ranging from 0.4% to 0.5%. The upward revision to growth in the second quarter has boosted hopes of avoiding a recession. Prior to the Brexit vote, the economy had significant momentum, and while it will likely slow in the second half of 2016, it will not experience two consecutive quarters of declining output. The government received less welcome news, as the UK's balance of payments deficit widened to 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016. The deterioration in the UK's trade performance was the primary driver of this increase, highlighting the imbalance in the economy. In essence, domestic producers are struggling to meet consumer demand. The post-Brexit decline in the value of sterling will make exports more competitive, but it will also curb consumer spending by making imports more expensive. Turning around the balance of payments will be a significant challenge, regardless of the outcome of the referendum. The Bank of England may reconsider cutting interest rates again in November, given the economy's resilience in the face of Brexit. The current interest rate of 0.25% is already at a record low, and the bank may be hesitant to reduce it further. The Bank of England may choose to conserve its resources for future use, allowing Chancellor Philip Hammond to take the lead. Despite the recent positive growth news, stimulus measures in the autumn statement still seem likely. This is because the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote is likely to have a more significant impact on long-term business decisions rather than consumer spending. Hammond would be wise to temporarily pause deficit reduction during the two-year Brexit negotiation period, using the extra £30 billion to fund public investment. This approach would have a double benefit: it would help maintain economic growth and ensure that growth is more balanced.",

He believes the BBC and National Health Service should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups. Simpson's strongest criticism was reserved for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, whom he accused of being involved in the Hutton affair and colluding with Rupert Murdoch. \"It's astonishing to see the British prime minister cozying up to someone who has no interest in Britain, is deeply opposed to Britain, and is hostile to the country's main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. He believes most governments he has worked with over his 50-year career at the BBC have a \"disgraceful political obsession\" to cut down the BBC. \"I'm not saying that cuts can't be made, but it's the brutality and ideological fervor with which they're implemented that's disturbing,\" he said. Simpson also criticized the government's decision to keep the BBC underfunded since 2010, saying it's \"absolutely disgraceful.\" He expressed his disapproval of the draft BBC charter, which requires the corporation to reveal the salaries of staff earning over £150,000, saying it's just a way for the government to demonstrate its control. Simpson, still recovering from a kidney failure episode caused by a reaction to eating kedgeree, made these comments. He criticized the BBC's treatment of staff, saying it's acceptable for those at the top but harsh for junior employees. After a brief holiday, Simpson will begin filming a Panorama special, visiting troubled regions like the Congo. Initially, he planned a short series but BBC commissioners rejected it, citing a preference for celebrity-focused content. Simpson's latest book, We Chose to Speak of War and Strife, honors the foreign correspondents of the past, who he believes are a dying breed, affected by financial struggles and technology.",

May praised Carney's efforts to steer the UK economy after Brexit, stating she would support him if he delays his departure until 2021. May's spokesperson emphasized the Prime Minister's consistent admiration for Carney's work and her willingness to support him staying on beyond his initial term. The spokesperson also highlighted May's good working relationship with Carney, intending to continue it. Carney will make a decision on his future plans before the end of the year, emphasizing the need to resolve the matter beforehand. His next public appearance will be at a press conference on Thursday to discuss the Bank's quarterly inflation report. May's recent comments at the Conservative party conference sparked speculation about a rift between Downing Street and the Bank, but No 10 apologized to Carney, insisting the remarks weren't intended to convey a lack of confidence in his leadership. Despite this, senior Conservatives have launched strong attacks on the Bank's monetary policy. Carney has been the Bank's Governor since July 2013, initially stating he'd only serve five years. He has been deliberating on whether to stick to his original plan or stay until 2021. Chancellor Philip Hammond has already expressed support for Carney serving a full eight-year term, believing his departure would cause unnecessary turmoil, especially given the pound's recent struggles on the foreign exchange market.",

The British Infrastructure Group claims the time for excuses from mobile network providers is over, citing the unacceptable state of mobile connectivity in some areas. MPs argue it's unacceptable that some parts of the country still have poor mobile coverage, while visitors from abroad can expect better reception due to their networks' national roaming capabilities. The group proposed an amendment to the government's digital economy bill, which would allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that fail to meet targets set in a 2014 agreement. A report found little evidence to suggest the mobile sector will meet its targets to provide coverage to 90% of the UK's geographic area. Shapps said, \"It's astonishing that with a foreign SIM card, you'll get better coverage than with one of the UK's companies.\" MPs also urged customers to be able to terminate their mobile agreements without penalty if their operator fails to provide satisfactory coverage. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport stated that it understands the inconvenience of poor mobile coverage, which is why it has made it mandatory for each mobile network operator to provide coverage to at least 90% of the UK by the end of next year. Mobile phone operators claim they are working diligently to enhance coverage, with an EE spokesperson saying that while the report acknowledges the importance of increased mobile coverage, it neglects the significant advancements in mobile coverage since 2014.",

In contrast, Amazon fell short of predictions due to increased spending ahead of the holiday season, resulting in a 52-cent per share profit that missed analyst predictions of 85 cents per share. Alphabet's revenue reached $32.71 billion, but is expected to reach between $42 billion and $45.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company maintains its dominance in the mobile advertising market, alongside Facebook, driven by robust sales on mobile devices and YouTube. Alphabet plans to repurchase around $7 billion of its Class C stock and saw its shares rise 1.6% in after-hours trading. Google's ad revenue surged 18.1% to $19.82 billion, accounting for 89.1% of its total revenue, with paid clicks increasing 33%. However, the average cost-per-click fell 11%, down from a 7% drop in the previous quarter. Analysts had predicted a 7.9% decline. The decline in cost-per-click is attributed to the shift from desktop to mobile devices, where ad space is limited and cheaper. Google is expected to capture 56.9% of the global search ad revenue market in 2016, with $52.88 billion in revenue. Google's \"Other Revenue\" segment, which includes its cloud business, saw a 38.8% increase, while Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" generated revenue of $197 million but reported an operating loss of $865 million. Alphabet's consolidated revenue increased to $22.45 billion in the third quarter ending September 30, up from $18.68 billion in the same period the previous year.

The RBoS Shareholder Action Group, representing 27,000 retail investors, is warning that other shareholders may settle out of court. The group is eager to take on Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March, seeking to recover losses for thousands of investors who lost money by subscribing to shares during the 2008 RBS rights issue. The announcement comes ahead of RBS's third-quarter results, which will be scrutinized for further provisions related to the case. The total claim by all investors totals £4 billion. The court action is one of many factors that could feature in the bank's results on Friday, when it is expected to report further losses on top of the £52 billion it has already incurred since the bailout. The bank is expected to provide an update on the potential spin-out of 300 branches and face questions about the alleged mistreatment of small-business customers.

It seemed extremely unlikely. According to the article, Pete Burns had revealed a stunning secret just before his fatal heart attack: he had previously been believed to have died, and a priest had been summoned to administer last rites. The alleged revelation came from a haunting final interview conducted weeks before his death, which the Star quoted extensively but has yet to upload to its website. The Wednesday headline was intended to suggest reports of his death had been exaggerated, echoing Mark Twain's famous quote. Moreover, it also displayed poor taste.

A US$300 million deal between Sirius Minerals and Hancock Prospecting has given the project a significant boost. The mine plans to produce up to 20 million tonnes of polyhalite fertilizer annually. Under the deal, Rinehart will acquire $50 million worth of Sirius shares and pay $250 million for a 5% royalty stream on the first 13 million tonnes of fertilizer produced annually. The project aligns with Hancock's focus on agriculture, as it delivers a new and natural product with improved yields in field tests. Sirius has a large, high-quality mineral resource and is located in a stable jurisdiction with a competitive tax rate. The mine shaft, over a mile deep, was approved by a narrow margin after a four-year planning dispute. The project was supported by 93% of local residents who wrote to the council, but faced opposition from several organizations.

The students criticized the entrants for pricing out poorer students and contributing to the \"social cleansing of education\". The panel referenced a 2015 study by the National Union of Students, which found that UK university rent increased by 18% over two years, reaching an average of £146 per week.

The letter emphasized that students cannot celebrate or award a \"for-profit sector\" that is failing many of their peers.\n\nThis development follows a series of university rent strikes and demonstrations coordinated by student activists over the past year. An anonymous student activist argued in a recent blog post that rent strikes are more than just a complaint about rising student housing costs. Rather than being seen as entitled students complaining about paying rent, the activist contends that the real issue is that high rents are preventing poorer students from accessing higher education.

The company's chairman attributed the decline to an \"extreme political, union and media campaign\" against the company. An undercover investigation revealed that Sports Direct workers were being paid below the minimum wage. The company has been compelled to pay £1 million in back wages to employees and provide staff with guaranteed working hours. As a result, Sports Direct's stock price has plummeted by more than half over the past year. The retailer's profit margins have also been significantly impacted by the pound's sharp depreciation following the Brexit vote. Despite the challenges, Sports Direct still maintains a substantial portfolio of brands.",

        "Text": "Jens Weidmann, a European Central Bank policymaker and president of Germany's Bundesbank, has cautioned that a bailout of struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi is not a foregone conclusion. Weidmann advises the Italian government to meticulously weigh the advantages and disadvantages of rescuing the bank if it's facing financial difficulties. He emphasizes that the bank's financial health is pivotal for the planned measures to be effective, and that funds cannot be used to cover anticipated losses. Weidmann stresses that all aspects must be thoroughly examined and that the rules are designed to protect taxpayers and place responsibility on investors. He believes state funds should only be used as a last resort, which is why the bar is set high. Monte dei Paschi's troubles began to escalate after the 2008 banking crisis, when it made a costly acquisition. The deal ultimately contributed to the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Monte dei Paschi's financial woes intensified three years ago, when it sought a €4 billion bailout amid a scandal over derivatives contracts and allegations of fraud. The bank has since returned to the government for funding after talks with private investors fell through. The ECB has taken a firm stance with Monte dei Paschi, refusing to grant the bank extra time to find private investors. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan after the bank failed to secure €5 billion in private investment. The plan involves dipping into a €20 billion fund to prop up the bank. Monte dei Paschi's poor performance in the ECB's \"stress tests\" prompted the government to take action.",

Customers who booked through the website are being told at car rental desks that their booking won't be honored unless they pay again, often hundreds of pounds. Frustrated customers have taken to social media to report the issue. Tom Richards tweeted, \"I'm cancelling my rental car, keeping my money, and being given no other option just two days before I fly home for Christmas. Seriously?\" Chris Clifton-Brown shared his experience online, saying, \"I booked through them recently and when I arrived to collect my car, the hire firm informed me that Atlaschoice is not paying the actual hire firms. I had to pay the hire firm for the car again, even though Atlaschoice had already taken my money.\" Despite being in business since 1990, Atlaschoice did not respond to calls or emails. The website was still operational, but it appears to have stopped taking new bookings. Many customers may have used the booking agent website through TravelSupermarket, a popular travel comparison site. The company also partnered with several other major online travel businesses. The Christmas period is typically one of the busiest for car hire operators, and many customers may be unable to pay for their car hire a second time. TravelSupermarket removed Atlaschoice from its listings three weeks ago, citing missed payments and lack of response. If you booked a car through Atlaschoice, you're advised to contact the car supplier to confirm whether your booking has been paid for and will be honored. You should also reach out to your bank card provider. For credit card users, Section 75 rights will protect them, as the card provider is jointly liable for the booking cost if it exceeds £100. Debit card users may face more difficulty in getting a refund, but they may be eligible for a chargeback scheme. Unfortunately, Atlaschoice did not respond to the Guardian's requests for comment.",

In 2005, I led a Treasury committee inquiry into cash machine fees and discovered that hundreds of local areas faced unfairly high charges. In Speke, a low-income area in Liverpool, consumers were charged £1.50 per cash withdrawal. I established a working group comprising banks, consumer groups, and ATM operators, and the banks committed to maintaining a large network of free cash machines. As a result, a \"financial inclusion premium\" was introduced for operators of free cash machines in 1,500 under-served low-income areas. The importance of the free-to-use ATM network has grown significantly since banks have closed over 1,000 branches in the past two years.

At the company's annual meeting, CEO Ben Magara acknowledged that progress on building homes for its 33,000 employees has been hindered by low platinum prices. The 2012 Marikana massacre, which resulted in 34 deaths, was sparked by a strike by workers demanding a living wage from Lonmin. Former Bishop Johannes Seoka believes Lonmin should take greater responsibility for the tragedy, stating that if the company had engaged with workers, the massacre would not have occurred. Seoka and Amnesty International are urging Lonmin to accelerate its efforts to provide housing for its workers, many of whom live in informal communities without basic amenities. Last year, Lonmin reached a deal with workers to increase the basic monthly pay of rock drill operators to nearly 12,500 South African rand by 2018.

The company, which owns Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, unexpectedly chose not to put its new pay policy to a vote at its annual meeting. The policy would have increased Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m per year by expanding bonus opportunities. Imperial Brands did not expect widespread support from investors, given ISS's recommendation to vote against the policy. The company's chairman, Mark Williamson, stated that investors had changed their minds about supporting the plan. Williamson added that revising the policy is necessary to attract and retain top talent and ensure the company's sustainable growth. David Haines argued that the pay rise was necessary not only for Cooper but also for other executives, as it is significantly below the average for companies of Imperial Brands' size. Critics of high pay saw the move as a warning to company executives against pushing through pay increases, but urged investors to maintain their pressure. This is the first sign that some institutions will be more resistant this year, so it looks like good news. The question remains whether asset managers will continue to actively engage in critical discussions. BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, has signaled a more prominent stance on executive pay.

Mark Carney cautioned that these untested lenders could trigger the next financial crisis if they fail to repay their loans, leaving customers with substantial losses. He also highlighted the risk of cyber-attacks stripping customers of their digital money, leaving them without traditional regulatory protection.\n\nCarney's warning comes after a similar warning from Adair Turner, who cautioned that losses on internet-based loans could make even the worst bankers appear like lending geniuses. Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney noted that digital money could potentially allow millions of people excluded from mainstream banking to access loans securely. However, he emphasized the need for authorities to focus on financial regulations, lending rules, and operational and cyber risks to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nIn the UK, fintech lenders have become increasingly popular, accounting for around 14% of new lending to small and medium-sized businesses last year. These lenders typically offer loans with funds provided directly by investors, similar to securitized loans used by banks before the 2008 financial crisis. Carney cautioned that the rapid growth of online lending could lead to emerging vulnerabilities that regulators would need to address.\n\nThe UK is expected to become a global leader in online lending, putting pressure on the Bank to adopt regulations that protect customers without stifling the industry. The growth of online lending has been hindered by the volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin, which has limited its adoption due to concerns about its value and security. In recent months, Bitcoin's value has rebounded, and the popularity of blockchain electronic wallets has led some analysts to predict a surge in adoption this year.\n\nTraditionally, payment services relied on cash, debit and credit cards, and wire transfers. However, fintech companies are now offering domestic and cross-border payment services on a large scale through digital wallets or prepaid e-money. According to Carney, tech firms take a share of payment revenues and often gain access to the entirety of customer transaction data. In doing so, they are systematically accumulating the kind of customer insights he gained through his daily interactions with customers as a bank teller.",

Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on affordable arbitration has created a major hurdle, as editors argue it would be a final blow to a struggling industry. This poses a litmus test for MPs and ministers, who are uncertain how to proceed. The culture, media, and sport committee has given Ipso, a non-Leveson-compliant regulator, a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. If Ipso fails, recognition will pass to its rival, Impress. The choice between the two schemes is clear: Impress charges £75 upfront for a three- to six-month process, while Ipso offers super-silky barristers for a downpayment of £300, with potentially much more to follow. A key difference is that Impress caps arbitrators' fees at £3,500, regardless of the outcome, and does not charge legal costs if the plaintiff wins. This has raised concerns among local newspapers, who fear financial losses. Ipso, on the other hand, has more flexible costings and obligations, but its fees are higher and less transparent. The question is, can we get hard data to help make a decision? The answer depends on whether the demand for arbitration is as high as its proponents claim. So far, no one has taken advantage of the arbitration option, despite its availability. It may be that ordinary complaints regulation is sufficient, or that no-win-no-fee solicitors have cornered the market. But can't we gather more information before making a decision?

Upon reviewing the paperwork, I discovered that the suit ordered was bright blue, and shirts I hadn't requested had been added. I was told that the faded blue suit was unavailable, the groomsmen's measurements had been lost, and the promised large-order discount had only been applied to one of the eight suits.\n\nI then chose a faded blue Ted Baker suit, which was promised for early March. However, when I rang on March 1st, I was informed that it was unavailable. To make matters worse, they had also ordered the wrong color waistcoats, and the discount had only been applied to three suits. With only four weeks until my wedding, I was left with no idea what was happening with my suit, despite ordering it three months in advance and paying a £340 deposit.\n\nThe saga didn't end there. It took eight days for the Moss Bros press office to respond to my alert, during which time the Ted Baker suit arrived and turned out to be different from the one I had tried on, forcing me to choose yet another option that wouldn't be ready until two days before the wedding. When I lodged a formal complaint via the website, I was told that since the order had been corrected, my complaint was closed. After chasing the issue, the press office finally took action, arranging for the suits to be ready three weeks earlier than agreed and offering to courier replacements if needed.\n\nIn the end, I received a £50 gift card and a bottle of champagne as a token of goodwill for the inconvenience and stress caused. A valuable lesson to take away is to thoroughly review your order form before payment to avoid any potential mistakes.",

Dermot O'Leary paid tribute to London before moving on to Ant and Dec. News and entertainment are distinct services that cannot be easily combined or separated; ranking the worst events is impractical and unnecessary. ITV's attempt to create a daily chat show is understandable, but it's not suitable for the 10pm time slot, where viewers expect current events coverage. The BBC's executive board should not treat the selection process like a Paddy Power betting guide when Tony Hall retires. Charlotte Moore, James Harding, and James Purnell are the top contenders, making it difficult to predict a single winner without compromising the board's decision. As a result, all three candidates are waiting patiently for their chance to shine. However, Anne Bulford and Tim Davie, who transitioned from other roles to become BBC executives, do not have an inherent advantage in the race. This competition is far from over.",

The company initially planned to provide 500 16- to 18-year-olds with a week of unpaid work experience to address its recruitment crisis. However, after facing criticism, Pret's CEO announced that participants will be paid the company's hourly starting rate, plus receive free food. The UK's minimum wage for under 18s is £4 an hour, while for 18- to 20-year-olds it is £5.55 an hour. Pret's recruitment efforts are being impacted by Brexit, as the company relies heavily on non-UK workers and only one in 50 job applicants are born in the UK. The company's new work experience program, \"Big Experience Week\", aims to give participants a taste of various aspects of the business. Pret's human resources director believes that the company's struggles to attract British applicants are symptomatic of a wider cultural bias against careers in the hospitality industry. Wareham argues that British schools and parents need to take the industry more seriously, as it has undergone significant changes and growth over the past 20 years. The company is concerned it will struggle to recruit enough staff if it is forced to turn its back on EU nationals after Brexit. Pret hopes to offer permanent roles to participants who wish to apply after their work experience week. The company will promote its initiative through partnerships with schools and a social media campaign. To attract more British workers, Pret plans to boost recruitment advertising, double its school leavers program, and collaborate with Jobcentre Plus.",

The spacious cabin is marred by frustrating flaws, including a loose gear housing that frequently slips into second gear when I intend to shift into neutral. This inconsistency eroded my confidence. The car's unusual frame design features large plastic panels at the rear, creating a blind spot when parking on a curve. The cluttered dashboard, with its bold red accents, instilled a sense of unease. The interior lacks luxury, with a small, hard-to-read screen and storage compartments that don't align with my natural hand reach. However, the Tipo has its redeeming qualities. It doesn't feel like a small car, and its emissions are remarkably low. The exterior styling is a nostalgic ode to the 1980s, with curved lines that evoke a sense of retro charm. The boot space is ample for my needs, but I wouldn't dare attempt to transport anything larger than a shopping bag. The front seats offer generous leg room, while the rear seats are somewhat cramped. The Fiat Tipo's design is so retro that it's reminiscent of the 80s, when it was common for not all family members to be equally comfortable. The turbo diesel engine is a different story. In the city, it's sluggish to respond, then suddenly delivers a burst of power. On the motorway, the acceleration is smoother, especially in the higher gears. After an hour or so, I began to feel restless. The Tipo is a decent car, suitable for starting a family, but it may not be stylish or cool enough for some people's tastes. If you find it lacking in these areas, the problem may not be with the car, but with your expectations. Here are some key stats about the Fiat Tipo: The price is £18,545, the top speed is 124mph, acceleration is 0-62mph in 9.8 seconds, combined fuel consumption is 76mpg, CO2 emissions are 98g/km, the eco rating is 9/10, and the cool rating is 6/10.",

In England and Wales, personal insolvencies soared to 24,531 between January and March, representing a 6.7% increase from the previous quarter and a 15.7% jump from the same period a year earlier. This marks the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014. The sharp rise in insolvencies coincides with a difficult period for UK households, as rising inflation and stagnant pay growth continue to compress incomes. The annual inflation rate has reached 2.3% and is expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the effects of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote begin to manifest in higher prices. Meanwhile, regular pay growth has slowed to 1.9% compared to a year earlier. Joanna Elson, CEO of the Money Advice Trust, expressed concern over the insolvency figures, stating that growing household debt and increased pressure on budgets from inflation are cause for worry. Individual voluntary arrangements accounted for 59% of personal insolvencies, debt relief orders made up 25%, and bankruptcies accounted for 16%. Adrian Hyde, president of R3, noted that while borrowing rates remain at record lows, rising inflation and slowing real wage growth will restrict people's financial flexibility. Despite a few years of stability, personal insolvency rates are still relatively low, and the recent uptick in bankruptcies has been modest. However, the steady increase in personal insolvencies may signal that the post-recession surge in consumer borrowing and spending is beginning to plateau. Official statistics only tell part of the story, as hundreds of thousands of individuals on debt management plans are not included in the numbers. The Insolvency Service reported a 4.5% rise in corporate insolvencies in the first quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase compared to the same period last year.",

Waymo's head, John Krafcik, stated that the goal is to give participants unrestricted access to the fleet, allowing them to use the vehicles daily, at any time, to travel anywhere within a designated area. Arizona has been actively courting self-driving car researchers, offering a more favorable regulatory environment and launching social media campaigns to attract companies. The state's governor, Doug Ducey, has been aggressively pursuing companies like Uber. Waymo has been testing 100 self-driving minivans on public roads since earlier this year and plans to add another 500 vehicles to its fleet.

Would you prefer to be viewed as creative geniuses, like Paul McCartney and Michelangelo, who share this trait? Research on handedness has uncovered intriguing findings. For instance, men are more likely to be left-handed. Studies suggest that left-handed college graduates earn more, and that low birth weight, mental illness, autism, cerebral palsy, heart disease, and certain types of cancer are associated with left-handedness. Contrary to popular belief, left-handed individuals do not die younger. Left-handed individuals have an advantage in sports, as their opponents receive less practice against them. Additionally, they might be worse drivers, according to a survey conducted by a car insurance company. While this survey may be flawed, it's still worth discussing. The survey found that 28% of left-handed drivers had received a speeding ticket, compared to 19% of right-handed drivers. For parking tickets, the figures were 26% for lefties and 23% for righties. Over a 60-year driving lifetime, left-handed drivers caused an average of nine accidents, compared to eight for right-handed drivers. Interestingly, left-handed drivers were slightly less likely to have damaged their own car (35% vs 38%) and slightly more likely to have passed their driving test on the first attempt (53% vs 49%). It's essential to note that this phenomenon may not be related to the skill level of left-handed individuals. It's possible that cars and roads were simply designed with right-handed people in mind. Some people might agree with this notion. If you're sympathetic to the cause, you could chant 'Rights for lefties!' and avoid making snide comments like 'Next, they'll be demanding equal marriage rights…'",

The airline's response has been heavily scrutinized, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded and experts accusing BA of failing to meet their needs. The value of British Airways' parent company, IAG, has taken a significant hit, with £500 million wiped off its value. Crisis-response expert Paul Charles is perplexed by BA's slow response, stating that a clear statement should be released within an hour of an incident. BA's CEO took seven hours to release a video message on Twitter, a delay Charles deems unacceptable. Charles believes BA's strong brand can recover from this crisis, but notes that it's being eroded by the airline's poor response. He warns that a lack of crisis planning can lead to a decline in an airline's brand. United Airlines faced a similar crisis when it initially blamed a passenger who was dragged off an overbooked plane, but later apologized and improved its response. The airline's stock price recovered as a result. Malaysia Airlines was nationalized after the loss of two planes in 2014, highlighting the severity of the consequences of a crisis in the airline industry. According to Charles, airlines and airports have a unique ability to captivate the public and media, which can amplify even minor crises. Effective crisis management plans typically involve clear command structures and a list of key stakeholders that the CEO personally contacts. Charles has handled his fair share of crises, including a single complaint about the food on a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London. The complaint, which went viral in 2009, was made by an anonymous passenger who sent an email to Richard Branson with photos of his meal and a humorous review. Charles recalls that the company responded quickly and turned the situation around by offering the passenger a role as a food tester for future menus.",

After seven years of tracking the elusive birds in northern Queensland's unspoiled wilderness, scientists have finally recorded the extraordinary behavior on camera. The footage shows 18 male cockatoos delivering over 130 unique drum solos, each with its own distinct pattern and flair. Most performances took place in front of females, with males adding embellishments such as calls, blushing, and raised feathers to impress them. Researchers observed the birds preparing their drumming tools and then executing sequences of 27 to 92 beats, showcasing their impressive rhythmic skills. The birds' drumming styles varied greatly, ranging from rapid-fire strikes to more laid-back, repetitive beats. According to a study published in Science Advances, the cockatoos' drumming behavior shares key elements with human instrumental music, including the manufacture of sound tools, consistent performance contexts, and individual styles. The researchers liken the birds to solo artists or drummers in rock bands, who have an internal sense of rhythm and generate the motor pattern to create the beat.

Standing by a tree laden with pods, a favorite snack of parrots, he waited patiently for the birds to arrive. His persistence paid off when six parrots flew in, their striking red fronts and blue wing tips unlike any species he had previously encountered. The parrots' distinctive calls, unlike any on record, left Gómez Garza in awe. \"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" he exclaimed. \"The different noise belonged to a different parrot.\" Gómez Garza, an ornithologist and veterinarian, was thrilled to have discovered a new species of parrot. An international team of scientists published research on the newly discovered blue-winged Amazon parrot, or Amazona gomezgarzai, in honor of its discoverer. The parrot measures 25cm in height and boasts a loud, short, and repetitive call reminiscent of the soundtrack to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of its calls eerily imitates that of a hawk, a natural predator of parrots. Scientists speculate that this mimicry may serve as a deterrent, scaring other birds away and leaving more seeds, fruit, and flowers for the parrots to feast on. Gómez Garza captured a male and female parrot for further study, collaborating with Tony Silva at the University of Florida and Pawel Mackiewicz at the University of Wroclaw. DNA tests revealed that this new species evolved from the white-fronted parrots (Amazona albifrons) native to the region approximately 120,000 years ago. Conservation plans are already underway to protect the species, as there are likely fewer than 100 blue-winged Amazon parrots remaining. According to Gómez Garza, parrots worldwide are vulnerable to habitat destruction, and raising awareness will be crucial in saving wild parrots globally.",

Gordon and Murdoch, who jointly own 22.5% of the network, along with Packer, have agreed to provide the necessary funds to keep Ten operational. The network has sufficient cash resources for now, but the shareholder guarantors will establish a financing facility by the end of the week to ensure Ten's continued operation. A 14-member creditors' committee was appointed to oversee the network's administration, including representatives from various stakeholders. Judith Fox, CEO of the Australian Shareholders' Association, expressed a preference for the network to be re-listed, the business to be salvaged, and shareholders' stakes to continue. The Commonwealth Bank may appoint a receiver as early as this week, but Korda downplayed the threat, saying a receivership would not impact Ten's long-term viability. David Gordon, the chairman of Ten, has received an apology from the Australian newspaper after it published an incorrect report on Monday claiming he sold most of his shares before the company went into voluntary administration.",

The bank's total mortgage lending decreased by £1 billion to £11.6 billion in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Net lending fell by £200 million over the half year. Net consumer finance lending plummeted to £97 million from £266 million. Santander UK Chief Executive Nathan Bostock attributed the decline to intense competition driving down interest rates to historically low levels. He claimed that competitors are offering more attractive rates on car loans and credit cards than mortgage customers. Bostock emphasized that the risks associated with car loans should be considered in a broader context. Non-performing loans comprised only 0.48% of the unsecured book of lending, and mortgage arrears remained extremely low. Bostock ruled out further rate cuts for the popular 123 account. The account, which has 3.6 million customers in the UK, was paying 3% interest on balances up to £20,000 before the rate was reduced to 1.5%. Despite slashing interest payouts on the 123 account, Santander's loyal retail customer base continued to grow, reaching 3.9 million customers. The average mortgage lent by Santander remained steady at £198,000. The typical buyer was found to be taking out a loan equivalent to 3.18 times their income. Santander's total profit for the first half of the year decreased by 1% to £1,063 million. £69 million was set aside to cover potential Payment Protection Insurance payouts.",

Research by Citizens Advice reveals that nearly one in five people struggling with debt have had their credit card limit increased without their request. The charity is urging the Financial Conduct Authority to ban the practice, which has raised concerns about a surge in lending. Unsecured lending has reached levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, prompting warnings from the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn. The CEO of Citizens Advice emphasized that irresponsible lending practices are exacerbating debt problems, such as offering more credit to people who already have thousands of pounds in unpaid debt. The report found that individuals with long-term outstanding balances are more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users experiencing an increase in their limit over the past year without requesting it. Credit card debtors are also more likely to fall into long-term debt and struggle to pay off their debt compared to those with personal loans. A pensioner was repeatedly contacted by firms offering more credit cards despite being unable to afford minimum repayments on her existing debts. Citizens Advice has assisted 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems in the past year. According to the Bank of England, total consumer debt grew by 10% in the year to June, reaching almost £201 billion. The Financial Conduct Authority is developing new regulations to safeguard consumers from debt spirals, with a focus on curbing the high costs of overdrafts and scrutinizing the booming car loan market. The regulator is planning to compel companies to reach out to customers struggling with persistent debt issues after 18 months, asking if they can accelerate their repayment plans. Those who continue to struggle would then be placed on a repayment plan. The watchdog estimates that 3.3 million people have become trapped in a persistent credit card debt cycle.",

The BBC's relocation to MediaCity resulted in a 62% reduction in staff, with redundancy packages valued at £48,000 per person, compared to £27,000 for relocation. The Office for National Statistics, which relocated from London to Newport, saw a 90% decline in its London-based workforce.

If 62% of Channel 4 staff decline to relocate to Birmingham, the company would face a £20m redundancy bill, £7m in relocation costs, and additional expenses to hire new staff. The Office for National Statistics' staff defections would likely increase these costs.

You don't need to hire a claims handling company that will take a 30% cut of any compensation you're awarded. Check if you're eligible to claim mis-sold PPI. If you took out a consumer loan, store card, credit card, or mortgage between the 1990s and 2000s, you might have been mis-sold PPI. Review your old loan and mortgage statements for any mention of insurance that covers your payments if you become unemployed due to illness, accident, or redundancy. If you've lost your statements, check your credit report, which lists all your loans, mortgages, and debts from the past six years. Many lenders will inform you if you contact them and ask if you had PPI. PPI was often mis-sold because the insurance was not clearly explained to you, or you were not aware you had it, or the adviser did not explain significant exclusions under the policy. If you had to pay for the PPI upfront, the adviser did not make it clear that the insurance cost would be added to the loan and that you'd be paying interest on it. If you answered no to any of these questions, you may have a valid claim. To make a claim, use a free template letter from Which? or Moneysavingexpert, print it out, fill it in, and send it off. If your complaint is upheld, the company that sold you the policy should attempt to put you back in the position you would have been in if you hadn't taken out PPI. You may also be entitled to statutory compensation, which is usually set at an interest rate of 8% of the refunded amount. If your claim is rejected, carefully review the assumptions made by the bank and revisit your lender if you believe these assumptions are incorrect or that you've been unfairly treated. If you still feel the offered amount is unfair, you can seek assistance from the free Financial Ombudsman Service to dispute your bank's decision. Note that the deadline for submitting your complaint is August 29, 2019. Failure to submit your complaint by this date will result in it not being considered.",

Overall, the annual growth in consumer credit slowed from 1.9% in July to 1.5% in August. Despite a decline in consumer confidence due to rising prices and Brexit uncertainty, retail sales growth suggests that shoppers have not yet cut back on spending. Retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August, following a revised 0.6% increase in July. The falling rate of bank deposits also indicates that consumers are drawing on their savings. According to the latest ONS figures, the amount of household money available for saving has fallen to an all-time low in the first three months of this year. The amount being set aside as savings has slipped to 1.7% of disposable income, a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. The purchasing power of British consumers is expected to face further strain due to inflation, with the Bank of England predicting that the consumer price index (CPI) will reach a peak above 3% in October. As of August, the CPI inflation rate stood at 2.9%, driven by the increasing cost of importing fuel, clothing, and food. The Bank of England has kept interest rates unchanged this month, but warned that it may raise rates for the first time in a decade as early as November to combat rising inflation. According to Mohammad Jamei, senior economist at UK Finance, \"Some households in the UK have chosen to save less, while others have not increased their borrowing.\"",

        "Text": "Leading City businesses warn that London and Frankfurt may relinquish their status as global financial hubs to New York and Singapore unless a tailored free trade agreement on financial services is negotiated post-Brexit. A report from key UK banks, law firms, and fund managers proposes a free trade deal allowing British and EU-based financial companies to trade products and services without tariffs, taxes, or quotas. The agreement would establish a joint dispute resolution body to resolve breaches. Without \"passporting\" rights, British pensioners and EU consumers may face difficulties in paying out personal pension or insurance contracts. The International Regulatory Strategy Group has developed a plan for a free trade agreement to address these concerns. The report suggests setting up a free trade area would be straightforward, given the similarity of EU and UK regulatory regimes. The plan is ambitious but would benefit the entire continent. If London loses its status, activity would likely shift to New York or Singapore, resulting in losses for businesses and families. The proposed agreement mirrors the Canada-EU free trade area agreement, aiming to grant financial institutions reciprocal access to each other's markets. The report's starting point is that both the EU and the UK have expressed a desire to secure future arrangements for free trade in financial services. An enhanced free trade agreement is technically and legally feasible and would form a dedicated financial services chapter within a broader EU-UK agreement. The proposal includes a forum of regulators collaborating on a joint response to new global standards, as well as involvement in supervision and enforcement, with regular meetings. The report is the first comprehensive piece of work produced by any sector and could be applied to other highly regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals and aviation.",

I've complained to Holiday Autos, but they're refusing to provide a refund or assist in resolving the issue with Hertz. Hertz attributed the extra charge to an error in the original booking, stating that the distance-based one-way fee between Memphis and Brooklyn was not calculated correctly.

His impact extended globally, inspiring a vast network of colleagues and friends with his kindness and enthusiasm.

He earned his PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto and worked in oil exploration, focusing on South America. However, he became disillusioned and began to think about how he could use his skills to make a more meaningful difference. This led to a career change, during which he conducted research on science and technology in China and other Asian countries. As deputy director of SPRU from 1966 and later as its director from 1982 to 1992, Geoff drove policy research on science and technology in developing countries. He challenged the prevailing approach, advocating for building the capacity of developing countries to create their own. Geoff played a key role in establishing the International Development Research Centre of Canada in 1970 and led the science and technology policy program at IDRC, fostering policy research across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In recognition of his contributions to science, Geoff was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. After leaving his position as director of SPRU, Geoff remained actively engaged in various advisory roles, including high-level positions with the United Nations, IDRC, and Chinese ministers of science and technology.

The proportion of non-association independent schools judged good or outstanding decreased from 79% in 2014 to 60% over the past three years.

Specifically, 81 out of 139 independent Muslim schools were found to be less than good at their most recent inspection, while 39 were deemed inadequate. Over half of the 58 Jewish schools inspected received a rating of less than good.

The top-performing primary school overall is Meysey Hampton CofE in Cirencester. Ultimately, why not choose a primary school that feels right for your child? Some schools, like Downshall Primary in Essex, go the extra mile by hosting elderly visitors for the children. Others, like Findern Primary in Derby, have found that removing shoes and providing slippers can improve academic results. Who would have thought that such unconventional approaches could be so effective?",

The company aims to revamp its business strategy to stay afloat and has proposed reducing rent payments for its restaurants. Around 100 underperforming outlets, including all Chimichanga branches, are expected to close permanently. The plan is expected to result in around 1,000 job losses, with staff being transferred to surviving restaurants wherever possible. Prezzo's directors believe the company is in better shape than Byron or Jamie's Italian, having made a profit of £5m last year and holding £11m in cash reserves. However, the CVA will still reshape the business, cutting out less profitable restaurants to reflect declining sales. A CVA involves creditors agreeing to forgo some of what they are owed by a business rather than risk it going out of business altogether. When a restaurant chain is facing financial difficulties, a common solution is for landlords to accept reduced rent payments. A Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) requires the agreement of creditors who collectively hold a claim of more than 75% of the company's outstanding debt, with the remaining 25% being bound by the same terms if the CVA is approved.",

Chancellor Philip Hammond is set to unveil the results of a consultation on updating the tax system to reflect digital businesses' nature in the spring statement. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride emphasized the need for digital companies to pay fair taxes, suggesting a system where tax is levied based on where companies earn their revenue. Stride noted that digital companies generate significant value in the UK, but the current tax regime is not taxing these activities fairly. He expressed the government's desire to move towards a fairer system. The government's first preference is to reform the international tax system through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, but if progress cannot be made at the global level, the UK will implement unilateral changes. Large digital companies have faced criticism for paying very little tax in the UK, often through complex avoidance schemes. Facebook paid just £5.1m in corporation tax in the UK last year, despite revenues nearly quadrupling to £842.4m. The OECD's efforts to reform its tax policies have been hindered by a disagreement between countries. Some nations, such as the United States, want to impose higher taxes on internet companies, while others, like Luxembourg and Ireland, prioritize attracting foreign investment. Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's director of tax policy, recently expressed frustration, stating, \"Countries are left with a sour taste in their mouths because there's no consensus on taxing the profits of digitalized companies.\" A recent report proposes increasing taxes on companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Apple as a potential means of funding a universal basic income.",

The report reveals that emissions from the National Electricity Market decreased in January, reaching their lowest levels since 2004, largely due to the federal large-scale renewable energy target.\n\nEnergy expert Hugh Saddler analyzed the consumption and output of electricity from the Hornsdale Power Reserve, which includes the Tesla battery, and found that it follows a consistent pattern, charging overnight when wind generation is abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices are at their peak.\n\nThe battery's primary function is to stabilize the energy system, maintaining the grid frequency at 50 Hz and 240 volts, and only 30% of its 100MW capacity is devoted to trading. Despite its relatively small contribution to demand smoothing, the battery provides a valuable service, demonstrating the important role energy storage can play in the system.\n\nThe world's biggest battery, in SA, is working in harmony with wind farms to provide a reliable and efficient source of energy. Peak wind production is the cheapest way to charge the battery, which stands ready to fill demand gaps if they emerge. The battery charges up overnight, when prices are low, and then hits the grid at the right time to keep price spikes lower than they would be otherwise.\n\nThe Australia Institute's report also found that emissions from the NEM decreased to 152.8 Mt of CO2-equivalent in January, the lowest level since 2004. Despite relatively flat demand, the decrease in coal-fired power generation was driven by the increased output of large-scale renewable energy projects and the decline of Australia's aging coal-fired power station fleet. Energy expert Hugh Saddler emphasized that with the renewable energy target nearing completion, Australia urgently needs a post-2021 energy policy to reduce its reliance on coal in the National Electricity Market.",

The Office for National Statistics revised its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, falling short of economists' forecasts. The revised figure was attributed to lower-than-expected production and decreased consumer spending, influenced by price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker performance in the final quarter of the year led to a downward revision in the UK's overall growth rate for 2017, revised down from 1.8% to 1.7%, the weakest rate in five years. As the global economy continues to recover, the UK is falling behind other major economies, including Germany, France, and the US. According to Darren Morgan, a small number of revisions to various industries contributed to the downward revision in quarterly growth. Services continued to drive growth at the end of 2017, but consumer-facing industries slowed due to price rises, which squeezed household budgets. The UK economy's reliance on consumer spending for growth has decreased, as households have become more reluctant to spend due to falling real pay and inflation outpacing wage growth. Household spending grew by just 0.3% in the fourth quarter and by 1.8% in 2017 overall, the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012. Businesses also appeared hesitant to invest, with business investment remaining flat in the final quarter of 2017. The downward revision in growth came a day after the ONS released figures showing a surprise increase in unemployment in the three months to December. The disappointing economic data presents a potential challenge for the Bank of England, which had previously hinted that it may raise interest rates as soon as May. However, Samuel Tombs believes that the latest GDP figures indicate the economy is still fragile and does not require another rate hike so soon.",

The video was recorded in April 2016 but only recently uploaded online. Biologists describe the footage as the first documented video of a wild elephant exhibiting such behavior, leaving scientists and experts puzzled.\n\nAccording to the WCS, the elephant may have been using charcoal, which has toxin-binding properties that could have medicinal value for the animals. Charcoal is also a natural laxative and is commonly found in forests after wildfires, lightning strikes, or controlled burns. While elephants have not been observed blowing ash before, animal self-medication is a relatively common phenomenon in the animal kingdom.\n\nStudies have shown that other animals engage in self-medication, such as red colobus monkeys in Zanzibar, which consume charcoal to counteract toxic substances in their food.

The revised offer values Shire at £49 per share, a £5 increase from Takeda's initial bid. Shire's board is willing to recommend the revised proposal to shareholders, pending resolution of remaining terms. The company has set a new deadline of May 8th for negotiations to conclude. If the deal is completed, Shire shareholders will own approximately half of the combined company, with shares listed in Japan and the US. With Shire's board endorsement, the acquisition becomes more plausible, but several hurdles remain. Shire's shares in London closed at £38.20, down 2.8%, below the offer price, indicating market skepticism. Takeda's shares plummeted over 7% on the Tokyo stock exchange, reflecting concerns about the deal's financial implications. The acquisition would give Takeda Shire's lucrative rare diseases portfolio, propelling the Japanese company into the top global pharmaceutical ranks. Founded in 1986, Shire is headquartered in Dublin for tax reasons, but its operations are centered in Boston. The company is best known for its ADHD medication Adderall, but has focused on rare diseases in recent years. Shire's takeover by Takeda would propel the Japanese company into the top global pharmaceutical ranks.",

The regulator's annual survey reveals that the percentage of British social media users who consider Facebook their primary online profile has decreased from 80% to 70% over the past year. WhatsApp's popularity has skyrocketed, with 16% of internet users now considering it their main online profile, up from 7% a year ago. The shift away from Facebook is most pronounced among younger internet users, with 13% of 16- to 24-year-olds naming Snapchat as their preferred social media platform. The Ofcom survey found that the decline in Facebook's popularity occurred before the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Despite this, Facebook remains the dominant player in the social media landscape, with over half of British adults having an account. The average British adult spends 24 hours a week online and is becoming less reliant on traditional television. Many internet users lack a clear understanding of online regulation, with nearly a third mistakenly believing that YouTube regulates video content. While most Britons believe the benefits of being online outweigh the risks, many expressed concerns about the impact of prolonged internet use. Nearly half of internet users have encountered hateful content online in the past year. According to Ofcom, there is a significant wealth divide in how Britons use the internet, with poorer individuals relying more heavily on smartphones and exhibiting lower levels of online confidence and critical understanding.",

A US study found that even a slight temperature increase can lead to a decline in exam scores, with a 0.5°C rise in average temperature corresponding to a 1% drop in average exam scores. In the UK, the situation is more complicated, as air conditioning, which could mitigate the negative effects, is rarely found in British schools. June is the month when average high temperatures tend to exceed 21°C, when the negative effects on exam performance become apparent. This raises the question of why we schedule important exams during this time, when distractions like sports tournaments and heatwaves are common. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow students to take their exams online when it's most convenient for their learning and comfort? Changing the academic year is a complex issue, with schools, large firms, universities, and even the law courts following a similar September-to-July schedule. The UK government may find it challenging to argue for changing the system when they themselves benefit from it. The UK's exam marking system relies on students taking tests at the same time, but it has a significant benefit: scores required for a given grade change each year based on average scores. Fortunately, if a sweltering summer temporarily impairs children's cognitive abilities, they shouldn't suffer any lasting consequences. And if this summer proves to be another unremarkable, rainy British summer, they can breathe a sigh of relief.",

The sale could involve around 10% of the bank, but would still result in a significant loss for taxpayers. The Treasury's long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return RBS to the private sector, but the current share price may delay this decision. RBS's value has decreased by approximately 12% since the government last sold shares in 2015, and the government is prepared to write off a substantial portion of the £45.5 billion it spent on the bailout. The government's decision to resume its share disposal plan was facilitated by a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. Chancellor Philip Hammond has stated that the agreement will allow the government to proceed with the sale, which has already led to a sharp increase in RBS's shares. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the government will raise £15 billion from the sale of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is set to hold its annual general meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, which will be buoyed by the bank's first annual profit since the crisis and its promise to resume paying dividends. Tensions are running high due to a scathing report exposing widespread mistreatment of small businesses by RBS following the financial crisis.

Burnt Yates school, a small rural primary school with excellent facilities and a dedicated trust, will close its doors at the end of the academic year. Despite its rich history dating back to 1760, the school was unable to find a suitable partner or merge with other schools, and its decline is attributed to poor decisions by the local authority. The community rallied around the school, but ultimately, the lack of funding led to its closure. I blame Michael Gove's academies plan, which has undermined local accountability and led to the loss of schools like Burnt Yates, which would still thrive if not for his policies.\n\nThe department publishes data on sponsored academy primary schools, which have been forced out of local control, and these schools consistently underperform compared to average schools. This is not surprising, given the higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Despite having more time to improve, the results of these schools do not show significant improvement. As a former primary school governor, I can attest to the devastating consequences of the academies program, which included the dismissal of governors, the headteacher's departure, and the takeover by a neighboring institution.

Scientists discovered tiny fossilized skin flakes on a microraptor, a crow-sized, meat-eating dinosaur with wings on all four limbs. Similar flakes were also found on two other feathered dinosaurs, beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, as well as a primitive bird called confuciusornis. The fossilized skin flakes are the only evidence of how dinosaurs shed their skin. Unlike modern reptiles, which typically shed their skin in large sheets, the feathered dinosaurs shed their skin in tiny flakes. According to paleontologist Maria McNamara, \"This is the only fossil dandruff known. Until now, we had no evidence for how dinosaurs shed their skin.\" Images taken with an electron microscope reveal that the fossilized dandruff is extremely well-preserved and almost identical to that found on modern birds. The skin flakes are composed of tough cells called corneocytes rich in the protein keratin. The study suggests that dinosaurs with feathers evolved skin to cope with their plumage as far back as the Middle Jurassic period. \"Even in the early stages of feather evolution, they had already adapted their skin to this more modern structure,\" McNamara said. The fossilized remains of the animals were discovered in rock formations in northeastern China. Beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, which grew to over 2 meters in length, were significantly larger than the 1-meter-long microraptor. Unlike modern birds, the dinosaur dandruff cells lacked fat, suggesting that the animals did not generate as much heat, possibly because they were not capable of flying long distances or at all. Many dinosaurs with feathers were not skilled fliers. \"Rather, their feathers had multiple functions, including keeping them warm, blending in with their surroundings for camouflage, and potentially showcasing their vibrant colors to attract mates with dazzling displays.\"",

The fraudster had taken out a £11,420 loan from Sainsbury's Bank and deposited the funds into the Santander account. Sainsbury's Bank informed Santander and raised an indemnity to recover the money, but told me my credit file wouldn't be corrected until the issue was resolved. Although the Santander account was closed, the bank loan still appears on my credit report, disregarding my right to have inaccurate information corrected.\n\nThe high cost of relying on large financial institutions to communicate is evident in this case. Sainsbury's claims it only learned about my complaint when the Observer contacted them, and subsequently restored my credit record, which typically takes 60 days. However, Santander insists it notified Sainsbury's immediately after I reported the fraud and agreed to arrange an indemnity and close the loan. Despite this, nothing happened until eight days after I contacted Sainsbury's.

Santander claimed it had never received an indemnity request and would need 30 days to process one. Fortunately, modern technology was used to expedite the indemnity process. Sainsbury's has since admitted it was contacted by Santander when I discovered the fraud, but claims Santander failed to respond to its requests for an indemnity. As a result, Sainsbury's amended my credit file and paid me £100 in compensation.\n\nIt's unclear which bank's inaction caused the delay, but it's clear that if I had wanted to apply for credit during the weeks of waiting, I would have been refused.

According to the investigation, the vehicle's emergency braking system was deliberately disabled. The National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report revealed that the vehicle's guidance system detected the pedestrian six seconds before impact, but the emergency braking system did not activate due to concerns about erratic vehicle behavior. The system relied on the human backup driver to intervene, but it did not alert the driver to the impending danger. The vehicle was traveling at 43 miles per hour when it struck the pedestrian, who was pushing a bicycle across a boulevard. The report showed that the sensors detected the need to brake 1.3 seconds before impact, but the brakes were not applied until after the fatal collision. The backup driver claimed she was monitoring the self-driving interface at the time of the accident. In response, Uber suspended testing in Arizona and focused on more limited testing in Pittsburgh and California. The company is conducting an internal review of its self-driving vehicle program and has brought in a former NTSB chairman to advise on its safety culture. The NTSB's preliminary report aims to provide an initial analysis of the incident, rather than assign blame. An expert in liability law emphasized the need for greater regulatory oversight in the testing of self-driving vehicles. States must exercise extreme caution when establishing and regulating these programs to avoid a patchwork of 50 different systems. We can't afford to have multiple, uncoordinated approaches, which could lead to experimentation with the technology at the risk of injuries and fatalities.

Prior to 2010, life expectancy in Britain had been steadily rising, with men born in the 1920s and 1930s enjoying unusually long and healthy lives. This growth in lifespan has had far-reaching implications across various aspects of life. The trend of increasing longevity has plateaued, according to a recent analysis by the Office for National Statistics. The underlying causes of this sudden stagnation are unclear, but potential factors include austerity measures, reduced NHS spending, flu outbreaks, rising obesity and diabetes rates, and increasing multimorbidity. The study's findings are concerning, as they indicate that the trend towards improving life expectancy has slowed significantly. The slowdown began in the second quarter of 2009 for men and soon after for women. Between 2011 and 2013, and again between 2014 and 2016, only a small number of local authorities in England showed statistically significant increases in life expectancy. This is a stark contrast to the equivalent period 10 years earlier, when many more local authorities reported significant increases in life expectancy. Other disquieting data from the weekly register of deaths in England and Wales this year adds to the worrying trend. The statistics reveal that the number of deaths is significantly higher than the average over the past five years.

The company's value has nearly matched that of Royal Mail and surpassed the combined stock market value of WH Smith, Debenhams, the AA, and Saga. Fever-Tree's rapid growth is attributed to the soaring popularity of premium gin, which has doubled UK sales to £1.2 billion in the past six years. Gin is the UK's most beloved spirit, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favorite. Riding the wave of gin's popularity, Fever-Tree has transformed into one of the UK's fastest-growing major companies, making co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow multi-millionaires. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005 and since the company's stock market float in 2014, Rolls has sold shares worth over £150 million, while Warrilow has sold shares worth £41 million. They still own 14% of the company, a stake worth nearly £600 million. Fever-Tree's shares jumped by as much as 15% to an all-time high of £39.87, driven by profits rising by a third to £34 million in the first six months of the year. The company reported particularly strong performance in the UK over the Christmas period, with an impressive rate of sales growth. Fever-Tree has announced two new distribution agreements: one in the US with Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, and another with Grupo Damm, a Spanish company that produces Estrella Damm.",

The trial will take place within the company's depots, where the bus will operate autonomously until necessary laws permit passenger transportation. The bus is being adapted with technology similar to that used in a recent trial of driverless pods in Greenwich, south-east London. According to Stagecoach, the bus will be able to park, refuel, and navigate to wash points without human intervention. The company believes that wider adoption of self-driving buses could lead to safer and more efficient operations, as well as increased space within its depots.\n\nEven when the bus is on public roads, the sensor system could provide earlier warnings to other road users, such as cyclists or pedestrians, who may be in blind spots or approaching unexpectedly. Stagecoach's UK bus engineering director, Sam Greer, described the project as exciting and potentially transformative, stating that it could improve safety and efficiency within depots and, in the long term, revolutionize bus travel.\n\nThis move by a traditional bus operator using a full-size vehicle could mark a significant step towards the wider adoption of autonomous vehicles in the UK. In contrast, passenger services using small driverless vehicles have been trialed in France, while China has tested larger driverless buses on major city roads in Shenzhen. The trials in Greenwich suggested that passengers may be more receptive to larger autonomous vehicles for public transportation than smaller pods. While driverless trains have been in operation for some time, researchers found that users had concerns about sharing vehicles with strangers, with 85% of participants expressing comfort with autonomous technology but only 46% willing to ride-share. Many respondents indicated that they were not willing to pay a substantial amount above the standard bus fare to use autonomous driverless pods.",

The company's name was inspired by their success at the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire. Aston Martin made its international racing debut in the 1922 French Grand Prix, but faced financial difficulties and was rescued in 1926. The company developed a reputation for engineering and design, competing in the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars increased in the 1930s, with a record 140 cars built in 1937. In 1947, English industrialist David Brown acquired the company, expanding operations and relocating production. The company relocated its production base again in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. The iconic Aston Martin DB5 was introduced in 1963, and its famous partnership with James Bond began a year later in the film Goldfinger. Bond has since driven an Aston Martin in several films. The company changed hands several times in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1987, Ford Motor Company acquired a 75% stake. The DB moniker was revived with the introduction of the DB7 in 1993. Aston Martin opened its first purpose-built factory in Gaydon, Warwickshire, in 2003. The company returned to racing in 2005 with the DBR9. In 2007, Aston Martin was sold to a consortium of two Kuwaiti investment houses for nearly £1 billion. Today, Aston Martin is one of the world's leading sports car manufacturers. The company is poised to make its stock market debut in London later this year.",

        "Text": "Elite private schools are urging universities to reduce the use of unconditional offers for undergraduate places, citing concerns that students may become complacent and not strive for high A-level grades. According to Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, students tend to relax after accepting unconditional offers, which may hinder their academic achievements. Buchanan believes that students will carry their academic achievements throughout their careers and should be motivated to work hard. He is calling on universities to only offer unconditional places to students who have been interviewed or whose schools have provided additional information. Historically, only a small number of students received unconditional offers, but the government's removal of the cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities to expand and compete aggressively for students and tuition fees. While there is limited evidence on the impact of unconditional offers on students' final grades, private school heads have long been concerned about the potential impact on their school's results and league table rankings. Some employers place significant weight on A-level grades when recruiting for graduate trainee programs, which means that students who underperform may struggle in the job market. The HMC's call follows that of Education Minister Sam Gyimah, who in July criticized the rise in unconditional offers as \"completely irresponsible to students\" and urged universities to limit their use. Typically, universities make conditional offers, specifying the A-level grades required to secure a place. However, in a more competitive market, unconditional offers have become more common, even among research-intensive institutions in the Russell Group. According to Ucas, 7% of the 950,000 offers made this year were unconditional, with roughly one-fifth of the 250,000 applicants to English universities receiving at least one such offer. Ucas noted that unconditional offers were more prevalent for older students who already held qualifications, as well as for those applying to creative arts courses who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties. University vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers, citing their benefits in allowing for earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation.",

Despite a two-percentage-point improvement, disadvantaged white boys still lag behind their peers. Overall, 82% of pupils met the expected standard, a one-percentage-point increase from 2017. Chinese girls not receiving free school meals emerged as the highest-performing group. The phonics screening check involves pupils reading 40 words aloud, with a pass mark of 32. Pupils who fail to meet the standard will retake the check at the end of year 2, by which time 92% are expected to meet the required standard. Fewer than half (44%) of pupils with special educational needs reached the pass mark, compared to 89% of pupils with no identified SEN. Provisional results for key stage 1 teacher assessments showed a slight decline in the number of six- and seven-year-olds reaching the expected standard in reading and maths. The government reported that 163,000 more six-year-olds are on track to become fluent readers than in 2012. However, the test remains contentious, with 85% of heads believing it should not be compulsory and 65% of teachers wanting it scrapped. A representative of the More Than A Score campaign group argued that the phonics check is a waste of valuable teaching time and instead of fostering a love of reading, children are spending months drilling on nonsensical words solely to prepare for a test. School Standards Minister Nick Gibb hailed this as a significant achievement, citing its positive impact on the education and lives of hundreds of thousands of children, and reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.",

Masuko stated that the alliance's capital structure was not discussed during a recent meeting in Amsterdam, but changes to the governance structure are seen as a possibility. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three companies, has been in detention for 10 days and may be charged with a crime after his detention is extended for another 10 days. The arrest has raised questions about the future of the alliance, which has been led by Ghosn since its inception. While Nissan and Mitsubishi quickly removed Ghosn as chair of their respective boards, Renault chose not to do so and has allowed him to remain as chairman and CEO. The alliance's leadership, excluding Ghosn, met in Amsterdam for an operational review, which was scheduled before the arrest. The meeting focused on operational issues, including research and development, basic components, and technology sharing. A separate meeting of the Renault-Nissan BV board would be required to remove Ghosn from his position. In a joint statement, the three companies reaffirmed their commitment to the alliance, stating that they have \"all – individually and collectively – emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\" The statement added that the alliance has achieved significant success over the past two decades and remains committed to its goals.

Unauthorized immigrants, in particular, may face significant barriers to opening a bank account. Torres believes the proposed ban is necessary to prevent a \"gentrification of the marketplace\" and ensure equal access to goods and services for all individuals. He views this as a new frontier of anti-discrimination law, addressing the unequal impact of cashless transactions on marginalized communities. However, Andrew Rigie, head of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, suggests finding a balance between the benefits of cashless transactions and ensuring all customers have access to goods and services. While cashless restaurants may offer operational and worker safety benefits, they should not discriminate against individuals without credit cards.",

        "Text": "The US-China trade dispute has escalated ahead of the G20 summit in Argentina, with US President Donald Trump threatening China with increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting sharp stock market declines in London and New York. Trump's comments make it unlikely that he will heed Beijing's request to refrain from raising tariffs starting next year. The move would increase the existing 10% US import tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from January 1. Economists warn that a US-China trade war escalation could severely impact the global economy over the next decade, potentially resulting in a 2% loss of GDP growth by 2030. The ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond their borders, with no clear winners in a globalized economy. Trump's comments also suggested that Apple products could be subject to tariffs, triggering a sell-off in Apple shares. Recent developments, including the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, have helped to ease tensions between the White House and other countries. Despite previous optimism, Trump has recently hinted at imposing higher import tariffs on China. Meanwhile, he has dampened expectations of a trade agreement between the UK and the US if Theresa May secures parliamentary backing for her Brexit deal. The US government is investigating car imports on national security grounds, which could potentially lead to higher tariffs on European-made vehicles.",

In November 2016, attackers exploited stolen credentials to access Uber's cloud servers and download 16 large files containing sensitive information. The compromised data included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and location information, as well as drivers' weekly pay, trip summaries, and in some cases, driver's license numbers. The breach was attributed to inadequate information security measures and was exacerbated by Uber US's decision not to disclose the attack. The Information Commissioner's Office deemed this a malicious attack, rather than a typical bug bounty scenario, as the hackers exploited the vulnerability to steal personal data. As a result, none of the affected individuals were notified of the breach, and the company only began monitoring accounts for fraud 12 months later. The potential fine was reduced due to the fact that Uber's European branches were not informed of the breach, and there was no evidence that the compromised data was misused. Uber US was ordered to pay $148 million for failing to notify drivers about the breach. To strengthen our systems, we have implemented numerous technical enhancements and made significant changes to our leadership structure to ensure transparency with regulatory bodies and customers. We have appointed a chief privacy officer, data protection officer, and chief trust and security officer. We view our mistakes as opportunities to learn and are committed to earning the trust of our users every day. The timing of the breach meant that we were subject to the Data Protection Act 1998, which capped the financial penalty at £500,000. If the same breach had occurred under the Data Protection Act 2018, the potential fine would be significantly higher, up to 4% of our global revenue.",

I had specifically asked for Wyevale due to its large location near my home, which has been a staple in the area for years. However, when I visited last weekend, I was surprised to find it had been rebranded as a Dobbies garden centre. The staff informed me that I couldn't use the gift cards at that location, but I could redeem them at other centres. Unfortunately, the three closest options are a significant drive away, which seems unfair given the company's change of ownership wasn't my fault.\n\nIt was unfortunate timing, as the sale of this centre to Dobbies was only completed two and a half weeks prior.

Wyevale has stated that there are still over 100 centres in operation and has made efforts to inform its Garden Club members about the changes.

Wyevale's spokesperson emphasized that customer loyalty is crucial and that once a local centre changes ownership, gift cards can be redeemed in a way that suits the customer best, either online or in-person at their nearest centre.

The payout was made according to Guthrie's contractual entitlements, as determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, following verification with individuals involved in the negotiations. Guthrie was terminated by the ABC board after two years into her five-year term as managing director, following clashes with former chairman Justin Milne over issues including allegations of political sensitivities.

The InSight probe is scheduled to touch down gently on Elysium Planitia, where it will analyze seismic activity on the red planet. Despite numerous Mars probes, more than half have failed due to the final stages of landing proving notoriously challenging. The Martian atmosphere's thinness, equivalent to just 1% of Earth's, poses a significant hurdle, as there is little friction to slow down a spacecraft. This has contributed to past failures, leaving NASA engineers on edge as they guide their $800 million InSight craft on a 300 million-mile journey to a 15-mile-by-6-mile target zone. If InSight navigates this precise keyhole, it should land squarely in the middle of Elysium Planitia. However, it will still require a heat-resistant capsule, parachute, and rockets to slow down from 12,000mph to 5mph and ensure a soft and safe landing after a seven-minute descent. The most recent attempt to land on Mars was made two years ago by a European probe, which unfortunately crashed on the planet's surface. Despite this, NASA remains optimistic about the mission's success. The InSight mission aims to help scientists understand the early evolution of Mars and other planets in the solar system, including Earth, by using instruments to probe deep beneath the planet's surface and measure temperatures and seismic activity.",

A recent study found that while river fish successfully regenerated tissue after heart parts were removed, cave fish developed only scars. The salamander's ability to regrow a lost tail involves a complex process of cell migration and gradual regeneration over several weeks. The regenerated tail is fully functional and identical to the original, with the spinal cord and nerves fully restored. The axolotl, a salamander relative, boasts impressive regenerative abilities, capable of regrowing its tail, limbs, skin, and almost any other body part. Each time a limb is removed, it regrows almost perfectly, making the axolotl a valuable subject for studying human limb regeneration. Starfish can regrow arms that detach from their central disc, and some species can even regrow an entire body from a lost arm. To accomplish this, starfish store nutrients in the detached arm until they can regrow their mouth. The sea cucumber has a remarkable ability to rapidly mend its organs, regrowing damaged parts and healing deep wounds in as little as a week. This remarkable skill is crucial for the sea cucumber, as it often jettisons certain organs as a distraction technique to defend itself against predators like crabs and turtles.",

According to recent accounts, Odey received £1.5m from Odey Asset Management, a 72% drop from the previous year's £5.5m. The hedge fund reported a 52% decline in profit to £8.8m, primarily due to Odey's unsuccessful bets against the pound and UK retailers. Odey Asset Management has taken a £149m short position against UK shops, banks, estate agents, and property companies. Despite this, the fund has performed exceptionally well in recent months, as the pound has continued to fall and the share prices of several British businesses Odey bet against have plummeted. The fund has gained more than 50% so far this year, including a 7% return in October, making it one of the world's top-performing hedge funds. Last month, the fund made millions from a bet against Intu, whose shares dropped 42% after a proposed takeover collapsed.

The economy rebounded from a cold winter earlier in the year, as consumers splurged during the World Cup and a prolonged heatwave. However, detailed data revealed that consumers, burdened by rising utility bills and transportation costs, relied on their savings to maintain their spending habits, as their disposable income remained stagnant. According to Rob Kent-Smith, statistician at the ONS, households have spent more than they earned for an unprecedented eighth consecutive quarter, raising concerns about their ability to sustain their spending and drive the economy. Recent surveys have fueled concerns that consumer spending is losing momentum, with several high street retailers reporting dismal sales in November. Asos's surprise profit warning has added to these concerns, as analysts had grown accustomed to web-based operators weathering the spending downturn. Business investment has declined for the third consecutive quarter, a trend not seen since the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. The cumulative effect is expected to reduce GDP growth in the final quarter of 2018 to nearly zero. The Bank of England attributed the decline in business investment to Brexit uncertainty, although the risk of border disruptions has led to increased spending on warehousing and port capacity. Companies are stockpiling goods at their highest level since 2016, suggesting they are under pressure to build large inventories in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit. The GfK monthly health check found consumer confidence at its lowest level in five years, and a Lloyds bank monitor registered the lowest business morale since the 2016 Brexit referendum.

This figure surges to a striking 40% for mothers of two children. Researchers from Manchester and Essex universities analyzed biological data from 6,025 UK participants to examine the impact of working hours and family conditions on stress levels. The study, published in Sociology, found that working from home or having flexible hours had no significant effect on women's chronic stress levels, but reducing working hours had a positive impact. Work-family conflict is a significant contributor to increased psychological strain, stress, and decreased wellbeing, particularly for parents of young children. The study's findings are based on 11 biomarkers that measure the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems. Chronic stress, resulting from repeated stressful events and combinations of social and environmental stressors, can have a significant impact on overall health. Women working full-time with two children had biomarkers indicating chronic stress, including hormone levels and blood pressure, that were 40% higher compared to those with no children. Women working full-time with one child had 18% higher levels of stress than those with no children. Flexible work practices aim to help employees achieve a better work-life balance, which should reduce work-family conflict. While reduced-hours flexible work arrangements did help moderate the relationship between family and work stressors, there was limited evidence that flexible work arrangements were associated with lower chronic stress responses.

The high street challenger is currently under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority regarding a significant accounting error. The news coincided with the bank's annual results presentation on Tuesday night. Metro Bank's share price has lost half its value since the accounting issue was disclosed. CEO Craig Donaldson has opted to forgo his £800,000 annual bonus and has offered to resign, but the board has given him full backing to remain in his position. Donaldson apologized to investors and denied that the latest capital raise was influenced by the loans misclassification. The bank raised £303 million from investors last July, but Donaldson has since changed his stance, stating that the bank will always seek to raise capital when it's in its best interests. A financial analyst predicted shares could drop to 729p. A major shareholder, Royal London Asset Management, expressed concerns about the accounting error, citing it as a warning sign for investors.",

        "Text": "Retail workers in the UK are more likely to face unemployment than find a new job, a recent report reveals. The retail industry has seen a sharp increase in redundancies, with major high street retailers announcing job cuts and store closures. The decline in consumer spending, driven by inflation and changing shopping habits, has exacerbated the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The study found that 31% of retail workers who lose their jobs become unemployed, compared to 26% across all industries. Two in five former retail workers are unemployed for at least six months, with younger workers facing greater risks. The report highlights that three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30, despite this age group making up only a third of the retail workforce. Policymakers can support those most affected by the shift towards online shopping. The study shows a long-term decline in retail employment in the UK since 2003, with the number of jobs shrinking from 10.8% to 9.5% of the overall workforce. Britain now has a lower proportion of workers in wholesale and retail compared to Germany. Despite multiple rounds of job cuts, the job market has created new opportunities in industries such as hospitality and social care. The retail sector remains a low-paying industry, with an average hourly wage of £8.80, approximately a third lower than the average pay across the entire economy.",

The consumer group advises packing essentials like food, water, and diapers to cope with prolonged delays. Alicante airport, which serves popular resorts, is expected to be severely impacted, with visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote, and Málaga likely to experience significant delays. An additional 90 seconds per UK passport could add five hours to processing time for a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers. Alicante airport's high volume of UK arrivals makes it particularly vulnerable. Portugal has announced plans to introduce special UK lanes at Faro airport and Funchal, but Spain has yet to confirm its position. Travel editor Rory Boland warns that airports can be chaotic, and a no-deal Brexit could lead to extremely long queues. Until a deal is reached or airports announce alternative arrangements, travelers should prepare for lengthy queues and pack accordingly. The analysis was based on data from the European Tourism Association. British tourists would not be entitled to use designated lanes for EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals in a no-deal scenario. They may be required to present a return or onward ticket and face additional checks to ensure sufficient funds. Despite potential challenges, Aena, Spain's largest airport operator, does not anticipate chaos this summer, citing the high stakes involved. Aena believes that once the initial uncertainty is resolved, UK traffic can continue to thrive in both the short and long term.",

The FTSE 250-listed company is actively discussing the disposal of assets exceeding its £500 million target for 2019, following the sale of £570 million in property last year at an average price 7% below its book value. Under pressure from activist investor Elliott Advisors, which owns a 5% stake, Hammerson is accelerating its disposal plans after a 9.3% decline in property values in 2018. Hammerson's tenants include Patisserie Valerie, House of Fraser, and New Look, all of which have been affected by the decline in the retail sector. Hammerson's CEO, David Atkins, acknowledged that 2018 was a challenging year, particularly in the UK, due to tenant failures, structural shifts in retail, and a more cautious consumer.

However, the statistics published last week are consistent over the 44-year period covered, using an internationally agreed definition of unemployment and unaffected by changes in the benefits system.

The European and Wall Street stock exchanges suffered sharp losses following weak economic growth data in the European single currency bloc, dispelling hopes of a rebound from a weak finish to last year. Economists attributed the poor industrial output figures to a slowdown in China and the global economy, raising the prospect of weaker growth for the rest of 2019. The New York stock market plummeted, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped 2% and markets across Europe suffered steep losses. The IHS Markit flash purchasing managers' index revealed that euro area factory output contracted the most since December 2012, with disruptions caused by Brexit and faltering demand for exports amid the US-China trade dispute having a significant impact. Germany's manufacturing sector recorded its steepest decline in output in seven years, with new factory orders deteriorating to the greatest extent since the financial crisis. Germany's industry woes are linked to China's slowing economy, triggered by US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese car sales fell for the first time in almost 30 years, a significant blow to German car manufacturers. Germany narrowly avoided recession last year, and the PMI index showed that Germany and France were the worst performers, while other parts of the eurozone recorded stronger growth.

While the recent warming of the Earth is well-documented, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of an alien breeding program. Some alleged alien abductees claim to have experienced \"sexually oriented actions with aliens or other human abductees under mind control,\" but I remain skeptical. Apparently, some recall seeing jars containing hybrid toddlers and fetuses on the alleged alien spaceships. I acknowledge that these individuals may have undergone a traumatic experience, but is there any concrete evidence to support the existence of aliens? Unfortunately, the lack of detectable evidence may be due to the fact that aliens allegedly reside in a different dimension. This sounds similar to the concept of ghosts, which are also often associated with unexplained phenomena.

This pioneering discovery implies that scents could be leveraged to shape food choices, such as subtly incorporating aromas to make food taste sweeter and reduce sugar intake. When driving at night, many people experience motion-induced blindness, where red lights momentarily vanish when gazing at oncoming traffic. This phenomenon occurs when the brain disregards visual information presented against a moving backdrop. A striking correlation exists between hearing and vision in speech perception, known as the McGurk effect, where the auditory and visual components of a syllable can create the perception of a third sound. The visual presence of cutlery significantly influences how we perceive the flavor of food, with research demonstrating that yoghurt tastes sweeter when consumed with a white spoon compared to a black spoon. There is a surprising overlap between smell and sound in human perception, with experiments consistently revealing that individuals pair specific scents with particular instruments and pitches. For instance, a piano is often linked to a fruity aroma, while brass is associated with a musky odor. This phenomenon is thought to be triggered by the olfactory tubercle, an area of the brain that responds to both auditory and olfactory stimuli.",

Adani claims necessary permits for mining operations, but not for the construction phase. The company has mentioned alternative water sources, including groundwater, rainwater, and recycled water. A former Queensland government general manager described Adani's accessible water as a \"puddle\", insufficient to cover the shortfall. Adani's claims to start construction on the Carmichael coalmine have become a federal election campaign issue. The federal environment minister approved Adani's groundwater plans, allowing LNP politicians to blame the state Labor government for delays. Adani intensified its advertising campaign, criticizing the Queensland government for \"moving the goalposts\". Adani denied its campaign was political, claiming to inform Queenslanders about the project's true status.",

        "Text": "PepsiCo has faced backlash after suing four Indian farmers for allegedly growing a patented potato strain used in its Lay's crisps without permission. The company initially sought $150,000 in damages from each farmer, claiming they broke the law by sourcing and dealing the potatoes. However, when the case went to court in Ahmedabad, India, PepsiCo offered to settle the dispute amicably. The case has sparked outrage among farmers and others, who fear PepsiCo is using its influence to interfere with India's food supply. Several farmers' groups in India have come together to protest the court action. PepsiCo claimed that the farmers who grew its patented potatoes without permission were hurting the interests of many people who work with the company to produce potatoes for its Lay's crisps. The company supplies seeds to these farmers and subsequently buys back the potatoes. PepsiCo is India's largest process-grade potato buyer and one of the first companies to work with thousands of local farmers to grow a specific protected variety of potatoes for its Lay's crisps. The company was forced to take legal action as a last resort, and is deeply committed to resolving the issue. The recent controversy has stirred up memories of the drought, with some commentators expressing concerns that PepsiCo may be using the legal system to punish individuals who use the same groundwater used in their products. The role of foreign companies in producing and selling food in India is a contentious issue, particularly when it comes to genetically modified crops. The case is about \"India's seed sovereignty, food sovereignty, and country sovereignty,\" said Kapil Shah, an activist defending the farmers. He added that it's spreading panic among farmers. Ambubhai Patel, vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers' association linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata party, said they are lobbying the government to support the accused farmers and punish those harassing other farmers. Patel warned that the government cannot allow such intimidation and vowed to fight against it in court and on the streets if necessary.",

The bank reported a pre-tax profit of £1.5 billion for the January-to-March period, a decrease from £1.7 billion in the same period last year, but in line with City analysts' expectations. Barclays' investment banking division has faced pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson, who is pushing for cost reductions and a seat on the board. Bramson, who owns 5.5% of Barclays' shares, will confront CEO Jes Staley at the bank's annual general meeting next week. Barclays' international business, which includes the investment bank, saw a decline in pre-tax profit to £1.1 billion, while its UK business reported a rise in profits to £600 million, driven by strong mortgage applications. Staley stated that the bank cut bonuses to reduce costs and is \"very comfortable\" with its cost targets, which amounted to £3.3 billion in the first quarter. The bank took a £400 million charge in 2016 to align bonuses with revenues. \"We are exercising our discretion around variable compensation to manage our costs and deliver expected profitability,\" Staley said.

Research reveals that the dominant commercial cultivar grown in Hawaii originated from a single tree in southern Queensland in the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was established using a single cultivar from Australia, repeatedly cloned, resulting in a lack of genetic diversity. This lack of diversity has led to concerns about crop productivity, disease resistance, and the ability to grow macadamia trees in new areas. Researchers hope that their findings will lead to the discovery of wild trees and novel genes that could improve the crop.\n\nResearchers traced the origins of Hawaii's macadamia industry back to Queensland, discovering that the Hawaiian cultivar had distinctive gene markers in common with a small crop of trees in the Mooloo area, near Gympie. Historical records show that seeds from these trees were taken to Honolulu in 1896.\n\nAustralia's native macadamia trees have a rich genetic diversity compared to commercial crops, with a strong geographic pattern to the diversity, all coming from south-east Queensland and northern NSW. The Hawaiian germplasm is very narrow, meaning it has only come from one locality.\n\nThe researchers found that some unique genetic markers in commercial trees could not be matched with known wild trees, potentially due to the loss of diverse genes in the wild or their continued existence in domestic cultivated plants. Some lost diversity might be found in cultivated plants, parks, gardens, or backyards. The oldest known cultivated macadamia tree is located in Brisbane's city botanic gardens, planted in 1858.\n\nAustralia's macadamia industry is significant, with the crop accounting for 14% of the country's total horticultural exports in 2017.",

Assange's solicitor, Gareth Peirce, informed the judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London that he was unable to attend. The next hearing is scheduled for June 12. The judge suggested that the next hearing may take place at Belmarsh Prison in south London if it is convenient for all parties. The US has requested Assange's extradition, initiated after his removal from the Ecuadorian embassy in London on April 11. He faces charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years, and violating the Espionage Act by publishing classified information through WikiLeaks, which could lead to decades in prison. Prosecutors have announced 17 additional charges against Assange for publishing secret diplomatic cables and files on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Of the nine airlines contacted, only Flybe agreed to modify the clauses, but has not entirely removed them. The airlines that retained the clauses were British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Air France, Singapore, Qatar, and Swiss. KLM instead charges a fixed-rate fee ranging from €125 to €3,000 to passengers at the airport if the first leg is missed. The Civil Aviation Authority expressed concern over the failure to remove the no-show clauses, adding to the pressure on airlines.

The notion that women will assume leadership roles, not just on Earth but throughout the galaxy, is not entirely implausible. It's possible that men have had their time and it's now women's turn to take the helm. According to this theory, women will either quietly eliminate men in their sleep or leave them behind as they colonize space. However, this raises the question of how they plan to reproduce without men's involvement. The answer is that the matriarchy only requires a supply of frozen sperm to get started. While it's possible that men might resist this plan, new research suggests that frozen sperm can survive in space with no adverse effects. Scientists have found that by subjecting sperm samples to weightlessness, they can collect and store it for future use, raising the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth, allowing the matriarchy to impregnate themselves as needed.\n\nThe absence of gender-based biases and stereotypes could contribute to a more cohesive and efficient all-female space mission. In contrast, all-male missions in the past may have been plagued by similar issues. NASA reportedly conducted a secret study on long-term space travel, suggesting that to prevent conflicts, the crew should consist only of individuals of the same gender - either all men or all women. The study concluded that an all-female crew would be a better option, as men might argue over who should be in charge. This is a pattern observed throughout human history. While an all-female spacecraft would likely still see some romantic entanglements, at least the risk of pregnancy during a space flight would be eliminated.

The investigation will focus on allegations that these companies are illegally stifling competition and hindering innovation. The review aims to address widespread concerns expressed by consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs about search, social media, and online retail services. Without competition, digital platforms may prioritize their own interests over consumer demands, warned Makan Delrahim, Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division. The review will scrutinize the practices of online platforms, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. The investigation comes amid calls from lawmakers, including Democratic presidential candidates, for greater oversight of these companies. Last week, Facebook, Google, and Amazon faced intense questioning from lawmakers over their control of markets such as digital advertising, e-commerce, and cloud computing. Lawmakers grilled Amazon over its fees for third-party sellers and questioned Facebook executives about their practices of targeting startups for acquisition and copying features from companies that decline to be acquired. The hearing also saw lawmakers question Facebook about its plans to launch a global cryptocurrency, Libra.

The guests were not allowed to leave until they paid a 6,000 Tunisian dinar fee. According to reports, buses sent to transport the holidaymakers to Enfidha airport were turned away by security. Maddie Clamp and her boyfriend Shaun Holmes described being locked within their holiday complex as management tried to secure payment from guests. \"They wouldn't even let us out of the hotel,\" Holmes said. By Sunday, the standoff had been resolved and guests were allowed to leave. A local Thomas Cook representative worked late into the night and returned on Sunday morning to address guests' urgent queries. The company stated that any guests who had paid the hotel had been refunded. A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: \"We are aware that a small number of customers were asked to pay for their hotel room before leaving Les Orangers in Tunisia. This has now been resolved and customers flew home as planned. We continue to support our customers in all our resorts.\" Lynn and Peter Taylor reported that guests leaving the hotel had been asked for extra payment. \"Those who were due to leave today had letters slipped under their door,\" said Lynn Taylor. \"The hotel was asking for 6,000 TD. I think one old lady paid it. We didn't.\" The hotel refused to comment on its communication with Thomas Cook, only confirming that guests are now free to enter and leave the premises. Tunisia's tourism industry is still recovering from the devastating impact of two terror attacks in 2015, which severely damaged the sector and resulted in the mass killing of predominantly British tourists. The UK was particularly affected, as a government travel warning was in place from June 2015 to July 2017, advising against travel to Tunisia. Thomas Cook was one of the first companies to resume flights to Tunisia, announcing its return in February 2018. The British consulate in Tunis is aware of the situation and is providing assistance as needed.",

The submission alleges that a public interest disclosure was made in 2017 regarding an issue with hiring practices involving a senior executive, which was instead of being investigated independently, sent back to the department for handling. The government emphasizes the importance of the public interest disclosure process, rather than leaking information to the media. The Home Affairs Secretary stated that the department will investigate and prosecute public servants who leak sensitive information. The submission reveals that the public servant initially contacted the ombudsman and the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, but the matter was ultimately handled internally.

The retailer has partnered with Clearpay to offer interest-free instalments for orders over £30. Clearpay, an Australian fintech company, has gained popularity among millennials on tight budgets. Many of M&S's competitors, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services. M&S says its customers seek ways to spread larger purchases, and Clearpay enables them to do so over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800, and customers can manage payments through a phone app without applying for credit. Fintech firms like Clearpay and Klarna make money by earning commission on sales transactions. Shoppers who use these plans tend to spend more frequently, making it attractive for retailers like M&S. Over 4,000 UK retailers work with Klarna, which has over 3 million British customers. Clearpay has gained over 200,000 active customers in the UK. However, not everyone is a fan of this form of credit. Simon Wolfson, CEO of Next, has expressed concerns that it might be dangerous. Stepchange, a debt charity, has also expressed concern that these payment plans may encourage individuals to spend money they don't have.

The sculpture rapidly gained popularity, attracting crowds of selfie-takers and becoming a symbol of feminist empowerment. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren utilized the statue to promote her policies, capitalizing on its widespread appeal. Sculptor Kristen Visbal has since created multiple copies of Fearless Girl, which now stand in cities worldwide.

Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have discovered a previously unknown satellite orbiting Neptune, as reported in Nature. This finding serves as a poignant reminder that much remains to be uncovered in our own celestial backyard, with far-reaching implications for understanding exoplanetary systems. According to planetary scientist Anne Verbiscer, \"many assume we have a comprehensive understanding of major planets' moons, but this is not the case. We still have much to discover.\" The ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, remain largely unexplored, unlike every other planet in our solar system.

The Sundarbans, a 4,000-square-mile region in Bangladesh and India, is home to the world's largest mangrove forest and a diverse ecosystem that supports hundreds of animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. However, 70% of the region is only a few feet above sea level, making it extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts. Researchers predict that the warming planet will decimate the few hundred Bengal tigers remaining in the region, with no suitable tiger habitats remaining in the Bangladesh Sundarbans by 2070. Climate change has already had a devastating impact on endangered mammals, with a recent study finding that it has harmed almost half of them. The report's lead author and colleagues examined the risks to the tiger population beyond sea level rise, finding that other climate-related factors were more significant threats to the Sundarbans' tigers. Habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal trade of animal parts have contributed to the global tiger population decline since the early 1900s. The Bangladesh Sundarbans will likely experience a decline in its population due to an increase in extreme weather events and changes in vegetation. As the Sundarbans flood, the likelihood of conflicts between humans and tigers will rise, with the situation worsening significantly if a cyclone hits, a disease outbreak occurs, or a food shortage develops.

The lawsuit was brought by New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland. The 2017 tax law introduced a cap on state and local tax deductions to offset the cost of trillions in tax cuts. The cap and related provisions are expected to generate nearly $700 billion in revenue over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Independent analyses suggest most residents in high-tax states received a modest tax cut under the 2017 law. Other provisions, such as reduced marginal tax rates, offset the loss of the deduction for many families. The state and local tax issue poses a challenge for Democrats seeking to restore a tax break primarily benefiting high-income earners. Prior to the cap's implementation, households earning $200,000 or more accounted for roughly half of the nearly $600 billion in state and local tax payments deducted on federal tax returns. Democrats argue the SALT cap unfairly penalizes states with progressive tax policies, making state and local taxes more expensive for residents. This could hinder states' ability to raise taxes, particularly on wealthy residents, and increase pressure to cut spending. The four states claimed the SALT cap constitutes an impermissible attempt by the federal government to influence certain states' tax policies.",

This behavior has its origins in ancient trilobites, which went extinct around 500 million years ago. Trilobites curled up for protection, and the chiton, their modern equivalent, shares this ability. Despite its appearance, which resembles a flattened piece of shrimp nigiri, the chiton is a marine mollusk that clings to tidepool rocks. Like trilobites, several animals, including three-banded armadillos, pill bugs, and hedgehogs, can also roll into balls. Previously, many scientists believed that conglobation was a defense mechanism against predators, but Dr. Sigwart disputes this assumption. In lab experiments, Dr. Sigwart found that chitons roll into balls to regain their footing after losing it. Her research suggests that chitons can make decisions and may be more intelligent than previously thought.",

The underweight whale, still growing, was an unusual case, as adult sperm whales typically reach up to 120,000 pounds in weight. A post-mortem examination revealed that the whale's digestive system was severely clogged with 64 pounds of trash, including plastic bags, ropes, and a plastic drum, which it was unable to digest or pass through its system. This led to severe inflammation, ultimately causing the whale's decline and death. Sperm whales, which dive to great depths to hunt squid, often linger near the surface, making them vulnerable to ingesting floating debris that may be mistaken for food. Unfortunately, ocean pollution has devastating effects on wildlife, particularly in areas where buoyant debris accumulates in \"islands\" of trash that float above or just below the surface. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to contain at least 87,000 tons of plastic. Some scientists believe that plastic pollution may have a greater impact on animal populations than climate change. In 2008, two whales were found on a California beach with bags and netting in their stomachs, likely discarded by fishermen. One whale's stomach had ruptured, and the other, which had consumed over 160 pounds of trash, likely starved to death as the garbage obstructed its stomach. Authorities have released the results of a post-mortem examination as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the impact of plastic and trash in the coastal region's waters. Volunteers are working to clean up local beaches and urging the public to be more mindful of their plastic waste disposal. It is crucial that we address this issue through both cleanup efforts and education, ensuring our citizens are aware of the importance of protecting our environment.",

A fungus targeting gypsy moths was first detected in the Northeast in 1989, with efforts to introduce it as a biological control measure dating back to 1910. In 2000, a coordinated program was launched by 11 states and the US Forest Service to combat the gypsy moth infestation.

Scientists had previously thought the droplets moved due to air currents or sliding down a slope, but new research shows they can move independently. \"It's surprisingly simple,\" said David Quere, a scientist at Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris. \"The drop is running away, and it has a little motor inside, which is surprising.\" Quere and his colleagues published their findings in Nature Physics this week. To observe the Leidenfrost effect, droplets of water were placed on a very flat, very hot, nonabsorbent surface held in place by a needle. The surface must be at least 400 degrees Fahrenheit for the effect to occur. Some recipes use this test to determine whether a pan is hot enough. Large drops have a flattened shape, resembling puddles. Within each drop, two convective cells rotate in opposite directions, canceling out each other's motion. As the water evaporates, the droplet shrinks and becomes nearly spherical, allowing for only one convective cell to exist. When the needle is lifted, the smaller droplet speeds away in the direction of its convective spin. The researchers' next step is to guide the droplets through channels or temperature gradients. There are still fundamental phenomena to be explored, such as why the surface temperature must be significantly higher than the boiling point for the drops to levitate. Interestingly, there is currently no clear answer to this question.",

        "Text": "Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is home to billions of planets, many of which are invisible to human eyes - for now. Just three decades ago, we had no idea if there were planets beyond our own solar system. In 1995, astronomers made a groundbreaking discovery when they found a star in the constellation Pegasus wobbling due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive instruments that detect subtle changes in starlight caused by an orbiting planet. As a planet orbits its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again, a phenomenon that can be detected by these advanced instruments. The Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, revolutionized the field of exoplanet hunting by discovering thousands of planets. Unlike earlier methods, Kepler searched for small dips in starlight caused by a planet passing in front of its star. Kepler's findings were astounding, revealing a diverse range of exoplanets. In recent years, astronomers have made significant progress in directly imaging exoplanets, capturing blurry but tantalizing glimpses of alien landscapes. We've also discovered a free-floating planet and signs of planets being born. The next generation of planet hunters is now on the horizon. On April 16, 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, will launch and spend two years scanning the entire sky for minute dips in brightness caused by nearby alien worlds. TESS is equipped with four cameras that can cover a 96-degree swath of the sky. As a planet hunter, TESS's discoveries can be further studied by the next generation of telescopes on Earth and in space. If fortunate, TESS may uncover planets with lakes, oceans, and atmospheres rich in chemicals, allowing us to detect signs of habitability or even life. The Milky Way is estimated to harbor more planets than stars, with a vast diversity that remains largely unexplored. Our own planet remains the ultimate benchmark for our quest for life and meaning in the universe.",

Research has uncovered significant disparities in the diets of urban and rural rodents, with city rats enjoying a more diverse and stable diet compared to their rural counterparts. By analyzing brown rat remains from Toronto between 1790 and 1890, scientists found that city rats thrived on human waste, whereas country rats struggled to survive. According to Eric Guiry, city rats had a significantly higher proportion of meat in their diet, evident in their bones. Guiry and Michael Buckley are pioneers in paleoproteomics, using ancient bone proteins to gain insights into animal behavior. Guiry's interest in applying this technique to rats stemmed from a desire to learn about human populations in the 1800s without analyzing human remains.

The lander's seismometers, designed to detect marsquakes, picked up vibrations in the air, which are essentially sound waves. The moderate 10-15 mile-per-hour winds caused the lander's solar panels to vibrate, and the seismometers recorded these vibrations. This process is analogous to human hearing, with the solar panels acting like the eardrum, the spacecraft structure like the inner ear, and the seismometers converting vibrations into nerve signals. The recorded vibrations have a frequency of up to 50 Hertz, audible to humans as a low rumble. NASA has amplified the recording by two octaves, evoking the feeling of wind or ocean waves with an otherworldly quality. An air pressure sensor also detected sound vibrations, but at a much lower frequency audible only to certain animals. When sped up by a factor of 100, the air pressure sensor's readings raise the pitch by over six octaves. The instruments are not sensitive to higher frequencies, so the sounds are lower in frequency. Mars' incredibly thin air makes it more conducive to low-frequency sounds. The Viking landers detected some wind noise, but the recordings were made at lower sampling rates and didn't pick up any sounds at audible frequencies. The Viking seismometer detected spacecraft movements, but it would be a stretch to describe them as sounds.

Despite this, scientists discovered that meteorites that fall on Earth differ significantly from asteroids that pass through our neighborhood. According to Philipp R. Heck, curator at the Field Museum of Natural History, \"That's what everybody would have expected,\" but planetary scientists were surprised to find that the most common types of meteorites on Earth are not common in space. A recent study published in Nature Astronomy revealed that mineralogical evidence in some meteorites suggests a massive collision in the asteroid belt around 466 million years ago. Dr. Heck estimates that during this time, skywatchers would have witnessed about 100 times more shooting stars than we see today. To investigate meteorites that landed on Earth before this collision, Dr. Heck and his colleagues turned to ancient limestone from Russia, which dates back around a million years. They extracted 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite from almost 600 pounds of rock. These crystals remain unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, allowing scientists to determine that 41 of them originated from space and were once part of specific types of asteroids. The mix of meteorites from this ancient period was strikingly different from what we see today, with more than a third belonging to a type called primitive achondrites, compared to less than half a percent today. The findings align with the growing understanding that the composition of meteorites is shaped by the history of asteroid collisions in the asteroid belt, rather than the proximity of asteroids to Earth's orbit.

According to figures released Friday, Uber's ride-hailing service experienced a significant surge in gross bookings, reaching $20 billion in 2016, more than doubling the previous year's total. Net revenue, factoring in driver costs, reached $6.5 billion. Despite its growth, Uber remains in the red, reporting an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding Uber China's costs. This loss is attributed to investments in China, which ultimately led to the sale of Uber China to Didi Chuxing. The release of these figures, previously reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by Uber, marks the first public disclosure of the company's financial data. While some financial information has leaked in the past, this is the first time the figures have been publicly available.

So, what drives their popularity? While it's an exaggeration to say they're a necessity, sound bars have gained widespread appeal due to their effective solution of two key issues. Unlike older TVs with ample space for speakers, modern flat-panel displays are compact, leaving little room for sound reproduction. As a result, smaller speakers struggle to produce high-quality sound. Additionally, the limited space on the front of the TV led manufacturers to relocate speakers to the bottom or back of the panel. Meanwhile, people transitioned from playing music on CDs to streaming it on computers and phones. Sound bars, with their sleek design, eliminate the need for additional cables or equipment, featuring built-in Bluetooth for seamless wireless music playback.",

Male elk, or bulls, typically don't live beyond five years due to hunting, whereas female elk, or cows, can live up to 20 years. Notably, cows over the age of 10 appear to be nearly invulnerable to hunters. A team of scientists sought to understand why senior cows are so skilled at survival. Is it because these elk are naturally more cautious, thereby allowing them to evade hunters more effectively? Or can cows learn to avoid hunters over their lifetime, even if they initially exhibit more daring behavior? Research published in PLOS One suggests that both factors are involved. By tracking dozens of female elk over several years, the authors found that, overall, cautious cows were more likely to survive. However, they also discovered that individual cows could adapt their behavior and adopt stealthier strategies as they aged. As cows aged, they tended to move shorter distances and seek safer terrain if they sensed a higher risk of encountering hunters.",

Despite human-defined boundaries, wolves remain unaffected by human efforts to restrict their movement. A recent study in Wildlife Monographs suggests that controlling wolf populations outside the preserve has had adverse effects on wolves within it. The study reveals that when Alaskan authorities culled wolf populations outside the preserve, survival rates within the preserve were lower than usual. This highlights the importance of communication and cooperation between wildlife managers within and outside preserve boundaries, with potential implications for global wildlife management programs. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has invested millions in an intensive predator management program since the 1990s, initially using sterilization and later shooting and killing hundreds of wolves from helicopters. Despite decades of effort, the program has failed to significantly increase the Fortymile caribou herd population, which remains at around 50,000 to 60,000. Research suggests that these efforts may not be effective in increasing caribou numbers. Over 22 years of monitoring wolves using radio collars, researchers found that wolf survival rates decreased during lethal management outside the preserve.

Similarly, in humans, this type of behavior is linked to creativity and cognitive complexity. Nevertheless, understanding the human mind's capacity for randomness is a complex task. A team of European researchers recently conducted a series of experiments to measure human random decision-making abilities. They discovered that, on average, individuals are most skilled at producing random results around the age of 25. The team designed five tasks to test randomness, including simulating random coin flips, guessing the next card in a shuffled deck, and arranging a grid of black and white boxes to appear random. Over 3,400 participants from 4 to 91 years old took part in the experiment. The researchers used software to analyze participants' responses and identified the sequences that were most challenging for the computer to predict as the most random. By analyzing participants' performance against various factors, including age, sex, and educational background, the researchers found a strong correlation with age. Performance improved from childhood to the mid-20s and remained relatively high until the 60s, after which it began to decline. However, even in older adults, there may be trade-offs that compensate for decreased randomness, such as increased experience and knowledge.",

Sometimes we struggle to cry when we should, and other times we cry without apparent cause. Amidst this emotional complexity, it's refreshing to consider the straightforward explanation behind why onions make us tear up. Onions release a chemical called lachrymatory factor, which irritates our eyes when it reacts with other substances. Chopping, cutting, crushing, or smashing an onion causes our eyes to water because the onion's cells break open, allowing two previously separate substances to combine and form a potent chemical irritant. According to Josie Silvaroli, this chemical reaction is analogous to tear gas, as it releases a gas that hits the eyes and sensory nerves, causing them to tear up. The lachrymatory factor evolved as a defense mechanism to protect onions from microbes and animals, including humans. When an onion is damaged, it triggers this defense mechanism, releasing the chemical reaction as its cells break down.",

The original ruling had dismissed the lawsuit, stating that the three men had not shown that the article was about them personally, aside from their affiliation with the fraternity.

Years of conservation efforts by the Chinese government have led to a remarkable resurgence in the panda population. In September 2016, the pandas were officially removed from the endangered species list, with an estimated population of 1,864, excluding cubs. This represents a significant increase from the low of around 1,200 in the 1980s. However, climate change and other factors could still devastate the pandas' habitat in the long term, rendering any population surge a temporary triumph. The fragmentation of the panda population, now confined to just six mountain ranges and 30 isolated groups, is a major concern. According to Dr. Ouyang and her colleagues, Chinese conservation efforts have had a positive impact on panda habitats in recent years, and planned changes are expected to reduce pressures on the pandas and their habitat in the short term. However, infrastructure development, tourism, and other human activities could undermine these improvements. To prevent the pandas from becoming endangered again, researchers recommend improving connectivity between isolated panda populations, reducing habitat fragmentation, establishing ecological red lines, expanding panda preserves, and restricting tourism in national parks containing pandas.",

Officially recognized as the largest known terrestrial organism on the planet by the United States Forest Service, this enormous organism is a highly destructive forest pathogen. Other Armillaria species are prevalent in North America, Europe, and Asia, causing root rot disease in forests, parks, orchards, and vineyards. These fungi send out stringy rhizomorphs that target weak trees, colonize their roots, and ultimately kill and consume them. Scientists have made a breakthrough in the fight against these fungal giants, uncovering the genetic secrets behind Armillaria's remarkable ability to develop its unique rhizomorphs, grow to enormous sizes, and excel at killing host plants.",

Research suggests that our sense of smell is more acute at specific times of day, typically peaking before sleep, due to fluctuations linked to our internal body rhythms. A study published in Chemical Senses investigated how the senses of taste and smell influence obesity in teenagers, led by sensory researcher Rachel Herz at Brown University. The experiment involved 37 teenagers aged 12 to 15 who spent nine days in a lab, following a strict schedule to regulate their sleep and wake cycles. This allowed researchers to isolate the impact of the body's internal clock on metabolic processes. While more research is needed to determine if these findings apply to adults, Dr. Herz notes that the types of smell receptors in our noses remain consistent across age, yet internal clocks may evolve.",

These remarkable 'trees' aren't plants, but rather intricate homes built by Christmas tree worms on coral reefs worldwide. Constructed from calcium carbonate secretions, these tubes serve as homes for the worms, who emerge to feed, reproduce, and breathe using their branchial crowns. As you snorkel through the waters, look out for these vibrant, spiral-shaped cones that resemble miniature decorated firs. According to marine biologist Orly Perry, these 'trees' are \"really pretty, very colorful, very festive, and Christmassy.\" Despite their small size, these worm 'trees' make up for it with dazzling displays that rival the work of a skilled candymaker. In the Gulf of Aqaba, near Eilat, Israel, Perry has observed many of these 'trees' displaying a kaleidoscope of colors, including purples, greens, and whites. Unlike other creatures, Christmas tree worms don't burrow into the coral; instead, they latch onto dead spots or wounds and construct their tubes. By synchronizing their tube growth with the coral's growth, the worms ensure their homes remain stable and accessible. Once settled, these worms stay put for up to 30 or 40 years, unable to relocate. The locations where these larvae settle are not arbitrary; they appear to have a specific preference for certain coral species, often opting for less aggressive ones. In optimal environments, the worms are able to grow to their full size. According to Mrs. Perry, this phenomenon is reminiscent of human behavior: \"If you're comfortable in a place, everything is happy, and that's true for these worms too. Their size is directly impacted by their habitat choice.\" Some species within the Spirobranchus genus have a fondness for artificial surfaces, while others thrive on specific types of coral. Mrs. Perry discovered a potentially new species in the Gulf of Eilat that has a peculiar affinity for plastic buoys and metal surfaces on piers and staircases. It's possible that the larvae are drawn to these preferred habitats by signals emitted by older worms that have successfully colonized similar locations in the past.\"",

Researchers previously reported no cancer cases in these long-lived rodents, either in the wild or in zoos, and even injected their cells with viruses that trigger tumors in mice without observing any adverse effects. However, a recent study published in Veterinary Pathology has identified two cases of cancer in naked mole rats housed in zoos. According to Martha Delaney, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and lead author of the study, these cases do not rule out the possibility that naked mole rats may hold a clue to fighting cancer, but rather provide additional insights about what makes them less susceptible to cancer. The discovery of cancer in naked mole rats is significant, as researchers have been studying the rodents for over a decade to understand why they are less prone to cancer. The first case of cancer was identified in a 22-year-old male naked mole rat from the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that develops from the body's mucus-secreting glands. Now that we have two cases of cancer in naked mole rats, we can study the colonies from which they came to understand why they are more prone to cancer compared to other zoo and research colonies.",

According to Carroll Muffett, Exxon's predecessor, Humble Oil, was aware of rising CO2 levels and global warming potential as early as 1957. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies, and organizations formed the Smoke and Fumes Committee to monitor pollution research and use science to undermine environmental regulations. Muffett believes the committee's actions would be echoed in later efforts to discredit climate science. The Center for International Environmental Law's work was first reported by Inside Climate News, which has previously published stories suggesting Exxon Mobil understood climate change risks from its own research and used that knowledge to plan activities. Exxon Mobil's own research funded climate denial groups until the mid-2000s. The investigations have led to a surge in activism against the company and energy industry, with the hashtag #exxonknew.

Exxon Mobil is pushing back against an investigation into its knowledge of climate change, claiming the inquiry is not credible.

To promote the US release of \"The Angry Birds Movie\" on Friday, Rovio is offering bonus content in its new mobile game, Angry Birds Action, to those who open the app during the movie's credits. This cross-platform marketing strategy is part of Rovio's efforts to revitalize its Angry Birds brand and become a global media powerhouse. The original Angry Birds game, released in 2009, was a massive hit, but sales have slowed in recent years, leading the company to diversify into consumer products and reduce its reliance on mobile games. Despite these efforts, Rovio reported a 13 million euro loss in 2015.

For some, this may be accompanied by other symptoms: sudden back pain, a kick in the lower abdomen, or an urgent need to use the restroom. These sensations are reminiscent of those experienced by individuals who have passed a kidney stone. Researchers created a silicone cast of the inside of a kidney to study the effects of roller coasters on kidney stones. The study found that moderate-intensity, rattling roller coasters may dislodge small kidney stones in the outer ducts of the kidney and propel them towards the ureter. The study suggests that riding these roller coasters could be a potential treatment for patients with kidney stones five millimeters or less in diameter. A patient's passing of kidney stones after each of three consecutive rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster inspired the study. Dr. Wartinger and Dr. Mitchell created a 3D-printed silicone cast of a patient's kidney, filled it with kidney stones and urine, and rode the roller coaster 20 times, observing the movement of the kidney stones. The back of a roller coaster is a more effective spot to dislodge a small kidney stone, with a success rate of 64% compared to 17% at the front. Each year, over 300,000 Americans seek emergency care for kidney stones, often due to severe pain caused by a large stone lodged in their ureter. However, it's unlikely that a roller coaster ride would provide relief for those with larger stones. Dr. Borin notes that this study is specifically designed for individuals with small kidney stones.

The Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, a former chemical production facility, has contaminated the surrounding waterways, allowing toxic substances to seep into aquatic animals' bodies. Despite the toxic environment, some aquatic animals have miraculously survived, including the Atlantic killifish, a small, silver fish that has adapted to thrive in this polluted ecosystem. The killifish's ability to survive in polluted waters is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation. Researchers first discovered the fish's tolerance to toxic waters in the late 1990s and have since found that distinct populations of killifish have independently developed similar genetic adaptations to survive in highly polluted areas along the Atlantic coastline. The study reveals that evolution can occur independently in different populations and that similar genetic changes can emerge in response to extreme environments. The study provides a valuable example of how animals can adapt to rapidly changing environments.

He had just returned from a cross-country trip with two college friends, including future Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, which began in a 1935 Packard hearse and ended with the trio hopping freight trains back home.\n\nMeryman went on to become Life magazine's first human affairs editor, writing profiles of extraordinary people in everyday life. His subjects included a struggling family on Chicago's South Side and a single mother giving up her baby for adoption. Meryman was one of the first writers to use a tape recorder, conducting interviews with notable figures such as Ingmar Bergman, Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Horne, Paul McCartney, Laurence Olivier, and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nMeryman's most famous interview was with Marilyn Monroe, which appeared in Life magazine on August 3, 1962, just two days before her death at the age of 36.

The series, following siblings in a post-apocalyptic world, garnered 100,000 views without promotional efforts. Following its release on Netflix, Hulu, and PlayStation, it attracted tens of thousands more viewers. According to Mr. Pizzolo, catering to both core comic book fans and new audiences is essential. The inaugural series on the YouTube channel will feature a mix of comics from Black Mask and other independent publishers, including \"Liberator,\" focusing on animal welfare activists, and \"Five Ghosts,\" following an adventurer possessed by literary characters. The channel will include links to purchase the comics and related merchandise.\n\nBlack Mask Studios was founded in 2012 by Mr. Pizzolo, a filmmaker, Steve Niles, a writer of horror novels and comics, and Brett Gurewitz, a musician and founder of Epitaph Records. The company was born out of \"Occupy Comics,\" a project aimed at raising funds for the Occupy Wall Street movement. This experience highlighted the challenges of publishing comics with a message. With the upcoming release of the animated version of \"Godkiller\" and \"Liberator,\" Black Mask will have a broader platform to share its message. Before the International Comic Con in July, the company will release the first part of the animated \"Godkiller.\" Kirkus Reviews has praised the comic's first volume, describing it as \"wickedly delectable\" and \"an experience rather than a story.\" Black Mask is also developing three comic-based TV series: \"Sinatoro,\" \"The Disciples,\" and \"Ballistic.\" Despite its small size, with only a handful of employees and freelancers, the company remains committed to its mission. Black Mask operates like a startup, with a scrappy and entrepreneurial spirit. As executive producers, we ensure that the creators of the comics are involved throughout the process. Historically, film and TV executives would often use comic books as a starting point and then depart from the original material, but now we're seeing a trend towards more faithful adaptations, which is a direct result of our hands-on approach.",

Over the past 15 years, scientists have made significant strides in creating materials that can manipulate light, radar, radio, sound, and seismic waves in ways that defy natural laws. The concept of metamaterials was first proposed by Russian physicist Victor Veselago in 1967 and later developed by physicist David R. Smith and his team in 1999.

However, researchers have since gained a deeper understanding of the science and are now driving innovation in various fields, including radio antennas, radar, cosmetics, soundproofing, and earthquake-resistant construction.

Home loan rates are unlikely to revert to traditional levels but will likely remain moderate, having prompted millions of homeowners to refinance and contributed to the housing market's recovery. As 10-year government bond yields rise in response to signs of economic improvement and the Federal Reserve's plan to reduce bond purchases, mortgage rates have quickly followed suit. On Thursday, 30-year fixed mortgage rates reached 4.25 percent, up from 4.12 percent the day before, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hinted at easing stimulus efforts later this year. Just a few months ago, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.5 percent, near a historic low. In contrast, credit card borrowing costs are already at relatively high levels, and rates on short-term loans, such as car loans and home equity loans, are tied to short-term interest rates, which the Fed has indicated will not rise before 2015. The rate on a five-year car loan is currently around 4 percent, similar to its level in mid-May. A fixed-rate home equity loan carries a rate of 6.1 percent, not far from where it was a month ago. The Fed's decision to keep the short-term bank lending rate at close to zero means savers will not see any improvement in the low interest rates paid on savings accounts, money market accounts, and short-term certificates of deposit, which are also tied to short-term rates.",

According to the Commerce Department's report, released on Thursday, goods exports reached $126.4 billion and services exports $49.1 billion, while imports totalled $219.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $43.7 billion, the lowest since December. The revised March deficit was $46.8 billion, down from the initial estimate of $48.2 billion. Economists had forecast the deficit would swell to $48.8 billion. A weaker US dollar has made American goods more competitive globally, while growing demand in developing nations has driven up export prices. The Commerce Department attributed the April surge in exports to increased sales of industrial supplies, capital goods, and consumer goods. The decline in imports was partly due to a decrease in automotive parts, vehicles, and industrial supplies, the department said.",

However, Geithner stressed that the plan's actual impact will depend on the details, which remain unclear until it takes concrete shape.",

        "Text": "The University of Chicago's Joe and Rika Mansueto Library boasts a futuristic design, eschewing traditional bookshelves in favor of something unique. Despite offering nearly one million items online, the library has also invested in cutting-edge technology. Unlike other academic libraries, the Mansueto Library is one of the largest and latest to incorporate automated storage and retrieval systems, housing its volumes in solid steel cases 50 feet underground. Books can be retrieved through a complex system of cranes and elevators, evoking the door-sorting machine from Pixar's \"Monsters Inc.\" The $81 million Mansueto Library has a capacity for 3.5 million volumes, freeing up space in the main library's cramped stacks. The Mansueto Library also features a lab that serves dual purposes: digitization and conservation. The lab not only repairs and rebinds the university's books, including ancient papyrus volumes, but also cleans and prepares materials for scanning, which are then shared with partner Google Books.",

        "Text": "Despite a $30 million budget reduction, the Brownsville Independent School District is prioritizing its chess program, allocating $400,000 this year. This notable investment distinguishes the district from others nationwide. Jay Harris, who oversees the program, says Brownsville's commitment to chess is unmatched. As a city struggling with poverty and situated on the US-Mexico border, the district views chess as a valuable tool for student success and a source of community pride. This year, approximately 4,000 students have enrolled in the district's chess programs, which include regular tournaments. Typically, 500 to 800 students attend these events.",

        "Text": "James Anthony, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, frequently finds common ground with iPhone and iPod Touch developers due to their shared programming background. Anthony and others learned about Apple's hit mobile devices through Stanford's popular iPhone applications course, which launched in 2008. Anthony took the class as a senior, while many others learned through free video recordings on iTunes U, which consistently ranks as one of the most downloaded courses. Stanford's online class remains the primary way to learn about iPhone development, but online students miss out on the in-person benefits. This term's classes are not available online, although past sessions are typically uploaded to iTunes U within two to three days. Stanford is unable to discuss the new iPad due to rights issues, but a lecture from last winter provided valuable tips for iPad programming. Despite limitations, past classes offer iPhone developers a rare opportunity to gain insight from Apple, notoriously secretive about its technology.",

Stephanie Fiore struggled to find space for her extensive shoe collection in her compact closet. Meanwhile, above, roommates Letticia Camacho and Juliet Dolan chuckled at the serendipitous coincidence of matching color schemes: turquoise-and-purple hangers, storage boxes, and sheets. On the fifth floor, Mohamed Sako left his door ajar, his stereo playing Nicki Minaj's \"Your Love\" lyrics: \"You got spark, you, you got spunk.\" Only 500 of Queens College's 20,000 students enjoy the rare privilege of living on campus, a perk that is a major draw for commuters who access the college by car and bus, but not subway. The Summit, officially known as the dorm, offers rooms with full kitchens, cable TV, wireless internet, and private bathrooms, creating a hotel-like atmosphere with carpeted hallways, a glass-encased gym, and a lobby featuring flat-screen TVs. For residents, it's a convenient and coveted living arrangement, while for the college, it serves as a valuable recruitment tool, offering a unique selling point to prospective students.",

        "Text": "Researchers have recruited 3,000 educators from seven US school districts, comprising Dallas, Denver, Charlotte, North Carolina, Hillsborough County, Florida, Memphis, New York, and Pittsburgh. Participating teachers gave consent for classroom video recordings, with access restricted to researchers only. The project involves teachers from grades four to nine in regular public schools. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation requested additional recordings from Charlotte and Memphis teachers, with the understanding that these would not be subject to confidentiality agreements. Rachael Maher, a seventh-grade math teacher at Alexander Graham Middle School in Charlotte, volunteered to record her classes. For an hour, Ms. Maher taught her students the Pythagorean theorem while digital video equipment captured a panoramic view of the classroom. Two scorers from the Educational Testing Service reviewed the video footage to critique Ms. Maher's performance. The scorers, Edith Aurora Graf and Leslie Thornley, watched the video multiple times, analyzing Ms. Maher's rapport with her students, pacing, and transitions.",
