Its outgoing chairman, Terry Burns, fought hard to stay on, but the government declined to extend his tenure. Charles Gurassa, the deputy chairman of easyJet and a seasoned executive, has been appointed to take his place. Gurassa brings an impressive track record, having served as chairman, director, or non-executive director of 27 companies since 2003. Gurassa has a wealth of experience, primarily in the private sector. Before his current role, he was a director of leisure services at British Airways and has experience in the travel industry. However, he has no experience in television, except for watching Richard Branson sell Virgin Mobile to NTL and overseeing the sale of LoveFilm to Amazon. He's skilled at selling companies, not producing TV content. Ofcom and Downing Street have endorsed Gurassa's appointment, replacing a chairman who was a late convert to the Awkward Squad. It's possible that David Cameron will follow a similar precedent when selecting a new BBC chairman. We can only hope that Mr. Gurassa will uphold the ideals of independent public service, but it's hard to hold our breath.\"",

The recent stock market rally, triggered by the Bank of Japan's interest rate cut, has brought relief to many in the financial sector. Oil prices, which plummeted to $27 a barrel just two weeks ago, have risen to $34. However, investors are concerned that governments and central banks have yet to grasp the true extent of global economic fragility. The situation is precarious, with China's private debt levels reaching alarming heights, Europe's banking system still reeling from bad debts, and consumers worldwide exhibiting nervous behavior. When central banks acknowledge the importance of cheap money, investors rejoice, but when they suggest the world is recovering, investors panic. The recent reaction to the US Federal Reserve's smallest possible interest rate hike sent American consumers scrambling to stash their savings. New car sales declined in December, and consumer sentiment dipped in January, following a weak fourth quarter. The Fed noted that even a small rate hike would likely be ignored by US consumers, who are resilient. The Bank of Japan's interest rate cut is another sign of global economic weakness. Tokyo aims to generate domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and has introduced a negative interest rate to deter foreign funds and encourage domestic spending. The move has had the desired effect, with the yen falling against the dollar. We'll need to wait and see how this affects domestic demand. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has put aside its hopes of following the Fed's lead. Governor Mark Carney's recent speeches suggest a more cautious tone. Given the Federal Reserve's potential struggles to increase interest rates, it's unlikely that the UK would consider a rate hike. A rate hike would cause the pound to surge, making exports uncompetitive and leaving domestic businesses vulnerable to cheap imports. Carney is aware that the recent closure of the Scunthorpe steel plant is just the beginning of potential consequences.",

The 5p charge, introduced in October, applies to thin-gauge bags with handles from large retailers, with revenue going to charity. However, Card Factory claims it's not charging for bags without handles, citing a clarification from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. While the retailer still offers some bags with handles for the standard 5p fee, it has removed handles from thousands of bags to provide customers with a free alternative. The bag tax was introduced in England to align with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, which already had similar levies in place. Since the tax was introduced, retailers like Tesco have reported significant reductions in single-use bag usage, with Asda noting a decline of over 90% in Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.

The allergy is so severe that even being in the same room as someone consuming chocolate poses a threat to the child's health. The school's headteacher, Owain Hyett, explained in a letter to parents that the school will be completely chocolate-free, including the staff room and office, to ensure the pupil's safety. Parents have been asked to remove all traces of chocolate from their children's bags and to avoid packing chocolate products in their lunches. The catering department is working to replace chocolate products on the school menu, and staff will be responsible for ensuring that all areas of the school remain chocolate-free. The decision has sparked controversy among some parents, who feel that they were not consulted and that the ban is too broad. One parent questioned the practicality of the ban, asking how staff would enforce it and whether they would have to inspect lunchboxes for chocolate. The ban is part of a growing trend of schools accommodating children with severe allergies. Many primary schools and nurseries have already implemented bans on nuts due to the rising prevalence of nut intolerance among children. National regulations have prompted many schools to prohibit crisps and chocolate from being brought into lunchboxes due to health concerns. A primary school in Kent has taken this step, banning fruit juice from being brought in due to its high sugar content.",

EDF directors had been set to meet this week to approve a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, but a final decision has been pending since October. China's state nuclear firm CGN agreed to take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping. EDF executives have delayed a final decision due to funding issues, according to French financial journal Les Echos. The company is reportedly seeking help from the French government to find new backers to join the project alongside CGN. Although directors are scheduled to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, no decision is expected until the next meeting, which will take place before the release of final results on February 15. EDF has declined to comment on the matter. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, and the UK government has faced criticism for agreeing to pay EDF £92.50 per unit of electricity, more than double the market rate. A group of EDF employee-shareholders has also urged the company to abandon the Hinkley project, citing concerns that it could put the company's survival at risk. Green campaigners argue that any fresh delay highlights the flaws in a deal intended to kickstart a new generation of nuclear power in the UK. The EDF board is clearly rattled by this crucial investment decision, said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace. This delay could signal the end of Hinkley. EDF managers and employee representatives on the board are concerned that the project is too risky and too expensive. He also criticized former Chancellor George Osborne for defending the Hinkley project.",

The company claims that increased fees to enter the newly privatized Newcastle port will significantly impact coal producers' profit margins. Glencore's appeal comes amid declining share prices and job cuts in its zinc production operations worldwide. The company is challenging a 2015 decision by the then-acting treasurer, Mathias Cormann, who declined to declare the port's fees as excessive. If successful, the appeal would allow Glencore to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration, potentially leading to lower port fees. The tribunal battle will focus on technical issues related to competition laws and the impact of privatization and price increases. Glencore argues that the port's unconstrained pricing and monopoly over access create uncertainty for coal producers and acquirers in the Hunter Valley. The company claims that the port's monopoly power will significantly impact coal producers' profit margins. The Australian government has yet to respond to Glencore's application. The case will test the limited types of review available to the Australian Competition Tribunal in \"access\" cases.

They argue that this would bring more direct ownership and accountability to the broadcaster, rather than the current system, which allows for excessive government interference. In a letter to the Times, Thomas and Baker wrote that the BBC is a \"public service\" broadcaster, but its ownership and accountability are unclear. They believe that the current proposals, which would give the government more control over the BBC, do not address the issues of ownership and accountability. Instead, they propose mutualizing the BBC, which would give licence fee payers a direct say in the organization's governance. Becoming members and owners of the BBC would enable TV licence holders to address the ownership deficit. As members, they would elect representatives to hold the executive management accountable for their actions. Key issues like executive compensation and resource allocation would be decided at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) that would be open to all members, either in person or online. This would fill the accountability gap and provide a strong defense against political interference. Mutualising the BBC would not only lend credibility to the licence fee, but also foster a sense of unity between the BBC and its audience, which is essential for the BBC's success.",

The prevalence of racism in the media is often linked to the industry's lack of diversity, which has remained stagnant over the years. In 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders found that the media predominantly reported and wrote from a white perspective, with fewer than 5% of editorial staff members being African American. In 2015, only 4.7% of newsroom employees were African American, despite making up 13.2% of the US population. Hispanic people comprised just 4% of employees in 2015, compared to 17.4% of the US population. The problem lies not in a lack of qualified minority candidates, but rather three obstacles that hinder their entry into the media industry: inexperience on campus newspapers, the prevalence of unpaid internships, and a lack of social capital to gain access to hiring networks. A new civil lawsuit against the New York Times this week draws on statistics related to representation, citing a 2014 study by the Women's Media Center, which found that New York Times reporters were 3.5 times more likely to cite men as sources than women. In 2015, the Women's Media Center released a report for the second consecutive year, revealing that the New York Times had the largest gender gap in bylines, with only 32% of articles written by women compared to 68% written by men.

This unseasonable warmth is a clear indication of the devastating effects of climate change. The country has been consistently breaking temperature records, with February being the hottest month on record and March shattering that record shortly after. In fact, March 2016 was the warmest March on record in Australia. The Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook predicts above-average temperatures will persist across the country at least through May.\n\nAccording to David Karoly, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, climate change has increased the likelihood of March breaking temperature records in Australia by at least seven times. \"The previous record had a one in 43-year chance of occurring naturally, but now it happens about once every six years due to human-caused climate change,\" Karoly said. \"This is evidence that climate change is already happening and increasing the risks of extreme heat.\"\n\nBlair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology notes that while April may not set a new record, it will still be significantly warmer than normal. Throughout May, there is an 80% chance that temperatures across most of the country will be warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. By June and July, coastal regions will continue to experience unusually warm weather, but temperatures will return to normal in central and southern Australia.\n\nThe current warm spell is partly due to the monster El Niño event that occurred in 2015, which spread warm water across the Pacific Ocean. However, this is happening on top of the background of global warming, Trewin said. In an El Niño year, the world tends to experience extreme temperatures, while in other years, temperatures are merely above average. \"La Niña events were typically followed by normal or slightly cool global temperatures.\"",

Led by former National Highway Traffic Administration administrator David Strickland, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets aims to bring autonomous vehicles to US roads nationwide. The coalition claims that self-driving cars will reduce crashes by 94%, as human error causes most accidents. However, experts warn that tech companies may gain legal protection over car owners in the event of a crash. This could pose a challenge for personal injury lawyers, who are already concerned about the technology. Accident lawyer Daniel Vega fears that the lobbying group may unfairly protect tech companies and app makers over human car owners, leaving drivers responsible for accidents. Statistician Susan Paddock notes that testing self-driving cars is challenging, and consumers must become comfortable with uncertainty before adopting the technology. Paddock emphasizes that even if autonomous vehicle fleets travel 10 million miles, it's impossible to draw statistically significant conclusions about their safety and reliability. \"Uncertainty persists, and I'm unsure how the general public will react to this technology.\" Strickland stresses that the coalition's goal is to establish a single, national policy for self-driving cars, rather than navigating state regulations. \"The widespread adoption of self-driving vehicle technology will undoubtedly lead to safer and less congested roadways in America.\" To facilitate deployment, a clear, federal framework is essential, and the Coalition will work with policymakers to identify effective solutions.",

Committee chairman Frank Field plans to summon Green to testify before MPs as part of the inquiry. The collapse of BHS into administration will see the PPF take on the company's pension scheme. The retail sector suffered another blow with the collapse of clothing retailer Austin Reed, threatening over 1,000 jobs. Green and Dominic Chappell are facing scrutiny over their management of BHS. Calculations reveal that Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments, and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of BHS. BHS paid out £25m to Retail Acquisitions, led by Chappell, in the 13 months following the sale. Labour MP John Mann has called on Green to repay £400m in dividends paid out of BHS or relinquish his knighthood.

A simple and honourable solution is for Green to repay the dividends, live up to the name of his new yacht, or surrender his knighthood. The committee must examine the Pension Protection Fund and how the transfer of BHS's pension liabilities will affect the levy increases imposed on other eligible employers to fund the scheme.

The total lending figure of £17.1 billion marked a 64% increase from the same period last year, the highest figure since April 2008. In a rush to beat the deadline, buyers hastily closed property deals, while existing homeowners also surged, driven by the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. The average mortgage loan size reached a record high of £184,200, surpassing the previous peak of £158,000 in April 2008. However, the lending figures reveal an increasingly imbalanced financial landscape, with borrowing by manufacturers plummeting while buy-to-let speculation has soared. Lending to manufacturing companies, which had been growing at an annual rate of 12% in 2014, has come to a standstill, while construction lending is also declining. Meanwhile, personal borrowing on credit cards continues to rise, with British households making 223 million purchases in March, valued at £12.6 billion. Mortgage brokers are bracing for a decline in lending in April, citing the rush of transactions in March. While some predict a decline in the housing market, others believe that the EU referendum could benefit first-time buyers.

The Centre for Cities believes the government's plan to bridge the economic gap between the south and north is overly reliant on intercity transport links and insufficiently focused on enhancing individual city performance. The proposed HS3 rail link is a crucial component of the government's plan to address the UK's economic imbalances, but the thinktank argues that individual city performance is the key to success, not merely better rail links. The five most productive cities in Germany's Rhine-Ruhr region and the Netherlands' Randstad region, on average, are 40% more productive than their UK counterparts. A successful northern powerhouse necessitates stronger, more productive cities, and the government's initiative has the potential to significantly impact the north-south divide. To boost productivity, policymakers should address the skills gap in northern cities and enhance transportation within them. Local policymakers should be granted more autonomy to tackle the unique skills and transportation challenges they face.

Ball, who works under the pseudonym Docubyte, developed a fascination with retro computers and created the project to celebrate their uniqueness. He notes that it's rare to find machines that allow hands-on interaction today, as most computers have transitioned to touch screens. Ball believes that pre-Apple era computers are often overlooked as design pieces, and his nostalgia for their aesthetic led him to seek out and photograph a range of machines from the latter half of the 20th century. He found the machines at the Science Museum in London, the Dresden Technical Collections, and the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, and then meticulously enhanced the images with his colleagues at INK studio to make them appear modern. The retouching is essential to the piece. The series showcases striking machines like the Harwell Dekatron, the world's oldest functioning computer, and the Control Data 6600, often referred to as the first \"supercomputer.\" Ball says that the machines look attractive, but he would also like to create a comprehensive book about computing history. With a hint of poignancy, he notes that each of his images, rendered as a jpeg, is approximately 5mb in size – larger than any file that the individual computers could handle. They're lovely in their outdatedness.\n\nWith a touch of understatement, he notes, those old things are charmingly outdated.\n\nIn a restrained and unassuming manner, they possess a certain beauty in their obsolescence.",

The Commons work and pensions select committee will launch a comprehensive inquiry into the issue, likely to begin in the autumn. The spotlight has fallen on workers' occupational pensions due to BHS's collapse and Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result of the collapse. The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain's largest defined benefit plans, is facing cuts to facilitate a sale. The scheme has liabilities of almost £15 billion and a deficit of £700 million. The chair of the committee stated that the British Steel pension scheme's troubles are evidence of a broader threat to occupational pension schemes. The committee's case study on BHS is highlighting how such schemes are struggling due to rising life expectancy and record-low returns on capital. \"Pension law and regulation must adapt to the issues of the future, rather than the problems of the past,\" the chair said. \"We should not be under any illusions that British Steel is a special case. The entire savings edifice is at risk.\" The Labour MP noted that 11 million workers have private defined benefit pensions, but more than 5,000 of the associated pension schemes are in deficit, with a total shortfall of £805 billion. \"This will be a major inquiry that will consider radical solutions to one of the great problems of our time,\" he added. The committee will present a unique and free theatrical experience in London, featuring interviews with senior BHS executives and Dominic Chappell, and Sir Phillip Green will appear a week later.",

He expressed hope that any outcome would benefit the UK's membership, and acknowledged that the outcome of Brexit talks with the EU is uncertain. London remains the financial center for Europe, and English will continue to be the language of business, McFarlane said. HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint advised bankers to be cautious in making demands in the wake of the Brexit vote, which he described as a rejection of the \"expert class.\" Flint noted that the financial system's resilience was evident this week, as markets functioned smoothly despite a significant surge in trading volumes. Following the recent Brexit vote, Harriett Baldwin, a junior finance minister, sought to reassure the City of London by highlighting that banks maintain substantial reserves and the Bank of England is prepared to take action if needed. Baldwin stated that financial markets are capable of withstanding challenges, adapting quickly, and finding new opportunities. Cameron reportedly urged businesses not to become \"fixated\" on the EU, but instead to focus on building relationships and generating sales in other markets. The UK is not expected to begin negotiations with Brussels until autumn at the earliest, and possibly not until next year, after a new prime minister is chosen.

Despite reporting a 33% increase in underlying profits, the company's shares dropped to 216.88p before recovering to 225p. Carpetright's new financial year started poorly, with UK like-for-like sales declining 7.6% in May before rebounding to a 6.3% increase in June. According to Walsh, the current atmosphere is unusual, with consumers not behaving predictably. It's too early to gauge the full impact of the referendum on the company. Walsh has been working to revamp the retailer, introducing a new store design and customer service improvements. Research shows only 50% of surveyed customers would consider shopping at Carpetright.

Asda's sales plummeted by 5.9%, its worst performance on record, while Tesco's sales dropped by 1.3%, the best performance among major chains. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to thrive, with sales increasing by 11.5% and 13.8%, respectively, and their combined market share reaching a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is poised to surpass the Co-op and become the UK's fifth-largest supermarket. The latest figures do not include the period following the referendum, but analysts believe the decision to leave the EU will likely bolster discounters further. The immediate economic uncertainty is unlikely to cause a significant drop in grocery volumes, but may lead to higher prices and increased demand for discounters. Major supermarkets may benefit from a rise in prices, which have dropped by 1.4% over the three-month period. Store closures contributed to the decline in sales at Tesco and Morrisons, as the companies adjust to changing shopper habits. Supermarket sales experienced a surge in the four weeks leading up to June 18, driven by a boost in sales of snacks, beverages, and gourmet items during the Euro 2016 tournament. Beer, wine, and spirits sales jumped 6.2% year-over-year during this period, while crisp and snack sales rose 4.2%, marking the industry's first monthly sales increase in nearly a year.

The Confederation of British Industry's report reveals that the balance of retailers reporting sales increases minus those reporting decreases fell to 4% in June, down from 7% in May. While some retailers experienced an uptick, others reported slower growth or declines. Retailers anticipate a sales improvement in July, with the balance expected to shift to -10% from -5% in June. The CBI noted that retail sales reported weak growth in the year to June, exceeding expectations of a modest decline. Orders placed with suppliers decreased in June, although at a slower pace than the previous month. Internet sales growth slowed in the year to June, falling below the long-run average, but is expected to rebound strongly in July. The survey suggests that consumers were cautious in their spending before the EU referendum, but did not completely abstain. The question now is how well or poorly retail sales will perform in July following the UK's vote to leave the EU. After the Brexit vote, consumer spending will likely be heavily impacted due to increased uncertainty, potentially higher unemployment, and reduced purchasing power. A separate report from Lloyds Bank found that consumer spending on essential items decreased again in May, although at a slower pace than in previous months. Spending on essentials has been declining for 18 consecutive months, with a 0.4% year-over-year drop in May.

The broadcaster's share price plummeted by over 20% on Friday and continued to fall by more than 5% in early trading on Monday. By midday on Monday, ITV's share price had dropped to 164p, a significant decline from its pre-Brexit price of 220p and its one-year high of 280p. Investors' concerns about the impact of Brexit on ITV's advertising revenue have driven the company's market capitalization from £9 billion to around £6.5 billion in the days following the EU referendum. City analysts are now speculating that ITV could become a takeover target due to its declining share price and the UK's currency crash. According to Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum, major US media companies have historically and currently shown interest in the UK market, making a takeover bid more likely. Whittaker believes not only established media giants but also new media and tech companies may be interested in making a bid for ITV. NBC Universal has been rumored to have had an interest in bidding for ITV in the past. John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, has a 9.9% stake in ITV, and Malone is also a major shareholder in Discovery. Whittaker recommends that investors \"buy\" ITV's stock, citing the company's undervalued price following Friday's share price fall. Despite the post-Brexit vote, ITV's business fundamentals remain unchanged. Even if we assume a significant decline in advertising revenue similar to the post-Lehman crisis, ITV would still appear undervalued with an attractive dividend yield. In fact, even in a worst-case scenario, ITV's stock price would still be considered cheap. Liberum's analysis compared the 8.3% decline in TV advertising in 2009 to the 8.7% fall in 2010, while media stocks continued to decline, with Sky falling by almost 3%, Trinity Mirror dropping 10%, the Daily Mail declining by almost 4%, and WPP decreasing by 2.3%.",

Centrica, British Gas's parent company, attributed the decline to increased competition and expiring long-term contracts. The decline was partially offset by a June surge, according to British Gas. Energy analyst Claire Osborne noted that British Gas's market share is being eroded by both smaller and larger suppliers. British Gas is the only major supplier to have lowered its standard gas prices three times since last year. Despite this, its best deal remains more expensive than the cheapest option. Centrica reported a 6% decline in operating profit at its UK home business, falling to £635 million. The company's total revenue fell 13% to £13.4 billion. Centrica has implemented £141 million in cost cuts and aims to achieve £750 million in savings by 2020. The company is currently reducing its workforce by 6,000 jobs, with plans to cut 3,000 staff by the end of the year. CEO Iain Conn described the first half of the year as challenging, but the company has responded strongly and made significant progress.

According to Olivetree Financial data, compiled for FT Money, FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 company directors made more than £18.5m in share purchases between June 23 and July, the largest amount in at least 10 years. The sectors most affected by the Brexit news - banks, housebuilders, retailers, and travel companies - saw the largest director purchases. Many boardroom directors benefited from these deals as the stock market rebounded following the initial dramatic falls. The majority of these transactions took place in late June and early July. The largest single transaction in the FTSE 100 was made by the Darwazah family, Hikma Pharmaceuticals' founding shareholders, who purchased £3.3m of shares the day after the Brexit vote. Tony Pidgley, chairman of Berkeley Group, bought nearly £800,000 of shares on June 27 and has seen their value increase by 15% since then. Lloyds Banking Group saw the most director purchases, with 21 directors buying shares worth over £750,000. Provident Financial was second, with seven directors buying nearly £1.5m of stock, followed by Vodafone, where five directors purchased £1.4m of shares.

Italy's economy has been stagnant for over two decades, characterized by slow growth, declining competitiveness, and high unemployment. As a result, non-performing loans have ballooned to €360 billion, equivalent to 18% of all outstanding loans, severely impacting Italian banks. While non-performing loans are a symptom of the problem, they do not cause it. Unlike Greece, Ireland, and Spain, Italy did not experience a significant economic boom before the 2008-09 financial crisis, and its performance has consistently been underwhelming. As a result, the economy is 10% smaller than it was before the crisis, and unemployment is high, particularly in southern Italy. Before joining the euro, Italy could have boosted its competitiveness by devaluing the lira, but this option is no longer available. This creates a significant risk: a European slowdown following Brexit, combined with Italy's already weak economy, could lead to bank failures and small investors being forced to absorb losses. If the Five Star Movement, which has pledged to hold a referendum on leaving the euro, were to come to power, the possibility of Quitaly cannot be ruled out. In the event of a Quitaly, the single currency would likely collapse.",

The report suggests that 12% of agents have reported a decline in asking rents over the past 10 days. While the report indicates that the rental market has thus far responded to Brexit in a calm manner, the organization warns that continued uncertainty could lead to turbulence in the coming months. David Cox, managing director of Arla, emphasized the need for the new government to prioritize housing and the rental market, citing concerns that a lack of certainty could lead to institutional investors pulling out of the market, ultimately impacting tenants by reducing supply and increasing rents.\n\nThe report also found that almost 36% of Arla members have reported a reduction or no change in the number of prospective tenants looking for properties. Notably, overall supply and demand for rental accommodation increased in June, with prospective tenants seeing a 12% average increase and properties on agents' books rising by an average of 3%. According to Cox, the key takeaway from the Brexit vote is that supply and demand remain a significant issue in the rental market. If supply continues to dwindle against growing demand, renting will become more difficult and expensive for tenants, regardless of the eventual implications of Brexit.\n\nA recent report by the Taxpayer's Alliance recommends slashing stamp duty on homes by half and eventually eliminating it altogether. The report argues that the current tax is exacerbating supply shortages and driving up rents for tenants. Specifically, it suggests abolishing the 3% surcharge on buy-to-let and additional homes, warning that investors will likely pass on the costs to tenants, further increasing rents.",

In 2015, there were 6,700 applications for new retail developments, a drop from 7,360 the previous year. This represents a nearly 50% decline from the 11,900 applications in 2008, before the recession. The report highlights the ongoing challenges faced by shopkeepers as consumers increasingly turn to online shopping. Despite efforts to expand online presence, many traditional retailers struggle to keep pace with online-only brands. The report suggests that Brexit uncertainty could exacerbate these challenges, with potential negative impacts on the UK economy. According to Aimee Barrable of EMW, the success of online retailers has led to decreased appetite for new shop openings. Many retailers instead develop online services or repurpose existing space. Recent high-profile closures could lead to increased retail space, attracting retailers seeking high street presence. Some retailers may delay new shop developments until the Brexit vote's economic impact becomes clearer. Last week's retail sales statistics showed a 0.9% decline between May and June, exceeding economists' 0.6% expectation. The decline was partly attributed to inclement weather, but also hints at Brexit's impact on consumer spending.",

The firm received a severe reprimand and must pay £750,000 towards the FRC's costs. The fine was reduced from £3.5 million after mitigation and a settlement discount. PwC admitted that its conduct fell short of expected standards in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC stated that PwC had insufficient audit evidence regarding the loan loss provision and failed to identify inadequate disclosure of the impairment policy in the financial statements. The watchdog said that the disclosures were not in compliance with accountancy rules. PwC acknowledged that certain aspects of its 2007 audit did not meet expected standards. Audit quality is a top priority for PwC, and the FRC's annual audit quality assessments have shown a trend of improvement in its work over several years. The substantial fines imposed reflect the seriousness of the audit failings and will send a strong signal to the audit community about the importance of upholding high standards of professional conduct in audit work. PwC and its audit engagement partner, Simon Bradburn, were sued by Cattles, which alleged that the accountants acted negligently in their auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis.

This modern twist on an ancient riddle is sure to captivate partygoers and puzzle enthusiasts alike. Three friends visit a carnival with a 1.2-liter jerry can filled with rum punch. Upon arrival, they decide to split the drinks among three separate sound systems. To do so, they must divide the punch equally among themselves. Fortunately, they brought two large bottles to aid in the task. However, they soon discover that these bottles lack measurements. One of the friends finds an empty 50cl Red Stripe can and a 15cl vial marked 'rave juice' on the ground. A nearby water tap allows them to clean the can and vial. Using only these vessels and the knowledge that the jerry can initially held 1.2 liters of punch, how do the friends manage to divide the punch into three equal portions?

Analysts are revising their growth forecasts for the third quarter, ranging from 0.4% to 0.5%. The upward revision to growth in the second quarter has bolstered hopes of avoiding a recession. Prior to the Brexit vote, the economy had significant momentum, and while it will likely slow in the second half of 2016, it will not experience two consecutive quarters of declining output. The government received less welcome news, as the UK's balance of payments deficit widened to 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016. The deterioration in the UK's trade performance was the primary driver of this increase, highlighting the imbalance in the economy. In essence, domestic producers are struggling to keep up with consumer demand. The post-Brexit decline in the value of sterling will make exports more competitive, but it will also curb consumer spending by making imports more expensive. Turning around the balance of payments will be a significant challenge, regardless of the outcome of the referendum. The Bank of England may reconsider cutting interest rates again in November, given the economy's resilience in the face of Brexit. The current interest rate of 0.25% is already at a record low, and the bank may be hesitant to reduce it further. The Bank of England may choose to conserve its resources for future use, allowing Chancellor Philip Hammond to take the lead. Despite the recent positive growth news, stimulus measures in the autumn statement still seem likely. This is because the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote is likely to have a more significant impact on long-term business decisions rather than consumer spending. Hammond would be wise to temporarily pause deficit reduction during the two-year Brexit negotiation period, using the extra £30 billion to fund public investment. This approach would have a double benefit: it would help maintain economic growth and ensure that growth is more balanced.",

The decline in profits was attributed to increased online delivery costs and a decrease in sales of House of Fraser's own brands. Total sales remained steady at £573.5m, but established department stores experienced a 2.5% slump. Meanwhile, underlying sales showed a 0.9% increase, driven by a 17.8% rise in online sales. House of Fraser's CEO described the trading environment as \"extremely volatile\" and attributed the profit slump to a combination of factors, including record temperatures and Brexit uncertainty. Shoppers are now more likely to buy products to wear immediately, rather than waiting for sales, and consumer confidence concerns about the impact of Brexit on household finances are also a contributing factor. To combat these challenges, House of Fraser is introducing new brands and concessions. Despite struggling, House of Fraser's performance stood in stark contrast to the impressive results of online retailer Boohoo.com, which reported a 40% surge in sales and a 129% increase in pre-tax profits. Boohoo.com's success can be attributed to its ability to attract 28% more customers and increase the average transaction value as it expanded its presence in Europe and the US, while also broadening its product offerings.",

Summer bookings excluding Turkey increased by 4%, but a 40% decline in trips to Turkey resulted in a total booking decrease. Continental Europe was heavily impacted, particularly among German tourists who shunned Turkey, while UK bookings rose by 1%. Thomas Cook has been severely affected by terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Egypt, and Turkey since summer 2015. Bookings from Belgium also decreased following the terrorist attacks on Brussels in March. The company warned in July that it had slumped to a quarterly loss and would miss its annual profit target. Thomas Cook's CEO, Peter Fankhauser, stated that the travel industry is experiencing the most turbulent period he has seen in his 30-year career. Despite the challenges, Thomas Cook's shares rose 4% to 73p. Group bookings were in line with expectations, with customers shifting their focus from Turkey to destinations such as the Balearic and Canary islands, the US, Bulgaria, and Cuba. Fankhauser noted that the summer season has progressed largely as expected, with customer demand remaining strong except for Turkey, where demand remains volatile. He also mentioned that sales for the winter season are in line with last year's figures, while summer 2017 bookings suggest that customers are booking early to secure their preferred destinations and hotels. Demand for holidays among UK consumers appears to be unaffected by the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote on June 23. The winter season has also started well in the UK, with bookings up 8%.",

What is the next number in the sequence: 23, 9, 20, 14, 14, 9, 20, 6,...?\n\n2. The series appears to be a code, where each term is the first letter of a monarch's name. For example, Mary I corresponds to the first letter \"M\", George III corresponds to the third letter \"G\", and so on. Why might Henry I be a fitting conclusion to this series?\n\n3. What comes next in the sequence: 2.1, 3.5, 3.3, 2.3, 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 1.8,...?\n\n4. What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 2, 9, 12, 70, 89, 97, 102,...?\n\nThe solutions to these puzzles are:\n\n1. The answer is 19, as the numbers correspond to the alphabet positions of the first letters of the words in the question.\n\n2. The code is indeed a clever one, as it spells out the word \"monarch\" when each term is taken to represent the first letter of a monarch's name.\n\n3. The sequence appears to be related to the layout of a QWERTY keyboard, where each term corresponds to the row and column position of a letter in alphabetical order.\n\n4. The answer is 112, as each number in the sequence is one less than the corresponding number when viewed upside down.\n\nBill, the creator of these puzzles, shares an interesting anecdote about how he came up with the fourth puzzle. He was approached by a Cambridge mathematician who was about to compete in a puzzle-solving competition against Oxford. The mathematician asked Bill to come up with an original puzzle for the informal portion of the contest, and Bill's creation was the result. Although no one was able to solve it, everyone agrees that the puzzle is fair and logical.\n\nI'd like to express my gratitude to Bill once again for allowing me to use these puzzles.

Simpson, who has spent five decades at the BBC, including his current role as world affairs editor, told The Guardian that the BBC and the National Health Service should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups. He believes that both sides of the House of Commons frequently attack the BBC because it refuses to conform to their party lines. Simpson's strongest criticism was reserved for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, whom he accused of being involved in the Hutton affair and colluding with Rupert Murdoch. \"It's astonishing to see the British prime minister cozying up to someone who has no interest in Britain, is deeply opposed to Britain, and is hostile to the country's main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. He believes that most governments he has worked with over his 50-year career at the BBC have a \"disgraceful political obsession\" to cut down the BBC. \"I'm not saying that cuts can't be made, but it's the brutality and ideological fervor with which they're implemented that's disturbing,\" he said. Simpson also criticized the government's decision to keep the BBC underfunded since 2010, saying it's \"absolutely disgraceful.\" He expressed his disapproval of the draft BBC charter, which requires the corporation to reveal the salaries of staff earning over £150,000, saying it's just a way for the government to demonstrate its control. Simpson made these comments just three days after being released from the hospital, where he had been treated for kidney failure caused by a reaction to eating kedgeree. \"It's acceptable for individuals like myself, who receive favorable treatment. However, as you progress down the hierarchy, it becomes significantly more challenging. People are anxious about their job security... there's a harsh environment, particularly towards junior staff members.\" After a brief holiday to recharge, I'll begin filming the Panorama special. I plan to travel to Iraq, Russia, China, and possibly the US, and I'm eager to visit a particularly troubled region like the Congo. Initially, there was a plan for a short series, but BBC commissioners rejected it. \"They told me that we don't want current affairs journalists covering current events,\" I was informed. \"I believe what they meant was that nowadays they prefer to feature celebrities like Joanna Lumley.\" My latest book, We Chose to Speak of War and Strife, is a tribute to the foreign correspondents of yesteryear, who I believe are a dying breed.

He has been deliberating on whether to stick to his original plan or stay until 2021.

The British Infrastructure Group (BIG) has declared that the time for excuses from mobile network providers is over, citing the unacceptable state of mobile connectivity in some areas of Britain. MPs argued that it's unacceptable that some parts of the country still have poor mobile coverage, while visitors from abroad can expect better reception due to their networks' national roaming capabilities. The group proposed an amendment to the government's digital economy bill, which would allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that fail to meet targets set in a 2014 agreement. The BIG report found little evidence to suggest that the mobile sector will meet its targets to provide coverage to 90% of the UK's geographic area. Shapps said, \"If you have a foreign SIM card and use it in the UK, you'll get better coverage than if you were using one of the UK's companies. It's astonishing.\" MPs also urged customers to be able to terminate their mobile agreements without penalty if their operator fails to provide a satisfactory level of coverage in their area. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport stated that it understands the inconvenience of poor mobile coverage, which is why it has made it mandatory for each mobile network operator to provide coverage to at least 90% of the UK by the end of next year. Mobile phone operators claim they are working diligently to enhance coverage, with an EE spokesperson saying that while the report acknowledges the importance of increased mobile coverage for a digital Britain, it neglects the significant advancements in mobile coverage since 2014.",

Alphabet's revenue reached $32.71 billion, but is expected to reach between $42 billion and $45.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company maintains its dominance in the mobile advertising market, alongside Facebook, driven by robust sales on mobile devices and YouTube. Alphabet plans to repurchase around $7 billion of its Class C stock and saw its shares rise 1.6% in after-hours trading. Google's ad revenue surged 18.1% to $19.82 billion, accounting for 89.1% of its total revenue, with paid clicks increasing 33%. However, the average cost-per-click fell 11%, down from a 7% drop in the previous quarter. Analysts had predicted a 7.9% decline. The decline in cost-per-click is attributed to the shift from desktop to mobile devices, where ad space is limited and cheaper. Google is expected to capture 56.9% of the global search ad revenue market in 2016, with $52.88 billion in revenue. Google's \"Other Revenue\" segment, which includes its cloud business, saw a 38.8% increase, while Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" generated revenue of $197 million but reported an operating loss of $865 million.

Over 100,000 people have signed a petition calling on Green to honour his promise to rectify the pension scheme, which has more than 20,000 members. The petition, led by Usdaw's general secretary John Hannett, will be delivered to Arcadia on Wednesday. Green had previously committed to addressing the pension scheme's issues during a parliamentary hearing in June, but has since failed to reach an agreement with the Pensions Regulator. Hannett emphasized that Green needs to contribute more than £250m to the scheme, describing any less as \"derisory\". He urged Green to \"do the right thing\" and fulfill his promise, stating that anything less would be unacceptable for former staff who spent their careers at BHS. The petition includes comments from BHS workers, such as \"This man's greed is unbelievable and I worked for him.\" The collapse of BHS in April led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a £571m pension deficit. A parliamentary investigation found that BHS was systematically plundered under Green's and Chappell's leadership, with Green and his family collecting at least £580m from the retailer while Chappell's company Retail Acquisitions received an estimated £17m.",

The contract will preserve 200 jobs and involve producing three-legged steel jackets standing over 65 metres high and weighing over 845 tonnes. Work on the foundation jackets is set to begin in the second quarter of 2017 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The East Anglia One windfarm, valued at £2.5bn, will generate enough electricity to power 500,000 homes by 2020. Scottish Power Renewables' director of business development praised Harland and Wolff for the opportunity to work on the project. The chief executive of Scottish Power Renewables stated that the East Anglia One windfarm will be the best value offshore windfarm ever constructed, while also delivering industry-leading levels of UK content. Founded in 1862, Harland and Wolff is a Belfast-based company with a rich history of shipbuilding, including the Titanic's construction. The company has diversified away from shipbuilding and has been involved in oil and gas rig construction, as well as the recasting of Halfpenny Bridge in Dublin. In recent years, Harland and Wolff has focused on the booming offshore windfarm industry, which now accounts for 75% of its work.",

As part of the deal, Sumitomo will acquire the trademark rights to the Dunlop brand overseas and its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Mike Ashley acquired Dunlop Slazenger in 2004 for an estimated £40 million. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is synonymous with sports such as tennis, squash, badminton, and golf. Sports Direct stated it no longer has the resources to manage international brands and needs to focus on its core UK businesses. The Dunlop business generated a pre-tax profit of £4 million on sales of £41.8 million. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has a tyre business and a sports division that produces tennis and golf equipment. The company already owns the rights to the Dunlop brand in other markets. Sports Direct has faced challenges, including criticism of its working practices and weak trading.

The company's chairman attributed the decline to an \"extreme political, union and media campaign\" against the company. An undercover investigation revealed Sports Direct workers were being paid below the minimum wage. The company has been compelled to pay £1 million in back wages to employees and provide staff with guaranteed working hours. As a result, Sports Direct's stock price has plummeted by more than half over the past year. The retailer's profit margins have also been significantly impacted by the pound's sharp depreciation following the Brexit vote.

Weidmann believes the Italian government should carefully weigh the pros and cons of rescuing the bank if it's facing financial difficulties. He emphasized that the bank's financial health is crucial for the planned measures to be effective, and that funds cannot be used to cover expected losses. Weidmann stressed that all aspects must be thoroughly examined. The ECB has taken a tough stance with Monte dei Paschi, refusing to grant the bank extra time to find private investors. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan after the bank failed to secure €5 billion in private investment. The plan involves dipping into a €20 billion fund to prop up the bank. Monte dei Paschi's poor performance in the ECB's \"stress tests\" prompted the government to take action. Weidmann stressed that the rules are intended to protect taxpayers and place responsibility on investors. He believes state funds should only be used as a last resort, which is why the bar is set high. Monte dei Paschi's troubles began to mount after the 2008 banking crisis, when it made a costly acquisition. The deal ultimately contributed to the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Monte dei Paschi's financial woes escalated three years ago, when it sought a €4 billion bailout amid a scandal over derivatives contracts and allegations of fraud. The bank has since returned to the government for funding after talks with private investors fell through.",

In Speke, a low-income area in Liverpool, consumers were charged £1.50 per cash withdrawal.

The company, which owns Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, unexpectedly announced it would not put its new pay policy to a vote at its annual meeting. The policy would have increased Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m per year by expanding bonus opportunities. Imperial Brands did not expect to receive overwhelming support from investors, given ISS's recommendation to vote against the policy. The company's chairman, Mark Williamson, stated that investors had changed their minds about supporting the plan.

David Haines argued that the pay rise was necessary not only for Cooper but also for other executives, as it is significantly below the average for companies of Imperial Brands' size. Critics of high pay saw the move as a warning to company executives against pushing through pay increases, but urged investors to maintain their pressure.

Mark Carney cautioned that these untested lenders could trigger the next financial crisis if they fail to repay their loans, leaving customers with substantial losses. He also highlighted the risk of cyber-attacks stripping customers of their digital money, leaving them without traditional regulatory protection.\n\nCarney's warning comes after a similar warning from Adair Turner, who cautioned that losses on internet-based loans could make even the worst bankers appear like lending geniuses. Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney noted that digital money could potentially allow millions of people excluded from mainstream banking to access loans securely. However, he emphasized the need for authorities to focus on financial regulations, lending rules, and operational and cyber risks to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nIn the UK, fintech lenders have become increasingly popular, accounting for around 14% of new lending to small and medium-sized businesses last year. These lenders typically offer loans with funds provided directly by investors, similar to securitized loans used by banks before the 2008 financial crisis. Carney cautioned that the rapid growth of online lending could lead to emerging vulnerabilities that regulators would need to address.\n\nThe UK is expected to become a global leader in online lending, putting pressure on the Bank to adopt regulations that protect customers without stifling the industry. The growth of online lending has been hindered by the volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin, which has limited its adoption due to concerns about its value and security. In recent months, Bitcoin's value has rebounded, and the popularity of blockchain electronic wallets has led some analysts to predict a surge in adoption this year.\n\nTraditionally, payment services relied on cash, debit and credit cards, and wire transfers. However, fintech companies are now offering domestic and cross-border payment services on a large scale through digital wallets or prepaid e-money. According to Carney, tech firms take a share of payment revenues and often gain access to the entirety of customer transaction data. In doing so, they are systematically accumulating the kind of customer insights he gained through his daily interactions with customers as a bank teller.",

Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on affordable arbitration was a major hurdle, as editors argued it would be a final blow to a struggling industry. This created a litmus test for MPs and ministers, who were uncertain how to proceed. As a result, the culture, media, and sport committee has given Ipso, a non-Leveson-compliant regulator, a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. If Ipso fails, recognition will pass to its rival, Impress. The choice between the two schemes is clear: Impress charges £75 upfront for a three- to six-month process, while Ipso offers super-silky barristers for a downpayment of £300, with potentially much more to follow. A key difference is that Impress caps arbitrators' fees at £3,500, regardless of the outcome, and does not charge legal costs if the plaintiff wins. This has raised concerns among local newspapers, who fear financial losses. Ipso, on the other hand, has more flexible costings and obligations, but its fees are higher and less transparent. The question is, can we get hard data to help make a decision? The answer depends on whether the demand for arbitration is as high as its proponents claim. So far, no one has taken advantage of the arbitration option, despite its availability. It may be that ordinary complaints regulation is sufficient, or that no-win-no-fee solicitors have cornered the market. But can't we gather more information before making a decision? Can arbitration develop a single, comprehensive approach that applies universally?",

The network and production company Cordell Jigsaw agreed not to distribute the program again. Rinehart had initiated legal action against Nine and Cordell Jigsaw over the two-part miniseries, which told the story of one of Australia's wealthiest mining families. The statement apologised for any hurt or offense caused, clarifying the program was a drama, not a documentary. Nine and Cordell Jigsaw agreed to pay Rinehart's legal costs, estimated to be in the six figures. The program will not be sold or released. Rinehart had previously won the right to review the second episode and ordered certain parts to be edited out. She took legal action for defamation, claiming the program was \"twisted\" and \"offensive\" and some scenes were \"entirely false\". Rinehart expressed satisfaction with the apology, stating the case was not about money. She urged politicians to implement reforms to shield public figures from false media portrayals. A January Oxfam report listed Mrs Rinehart as one of the top 1% wealthiest Australians.",

The recycling bins are labeled blue for glass, cans, and plastic bottles, green for paper and card, brown for garden and food waste, and grey for non-recyclable materials. I'm shocked to hear people in some areas dump all their waste over park railings at night. Some individuals claim \"wherever I live is cool by default\" due to their youth, ambition, and creativity.

The courses, arranged by trade unions in partnership with their employers, covered economic and social history, and students presented papers on collective bargaining and global politics. I first met Peter in 1966 at Sheffield University's Department of Extramural Studies, where he had recently joined six months prior. Peter was committed to fostering students' independent thought and understanding, recognizing adult education as a collaborative process. Throughout his life, Peter touched and enriched the lives of many, leaving a lasting legacy through his work with the union-backed Society of Industrial Tutors. Born to Austen Smith and Isabel Reed, Peter was the son of a junior school headteacher in Sunderland. After leaving school, he studied economics at Manchester University and began teaching liberal studies at Stockport College of Technology in 1962. That same year, he met his future wife, Helen Naughton, while working for the Labour party in a north Manchester constituency. In 1965, Peter joined the extramural program at Sheffield University, and he and Helen married the following year. He played a key role in the Sheffield Vietnam campaign and led a large contingent to the famous anti-war protest outside the US embassy in London's Grosvenor Square in 1968. In 1969, he became principal lecturer and head of liberal studies at Teesside Polytechnic, where he served on the governing body and helped the institution achieve university status in 1992. Peter and Helen settled in Stockton-on-Tees in 1970 and lived there for over 40 years. He joined the Open University in that year, teaching social sciences and politics part-time for 45 years until his retirement in 2015. Even in retirement, Peter remained a dedicated advocate for justice and peace. A skilled athlete, he continued to excel at squash well into his 70s.

This move would allow us to bequeath our respective shares of the property to our daughters while enabling us to remain in the property if either of us passes away. I believe this would grant a \"life interest\" to the surviving spouse. Currently, as joint tenants, our joint will leaves the property to the surviving spouse and, upon our deaths, to our children. Additionally, our will stipulates that each of our six grandchildren will receive £10,000 upon our joint passing, provided there are sufficient assets in our estate. If we become tenants in common, do we need to update our existing wills to reflect the new arrangement, specifically to provide for a life interest to the surviving spouse and to leave our respective shares of the estate to our daughters and grandchildren, as outlined in our current will?\n\nYes, if we decide to own our home as tenants in common by severing our joint tenancy, we will need to draft new wills. Additionally, since we currently have a joint will, which is not recognized under UK law, we will need to create individual wills that \"mirror\" each other, with identical provisions. If we own the property as tenants in common, we can specify in our will who inherits our share of the property upon our death. However, simply leaving our share to our daughters does not automatically create a \"life interest\" in the property for our spouse. To ensure that our spouse can remain in the house until their death, our will must explicitly state this intention. Currently, as joint tenants, when one of us passes away, the surviving spouse will automatically inherit the property and have the right to live in it until their own death, without the need for a will to specify this. Upon the surviving spouse's death, our daughters will inherit the property, assuming they don't change their will to leave the property to someone else.

However, a month later, I received a call stating that only my measurements were on the order form. Upon reviewing the paperwork, I discovered that the suit ordered was bright blue, and shirts I hadn't requested had been added.

The spacious cabin is marred by annoying quirks, including a loose gear housing that often slips into second gear when I intend to shift into neutral. This inconsistency made me doubt my own abilities. The car's unusual frame design features large plastic panels at the rear, creating a blind spot when parking on a curve. The cluttered dashboard, with its red accents, gave me a sense of unease. The interior doesn't exude luxury, with a small, hard-to-read screen and storage compartments that don't align with my hand's natural reach. However, the Tipo has its redeeming qualities. It doesn't look or feel like a small car, and its emissions are impressively low. The exterior styling is a nostalgic ode to the 1980s, with curved lines that evoke a sense of retro charm. The boot space is ample for my needs, but I wouldn't dare try to transport anything larger than a shopping bag. The front seats offer generous leg room, while the rear seats are a bit cramped. The Fiat Tipo's design is so retro that it's reminiscent of the 80s, when it was common for not all family members to be equally comfortable. The turbo diesel engine is a different story. In the city, it's sluggish to respond, then suddenly delivers a burst of power. On the motorway, the acceleration is smoother, especially in the higher gears.

I even spotted a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Joan Hickson, the iconic actress who played Miss Marple, picking up a korma at Meghdoot's Indian restaurant.\n\nPetworth is often overshadowed by its famous stately home, boasting works by Titian and Turner.

In England and Wales, personal insolvencies totalled 24,531 between January and March, representing a 6.7% increase from the previous quarter and a 15.7% jump from the same period a year earlier. This marks the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014. The rise in insolvencies coincides with a challenging period for UK households, as rising inflation and stagnant pay growth continue to squeeze incomes. The annual inflation rate has reached 2.3% and is expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the effects of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote begin to manifest in higher prices. Meanwhile, regular pay growth has slowed to 1.9% compared to a year earlier. Joanna Elson, CEO of the Money Advice Trust, expressed concern over the insolvency figures, stating that growing household debt and increased pressure on budgets from inflation are cause for worry. Individual voluntary arrangements accounted for 59% of personal insolvencies, debt relief orders made up 25%, and bankruptcies accounted for 16%. Adrian Hyde, president of R3, noted that while borrowing rates remain at record lows, rising inflation and slowing real wage growth will restrict people's financial flexibility. Despite a few years of stability, personal insolvency rates are still relatively low, and the recent uptick in bankruptcies has been modest. However, the steady increase in personal insolvencies may signal that the post-recession surge in consumer borrowing and spending is beginning to plateau. Official statistics only tell part of the story, as hundreds of thousands of individuals on debt management plans are not included in the numbers. The Insolvency Service reported a 4.5% rise in corporate insolvencies in the first quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase compared to the same period last year.",

Waymo's head, John Krafcik, said the goal is to give participants unrestricted access to the fleet, allowing them to use the vehicles daily, at any time, to travel anywhere within a designated area roughly twice the size of San Francisco. Arizona has been actively courting self-driving car researchers, offering a more favorable regulatory environment and launching social media campaigns to attract companies from Silicon Valley.

Waymo has been testing 100 self-driving minivans on public roads since earlier this year and plans to add another 500 vehicles to its fleet.

The trial is currently more like a subsidized taxi service than a fully open self-driving car release, with a test driver in each vehicle to monitor the rides at all times. Households that apply don't need driving licenses or the physical ability to take control of the car.

Would you rather be regarded as creative geniuses, like Paul McCartney and Michelangelo, who share this trait? Research on handedness has uncovered intriguing facts. For instance, men are more likely to be left-handed. Studies suggest that left-handed college graduates earn more, and that low birth weight, mental illness, autism, cerebral palsy, heart disease, and certain types of cancer are associated with left-handedness. On the other hand, the notion that left-handed people die younger is a myth. Left-handed individuals have an advantage in sports, as their opponents receive less practice against them. Additionally, they might be worse drivers, according to a survey conducted by a car insurance company. While this survey may be flawed, it's still worth discussing. The survey found that 28% of left-handed drivers had received a speeding ticket, compared to 19% of right-handed drivers. For parking tickets, the figures were 26% for lefties and 23% for righties. Over a 60-year driving lifetime, left-handed drivers caused an average of nine accidents, compared to eight for right-handed drivers. Interestingly, left-handed drivers were slightly less likely to have damaged their own car (35% vs 38%) and slightly more likely to have passed their driving test on the first attempt (53% vs 49%). It's essential to note that this phenomenon may not be related to the skill level of left-handed individuals. It's possible that cars and roads were simply designed with right-handed people in mind. I often think that's the reason I receive so many parking tickets. Some might agree.

The executives can sell shares to cover their £70m income tax bill but must retain at least half of the remaining shares for at least two years. The directors have a history of retaining their shares, having only sold them to cover tax bills in the past. The bonus plan aims to align the interests of the directors with those of shareholders, with £3.5bn returned to investors over the five-year period. Melrose Industries has a track record of buying and turning around struggling manufacturing businesses, and its share price has soared from 42.97p five years ago to 236p on Wednesday. The company was founded and floated on the stock market in 2003 by Miller, Roper, and Peckham, who invested about £3m in the business. With its share price expected to rise further, Melrose Industries is likely to rejoin the FTSE 250 index soon. Despite declaring a statutory loss of £69.3m last year, the company made an underlying pretax profit of £96m, with revenues of £889m.

The airline's response has been widely criticized, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded and experts accusing BA of failing to meet their needs. The value of British Airways' parent company, IAG, has taken a significant hit, with £500 million wiped off its value. Crisis-response expert Paul Charles is perplexed by BA's slow response, saying, \"You need to respond within an hour with a clear statement on what's happening.\" BA's CEO took seven hours to release a video message on Twitter, a delay Charles deems unacceptable. Charles believes BA's strong brand can recover from this crisis, but notes that it's being eroded by the airline's poor response. He warns that a lack of crisis planning can lead to a decline in an airline's brand. United Airlines faced a similar crisis when it initially blamed a passenger who was dragged off an overbooked plane, but later apologized and improved its response. The airline's stock price recovered as a result. Malaysia Airlines was nationalized after the loss of two planes in 2014, highlighting the severity of the consequences of a crisis in the airline industry. According to Charles, airlines and airports have a unique ability to captivate the public and media, which can amplify even minor crises. Effective crisis management plans typically involve clear command structures and a list of key stakeholders that the CEO personally contacts. Charles has handled his fair share of crises, including a single complaint about the food on a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London. The complaint, which went viral in 2009, was made by an anonymous passenger who sent an email to Richard Branson with photos of his meal and a humorous review. Charles recalls that the company responded quickly and turned the situation around by offering the passenger a role as a food tester for future menus.",

Guthrie confirmed in a Senate estimates statement that the job losses, previously signaled in March, are underway. This latest round of layoffs will impact senior and middle management roles in Sydney. Guthrie acknowledged that layoffs are regrettable but necessary to fund the ABC's work. The ABC has begun consulting with affected employees in some divisions, with more consultations scheduled over the next few days. Guthrie defended the ABC's digital presence, rejecting criticism from Fairfax Media's CEO Greg Hywood. She emphasized the public's expectation of high-quality journalism on all platforms, including digital. Guthrie rejected the notion that the ABC should be used as a scapegoat for the digital media landscape's challenges. ABC staff are bracing for job cuts on Thursday, with Radio National expected to be particularly affected. The first round of job cuts in March saw up to 85 technical staff made redundant. Guthrie referred to the planned cuts as \"eliminating duplication in certain content areas.\" The ABC will allocate an additional $2.9 million to arts, science, and education, and $2 million to new programming. Guthrie explained that the ABC is simplifying its organizational structure, reducing management layers, and investing savings in new initiatives showcasing Australian stories. Every dollar saved will be used to create engaging content.",

As students and former students of the University of East Anglia's renowned counselling program, we are stunned by the university's sudden decision to shut down the course, leaving many students unable to complete their professional qualifications. This sudden move, made without adequate consultation, prioritizes the university's interests over those of students, staff, and the local community. The irony is not lost on us, as Prince Harry, a vocal advocate for mental health, recently emphasized the importance of in-depth listening relationships – a key component of our program. The closure will not only affect the course itself but also the therapy organizations where students have volunteered and the university's own counselling service. The university's management-speak explanation for the closure, citing the need for \"greater alignment\" and a \"coherent portfolio of activity,\" lacks substance. If mental health is truly a priority, then what is the point of offering courses if there are no qualified counsellors to deliver them?",

Former Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis has invested a six-figure sum in the not-for-profit enterprise, stating \"I'm in\". Credit unions are financial cooperatives owned and controlled by members, serving individuals of all income levels, offering a vital alternative to banks, payday lenders, and loan sharks. retailCURe, open to anyone aged 16+ who works in retail or a support industry, aims to provide a solution for the 4.5 million people in this sector on low pay. The retail sector is one of the UK's largest employers, with many part-time workers and declining salaries. retailCURe is run by the retail industry for the retail industry, with high street names Iceland, New Look, and Pets at Home supporting it, with more expected to join. Members will have access to loans from £500 to £5,000 at interest rates ranging from 9.9% to 26.8% APR, with two-thirds of loans issued so far having an interest rate of less than 10% APR. In contrast, many payday lenders charge over 1,000% APR. The credit union is also offering \"market-beating\" rates up to 3% on its savings accounts. To become a member, you'll need to open a simple easy access account with a minimum deposit of £1 and commit to regular savings. Once you've done this, you'll be eligible to apply for a loan or additional savings accounts. Some employers will also offer the option for employees to have their wages automatically deposited into their credit union account.",

After seven years of tracking the elusive Cape York palm cockatoos in northern Queensland's unspoiled wilderness, scientists have finally recorded the extraordinary behavior on camera. The footage shows 18 male cockatoos delivering over 130 unique drum solos, each with its own pattern and flair. Most performances took place in front of females, with males adding embellishments like calls, blushing, and raised feathers to impress them. Researchers observed the birds preparing their drumming tools and then banging out sequences of 27 to 92 beats, showcasing their impressive rhythmic skills. The birds' drumming styles varied greatly, ranging from rapid-fire strikes to more laid-back, repetitive beats. According to a study published in Science Advances, the cockatoos' drumming behavior shares key elements with human instrumental music, including the manufacture of sound tools, consistent performance contexts, and individual styles. The researchers liken the birds to solo artists or drummers in rock bands, who have an internal sense of rhythm and generate the motor pattern to create the beat. This behavior is remarkable, as tool manufacture is rare in the animal kingdom and is usually linked to foraging for food.",

As he stood by a tree laden with pods, a favorite snack of parrots, he waited patiently for the birds to arrive. His persistence paid off when a group of six parrots flew in, their striking red fronts and blue wing tips unlike any species he had previously encountered. The parrots' distinctive calls, unlike any on record, left Gómez Garza in awe. \"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" he exclaimed. \"The different noise belonged to a different parrot.\" Gómez Garza, an ornithologist and veterinarian, was thrilled to have discovered a new species of parrot. The international team of scientists published research on the newly discovered blue-winged Amazon parrot, or Amazona gomezgarzai, in honor of its discoverer. The parrot measures 25cm in height and boasts a loud, short, and repetitive call reminiscent of the soundtrack to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of its calls eerily imitates that of a hawk, a natural predator of parrots. Scientists speculate that this mimicry may serve as a deterrent, scaring other birds away and leaving more seeds, fruit, and flowers for the parrots to feast on. After obtaining permission from the Mexican authorities, Gómez Garza captured a male and female parrot for further study, collaborating with Tony Silva at the University of Florida and Pawel Mackiewicz at the University of Wroclaw. DNA tests revealed that this new species evolved from the white-fronted parrots (Amazona albifrons) native to the region approximately 120,000 years ago. Due to the parrots' rarity, the tests were performed without causing them harm. \"In recent history, I believe this is the first time a scientific description has been completed without the species being threatened with extinction,\" said Gómez Garza. He noted that conservation plans are already underway to protect the species. Mackiewicz estimated that there are likely fewer than 100 blue-winged Amazon parrots remaining, making conservation efforts a top priority. According to Gómez Garza, parrots worldwide are vulnerable to habitat destruction. While the international illegal trade of parrots has decreased in recent years, it still persists locally for certain species. Gómez Garza emphasized that raising awareness will be crucial in saving wild parrots globally.",

The bank's total mortgage lending decreased by £1 billion to £11.6 billion in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Net lending fell by £200 million over the half year. Net consumer finance lending plummeted to £97 million from £266 million. Santander UK Chief Executive Nathan Bostock attributed the decline to intense competition driving down interest rates to historically low levels. He accused competitors of offering more attractive rates on car loans and credit cards than mortgage customers. Bostock emphasized that the risks associated with car loans should be considered in a broader context. Non-performing loans comprised only 0.48% of the unsecured book of lending, and mortgage arrears remained extremely low. Bostock ruled out further rate cuts for the popular 123 account. The account, which has 3.6 million customers in the UK, was paying 3% interest on balances up to £20,000 before the rate was reduced to 1.5%. Despite slashing interest payouts on the 123 account, Santander's loyal retail customer base continued to grow, reaching 3.9 million customers. The average mortgage lent by Santander remained steady at £198,000. The typical buyer was found to be taking out a loan equivalent to 3.18 times their income.

According to research by Citizens Advice, nearly one in five people struggling with debt have had their credit card limit increased without their request. The charity is urging the Financial Conduct Authority to ban the practice, which has raised concerns about a surge in lending. Unsecured lending has reached levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, prompting warnings from the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn. Citizens Advice CEO Gillian Guy emphasized that irresponsible lending practices are exacerbating debt problems, such as offering more credit to people who already have thousands of pounds in unpaid debt. The report found that people with long-term outstanding balances are more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users experiencing an increase in their limit over the past year without requesting it. Credit card debtors are also more likely to fall into long-term debt and struggle to pay off their debt compared to those with personal loans. One pensioner was repeatedly contacted by firms offering more credit cards despite being unable to afford minimum repayments on her existing debts. Citizens Advice has helped 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems in the past year.

If you took out a consumer loan, store card, credit card, or mortgage between the 1990s and 2000s, you might have been mis-sold PPI. Review your old loan and mortgage statements for any mention of insurance that covers your payments if you become unemployed due to illness, accident, or redundancy. If you've lost your statements, check your credit report, which lists all your loans, mortgages, and debts from the past six years. Many lenders will inform you if you contact them and ask if you had PPI. PPI was often mis-sold because the insurance was not clearly explained to you, or you were not aware you had it, or the adviser did not explain significant exclusions under the policy. If you had to pay for the PPI upfront, the adviser did not make it clear that the insurance cost would be added to the loan and that you'd be paying interest on it. If you answered no to any of these questions, you may have a valid claim. To make a claim, use a free template letter from Which? or Moneysavingexpert, print it out, fill it in, and send it off. If your complaint is upheld, the company that sold you the policy should attempt to put you back in the position you would have been in if you hadn't taken out PPI. You may also be entitled to statutory compensation, which is usually set at an interest rate of 8% of the refunded amount. If your claim is rejected, carefully review the assumptions made by the bank and revisit your lender if you believe these assumptions are incorrect or that you've been unfairly treated. If you still feel the offered amount is unfair, you can seek assistance from the free Financial Ombudsman Service to dispute your bank's decision.

This strategy was unveiled on Thursday in the Department for Exiting the European Union's final summer policy paper, ahead of talks in Brussels on Monday. The government claims its leading role in electronic commerce justifies special treatment from the EU in setting future standards. The regulation of online data has become a contentious issue globally, with technology companies and national security agencies facing criticism for compromising personal privacy. Since the Edward Snowden revelations, tensions between the EU and US have been strained. The UK paper proposes exempting Britain from European adequacy tests and instead entering a permanent harmonization agreement to ensure stability. The government believes it would be in both parties' interests to recognize each other's data protection frameworks, allowing free data flows between the EU and UK. The government won't disclose how it would maintain mutual recognition if standards diverge, but hopes to establish a shared policy process. This concession may be fiercely resisted by Brussels negotiators, who view it as limiting their autonomy to set EU rules. The government's approach could be a clue to its approach in other areas, such as financial services, where it seeks a lasting mutual recognition deal. The government declined to comment on how a potential EU deal would address differing standards with the US. However, it noted that current EU-US regulatory harmonization is limited, which could become an advantage if it can negotiate separate deals.",

As a sound engineer, he played a crucial role in establishing reputable recording studios in Baghdad. He dedicated himself to teaching music at the Institute of Hope, developing innovative methods to reach his students. He helped establish a music and ballet school in Baghdad in 1968, where he served as a key staff member and played a significant role in directing the institution. Many students still fondly remember him, and his three children and four nieces and nephews are proud graduates of the school. Born in Baghdad, Saad was the fourth of six children to Mahmood Jasim Hikmat and Kadria Raoof Al-Attar. He demonstrated a natural talent for music and the accordion from a young age, which his father encouraged. After completing his high school education, Saad was admitted to the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, where he studied music with both Western and Iraqi teachers. He graduated as a skilled pianist, accordion player, and piano tuner, and further honed his craft through travels to Italy, Greece, Poland, and the former USSR. Saad had a deep appreciation for jazz, and his encounter with Duke Ellington in the 1960s was a highlight of his career. He was always willing to lend his skills to a good cause. In 2003, Saad relocated to Amman, Jordan, where he continued to share his passion for music. He spent his time in Amman teaching music privately and volunteering to teach at the Institute of Light. He leaves behind his wife, Rasmiya Mohammad Ali, a dedicated social worker, and their three children, Basheer, Omar, and Fatima.",

The updated software enables Pepper to chant sutras in a robotic voice while tapping a drum, offering a more affordable alternative to human priests for funeral services. At a recent Tokyo funeral industry fair, Nissei Eco showcased Pepper, a plastic molding maker, aiming to disrupt the market by offering its services for £350 per funeral, significantly cheaper than the average cost of £20,000 in Japan. With Japan's aging and shrinking population, many Buddhist priests struggle to make ends meet, prompting some to seek part-time work outside their temple duties. According to Michio Inamura, Nissei's executive adviser, Pepper could fill the gap when a human priest is unavailable. Funeral organizers can customize Pepper's appearance by dressing it in a Buddhist monk's robe and live-stream the ceremony for those who cannot attend in person. Buddhist priest Tetsugi Matsuo expressed interest in seeing if Pepper could convey the \"heart\" aspect of religion, which he believes is the foundation of faith. While Pepper has not yet been hired for a funeral, it seems likely that robots will eventually play a role in the funeral industry, given their increasing presence in various aspects of life.",

The annual growth rate of personal bank deposits has slowed to its lowest level since the financial crisis, with a mere 2.2% increase in August, the weakest month since May 2009. This decline is partly attributed to £1 billion being withdrawn from cash ISA accounts, as tax changes allow individuals to earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free. According to UK Finance, households are saving less each month, rather than borrowing more, as the growth in personal deposits has slowed alongside a slowdown in consumer credit borrowing. Annual growth in credit card borrowing slowed to 5% in August, down from 5.3% the previous month, while personal loan and overdraft usage fell by 1.6% on an annual basis. Overall, the annual growth in consumer credit slowed from 1.9% in July to 1.5% in August. Despite a decline in consumer confidence due to rising prices and Brexit uncertainty, retail sales growth suggests that shoppers have not yet cut back on spending. Retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August, following a revised 0.6% increase in July. The falling rate of bank deposits also indicates that consumers are drawing on their savings. According to the latest ONS figures, the amount of household money available for saving has fallen to an all-time low in the first three months of this year. The amount being set aside as savings has slipped to 1.7% of disposable income, a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. The purchasing power of British consumers is expected to face further strain due to inflation, with the Bank of England predicting that the consumer price index (CPI) will reach a peak above 3% in October. As of August, the CPI inflation rate stood at 2.9%, driven by the increasing cost of importing fuel, clothing, and food. The Bank of England has kept interest rates unchanged this month, but warned that it may raise rates for the first time in a decade as early as November to combat rising inflation. According to Mohammad Jamei, senior economist at UK Finance, \"Some households in the UK have chosen to save less, while others have not increased their borrowing.\"",

A report from key UK banks, law firms, and fund managers proposes a free trade deal allowing British and EU-based financial companies to trade products and services without tariffs, taxes, or quotas. The agreement would establish a joint dispute resolution body to resolve breaches. Without \"passporting\" rights, British pensioners and EU consumers could face difficulties in paying out personal pension or insurance contracts. To address these concerns, the International Regulatory Strategy Group has developed a plan for a free trade agreement. The report suggests setting up a free trade area would be straightforward, given the similarity of EU and UK regulatory regimes. The plan is ambitious but would benefit the entire continent. If London loses its status, activity would likely shift to New York or Singapore, resulting in losses for businesses and families. The proposed agreement mirrors the Canada-EU free trade area agreement, aiming to grant financial institutions reciprocal access to each other's markets. The report's starting point is that both the EU and the UK have expressed a desire to secure future arrangements for free trade in financial services. An enhanced free trade agreement is technically and legally feasible and would form a dedicated financial services chapter within a broader EU-UK agreement. The proposal includes a forum of regulators collaborating on a joint response to new global standards, as well as involvement in supervision and enforcement, with regular meetings.

Mr. Justice Norris made his ruling after hearing the application from the media organizations on the fourth day of the case.

His impact extended globally, and his kindness and enthusiasm inspired a vast network of colleagues and friends. Born in Harden, West Yorkshire, to Evelyn Brooke and Herbert Oldham, Geoff was the son of a NatWest bank manager. He attended Bingley grammar school and studied geology at the University of Reading, later being accepted for further studies at both Cambridge and Toronto universities. Following his wedding to Brenda Raven in September 1951, they embarked on a journey to Canada just 10 days later. Geoff earned his PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto and worked in oil exploration, focusing on South America. However, he soon became disillusioned with the work and began to think about how he could use his skills to make a more meaningful difference. This led to a career change, during which he conducted research on science and technology in China and other Asian countries. As deputy director of SPRU from 1966 and later as its director from 1982 to 1992, Geoff drove policy research on science and technology in developing countries. He challenged the prevailing approach, which relied heavily on transferring technology and science from wealthy countries, and instead advocated for a greater emphasis on building the capacity of developing countries to create their own. Geoff also played a key role in establishing the International Development Research Centre of Canada in 1970, which has been hailed as the \"jewel in the crown of Canadian aid.\" He then led the science and technology policy program at IDRC, fostering policy research across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In recognition of his contributions to science, Geoff was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. After leaving his position as director of SPRU, Geoff remained actively engaged in various advisory roles, including high-level positions with the United Nations, the IDRC in Canada, and with ministers of science and technology in China. He also became a dedicated champion for addressing gender disparities in science and technology, collaborating with international initiatives such as GenderInSITE. Throughout his career, Geoff played a significant role in shaping the field of science and technology policy research, leaving a lasting legacy on the organizations that fund, conduct, and utilize it.

Ofsted has reported a significant decline in inspection outcomes for smaller, fee-paying schools, particularly faith schools. Latest figures show that nearly half of private faith schools inspected by Ofsted were judged to be less than good at their most recent inspection, while a quarter were deemed inadequate. Ofsted's report on non-association independent schools reveals a stark decline in the proportion of schools judged good or outstanding. The proportion of schools judged good or outstanding decreased from 79% in 2014 to 60% over the past three years. Ofsted attributes the decline to the introduction of new standards that focus on leadership and fundamental British values. Since the Trojan horse affair in Birmingham in 2014, all schools have been required to teach and reflect British values. The new standards assess requirements related to written policies on the curriculum, the quality of teaching, and the spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development of pupils. A higher proportion of weaker faith schools are failing to meet these requirements compared to schools with no faith. Specifically, 81 out of 139 independent Muslim schools were found to be less than good at their most recent inspection, while 39 were deemed inadequate. Over half of the 58 Jewish schools inspected received a rating of less than good. The decline in ratings was also attributed to Ofsted's takeover of inspections at faith schools. Ofsted is concerned that struggling schools are taking too long to improve and has expressed particular worries about safeguarding, which was found to be ineffective in 17% of inspected schools. In contrast, independent special schools are making notable progress, with 78% of them rated good or outstanding, up from 74% in 2014. Only 9% of these schools were judged inadequate, compared to 19% of other independent schools.",

The majority of this cost is attributed to the \"repatriation tax,\" designed to encourage multinational corporations to bring back trillions of dollars held overseas. Goldman Sachs reported profits of $7.4 billion last year, stating that the tax legislation will result in a reduction of around $5 billion in its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017. Two-thirds of this reduction is due to the repatriation tax, while the remaining third is attributed to the implementation of the territorial tax system and the revaluation of US deferred tax assets at lower corporate tax rates. The tax overhaul will lead to a decrease in its earnings, primarily due to the repatriation tax and the implementation of the territorial tax system.\n\nThe recent tax overhaul includes significant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals. The reduction in corporate tax rates, from 35% to 21%, is intended to encourage multinational corporations to repatriate their cash from overseas. US companies are estimated to hold around $2.5 trillion in capital overseas. Companies had previously maintained that they had a responsibility to their shareholders to keep this money abroad rather than bringing it back to the US and paying large tax bills.\n\nThe tax overhaul will allow Apple to repatriate its $252.3 billion foreign cash reserves without incurring a significant tax burden. Apple's large amount of untaxed profits held overseas has become a major political issue and a challenge for the company. Amgen, a drugmaker, expects to pay between $6 billion and $6.5 billion to repatriate its cash to the US. Goldman Sachs has also reported that the rest of the $5 billion reduction in its profits will come from the cost of implementing the territorial tax system and changes that will make it more difficult for companies to deduct past losses from future tax bills. Barclays estimates that the change to \"deferred tax assets\" will cost it around £1 billion. The tax changes were implemented under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who praised the bill as \"great for hardworking workers\".

The Met Office forecasting service predicts that global temperatures will exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels between 2018 and 2022, potentially breaching the 1.5C threshold set by the Paris climate agreement in 2015. Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the Met Office, notes that continued warming from greenhouse gases and natural variability could cause a temporary spike above 1.5C in the next five years. Global temperatures have been steadily rising over the past 20 years, with each of the last three years exceeding the 1C threshold. Last year was the second hottest on record, with no significant boost from the El Niño effect. The 1.5C threshold was set as an ambitious target at the Paris climate conference because scientists believe a world warmer than that would be prone to extreme and unpredictable climate events, leading to consequences such as droughts, habitat loss, food insecurity, and mass migration. Previously, some predictions suggested the threshold would not be breached until the 2040s. However, Met Office scientists emphasize that a single year of temperatures above 1.5C does not necessarily indicate a sustained period of warmer temperatures.

A CVA involves creditors agreeing to forgo some of what they are owed by a business rather than risk it going out of business altogether.

Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride emphasized the need for digital companies to pay fair levels of tax, suggesting a system where tax is levied based on where companies earn their revenue. Stride noted that digital companies are generating significant value in the UK, but the current tax regime is not taxing these activities fairly. He expressed the government's desire to move towards a fairer system. Treasury sources revealed that the government's first preference is to reform the international tax system through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, but if progress cannot be made at the global level, the UK would implement unilateral changes.

The report reveals that emissions from the National Electricity Market decreased in January, reaching their lowest levels since 2004, largely due to the federal large-scale renewable energy target.\n\nEnergy expert Hugh Saddler analyzed the consumption and output of electricity from the Hornsdale Power Reserve, which includes the Tesla battery, and found that it follows a consistent pattern, charging overnight when wind generation is abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices are at their peak.\n\nWhile only 30% of the battery's 100MW capacity is devoted to trading, the rest is used to stabilize the energy system by maintaining the grid frequency at 50 Hz and 240 volts. Despite its relatively small contribution to demand smoothing, the battery still provides a valuable service, demonstrating the important role energy storage can play in the system.\n\nThe battery effectively time-shifts wind generation, exploiting the difference in wholesale energy prices throughout the day, providing critical power at the critical moment. The world's biggest battery, in SA, is working in harmony with wind farms.\n\nPeak wind production is the cheapest way to charge the battery, which stands ready to fill demand gaps if they emerge. The battery charges up overnight, when prices are low, and then hits the grid at the right time to keep price spikes lower than they would be otherwise.\n\nThe Australia Institute's report also found that emissions from the NEM decreased to 152.8 Mt of CO2-equivalent in January, the lowest level since 2004. Despite relatively flat demand, the decrease in coal-fired power generation was driven by the increased output of large-scale renewable energy projects and the decline of Australia's aging coal-fired power station fleet. Energy expert Hugh Saddler emphasized that with the renewable energy target nearing completion, Australia urgently needs a post-2021 energy policy to reduce its reliance on coal in the National Electricity Market.",

The Office for National Statistics revised its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, missing economists' forecasts. The revised figure was attributed to lower-than-expected production and decreased consumer spending, influenced by price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker performance in the final quarter of the year led to a downward revision in the UK's overall growth rate for 2017, revised down from 1.8% to 1.7%, the weakest rate in five years. As the global economy continues to recover, the UK is falling behind other major economies, including Germany, France, and the US. According to Darren Morgan, a small number of revisions to various industries contributed to the downward revision in quarterly growth. Services continued to drive growth at the end of 2017, but consumer-facing industries slowed due to price rises, which squeezed household budgets. The UK economy's reliance on consumer spending for growth has decreased, as households have become more reluctant to spend due to falling real pay and inflation outpacing wage growth. Household spending grew by just 0.3% in the fourth quarter and by 1.8% in 2017 overall, the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012.

The footage, captured by Vinay Kumar, a scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society's India program, shows the elephant picking up an object with its trunk and exhaling a puff of smoke. The 48-second video was recorded in April 2016 but only recently uploaded online. Biologists from the WCS describe the footage as the \"first documented video of a wild elephant exhibiting such behavior,\" leaving scientists and experts puzzled.\n\nAccording to the WCS, the elephant may have been using charcoal, which has toxin-binding properties that could have medicinal value for the animals. Charcoal is also a natural laxative and is commonly found in forests after wildfires, lightning strikes, or controlled burns. While elephants have not been observed blowing ash before, animal self-medication is a relatively common phenomenon in the animal kingdom.\n\nStudies have shown that other animals engage in self-medication, such as red colobus monkeys in Zanzibar, which consume charcoal to counteract toxic substances in their food. Bonobos have also been observed swallowing leaves with rough surfaces to remove parasites from their systems. Additionally, red and green macaws eat clay to kill bacteria in their systems, and pregnant elephants in Kenya are believed to eat leaves that may help expedite the delivery process.\n\nIndia is home to more than 27,000 Asian elephants, which comprise about 60% of the global population, according to a 2017 census. The number has decreased by 10% since the 2012 census, but the government attributes this decline to more accurate counting methods.",

Six individuals, including two former HBOS employees, were sentenced to prison in 2017 for perpetrating the fraud, which centered on the Reading branch. A judge described the scheme as \"utterly corrupt\" and devastating for small business owners. The scam occurred between 2003 and 2008 and involved Lynden Scourfield, a former HBOS employee, and David Mills, a financial consultancy owner. Scourfield was bribed to load loans onto struggling companies and refer them to Mills's business. The NCA will conduct a six-month review into allegations of fraud related to the HBOS branch in Reading, at the request of Thames Valley Police. The review will examine allegations that fell outside the scope of the original investigation. Several companies have reported significant fraud allegations, including claims of asset stripping and fraud. The sums involved could be substantial, running into tens of millions of pounds.

The sudden drop in demand for plants and garden furniture further complicated the company's situation. This poor trading resulted in a 15.4% decline in like-for-like sales for the first three months of 2018, outpacing the 15.1% decline in the previous quarter. Wesfarmers, Homebase's parent company, had planned to convert the chain into a Bunnings store, but only 23 of the 250 stores have been converted, leaving uncertainty over the future of the costly refurbishments. The company's managing director, Rob Scott, had previously considered withdrawing from the UK market, citing the disastrous takeover of Homebase. Wesfarmers wrote off A$1bn earlier this year due to the failed takeover and is now reportedly considering offering over £100m to find a buyer or pursuing a company voluntary arrangement to dump loss-making stores.

A US study found that even a small temperature increase can lead to a decline in exam scores, with a 0.5°C rise in average temperature corresponding to a 1% drop in average exam scores. In the UK, the situation is more challenging, as air conditioning, which could mitigate the negative effects, is rarely found in British schools. June is the month when average high temperatures tend to exceed 21°C, when the negative effects on exam performance become apparent. This raises the question of why we schedule important exams during this time, when distractions like sports tournaments and heatwaves are common. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow students to take their exams online when it's most convenient for their learning and comfort? Changing the academic year is a complex issue, with schools, large firms, universities, and even the law courts following a similar September-to-July schedule.

According to a Sky News report, bankers and investors are expecting an announcement as early as this week, with one fund manager stating that the City is \"abuzz with speculation\" about an imminent sale.

Scientists discovered tiny fossilized skin flakes on a microraptor, a crow-sized, meat-eating dinosaur with wings on all four limbs. Similar flakes were also found on two other feathered dinosaurs, beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, as well as a primitive bird called confuciusornis. The fossilized skin flakes are the sole evidence of how dinosaurs shed their skin. Unlike modern reptiles, which typically shed their skin in large sheets, the feathered dinosaurs shed their skin in tiny flakes. According to Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork, \"This is the only fossil dandruff known. Until now, we had no evidence for how dinosaurs shed their skin.\" Images taken with an electron microscope reveal that the fossilized dandruff is extremely well-preserved and almost identical to that found on modern birds. The skin flakes are comprised of tough cells called corneocytes rich in the protein keratin. The study suggests that dinosaurs with feathers evolved skin to cope with their plumage as far back as the Middle Jurassic period. \"Even in the early stages of feather evolution, they had already adapted their skin to this more modern structure,\" McNamara said. The fossilized remains of the animals were discovered in rock formations in northeastern China. Beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, which grew to over 2 meters in length, were significantly larger than the 1-meter-long microraptor. Unlike modern birds, the dinosaur dandruff cells lacked fat, suggesting that the animals did not generate as much heat, possibly because they were not capable of flying long distances or at all. Many dinosaurs with feathers were not skilled fliers. \"Rather, their feathers had multiple functions, including keeping them warm, blending in with their surroundings for camouflage, and potentially showcasing their vibrant colors to attract mates with dazzling displays.\"",

This growth in lifespan has had far-reaching consequences on various aspects of life. The trend of increasing longevity has come to a halt, according to a recent analysis by the Office for National Statistics. The underlying causes of this sudden stagnation are unclear, but potential factors include austerity measures, reduced NHS spending, flu outbreaks, rising obesity and diabetes rates, and the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity. The study's findings are alarming, as they indicate that the trend towards improving life expectancy has slowed significantly. The slowdown began in the second quarter of 2009 for men and soon after for women. Between 2011 and 2013, and again between 2014 and 2016, only a small number of local authorities in England showed statistically significant increases in life expectancy. This is a stark contrast to the equivalent period 10 years earlier, when many more local authorities reported significant increases in life expectancy. Other disquieting data from the weekly register of deaths in England and Wales this year adds to the worrying trend. The statistics reveal that the number of deaths is significantly higher than the average over the past five years. Pension companies repeatedly advise savers to plan for a retirement lasting 25 years or more, but perhaps this assumption is flawed. Maybe we should now reconsider increasing the state pension age and instead focus on maintaining the current age.",

The retailer secured a temporary reprieve from its lenders, who agreed to extend loans while it undergoes restructuring under a company voluntary arrangement scheme. C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, had agreed to invest £70m in House of Fraser, conditional on the CVA being implemented.

The Pension Regulator requested information about the brewery's pension plans in 2015 to ensure sufficient funding for the final-salary pension schemes of over 2,000 employees. However, Smith dismissed the request as \"tiresome\" and refused to comply, prompting the Pension Regulator to launch court proceedings. The company and Smith pleaded guilty to the offence in May, and on Monday, they were sentenced at Brighton magistrates court.

The total fine, including a victim surcharge and costs, came out to £27,990.

According to the Help to Buy Buyers' Guide, if you can already secure a 90% mortgage, you should carefully consider whether a Help-to-Buy equity loan is right for you. There may be better options available.\n\nHelp-to-Buy can be a good option if you're looking to buy a new-build property from a registered house builder and need the 20% equity loan to complete the purchase. However, it's not suitable if you don't want a new-build Help-to-Buy home or don't need government assistance. The Help-to-Buy equity loan is not free money - you'll need to pay a monthly management fee of £1 and interest will start to be charged after five years.\n\nThe primary concern with an equity loan is that if house values increase, so does the amount you'll need to repay. Furthermore, interest rates on Help-to-Buy mortgages are less competitive than those for standard mortgages.

The original story, published on December 15, incorrectly stated Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed was caught with a bomb and awarded £33,000 due to excessive detention. However, the judge's decision to award al-Waheed compensation was based on his unlawful imprisonment and mistreatment during the Iraq war. The newspaper ran the story despite the judge concluding the bomb claims were \"pure fiction\" and discredited shortly after detention. Ipso ordered the correction after finding the Daily Mail breached accuracy rules in its reporting. Ipso stated the newspaper's failure to clarify the bomb claims' disproof seriously misrepresented the judgment's basis. The judge found no evidence supported the claim al-Waheed was an insurgent, and he was detained without legal basis for 33 days in 2007. The compensation award was broken down into £3,300 for unlawful detention, £15,000 for beating after arrest, and £15,000 for ill treatment. The Daily Mail defended its reporting by citing a three-page summary of the 239-page judgment and previous reporting. Ipso rejected this explanation, arguing it was unreasonable to rely on previous press coverage without verifying accuracy. Following the decision, a major internal investigation was conducted, and seven senior staff members received strongly worded disciplinary notes.

The deal is \"transformational\" and will significantly enhance the company's US shale presence, according to CEO Bob Dudley. The acquisition will increase BP's US oil and gas production by nearly 20% and marks a new era of growth for the company, which has been recovering from the financial burden of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The deal covers 470,000 acres of assets, including fields in the Permian Basin in west Texas, the Eagle Ford in south Texas, and Haynesville in east Texas and Louisiana. Analysts have praised the deal, with Eagle Ford being considered the most valuable due to its scale and economics, and the Permian offering the greatest long-term potential. BHP purchased the fields in 2011 but has struggled to make them profitable, leading to their sale last August. BP believes its approach will differ from BHP's, bringing $350 million in synergies from its other US operations and capital efficiencies. According to Bernard Looney, CEO of BP's upstream division, the acquisition gives the company access to some of the best acreage in the best basins, including the Permian Basin, which is considered the most-talked-about oil play in the world. Following the deal's completion, BP's US production is expected to increase from 744,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 885,000 boe/d. The acquisition will be entirely financed through cash and is being partially funded by the company's decision to divest its interests in the Greater Kuparuk Area in Alaska, which is expected to generate $5-6 billion. BP's deal significantly surpasses its recent $200 million investment in Europe's largest solar company and its £130 million purchase of the UK's largest electric car charging network. BHP has announced that it will return the proceeds from the sale to its investors, and as a result, its shares closed the day up 2.3% in Australia, at A$34.40.

The surge in its share price has propelled the company's value to nearly match that of Royal Mail and surpass the combined stock market value of WH Smith, Debenhams, the AA, and Saga. Fever-Tree's rapid growth can be attributed to the soaring popularity of premium gin, which has doubled UK sales to £1.2 billion in the past six years, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. A YouGov poll found that gin is the most beloved spirit in the UK, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favorite. Riding the wave of gin's popularity has transformed Fever-Tree into one of the UK's fastest-growing major companies, making co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow multi-millionaires in the process. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005, naming it after the colloquial term for the cinchona tree, the bark of which produces quinine, a key ingredient in tonic water. Since the company's stock market float in 2014, Rolls has sold shares worth over £150 million, while Warrilow has sold shares worth £41 million. They still own 14% of the company, a stake worth nearly £600 million, and received payouts of over £630,000 on Tuesday after the group increased its dividend by 40%. Fever-Tree's shares jumped by as much as 15% to an all-time high of £39.87, driven by profits rising by a third to £34 million in the first six months of the year, on sales up 45% higher to £104 million. The shares settled back to give the company a stock market value of £4.2 billion, still more than 30 times its value when it floated four years ago. Fever-Tree reported particularly strong performance in the UK over the Christmas period, with an \"impressive rate of sales growth,\" but noted that it still has room to expand. Warrilow noted, \"While this milestone is impressive, we still have a substantial opportunity ahead of us across all our regions as Fever-Tree continues to shape the mixer category's future.\" Additionally, Fever-Tree announced two new distribution agreements: one in the US with Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, a leading wine and spirits distributor, and another with Grupo Damm, a Spanish company that produces Estrella Damm, a well-known beer from Barcelona.",

Production of its road cars increased in the 1930s, with a record 140 cars built in 1937. In 1947, English industrialist David Brown acquired the company, expanding operations and relocating production. The company moved its production base again in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. The iconic Aston Martin DB5 was introduced in 1963, and its famous partnership with James Bond began a year later in the film Goldfinger. Bond has since driven an Aston Martin in several films.

According to Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, students tend to \"take their foot off the gas\" after accepting unconditional offers. Buchanan believes that students will carry their academic achievements with them throughout their careers and thus should be motivated to work hard. He is calling on universities to only offer unconditional places to students who have been interviewed or whose schools have provided additional information. Historically, only a small number of students received unconditional offers, but the government's removal of the cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities to expand and compete aggressively for students and tuition fees. While there is limited evidence on the impact of unconditional offers on students' final grades, private school heads have long been concerned about the potential impact on their school's results and league table rankings. Some employers place significant weight on A-level grades when recruiting for graduate trainee programs, which means that students who underperform may struggle in the job market. The HMC's call follows that of Education Minister Sam Gyimah, who in July criticized the rise in unconditional offers as \"completely irresponsible to students\" and urged universities to limit their use. Typically, universities make conditional offers, specifying the A-level grades required to secure a place. However, in a more competitive market, unconditional offers have become more common, even among research-intensive institutions in the Russell Group. According to Ucas, 7% of the 950,000 offers made this year were unconditional, with roughly one-fifth of the 250,000 applicants to English universities receiving at least one such offer. Ucas noted that unconditional offers were more prevalent for older students who already held qualifications, as well as for those applying to creative arts courses who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties. University vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers, citing their benefits in allowing for earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation.",

Pupils who fail to meet the standard will retake the check at the end of year 2, by which time 92% are expected to meet the required standard. Fewer than half (44%) of pupils with special educational needs reached the pass mark, compared to 89% of pupils with no identified SEN. Provisional results for key stage 1 teacher assessments showed a slight decline in the number of six- and seven-year-olds reaching the expected standard in reading and maths. The government reported that 163,000 more six-year-olds are on track to become fluent readers than in 2012. However, the test remains contentious, with 85% of heads believing it should not be compulsory and 65% of teachers wanting it scrapped. A representative of the More Than A Score campaign group argued that the phonics check is a waste of valuable teaching time and instead of fostering a love of reading, children are spending months drilling on nonsensical words solely to prepare for a test. School Standards Minister Nick Gibb hailed this as a significant achievement, citing its positive impact on the education and lives of hundreds of thousands of children, and reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential.",

The estate, spanning 1.12 hectares, has been in the Fairfax family's hands for over a century. Cannon-Brookes, co-founder of software company Atlassian, expressed his delight with the purchase, stating that he and his family are eager to preserve the legacy of this beautiful Sydney home. The family is particularly excited to raise their four young children in this historic property. Fairwater is the largest privately held property on Sydney Harbour and one of the most significant heritage homes in Australia. Built in 1882, the waterfront estate stretches from New South Head Road to Seven Shillings Beach and has been the residence of the Fairfax publishing family since 1900. The property was previously owned by Mary Fairfax, who passed away in September last year. According to the New South Wales heritage register, Fairwater is of rare historic, aesthetic, social, and scientific significance. The property was adorned with priceless artworks, including a 2-metre tall bronze nude Rodin sculpture and paintings by Chagall, Degas, and Arthur Boyd. The property was listed for sale this month, despite rumors that it would be bequeathed to the state of NSW, and reportedly took less than two weeks to sell. Atlassian, founded by Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar in Sydney in 2002, was worth $29.9 billion at the beginning of September. The pair, who attended the University of NSW together, are now among the 10 richest Australians. Interestingly, Farquhar, Cannon-Brookes' business partner, purchased the neighboring estate Elaine for over $70 million last year, which was previously owned by the Fairfax family.",

The company is stockpiling some components and switching to a different port to bring in certain parts ahead of Brexit. If a Brexit deal is not reached by the end of the year, Bentley may stockpile more parts and close its factory for a few extra days. The majority of Bentley's key parts, including engines and bodies, come from the European Union, primarily Germany. We may work for four days, or we may have a longer Christmas break and a longer Easter break if there is no deal, so that we can smooth the period between now and the middle of next year. The company is concerned about the potential for tariffs and long delays in importing components. In the best-case scenario, a no-deal Brexit would be an annoying impact on our annual profitability, while in the worst-case scenario, it would be quite damaging. A full no-deal Brexit would hurt our company, limiting our ability to invest. Bentley is stockpiling engines in preparation for Brexit and is even considering airlifting components if motorway traffic to and from Dover becomes severely disrupted. The company is also exploring all options, including relocating staff to a three-day workweek.

Between January 1 and September 30, Bentley sold 6,654 vehicles, a 12% decrease from the 7,498 vehicles sold during the same period the previous year. The company's sales revenue dropped to €1.1 billion from €1.3 billion, and its operating loss widened to €137 million from €31 million, largely due to exchange rate fluctuations and delays in the launch of the new Continental GT model.",

The 182-year-old House of Fraser store, located on Deansgate, was on the brink of closure in January after Mike Ashley's Sports Direct failed to agree on new rental terms with the building's landlords. However, a deal was reached on Friday night, with the council playing a crucial role. Council leader Sir Richard Leese praised the outcome, describing it as \"fantastic news for the city\" and expressing pride in the council's constructive involvement in saving the iconic store and hundreds of jobs. Leese thanked all parties involved for their cooperation. The rescue deal comes as a welcome boost for Ashley, who is set to appear before MPs to discuss the future of the high street. Ashley has been vocal about his desire to see more done to support struggling high streets and has called for landlords and politicians to take action. He acquired House of Fraser out of administration in August for £90m and has since pledged to keep 23 of its 59 stores open. Ashley is currently in talks with landlords and has offered rock-bottom rents in some cases. In a statement announcing the Kendals deal, Ashley said that when landlords, local authorities, and retailers work together, \"the outcomes can be outstanding.\" He added that the deal demonstrates that with cooperation, the high street can be revitalized. The massive Kendals store, spanning nearly 390,000 square feet, was acquired by a private investor in 2016 for £85 million. Manchester City Council had previously hailed the store as an institution, praising its iconic art deco design as a treasured aspect of the city's architectural heritage. The store supports a staff of 568 employees.",

Instead, the alliance will be led by the heads of the three companies, as announced by Osamu Masuko, CEO of Mitsubishi Motors. Speaking in Tokyo, Masuko stated that the alliance's capital structure was not discussed during a recent meeting in Amsterdam, but changes to the governance structure are seen as a possibility. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three companies, has been in detention for 10 days and may be charged with a crime after his detention is extended for another 10 days. The arrest has raised questions about the future of the alliance, which has been led by Ghosn since its inception. While Nissan and Mitsubishi quickly removed Ghosn as chair of their respective boards, Renault chose not to do so and has allowed him to remain as chairman and CEO. The alliance's leadership, excluding Ghosn, met in Amsterdam for an operational review, which was scheduled before the arrest. The meeting focused on operational issues, including research and development, basic components, and technology sharing. A separate meeting of the Renault-Nissan BV board would be required to remove Ghosn from his position. In a joint statement, the three companies reaffirmed their commitment to the alliance, stating that they have \"all – individually and collectively – emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\" The statement added that the alliance has achieved significant success over the past two decades and remains committed to its goals. Car industry analysts have questioned whether Renault can maintain its dominant position in the alliance. Renault has a significant stake of 43.4% in Nissan, which in turn owns 15% of Renault and 34% of Mitsubishi. The alliance's combined output in 2017 reached 10.6 million cars. In recent years, Nissan has been the primary contributor to the alliance's profits, leading some analysts to speculate that any restructuring could result in a more prominent role for the company. Furthermore, any changes could also lead to a greater involvement for Mitsubishi, which currently has no formal representation on the board of Renault-Nissan BV.",

The penalties stem from failures in systems designed to prevent money-laundering and protect problem gamblers. Casumo must pay a penalty package of £5.85 million, while Videoslots will pay £1 million instead of a financial penalty. Daub Alderney was previously fined £7.1 million. CZ Holdings surrendered its license to operate in the UK after the regulator launched an investigation. Six other firms are still under investigation. Additionally, three individuals had their licenses to serve as directors of gambling companies revoked, four were issued warnings, and three are under investigation. The total payout exceeds the largest fine previously handed out by the Gambling Commission, which was £7.8 million to online casino firm 888. Secretary of State Jeremy Wright warned that online operators ignoring their duty to protect players will face consequences. He emphasized that protecting vulnerable consumers is the top priority and that gambling operators must adhere to robust requirements to safeguard players and prevent money-laundering. The Gambling Commission has become stricter in its enforcement over the past two years, issuing millions of pounds in fines to companies like William Hill, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, and SkyBet for failures related to money-laundering and problem gambling. CEO Neil McArthur urged online casino operators to \"sit up and pay attention\" and take responsibility for properly applying their policies and procedures. He emphasized that operators must have a deep understanding of their customers and ask the necessary questions to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations.

These businesses decline to accept paper currency, instead requiring customers to pay with debit or credit cards. Some business owners claim cashless transactions are quicker and easier, but City Councilman Ritchie Torres believes this practice disproportionately affects low-income individuals and people of color who may not have access to bank accounts or credit cards. Torres argues that a cashless business model has an exclusionary effect on the impoverished, the homeless, and the underbanked. According to Torres, nearly 12% of New Yorkers lack bank accounts, and many struggle to maintain an account due to minimum balance requirements, fees, or lack of proper ID. Unauthorized immigrants, in particular, may face significant barriers to opening a bank account. Torres believes the proposed ban is necessary to prevent a \"gentrification of the marketplace\" and ensure equal access to goods and services for all individuals. He views this as a new frontier of anti-discrimination law, addressing the unequal impact of cashless transactions on marginalized communities. However, Andrew Rigie, head of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, suggests finding a balance between the benefits of cashless transactions and ensuring all customers have access to goods and services. While cashless restaurants may offer operational and worker safety benefits, they should not discriminate against individuals without credit cards.",

Trump's comments make it highly unlikely he will heed Beijing's call to refrain from increasing tariffs starting next year. The move would raise the existing 10% US import tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from January 1. Economists warn that if the US-China trade war escalates, the global economy could suffer significantly over the next decade, potentially losing up to 2% of GDP growth by 2030. The ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond their borders, with no real winners in a globalized economy. Trump's comments also suggested that Apple products could be subject to tariffs, sparking a sell-off in Apple shares. Recent developments, including the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, have helped to cool tensions between the White House and other countries.

In November 2016, attackers exploited stolen credentials to access Uber's cloud servers and download 16 large files containing sensitive information. The compromised data included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and location information, as well as drivers' weekly pay, trip summaries, and in some cases, driver's license numbers. The breach was attributed to inadequate information security measures and was exacerbated by Uber US's decision not to disclose the attack. The Information Commissioner's Office deemed this a malicious attack, rather than a typical bug bounty scenario, as the hackers exploited the vulnerability to steal personal data. As a result, none of the affected individuals were notified of the breach, and the company only began monitoring accounts for fraud 12 months later. The potential fine was reduced due to the fact that Uber's European branches were not informed of the breach, and there was no evidence that the compromised data was misused. Uber US was ordered to pay $148 million for failing to notify drivers about the breach. To strengthen our systems, we have implemented numerous technical enhancements and made significant changes to our leadership structure to ensure transparency with regulatory bodies and customers. We have appointed a chief privacy officer, data protection officer, and chief trust and security officer. We view our mistakes as opportunities to learn and are committed to earning the trust of our users every day.

If InSight navigates this precise keyhole, it should land squarely in the middle of Elysium Planitia.

The salamander's remarkable ability to regrow a lost tail involves a complex process of cell migration and gradual regeneration over several weeks. The regenerated tail is fully functional and identical to the original, with the spinal cord and nerves fully restored. The axolotl, a salamander relative, boasts even more impressive regenerative abilities, capable of regrowing its tail, limbs, skin, and almost any other body part. Each time a limb is removed, it regrows almost perfectly, making the axolotl a valuable subject for studying human limb regeneration. Starfish can regrow arms that detach from their central disc, and some species have even been observed to regrow an entire body from a lost arm. To accomplish this, starfish store nutrients in the detached arm until they can regrow their mouth.

Official statistics showed that the economy rebounded from a cold winter earlier in the year, as consumers splurged during the World Cup and a prolonged heatwave. However, more detailed data revealed that consumers, burdened by rising utility bills and transportation costs, had to rely on their savings to maintain their spending habits, as their disposable income remained stagnant. According to Rob Kent-Smith, statistician at the ONS, households have spent more than they earned for an unprecedented eighth consecutive quarter, raising concerns about their ability to sustain their spending and drive the economy. Recent surveys have fueled concerns that consumer spending is losing momentum, with several high street retailers reporting dismal sales in November. Asos's surprise profit warning has added to these concerns, as analysts had grown accustomed to web-based operators weathering the spending downturn. Business investment has declined for the third consecutive quarter, a trend not seen since the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. This cumulative effect is expected to reduce GDP growth in the final quarter of 2018 to nearly zero. The Bank of England attributed the decline in business investment to Brexit uncertainty, although the risk of border disruptions has led to increased spending on warehousing and port capacity. Companies are stockpiling goods at their highest level since 2016, suggesting they are under pressure to build large inventories in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit. The GfK monthly health check found consumer confidence at its lowest level in five years, and a Lloyds bank monitor registered the lowest business morale since the 2016 Brexit referendum. The Bank of England lowered its growth forecasts on Thursday, predicting quarterly expansion of 0.2% for the last three months of 2018 and the first three months of 2019.",

The company achieved its third consecutive record-breaking profit, driven by a strong holiday retail season and its growing high-margin businesses, including cloud computing and advertising. The Seattle-based company posted a profit of $3.03 billion, or $6.04 per share, a substantial increase from $1.86 billion, or $3.75 per share, in the same quarter last year. Revenue skyrocketed 20% to $72.38 billion. Amazon's voice-controlled virtual assistant Alexa and the devices that play it played a vital role in the company's performance. According to Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO, \"Alexa was extremely busy during the holiday season. Echo Dot was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon globally, and customers purchased millions more devices from the Echo family compared to last year.\" Notably, Amazon's cloud-computing division reported a 45% surge in revenue in the fourth quarter, solidifying its lead over Google and Microsoft. The division has been growing at a rate of 40% per year and is a high-margin business compared to retail. The cloud business has become essential to Amazon's success, contributing not only to revenue but also to profits. Sales at Amazon Web Services soared to $7.43 billion from $5.11 billion a year ago, exceeding analyst estimates of $7.29 billion. The segment accounts for around 10% of total revenue. Amazon's stock has risen 18% over the past year, and its market capitalization, which exceeded $840 billion as of Thursday afternoon, is the largest of any publicly traded company in the world.

According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, UK car factories produced 1.52 million vehicles last year, a 9.1% drop from 2017. Production for the domestic market fell by 16.3%, while investment in British car manufacturing plummeted to £588.6 million, the lowest level since 2012. The industry is holding off on further investments due to Brexit uncertainty. The global automotive industry is grappling with multiple challenges, including declining car sales in China and a slump in demand for diesel vehicles in Europe. UK-based manufacturers are particularly concerned about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on their businesses, which rely heavily on \"just-in-time\" deliveries of parts. Delays at the border could be costly and risk British jobs. Two-thirds of UK car exports go to countries with preferential trading arrangements, including the EU and the US, which would default to less favorable World Trade Organization terms if there is no transition period. EU countries accounted for more than half of the UK's car exports in 2018. Some major parts manufacturers have already cited Brexit as a reason for relocating jobs abroad. Ford's European president refused to rule out the possibility of closing plants that employ thousands of workers if a no-deal Brexit occurs. Hawes dismissed claims that German carmakers will pressure the EU to offer the UK a better deal, calling them \"utter nonsense\". He also expressed skepticism about the idea of a managed no-deal Brexit without a transition period, describing it as a \"fantasy\".",

However, not everyone agrees, as seen in Sarah Vine's recent column in the Daily Mail, where she expresses disapproval of \"hospital selfies.\" As someone who has spent four days in the hospital over the past two months, I've found that sharing photos from my hospital bed has been a great way to stay connected with friends and family. I enjoy posting updates on Twitter and Instagram, and it's a way for my friends to keep up with my life and offer support. Sharing my experiences has also helped me feel more connected to others, especially during times when illness can be isolating. Chronic illness can make people feel unattractive and like they don't fit into societal beauty standards. By sharing my own experiences, I'm trying to challenge that idea and show that people with disabilities or illnesses are still attractive and worthy of respect. The \"hospital selfie\" movement has helped demystify disability and illness, and I've received many grateful messages from people who appreciate my openness about my health. These messages have come from others with epilepsy who feel less alone, from parents who want to show their children that they're not the only ones dealing with health issues, and from people who are looking for coping mechanisms and advice.

This figure surges to a remarkable 40% for mothers of two children. Researchers from Manchester and Essex universities analyzed biological data from 6,025 UK participants to investigate the impact of working hours and family conditions on stress levels. The study, published in Sociology, found that working from home or having flexible hours had no significant effect on women's chronic stress levels. However, reducing working hours had a positive impact on stress levels. Work-family conflict is a significant contributor to increased psychological strain, stress, and decreased wellbeing, particularly for parents of young children. The study's findings are based on 11 biomarkers that measure the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems. Chronic stress, resulting from repeated stressful events and combinations of social and environmental stressors, can have a significant impact on overall health. Women working full-time with two children had biomarkers indicating chronic stress, including hormone levels and blood pressure, that were 40% higher compared to those with no children. Women working full-time with one child had 18% higher levels of stress than those with no children. Flexible work practices aim to help employees achieve a better work-life balance, which should reduce work-family conflict. While reduced-hours flexible work arrangements did help moderate the relationship between family and work stressors, there was limited evidence that flexible work arrangements were associated with lower chronic stress responses. Notably, reduced work hours could lead to lower chronic stress markers for fathers.",

Retail businesses increased their stock-to-sales ratio in January to its highest level since February 2008, according to the latest report from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly distributive trades survey. The report reveals that retailers anticipate a decline in demand and have built up inventory in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit at the end of March. As the UK's exit from the EU remains uncertain, a growing number of companies are intensifying their plans for a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit. Luxury carmaker Bentley and retailers such as Dixons Carphone and Pets at Home have announced measures to secure their supplies in the event of disruptions at British ports. Wholesalers are stockpiling in case the UK exits the EU without a deal, marking early signs of companies preparing for a no-deal Brexit. January sales volumes stabilized after a challenging festive trading period, but were still below average for the time of year, marking one of the worst periods since 2011. Sales of clothing, footwear, and leather goods, as well as hardware and DIY items, declined, while grocers and online sales reported increased volumes. The CBI predicts a more optimistic outlook for the coming month, with retailers expecting sales volumes and orders to rise in the year to February. Retailers should be experiencing a surge in sales right now, thanks to the increasing pace of real wage growth and the ongoing growth in employment.

The study by the Resolution Foundation found that the retail industry has the highest rate of redundancies, with a sharp increase in shop closures nationwide. Major high street retailers have announced job cuts and store closures, exacerbating the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The decline in consumer spending, fueled by inflation following the Brexit vote, and changing shopping habits have contributed to the struggles of traditional stores. The study showed that 31% of retail workers who lose their jobs end up unemployed, compared to 26% across all industries. Two in five former retail workers are unemployed for at least six months, with younger workers facing greater risks. The report found that three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30, despite this age group making up only a third of the retail workforce. According to Daniel Tomlinson, life has become tougher for those leaving retail, who are more likely to find themselves unemployed – and for longer, too. Policymakers cannot reverse the shift towards online shopping, but they can and should focus on supporting those most affected. The study found that there has been a long-term decline in retail employment in the UK since 2003, with the number of jobs shrinking from 10.8% to 9.5% of the overall workforce. Britain now has a lower proportion of workers in wholesale and retail compared to Germany. Despite multiple rounds of job cuts, the job market has adapted by creating new opportunities in industries such as hospitality and social care.

The consumer group recommends packing essential items like food, water, and diapers to cope with prolonged delays. Alicante airport, which serves popular resorts like Benidorm, is expected to be severely impacted, with visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote, and Málaga likely to experience significant delays. The group estimates that an additional 90 seconds per UK passport could add five hours to processing time for a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers. Alicante airport's high volume of UK arrivals, processing up to 10 planes from the UK in an hour, makes it particularly vulnerable. Portugal has announced plans to introduce special UK lanes at Faro airport and Funchal, but Spain has yet to confirm its position. Travel editor Rory Boland warns that airports can be chaotic even in normal circumstances, and a no-deal Brexit could lead to extremely long queues.

The analysis was based on data from the European Tourism Association. According to the UK government's official advice, British tourists would not be entitled to use designated lanes for EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals in a no-deal scenario. They may be required to present a return or onward ticket and face additional checks to ensure sufficient funds.

Dunkerton, confident in his bid, stated \"I'm confident we'll win\" at a pre-vote press conference. Two key shareholders, Investec and Schroders, have backed Dunkerton's campaign, controlling around 10% of Superdry's shares. To succeed, Dunkerton requires a simple majority of votes cast on Tuesday. However, insiders suggest the outcome is uncertain. The tension ahead of the vote escalated on Friday when Schroders refused to commit to supporting Dunkerton. Superdry has received public backing from Aberdeen Standard Investments and proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Pirc. Sutherland, prepared to defend himself against Dunkerton's accusations, believes the brand needs to evolve. Dunkerton's 18% stake has lost over £150m in value since he left the company, and the company's market value has plummeted. The stakes are high on Tuesday, as Superdry has warned shareholders that Dunkerton's return will likely lead to a mass exodus of board directors.",

It doesn't measure reliability or the likelihood of an observed result, but rather the probability of observing the experimental result or a more extreme result if the experiment had no effect. This is known as the null hypothesis, a crucial aspect of the test. The test itself doesn't examine the possibility of an effect being present, although it's commonly used when one is suspected. Despite articles highlighting this point in the scientific literature for over 30 years, scientists, including ourselves, have only recently begun to grasp this logic.\n\nRegarding Richard Wilkinson's letter about unemployment statistics, I'd like to raise a different concern. He mentions the 30 changes to the administrative definition of unemployment between 1979 and 2000, which aimed to reduce the \"claimant count\" numbers and make comparisons over time more challenging. However, the statistics published last week are consistent over the 44-year period covered, using an internationally agreed definition of unemployment and unaffected by changes in the benefits system. I agree with Richard that the record low unemployment rate raises further questions, particularly about how this statistic fits into a broader description of the labor market, including the experiences of people with low-paid and insecure jobs, such as those with zero-hours contracts. While the unemployment rate is an important indicator, it's not the only metric that matters.",

The sharp losses on European and Wall Street stock exchanges followed data showing weak economic growth in the European single currency bloc in the first quarter of 2019, dispelling hopes of a rebound from a weak finish to last year. Economists attributed the poor industrial output figures to a slowdown in China and the global economy, raising the prospect that growth for the rest of 2019 would be weaker than expected. The New York stock market slumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped 2% and markets across Europe suffered steep losses. The IHS Markit flash purchasing managers' index for euro area factory output showed that output contracted the most since December 2012, a period marked by the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis. Analysts attributed the decline to disruptions caused by Brexit, but noted that faltering demand for exports amid the US-China trade dispute had a more significant impact. Germany's manufacturing sector recorded its steepest decline in output in seven years, with new factory orders deteriorating to the greatest extent since the financial crisis. Germany's industry woes are linked to China's slowing economy, triggered by US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on Chinese goods in a bitter trade standoff with Beijing. Chinese car sales fell for the first time in almost 30 years last year, a significant blow to several German car manufacturers, which rely heavily on China as their largest export market. Germany narrowly avoided recession last year, and the PMI index, compiled by surveying around 5,000 companies across the euro area, showed that Germany and France were the worst performers. Other parts of the eurozone recorded stronger growth. The survey suggests that the economy is expected to grow by around 0.2% in the first quarter. The bigger picture is that the eurozone economy is still moving at a slow pace, with Germany's manufacturing recession and Italy's broader downturn holding the region back.",

Anxiety sets in - do you firmly grasp it to demonstrate enthusiasm, take it gently to show respect, or opt for something unique? According to Nilesh Dosa, a youth mentor at Ernst & Young, schools are failing to teach young people essential skills, including proper handshaking techniques. We're producing academically talented students who lack the fundamental skills for the workforce, he says. Etiquette consultant Jo Bryant agrees, emphasizing that a strong handshake is crucial in making a good impression. You can have all the qualifications in the world, but if you enter an interview with poor body language, eye contact, and a weak handshake, you won't get the job, she warns. Your interviewer needs to like you and want to be around you. To shake hands correctly, Bryant advises maintaining eye contact, being firm, and ensuring your palms are together. Avoid bone-crushing, but also don't be too limp - that's a sign of underconfidence. A handshake that's too limp can feel like an empty gesture, while one that's too firm can be seen as arrogant. When interacting with someone, you can discreetly wipe your hands before meeting them, not in their presence. Avoid using dominating body language, such as placing your hand on top of theirs or clasping their forearm. To improve your handshaking skills, Bryant recommends practicing with a friend and seeking feedback. This may seem unusual, but it's similar to how you would practice other social skills.",

From now on, we'll refer to these events as unexplained aerial phenomena rather than unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe concept of alien abductions gained popularity in the 1990s through TV shows like \"The X-Files,\" leading many to believe in extraterrestrial life. However, it was revealed that the characters Mulder and Scully were fictional, leaving some to wonder how people continue to claim alien abductions. The answer is straightforward: people are mistaken. Or is it?\n\nDr. Young-hae Chi, a lecturer at Oxford University, takes the alien abduction theory seriously, despite not being a psychologist or materials scientist. He teaches Korean at the faculty of oriental studies and has spoken at conferences about the topic. In a 2012 lecture, he disputed the notion that visiting aliens have sinister plans to take over the world, instead proposing that their secret breeding program to create alien-human hybrids is a noble effort to save humanity from environmental disaster.\n\nDr. Chi has written a book expanding on his theories, but critics may question whether he has any concrete evidence to support his claims. While the recent warming of the Earth is well-documented, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of an alien breeding program. Some alleged alien abductees claim to have experienced \"sexually oriented actions with aliens or other human abductees under mind control,\" but I remain skeptical. Apparently, some recall seeing jars containing hybrid toddlers and fetuses on the alleged alien spaceships. I acknowledge that these individuals may have undergone a traumatic experience, but is there any concrete evidence to support the existence of aliens? Unfortunately, the lack of detectable evidence may be due to the fact that aliens allegedly reside in a different dimension.

This groundbreaking finding implies that scents could be leveraged to influence food choices, such as subtly infusing aromas to make food taste sweeter and reduce sugar consumption. When driving at night, many individuals experience motion-induced blindness, where red lights momentarily vanish when glancing at oncoming traffic. This phenomenon arises when the brain disregards visual information presented against a moving backdrop. A striking correlation exists between hearing and vision in speech perception, known as the McGurk effect, where the auditory and visual components of a syllable can conjure the perception of a third sound. The visual presence of cutlery significantly impacts how we perceive the flavor of food, with research demonstrating that yoghurt tastes sweeter when consumed with a white spoon compared to a black spoon. There exists a surprising overlap between smell and sound in human perception, with experiments consistently revealing that individuals pair specific scents with particular instruments and pitches. For instance, a piano is often linked to a fruity aroma, while brass is associated with a musky odor. This phenomenon is thought to be triggered by the olfactory tubercle, an area of the brain that responds to both auditory and olfactory stimuli.",

Research reveals that the dominant commercial cultivar grown in Hawaii originated from a single tree in southern Queensland in the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was established using a single cultivar from Australia, which was repeatedly cloned, resulting in a lack of genetic diversity. This lack of diversity has led to concerns about crop productivity, disease resistance, and the ability to grow macadamia trees in new areas. Researchers hope that their findings will lead to the discovery of wild trees and more \"novel genes\" that could improve the crop.\n\nBy analyzing genetic markers, researchers traced the origins of Hawaii's macadamia industry back to Queensland. They found that the Hawaiian cultivar had distinctive gene markers in common with a small crop of trees in the Mooloo area, near Gympie, which is 160km north of Brisbane. Historical records show that seeds from these trees were taken to Honolulu in 1896.\n\nDespite being found in a narrow band of subtropical rainforest, Australia's native macadamia trees have a rich genetic diversity compared to commercial crops. This means that there is hope for discovering diverse genes in Australian forests and even in backyards. The researchers found that there is a strong geographic pattern to the diversity of macadamia trees, with all the diversity coming from south-east Queensland and northern NSW. The Hawaiian germplasm is very narrow, meaning it has only come from one locality.\n\nThe researchers also found that some unique genetic markers in commercial trees could not be matched with known wild trees. This could be due to the loss of diverse genes in the wild through land clearing, or it could be that they continue to exist in domestic cultivated plants. Some of the lost diversity might be found in cultivated plants, parks, gardens, or backyards. The oldest known cultivated macadamia tree is located in Brisbane's city botanic gardens, which was planted in 1858.\n\nAustralia's macadamia industry is significant, with the crop accounting for 14% of the country's total horticultural exports in 2017.",

The judge suggested that the next hearing may take place at Belmarsh Prison in south London if it is convenient for all parties. The US has requested Assange's extradition, initiated after his removal from the Ecuadorian embassy in London on April 11. He faces charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years. Additionally, he is being charged with violating the Espionage Act by publishing classified information through WikiLeaks, which could lead to decades in prison. Prosecutors have announced 17 additional charges against Assange for publishing secret diplomatic cables and files on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Assange, 47, was previously charged with attempting to hack a Pentagon computer system. WikiLeaks stated that Assange had been moved to the hospital wing of Belmarsh Prison due to a \"dramatic\" loss of weight and deteriorating health. Assange is currently serving a 50-week prison sentence for breaching bail conditions to avoid extradition to Sweden. He sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 to evade extradition on charges of sexual assault, which he claims are unfounded.",

However, a recent announcement from the Department of Energy suggests that the country's natural resources also embody freedom. According to a news release, US Undersecretary of Energy Mark W Menezes has dubbed the country's natural gas reserves \"freedom gas\" to promote increased exports. The Department of Energy has approved the expansion of a liquefied natural gas terminal off the Texas coast, which Menezes claims will spread \"freedom gas\" globally by providing a diverse and affordable source of clean energy to America's allies. The concept of \"freedom gas\" may seem unclear, but it's being quantified down to the smallest unit. Steven Winberg, another Department of Energy official, endorsed the move, stating that the US is promoting an efficient regulatory system to export \"molecules of US freedom\" worldwide. It's unclear whether Trump administration members are aware of the absurdity of the concept, but Energy Secretary Rick Perry appears to believe in it. In a recent statement, Perry compared the country's efforts to deliver \"freedom gas\" to Europe to the liberation of the continent from Nazi Germany occupation 75 years ago.",

Consumer advocacy group Which? sent letters to nine airlines in December, warning them that they may be violating consumer laws by retaining clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger fails to show up for the first leg of the same booking. Of the nine airlines contacted, only Flybe agreed to modify the clauses, although it has not entirely removed them. The airlines that retained the clauses were British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Air France, Singapore, Qatar, and Swiss. KLM does not cancel the return flight ticket if the first leg is missed, instead charging a fixed-rate fee ranging from €125 to €3,000 to passengers at the airport. The Civil Aviation Authority added to the pressure on airlines, expressing concern over their failure to remove the no-show clauses. Which? called for the \"rip-off\" no-show clauses to be banned, citing Austria's example, which banned the practice in April. It is unreasonable for an airline to cancel a passenger's return flight – often without warning – simply because they've missed the first leg of their journey. Airlines have exploited this tactic for far too long, leaving passengers miserable, stranded, and out of pocket by hundreds or even thousands of pounds. According to the CAA's report, their enforcement powers are limited, suggesting that government intervention may be necessary to address the issue. Airlines claim that these clauses prevent passengers from taking advantage of cheaper return flights, which are sometimes offered instead of single tickets.",

The tragedy occurred when two galleries collapsed at the same mine site where six lives were lost in 2016. At least 19 illegal miners were killed when part of the open-pit mine collapsed, and further fatalities are possible. The governor of Lualaba province reported that at least 36 \"clandestine artisanal diggers\" lost their lives in the accident. Glencore blamed the illegal miners for trespassing at the copper mine and putting their lives at risk. The miners were working along two narrow strips when they caved in, resulting in the loss of life. Glencore reported a growing number of artisanal miners trespassing at the mine, with an estimated 2,000 illegal miners gathering on the site every day. The company expressed concern about the \"daily intrusions\" posing a significant risk to its employees, operating equipment, and the illegal artisanal miners themselves. Glencore emphasized that the incidents were not linked to the mine's operations and would not affect production. The company is assisting search and rescue operations with local authorities and urging all illegal miners to cease trespassing on the site, which poses a risk to their lives. Deadly mining accidents are common in the DRC, where high unemployment and the pursuit of copper for sale often lead to dangerous conditions. Glencore is working to inform local communities of the dangers associated with illegal trespassing on mining sites, stating that the safety and security of its employees, contractors, and host communities is of paramount importance. This accident marks Kamoto's deadliest incident since 2016, when a 250-meter pit wall collapsed, resulting in the deaths of six miners. Following news of the collapse, Glencore's shares plummeted 4.9% to 263.9p, wiping £1.8 billion from the value of the Swiss-based energy company.",

The idea that women will assume leadership roles, not just on Earth but in the galaxy, is not entirely far-fetched. It's possible that men have had their time and it's now women's turn to take the reins. According to this theory, women will either quietly eliminate men in their sleep or leave them behind as they colonize space. However, this raises the question of how they plan to reproduce without men's involvement. The answer is that the matriarchy only needs a supply of frozen sperm to get started. While it's possible that men might resist this plan, new research suggests that frozen sperm can survive in space with no adverse effects. Scientists have found that by subjecting sperm samples to weightlessness, they can collect and store it for future use, raising the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth, allowing the matriarchy to impregnate themselves as needed.\n\nThe absence of gender-based biases and stereotypes could contribute to a more cohesive and efficient all-female space mission. In contrast, all-male missions in the past may have been plagued by similar issues. NASA reportedly conducted a secret study on long-term space travel, suggesting that to prevent conflicts, the crew should consist only of individuals of the same gender - either all men or all women. The study concluded that an all-female crew would be a better option, as men might argue over who should be in charge. This is a pattern observed throughout human history. While an all-female spacecraft would likely still see some romantic entanglements, at least the risk of pregnancy during a space flight would be eliminated. One could joke that the sperm would be safe, but it's unlikely that the men on board would declare themselves kings of the ship once the women departed.",

However, local residents' worries may be unfounded, as Lloyds' research indicates that homes near budget supermarkets like Lidl have seen a 15% increase in value over the past four years, outpacing those near Waitrose. In fact, homes near Lidl are worth £5,411 more than similar properties in the area. Discount stores like Lidl and Aldi have gained popularity among affluent shoppers, with Lidl and Aldi now controlling nearly 14% of the UK market, according to Kantar analysts. This shift has seen them overtake Waitrose, which has traditionally been associated with middle-class shoppers.

The airline had argued that the strike ballot was invalid, but the high court rejected this claim on Tuesday.

Despite being legally entitled to call a strike, Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said the union will not set dates until after further talks with the airline at Acas this week. Strutton emphasized that the airline has admitted that even one day of strike action would cost more than what the pilots are asking for, and urged the airline to negotiate on pay and rewards. A BA spokesman expressed disappointment with the court's decision and stated that the airline remains open to talks, adding that it will continue to pursue all avenues to protect customers' holidays this summer.

The sale is not anticipated to influence discussions regarding the remainder of British Steel. TSP Projects, a York-based company, will be integrated into Systra, with the proceeds from the sale likely allocated to British Steel's lenders. The sale price was undisclosed, but Systra will assume TSP's £70m pension liabilities. TSP Projects' CEO, Craig Scott, emphasized that the liquidation of British Steel did not pose a threat to his company, which boasts a strong client base. Scott expressed his satisfaction with the sale, stating that TSP Projects will now focus on its core business under a new permanent owner. The company's employees will not lose their jobs, and there may be opportunities for new hires. TSP Projects has worked on notable projects, including the redevelopment of King's Cross and Reading stations.

Franco Manca's unique menu, featuring sourdough pizzas, green cola, and vegan cheese, resonated with changing consumer tastes. The contrasting fortunes of the two chains were highlighted by Pizza Express's falling profits and decision to halt new restaurant openings, while Franco Manca attracted more customers and capitalized on declining rents to expand its operations. Pizza Express reported a 7.7% decline in underlying profits to £32.4 million for the six months ending June, and opened only two new branches during the period. The company plans to focus on upgrading its existing sites and revamping its menu rather than expanding its physical presence. Franco Manca, founded in 2008 in Brixton, south London, has managed to thrive in this environment, expanding its operations while other chains struggled. Franco Manca's owner, Fulham Shore, reported strong sales from its five new restaurants opened in the first 21 weeks of its financial year and is in talks to expand outside of London. According to Fulham Shore's chairman, David Page, Franco Manca's increased revenue is driven by new restaurant openings and growing customer numbers. Franco Manca has succeeded in standing out in the Italian market by offering something unique, and the company plans to capitalize on the trend of decreasing rents. Pizza Express's CEO, Jinlong Wang, stated that the company is taking a measured approach to growth in the UK and Ireland, prioritizing investments in its existing estate over new site openings. Founded in 1965, Pizza Express expanded rapidly in the 1990s and became a staple for families seeking affordable dining options. However, the casual dining market has struggled since 2016, with overcrowding and rising costs squeezing margins, particularly in the saturated Italian-themed segment. Jamie Oliver's Italian chain recently closed, and Prezzo and Strada have shut branches amid a sector-wide downturn that prompted landlords to reduce rents. According to Peter Martin, vice-president at CGA, a food and drink consultancy, \"In today's fast-paced and competitive market, consumers crave novelty, and there's an abundance of options.\"",

The Cork facility alone has seen over 300 workers have their contracts terminated, with more being sent home from other European sites. The staff had been on paid leave since August 2 when Apple announced it was suspending the grading program for a thorough review. Initially, contractors were sent home on August 2 with many told there was no work due to technical errors. However, last week, the contracting firms were informed by Apple that the grading work would be terminated, leading to mass job losses with little notice. Despite concerns about the ethics of the program, there is widespread anger about the way the job losses have been handled. A former contractor, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed relief that the truth came out, saying, \"We constantly discussed the ethics of the job but we didn't know how to bring it up.\" Apple reportedly told contractors that they do what they want and when they're done with a project or mess up, they tell the vendor company to let the contractor go, which they do. Many of the laid-off workers feel they have been left without protection after the scandal. In Cork, over 300 workers were expected to be let go with just one week's notice, with no redundancy package in place. Apple declined to comment on this matter when approached for a response.",

The companies have confirmed discussions for an all-stock merger, but a deal is not guaranteed. They have declined further comment until a deal is announced. Altria spun off Philip Morris International in 2008, with Altria focusing on the US market and PMI on international sales. Philip Morris International is valued at $121 billion, while Altria is valued at $88 billion. Analysts predict a merger due to declining cigarette sales and the rise of vaping. Altria recently acquired a 35% stake in Juul Labs for $12.8 billion. The e-cigarette market grew 97% in the past year, with Juul's sales increasing 783%. Altria has also entered the cannabis market, acquiring a 45% stake in Cronos Group for $1.8 billion. Philip Morris International has diversified its business, investing in Juul-rival iQOS. The device is now available in 48 markets and will be launched in the US next month. Philip Morris International has about 11 million iQOS users globally. In July, the company lowered its earnings forecast due to lower demand and declining shipment volumes. Rival British American Tobacco completed its takeover of Reynolds American Incorporated in 2017, creating the world's largest tobacco company. The merger was prompted by declining sales and the growing popularity of e-cigarettes and vapes. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.1 billion people smoked tobacco in 2015. WHO estimates that smoking claims around 6 million lives annually. Despite public health efforts, tax hikes, and regulatory measures, smoking rates are decreasing in many parts of the world.

The reported 34% reduction in major cardiac events is based on a 2.9% chance of benefit over five years for individuals, with no impact on mortality. We should ask three questions of any intervention: can it work, does it work, and is it worth it? The absolute risk reduction answers the crucial 'is it worth it?' question. Many patients might hesitate to take a medication if they're told there's a 97% chance they won't benefit from it over five years and it won't improve their life expectancy. Considering the differences between the UK and rural Iran, where the study was conducted, as well as the risk of over-medicating healthy patients and potential side effects, it's unclear whether the polypill is worth the effort. Only by examining absolute risk-reduction figures can we make an informed decision. Promoting a polypill as a broad solution to prevent illnesses in large populations prioritizes big pharma. The composition of this pill is concerning, as it may harm patients prone to bleeding and targets a single biomarker rather than addressing underlying chronic diseases. Experts agree that high cholesterol levels are an indication of increased oxidative stress, not a disease in themselves. Instead of treating a single biomarker with medication, it's more effective to address underlying chronic diseases by focusing on the root causes: unhealthy lifestyles and nutrition.\"",

Clearpay, an Australian fintech company, has gained popularity among millennials on tight budgets, alongside its rival Klarna. Many of M&S's competitors, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services, and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shoppers, including families with young children. M&S says its customers are increasingly seeking ways to spread the cost of larger purchases, and the Clearpay service enables them to do so by spreading the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800, and customers can manage their payments through a phone app without needing to apply for credit. Unlike traditional credit products, fintech firms like Clearpay and Klarna make money by earning commission on the sales transaction, although some also offer interest-bearing products. Shoppers who use these plans tend to spend more frequently, making it an attractive proposition for retailers like M&S, where clothing sales are declining. Over 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports, and Boohoo, work with Klarna, which has more than 3 million British customers.

According to the National Pig Association, specialized processing plants already struggling to meet orders require additional seasonal labor for hand-finished products. Meat processing plants are facing labor shortages equivalent to 15% of their required workforces, while seasonal specialists are experiencing shortages of up to 30%. The decline in the pound's value since the 2016 referendum, combined with uncertainty over residential status, has exacerbated labor shortages.\n\nEd Barker, senior policy advisor for the NPA, reported that processors reliant on European semi-skilled laborers are struggling to fulfill orders ahead of Christmas. \"It's been challenging for two years, but it seems particularly strained this year,\" Barker said. \"Three years of uncertainty and the decline in the sterling to euro exchange rate has altered the mindset of many laborers who have decided to return home.\" The British Poultry Council stated that its members are 20% short of regular staff, and seasonal specialists, such as turkey and goose producers, are under pressure due to difficulties in hiring up to 2,000 extra workers usually required ahead of Christmas.\n\nConcerns about meat production come after it was revealed that thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables are being left to rot in UK fields due to a shortage of pickers and packers caused by ongoing Brexit uncertainty. Last month, some fruit farmers reported having 30% fewer workers than required, highlighting the severity of the issue.",

By Monday, Rebecca Rivers, one of the suspended workers, had been fired, with reports suggesting that three other Google employees had also been let go. Rivers, a software engineer, announced her termination on Twitter. According to an internal memo, three other Google employees were fired on Monday, with the company citing \"clear and repeated violations of our data security policies\" as the reason. The firings sparked immediate allegations of retaliation from current and former Google employees. Meredith Whittaker described Rivers' firing as \"craven retaliation\" on Twitter, while Stephanie Parker called the terminations \"inhumane\" and \"illegal\". Whittaker and another organizer, Claire Stapleton, had previously left Google after alleging they were retaliated against by management. Rivers expressed pride in her actions, stating everyone has the right to know what their work is used for. The public protest and firings are the latest signs of growing labor unrest at Google, which has seen an increase in employee activism over the past two years. Many employees have been demanding a say in how their work is used and their rights as workers. Google employees have voiced discontent with several projects, including a contract to supply AI technology to the US Department of Defense's drone program, a censored search engine for China, and cloud services to the fossil fuel industry. A notable example of employee dissatisfaction was the walkout by approximately 20,000 employees over the company's handling of sexual harassment cases. Many employees have also spoken out about Google's extensive use of subcontracted workers, who often have fewer rights and benefits than regular employees. A group of worker-organizers published a strongly-worded Medium post on Monday night, expressing outrage at the company's actions.

Commissioned by State Street Global, the 4-foot bronze sculpture of a bold young girl was designed to promote a fund investing in companies with diverse gender representation. Overnight in March 2017, the original Fearless Girl materialized in downtown New York, standing opposite the Charging Bull statue near Wall Street. The sculpture rapidly gained popularity, attracting crowds of selfie-takers. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren utilized the statue to promote her policies. Sculptor Kristen Visbal has since created multiple copies of Fearless Girl, which now stand in cities such as London and Oslo. However, State Street took legal action to prevent the Fearless Girl from spreading further, seeking to have a statue removed from Federation Square in Melbourne. State Street argues that the replicas infringe on its trademark and dilute its message. According to the New York Times, State Street's lawyer claimed that Maurice Blackburn exploited the Fearless Girl campaign to promote itself. State Street has also sued Visbal for creating other copies, citing trademark violations. Visbal's lawyers argue that State Street's actions are designed to \"rob her of making a living from her art.\" The statue has been a mixed blessing for State Street, elevating its profile but also highlighting its own record on gender equality. In October 2017, State Street paid $5 million to settle charges that it had underpaid approximately 300 women in its employ.

Within hours, a petition was launched to demand reimbursement for lost contact hours, with students concerned about the impact on end-of-term grades. However, frustration is mutual between staff and students, who both feel universities are becoming impersonal and poorly run. Instead of directing anger towards lecturers, we should focus on the institutions forcing them to strike.\n\nTuition fees aren't solely spent on tutors' salaries; academics' pay has fallen by 17% since 2009. More than half of academics are on temporary contracts, adding to their daily stress and contributing to poor mental health among higher education staff. The UCU reports a 15% gender pay gap and a decline in pensions due to USS changes. Under these conditions, it's unrealistic to expect students to receive the best education.\n\nAs NUS vice president Claire Sosienski-Smith noted, \"Students won't be happy about missing lectures, but they're not happy about studying in institutions where staff are underpaid and overworked.\" Lecturers demonstrate a genuine concern for their students' academic well-being. It's a testament to their dedication that they undertake such a demanding role without adequate recognition.\n\nThe strike's success hinges on universities recognizing students stand firmly behind their lecturers and acknowledge the need for change. As students, we have a crucial role to play in sustaining these strikes, maintaining pressure for fairer working conditions.

For years, scientists have been intrigued by these sudden, low-frequency radiation events, which release more energy than the sun in a day and vanish instantly. Known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), these enigmatic signals appear randomly and without warning, leaving astronomers uncertain about when or where they will occur next. Over 60 FRBs have been recorded, with the only consensus being that they are unlikely to be extraterrestrial greetings. A year ago, scientists identified a repeating radio signal and traced it to a dwarf galaxy 3 billion light-years from Earth. Further observations suggested that the burst was generated by extremely powerful magnetic fields, effectively ruling out the possibility of alien laser signals. A team of astronomers from several Canadian universities has announced the discovery of a second repeating radio signal. The team's breakthrough came after activating the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope in British Columbia.

One notable upcoming shower is the Lyrids, active from April 16 to 28, with its peak on Sunday night into Monday morning, although the moon may hinder viewing this year. Ancient Chinese astronomers documented their observations of these bursts of light, dating back over 2,700 years.

The Lyrids shower originates from Comet Thatcher, which takes 415 years to complete its orbit around the sun. Comet Thatcher's last visit was in 1861, and its next approach will be in 2276. Meteor showers often result from icy comets' leftovers crashing into Earth's atmosphere, where small particles of debris pierce the sky at incredible speeds, creating a spectacular display of celestial fireworks.

The report highlights that nearly 500,000 land species are at risk of extinction due to threats to their natural habitats. The Sundarbans, a 4,000-square-mile region in Bangladesh and India, is home to the world's largest mangrove forest and a diverse ecosystem that supports hundreds of animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. However, 70% of the region is only a few feet above sea level, making it extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts. Researchers predict that the warming planet will decimate the few hundred Bengal tigers remaining in the region. By 2070, the study concludes that there will be no suitable tiger habitats remaining in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Climate change has already had a devastating impact on the world's endangered mammals, with a recent study finding that it has harmed almost half of them. The new report's lead author and colleagues examined the risks to the tiger population beyond sea level rise, which accounted for only 5.4-11.3% of the projected habitat loss in 2050 and 2070. They found that other climate-related factors were more significant threats to the Sundarbans' tigers. Habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal trade of animal parts have contributed to the global tiger population decline since the early 1900s. A recent study has discovered that the Bangladesh Sundarbans will likely experience a decline in its population due to an increase in extreme weather events and changes in vegetation. As the Sundarbans flood, the likelihood of conflicts between humans and tigers will rise. The situation could worsen significantly if a cyclone hits, a disease outbreak occurs, or a food shortage develops.

Paul Oetken's decision stated, \"The court acknowledges that the SALT cap is a distinct provision, but the states have failed to demonstrate that it exceeds Congress's authority to impose taxes.\" The lawsuit was joined by New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland. The 2017 tax law introduced a cap on state and local tax deductions, previously unlimited, to offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts. The cap and related provisions are expected to generate nearly $700 billion in revenue over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Independent analyses suggest that most residents in high-tax states like New York received a modest tax cut under the 2017 law. Other provisions of the law, such as reduced marginal tax rates, offset the loss of the deduction for many families. The state and local tax issue poses a challenge for Democrats seeking to restore a tax break primarily benefiting high-income earners. Prior to the cap's implementation, households earning $200,000 or more accounted for roughly half of the nearly $600 billion in state and local tax payments deducted on federal tax returns. Democrats argue that the SALT cap unfairly penalizes states with progressive tax policies, making state and local taxes more expensive for residents. This could hinder states' ability to raise taxes, particularly on wealthy residents, and increase pressure to cut spending. The four states claimed that the SALT cap constitutes an impermissible attempt by the federal government to influence certain states' tax policies.",

Like trilobites, several animals, including three-banded armadillos, pill bugs, and hedgehogs, can also roll into balls. Many scientists thought conglobation was a defense mechanism against predators, but Dr. Sigwart questions this assumption, arguing that rolling into a ball wouldn't protect an animal from being swallowed whole. In lab experiments, Dr. Sigwart found that chitons roll into balls to regain their footing after losing it. Her research, published in Biology Letters, suggests that chitons can make decisions and may be more intelligent than previously thought.",

Unlike typing on a typewriter or computer, where established methods exist, smartphone typing lacks a standardized approach. A recent study involving 37,000 participants found that a specific method - using two thumbs and relying on autocorrect while avoiding predictive text - yields faster typing. According to Per Ola Kristensson, this technique is essential for quick typing. The study, presented at a human-computer interaction conference in Taipei, focused on the Qwerty keyboard, originally designed to prevent mechanical jams in typewriters. Despite questions about its relevance and the emergence of alternative layouts, the Qwerty layout remains widely used.",

Herbivorous dinosaurs, which needed to chew through tough plant material, often replaced their teeth frequently. However, researchers were surprised to discover that a carnivorous dinosaur replaced its teeth even more frequently than some herbivores.

The underweight whale, still growing, was an unusual case, as adult sperm whales typically reach up to 120,000 pounds. A necropsy revealed that the whale's digestive system was severely clogged with 64 pounds of trash, including plastic bags, ropes, and a plastic drum, which it was unable to digest or pass through its system. This led to severe inflammation, ultimately causing the whale's decline and death. Sperm whales, which dive to great depths to hunt squid, often linger near the surface, making them vulnerable to ingesting floating debris that may be mistaken for food. Unfortunately, ocean pollution has devastating effects on wildlife, particularly in areas where buoyant debris accumulates in \"islands\" of trash that float above or just below the surface. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to contain at least 87,000 tons of plastic. As plastic pollution continues to grow, some scientists believe it may have a greater impact on animal populations than climate change. In 2008, two whales were found on a beach in Northern California with bags and netting in their stomachs, likely discarded by fishermen. One whale's stomach had ruptured, and the other, which had consumed over 160 pounds of trash, likely starved to death as the garbage obstructed its stomach. The authorities in Murcia have released the results of a necropsy conducted by the El Valle Wildlife Recovery Center as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the impact of plastic and trash in the coastal region's waters. Volunteers are working to clean up local beaches and are urging the public to be more mindful of their plastic waste disposal. It is crucial that we address this issue through both cleanup efforts and education, ensuring our citizens are aware of the importance of protecting our environment.",

The gypsy moth is the adult stage of a caterpillar species introduced from France in 1869, posing a significant threat to tree canopies. The gypsy moth's feeding habits are more destructive to trees than those of native tent caterpillars, which it resembles. A fungus targeting gypsy moths was first detected in the Northeast in 1989, with efforts to introduce it as a biological control measure dating back to 1910. In 2000, a coordinated program was launched by 11 states and the US Forest Service to combat the gypsy moth infestation.

This phenomenon, known as the Leidenfrost effect, has been observed by cooks and scientists alike. In 1756, German doctor Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost first described the effect in his book on water properties. French scientists have recently made a new discovery about the behavior of these skittering drops. When the droplets are small, the heat from the pan causes them to tilt and rotate, propelling them to roll. Previously unknown, this phenomenon was only discovered when scientists attempted to pin a water droplet to a precisely flat surface. The clear color of water makes it difficult to see the liquid's movement. Scientists had previously thought the droplets moved due to air currents or sliding down a slope, but new research shows they can move independently. \"It's surprisingly simple,\" said David Quere, a scientist at Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris. \"The drop is running away, and it has a little motor inside, which is surprising.\" Quere and his colleagues published their findings in Nature Physics this week. To observe the Leidenfrost effect, droplets of water were placed on a very flat, very hot, nonabsorbent surface held in place by a needle. The surface must be at least 400 degrees Fahrenheit for the effect to occur. Some recipes use this test to determine whether a pan is hot enough. Large drops have a flattened shape, resembling puddles. Within each drop, two convective cells rotate in opposite directions, canceling out each other's motion. The flow within the drop was visualized using tracers mixed with the water. As the water evaporates, the droplet shrinks and becomes nearly spherical, allowing for only one convective cell to exist. When the needle is lifted, the smaller droplet speeds away in the direction of its convective spin. The researchers' next step is to guide the droplets through channels or temperature gradients. There are still fundamental phenomena to be explored, such as why the surface temperature must be significantly higher than the boiling point for the drops to levitate. Interestingly, there is currently no clear answer to this question.",

        "Text": "Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is home to billions of planets, many of which remain invisible to human eyes - for now. Just three decades ago, we had no idea if there were planets beyond our own solar system. In 1995, astronomers made a groundbreaking discovery when they found a star in the constellation Pegasus wobbling due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive instruments that detect subtle changes in starlight caused by an orbiting planet. As a planet orbits its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again, a phenomenon that can be detected by these advanced instruments. The Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, revolutionized the field of exoplanet hunting by discovering thousands of planets. Unlike earlier methods, Kepler searched for small dips in starlight caused by a planet passing in front of its star. Kepler's findings were astounding, revealing a diverse range of exoplanets. In recent years, astronomers have made significant progress in directly imaging exoplanets, capturing blurry but tantalizing glimpses of alien landscapes. We've also discovered a free-floating planet and signs of planets being born. The next generation of planet hunters is now on the horizon. On April 16, 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, will launch and spend two years scanning the entire sky for minute dips in brightness caused by nearby alien worlds. TESS is equipped with four cameras that can cover a 96-degree swath of the sky. As a planet hunter, TESS's discoveries can be further studied by the next generation of telescopes on Earth and in space. If fortunate, TESS may uncover planets with lakes, oceans, and atmospheres rich in chemicals, allowing us to detect signs of habitability or even life. The Milky Way is estimated to harbor more planets than stars, with a vast diversity that remains largely unexplored. Our own planet remains the ultimate benchmark for our quest for life and meaning in the universe.",

Fresh insights into a small, icy body beyond Pluto have bolstered this notion. Astronomers led by Scott S. Sheppard from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington have disclosed the orbital particulars of this new world, dubbed the Goblin. Officially designated as 2015 TG387, the world was initially detected during a systematic search for new celestial bodies in the outer solar system, including the hypothetical Planet Nine. Three years of additional observations were necessary to fully comprehend the world's orbit. The astronomers have submitted a paper detailing their discovery to The Astronomical Journal. The newly discovered world, estimated to be approximately 200 miles wide, is currently situated about 7.4 billion miles from the sun, or roughly 2.5 times farther away than Pluto. Its closest approach to the sun is relatively close to its current distance.",

This symbiotic relationship between ants and antimicrobial bacteria has been in existence for tens of millions of years, according to a recent discovery by Dr. Currie and his team. The key evidence came from two 20-million-year-old ants found trapped in amber in the Dominican Republic, which revealed specialized pockets on one ant's head and gas bubbles on the other. \"It's as if the ants are mobile pharmaceutical factories,\" said Dr. Currie, a co-author of the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This finding suggests that ants preceded humans by tens of millions of years in partnering with microbes to produce antibiotics. Dr. Hongjie Li discovered the bacteria in the amber ants while inspecting the specimens using a scanning electron microscope at the Smithsonian Institution. \"It was a surprise to me,\" Dr. Li said. The team combined this finding with data on 69 other ant species to reconstruct the ant's evolutionary tree, which indicated that ants established their partnership with bacteria tens of millions of years ago.",

Researchers found significant differences in the diets of urban and rural rodents, with city rats enjoying a more varied and stable diet than their rural counterparts. By analyzing brown rat remains from Toronto between 1790 and 1890, scientists discovered city rats thrived on human waste, while country rats struggled to survive. According to Eric Guiry, city rats had a significantly higher proportion of meat in their diet, evident in their bones. Guiry and Michael Buckley are pioneers in paleoproteomics, using ancient bone proteins to gain insights into animal behavior. Guiry's interest in applying this technique to rats stemmed from a desire to learn about human populations in the 1800s without analyzing human remains. The research has practical implications for cities seeking to better manage rodent populations.",

The lander's seismometers, designed to detect marsquakes, picked up vibrations in the air, which are essentially sound waves. The moderate 10-15 mile-per-hour winds caused the lander's solar panels to vibrate, and the seismometers recorded these vibrations. The process is analogous to human hearing, with the solar panels acting like the eardrum, the spacecraft structure like the inner ear, and the seismometers converting vibrations into nerve signals. The recorded vibrations have a frequency of up to 50 Hertz, audible to humans as a low rumble. NASA has amplified the recording by two octaves, evoking the feeling of wind or ocean waves with an otherworldly quality. A second instrument, an air pressure sensor, detected sound vibrations, although at a much lower frequency audible only to certain animals. The air pressure sensor's readings, sped up by a factor of 100, raise the pitch by over six octaves. The instruments are not sensitive to higher frequencies, so the sounds are lower in frequency. Mars' incredibly thin air makes it more conducive to low-frequency sounds. The Viking landers detected some wind noise, but the recordings were made at lower sampling rates and didn't pick up any sounds at audible frequencies. The Viking seismometer detected spacecraft movements, but it would be a stretch to describe them as sounds. NASA attempted to send microphones to Mars on the Mars Polar Lander spacecraft, but it crashed during landing. The Phoenix Mars lander was equipped with a microphone, but it was left turned off to avoid any potential problems during landing.",

Despite this, scientists found that meteorites that fall on Earth are not similar to asteroids that pass through our neighborhood. According to Philipp R. Heck, curator at the Field Museum of Natural History, \"That's what everybody would have expected,\" but planetary scientists were surprised to discover that the most common types of meteorites on Earth are not common in space. A recent study published in Nature Astronomy revealed that mineralogical evidence in some meteorites pointed to a massive collision in the asteroid belt around 466 million years ago. Dr. Heck estimates that during this time, skywatchers would have seen about 100 times more shooting stars than we see today. To investigate meteorites that landed on Earth before this collision, Dr. Heck and his colleagues turned to ancient limestone from Russia, which is around a million years older. They extracted 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite from almost 600 pounds of rock. These crystals remain unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, allowing scientists to determine that 41 of them originated from space and were once part of specific types of asteroids. The mix of meteorites from this ancient period was strikingly different from what we see today, with more than a third belonging to a type called primitive achondrites, compared to less than half a percent today. The findings align with the growing understanding that the composition of meteorites is shaped by the history of asteroid collisions in the asteroid belt, rather than the proximity of asteroids to Earth's orbit. The new paper opens up new avenues of research, including the origins of achondrite meteorites, which may not all share the same origin.",

The animals' breathing, oxygen intake, heart rate, and swimming patterns were measured across various settings. The results showed little disparity in energy expenditure between resting and swimming at average speeds.

According to figures released Friday, Uber's ride-hailing service saw a significant increase in gross bookings, reaching $20 billion in 2016, more than double the previous year's amount. Net revenue, accounting for driver costs, reached $6.5 billion. Despite its growth, Uber remains unprofitable. The company reported an adjusted net loss of $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding Uber China's costs. This loss is attributed to investments in China, which were ultimately sold to Didi Chuxing.

Sound bars can be quite expensive, even surpassing the cost of a TV. So, why would anyone choose one? While \"need\" might be an exaggeration, sound bars have gained immense popularity because they effectively address two significant issues. Unlike older TVs with ample space for speakers, modern flat-panel displays are cramped, leaving little room for sound reproduction. As a result, smaller speakers struggle to produce high-quality sound. Furthermore, the limited space on the front of the TV forced manufacturers to relocate speakers to the bottom or back of the panel. Meanwhile, people shifted from playing music on CDs to streaming it on computers and phones. Sound bars, with their sleek design, eliminate the need for additional cables or equipment, featuring built-in Bluetooth for seamless wireless music playback.",

Notably, cows over the age of 10 appear to be nearly invulnerable to hunters. A team of scientists aimed to understand why senior cows are so skilled at survival. Is it because these elk are naturally more cautious, thereby allowing them to evade hunters more effectively? Or can cows learn to avoid hunters over their lifetime, even if they initially exhibit more daring behavior? Research published in PLOS One suggests that both factors are involved. By tracking dozens of female elk over several years, the authors found that, overall, cautious cows were more likely to survive. However, they also discovered that individual cows could adapt their behavior and adopt stealthier strategies as they aged. As cows aged, they tended to move shorter distances and seek safer terrain if they sensed a higher risk of encountering hunters.",

Despite human-defined boundaries, wolves roam freely across the region, unaffected by human efforts to restrict their movement. A recent study in Wildlife Monographs suggests that controlling wolf populations outside the preserve has had adverse effects on wolves within it. The study reveals that when Alaskan authorities culled wolf populations outside the preserve, survival rates within the preserve were lower than usual. This highlights the importance of communication and cooperation between wildlife managers within and outside preserve boundaries, with potential implications for global wildlife management programs. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has invested millions in an intensive predator management program since the 1990s, initially using sterilization and later shooting and killing hundreds of wolves from helicopters. Despite decades of effort, the program has failed to significantly increase the Fortymile caribou herd population, which remains at around 50,000 to 60,000. Research suggests that these efforts may not be effective in increasing caribou numbers. Over 22 years of monitoring wolves using radio collars, researchers found that wolf survival rates decreased during lethal management outside the preserve. Every single wolf pack left the preserve, Dr. Burch noted, as the state only targeted wolves outside the preserve, while many wolves that ventured out were shot and killed.",

Ordinarily, they feed on these mice, but a recent study implies that the surge in tick-borne disease may be linked to a decline in traditional mouse predators.

Imagine a mouse trying to evade a cat by moving erratically and unpredictably, thereby increasing its chances of survival. Similarly, in humans, this type of behavior is linked to creativity and cognitive complexity. However, understanding the human mind's capacity to generate randomness is a complex task. A team of European researchers recently conducted a series of experiments to measure human random choice-making abilities. They found that, on average, individuals are most skilled at producing random results around the age of 25. The team designed five tasks to test randomness, including simulating random coin flips, guessing the next card in a shuffled deck, and arranging a grid of black and white boxes to appear random. Over 3,400 participants from 4 to 91 years old took part in the experiment. The researchers used software to analyze participants' responses and identified the sequences that were most challenging for the computer to predict as the most random. By analyzing participants' performance against various factors, including age, sex, and educational background, the researchers found a strong correlation with age. Performance improved from childhood to the mid-20s and remained relatively high until the 60s, after which it began to decline. However, Dr. Zenil noted that even in older adults, there may be trade-offs that compensate for decreased randomness, such as increased experience and knowledge.",

Sometimes we struggle to cry when we should, and other times we cry without apparent provocation. Amidst this emotional complexity, it's refreshing to consider the straightforward explanation behind why onions make us tear up. Onions release a chemical called lachrymatory factor, which irritates our eyes when it reacts with other substances. Simply peeling an onion won't cause our eyes to water, but chopping, cutting, crushing, or smashing one will. This is because the onion's cells break open, allowing two previously separate substances to combine and form a potent chemical irritant. According to Josie Silvaroli, an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University, this chemical reaction is analogous to tear gas, as it releases a gas that hits the eyes and sensory nerves, causing them to tear up. The lachrymatory factor evolved as a defense mechanism to protect onions from microbes and animals, including humans. When an onion is damaged, it triggers this defense mechanism, releasing the chemical reaction as its cells break down.",

Years of conservation efforts by the Chinese government have led to a remarkable recovery of the panda population. In September 2016, the pandas were officially removed from the endangered species list, with an estimated population of 1,864, excluding cubs. This represents a significant increase from the low of around 1,200 in the 1980s. However, climate change and other factors could still devastate the pandas' habitat in the long term, rendering any population surge a temporary victory. The fragmentation of the panda population, now confined to just six mountain ranges and 30 isolated groups, is a major concern. According to Dr. Ouyang and her colleagues, Chinese conservation efforts have had a positive impact on panda habitats in recent years, and planned changes are expected to reduce pressures on the pandas and their habitat in the short term. However, infrastructure development, tourism, and other human activities could undermine these improvements. The researchers recommend several steps to prevent the pandas from becoming endangered again, including improving connectivity between isolated panda populations, reducing habitat fragmentation, establishing ecological red lines, expanding panda preserves, and restricting tourism in national parks containing pandas.",

As Facebook concluded its attendance at Capitol Hill hearings on Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, the company released its third-quarter financial results, revealing a 47% revenue surge to $10.3 billion and a 79% profit increase to $4.7 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations. The results solidified Facebook's dominance in online advertising, an area the company has faced criticism for in Washington this week. Lawmakers interrogated Facebook, Google, and Twitter about how Russians may have misused their platforms, including online ads, to fuel discord and polarization in the American electorate. Some lawmakers expressed discontent over the absence of top executives from Facebook, Google, and Twitter at the hearings, as well as the lack of attendance by their top lawyers. Facebook's general counsel, Colin Stretch, answered questions on behalf of the company, while Google and Twitter sent their top lawyers to participate.",

Avrich claims the original film, \"Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project,\" was watered down and now feels a moral obligation to rework it due to sexual harassment and rape allegations against Weinstein. From Ottawa, Avrich stated he wants to expand the documentary beyond its initial 11-minute conclusion, which focused on Weinstein's behavior as a sexual predator. However, Avrich must first resolve the issue with IFC Films, which acquired the documentary's distribution rights in 2010. Avrich has long alleged that IFC requested edits to the film and ultimately decided against a theatrical release to appease Weinstein. IFC has denied these claims, stating that the film was made available on various platforms and that they asked the filmmaker to remove 30 seconds of non-essential footage.",

As it expanded, it dispatched dark, twisted tendrils called rhizomorphs to explore the underground darkness and forage for sustenance. Today, this enormous organism covers an area the size of three Central Parks beneath the Oregon soil, potentially weighing as much as 5,000 African elephants. Known scientifically as Armillaria ostoyae, this behemoth is affectionately referred to as The Humongous Fungus, and it's officially recognized as the largest known terrestrial organism on the planet by the United States Forest Service. However, its impressive size comes with a deadly drawback: it's a highly destructive forest pathogen. While none have reached the same colossal proportions, other Armillaria species are also prevalent in North America, Europe, and Asia, causing root rot disease in forests, parks, orchards, and vineyards. What sets these fungi apart is their ability to send out stringy rhizomorphs that target weak trees, colonize their roots, and ultimately kill and consume them. A team of international scientists, led by Hungarian researchers, has made a breakthrough in the fight against these fungal giants. In a recent study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, they uncovered the genetic secrets behind Armillaria's remarkable ability to develop its unique rhizomorphs, grow to enormous sizes, and excel at killing host plants.",

This allowed the researchers to focus on how the body's internal clock affects things like metabolism.

These remarkable 'trees' aren't plants, but rather intricate homes built by Christmas tree worms on coral reefs worldwide. Constructed from calcium carbonate secretions, these tubes serve as homes for the worms, who emerge to feed, reproduce, and breathe using their branchial crowns. As you snorkel through the waters, look out for these vibrant, spiral-shaped cones that resemble miniature decorated firs. According to marine biologist Orly Perry, these 'trees' are \"really pretty, very colorful, very festive, and Christmassy.\" Despite their small size, these worm 'trees' make up for it with dazzling displays that rival the work of a skilled candymaker. In the Gulf of Aqaba, near Eilat, Israel, Perry has observed many of these 'trees' displaying a kaleidoscope of colors, including purples, greens, and whites. Unlike other creatures, Christmas tree worms don't burrow into the coral; instead, they latch onto dead spots or wounds and construct their tubes. By synchronizing their tube growth with the coral's growth, the worms ensure their homes remain stable and accessible. Once settled, these worms stay put for up to 30 or 40 years, unable to relocate. The locations where these larvae settle are not arbitrary; they appear to have a specific preference for certain coral species, often opting for less aggressive ones. In optimal environments, the worms are able to grow to their full size. According to Mrs. Perry, this phenomenon is reminiscent of human behavior: \"If you're comfortable in a place, everything is happy, and that's true for these worms too. Their size is directly impacted by their habitat choice.\" Some species within the Spirobranchus genus have a fondness for artificial surfaces, while others thrive on specific types of coral. Mrs. Perry discovered a potentially new species in the Gulf of Eilat that has a peculiar affinity for plastic buoys and metal surfaces on piers and staircases. It's possible that the larvae are drawn to these preferred habitats by signals emitted by older worms that have successfully colonized similar locations in the past.\"",

However, a recent study published in Veterinary Pathology has identified two cases of cancer in naked mole rats housed in zoos. According to Martha Delaney, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and lead author of the study, these cases do not preclude the possibility that naked mole rats may hold a clue to fighting cancer, but rather provide additional insights about what makes them less susceptible to cancer. Now that we have two cases of cancer in naked mole rats, we can study the colonies from which they came to understand why they are more prone to cancer compared to other zoo and research colonies. The discovery of cancer in naked mole rats is significant, as researchers have been studying the rodents for over a decade to understand why they are less prone to cancer.

        "Text": "Exxon Mobil and the energy industry faced intense scrutiny on Wednesday with the release of decades-old documents revealing the industry's knowledge of climate change. The documents, published by the Center for International Environmental Law, suggest that the industry understood climate change as far back as 60 years ago. According to Carroll Muffett, the environmental law center's director, Exxon's predecessor, Humble Oil, was aware of rising CO2 levels and global warming potential as early as 1957. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies, and organizations formed the Smoke and Fumes Committee to monitor pollution research and use science to undermine environmental regulations. Muffett believes the committee's actions would be echoed in later efforts to discredit climate science. The Center for International Environmental Law's work was first reported by Inside Climate News, which has previously published stories suggesting Exxon Mobil understood climate change risks from its own research and used that knowledge to plan activities. Exxon Mobil's own research funded climate denial groups until the mid-2000s. The investigations have led to a surge in activism against the company and energy industry, with the hashtag #exxonknew. Attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, have demanded information from Exxon about its internal research and funding of climate denial. Inside Climate News announced its article is the first in a series based on the environmental law center's work and documents. Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers dismissed the new allegations as absurd. Exxon Mobil is pushing back against an investigation into its knowledge of climate change, claiming the inquiry is not credible. The company is being investigated by four attorneys general, including Claude Earl Walker, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islands, who is working with a private law firm. Exxon Mobil filed a response in Texas, accusing Walker and his team of misusing their power and violating the company's constitutional rights. The company argues it has no physical presence in the Virgin Islands and therefore is not subject to the jurisdiction of the island's courts.",

For some, this may be accompanied by other symptoms: sudden back pain, a kick in the lower abdomen, or an urgent need to use the restroom. These sensations are reminiscent of those experienced by individuals who have passed a kidney stone. Researchers created a silicone cast of the inside of a kidney to study the effects of roller coasters on kidney stones. The study found that moderate-intensity, rattling roller coasters may dislodge small kidney stones in the outer ducts of the kidney and propel them towards the ureter. The study suggests that riding these roller coasters could be a potential treatment for patients with kidney stones five millimeters or less in diameter. A patient's passing of kidney stones after each of three consecutive rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster inspired the study. Dr. Wartinger and Dr. Mitchell created a 3D-printed silicone cast of a patient's kidney, filled it with kidney stones and urine, and rode the roller coaster 20 times, observing the movement of the kidney stones. The back of a roller coaster is a more effective spot to dislodge a small kidney stone, with a success rate of 64% compared to 17% at the front.

The Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, where chemicals like DDT and Agent Orange were once produced, has contaminated the surrounding waterways, allowing toxic substances to seep into aquatic animals' bodies. Despite the toxic environment, some aquatic animals have miraculously survived, including the Atlantic killifish, a small, silver fish that has adapted to thrive in this polluted ecosystem. According to a recent study published in Science, the killifish's ability to survive in polluted waters is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation. Researchers first discovered the fish's tolerance to toxic waters in the late 1990s and have since found that distinct populations of killifish have independently developed similar genetic adaptations to survive in highly polluted areas along the Atlantic coastline. The new study reveals that evolution can occur independently in different populations and that similar genetic changes can emerge in response to extreme environments. According to Diane Nacci, a biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency, the study provides a valuable example of how animals can adapt to rapidly changing environments. The researchers, led by Noah Reid, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Connecticut, analyzed the genomes of 384 killifish from polluted and less-polluted areas, finding that a single genetic pathway was responsible for the pollution tolerance in all regions, although with slightly different patterns of genetic changes in each population.",

The prevailing theory suggests that the Earth's atmosphere was dominated by heat-trapping carbon dioxide during the Cretaceous period, likely a result of intense volcanic activity. This greenhouse effect would have dramatically altered the polar ecosystem, allowing species like Tingmiatornis arctica and its prey to thrive. The Turonian age, a period of intense warming, is believed to have occurred between 93.9 million and 89.8 million years ago. During this time, the Arctic is estimated to have reached temperatures of around 57 degrees Fahrenheit at its coldest. Dr. Tarduno discovered two wing bones belonging to Tingmiatornis arctica in the snow-capped hills and glaciers of Nunavut. Initially, he found a small humerus in 1999, which didn't raise much interest. However, the discovery of a larger humerus a few years later piqued his interest. Although the second humerus didn't initially capture his attention, Dr. Tarduno and his team were distracted by a large turtle shell found on the same rock. \"We took it back to camp and realized, 'Wait a minute, there's another incredible fossil on the other side,' \" Dr. Tarduno recalled.",

This marks a historic moment, as \"Game of Thrones\" will be the first television series to appear on Imax screens. The event runs from January 23rd to 29th, with tickets going on sale soon. This move reflects the blurring of lines between media platforms, where content can be streamed across a variety of devices. It also highlights the efforts of media companies to turn their hit shows into massive events, as drawing large audiences becomes increasingly challenging. For Imax, this is part of a broader strategy to expand its programming beyond traditional films, as the North American box office struggles with declining sales.

The strategic objective of Panther, Jay Z's company, is to expand globally and scale up Aspiro's platform, technology, and services to meet growing demand. Jay Z's interest in Aspiro may be driven by his desire to tap into the niche market of high-fidelity digital music and capitalize on the growing trend. Aspiro's WiMP and Tidal services offer lossless audio formats significantly higher in quality than those of Spotify and most other streaming services. WiMP has 512,000 paying subscribers, according to Aspiro's latest quarterly report, while Tidal's customer numbers remain undisclosed, although it charges $20 per month, twice the average rate of most streaming services. The number of companies offering high-quality digital audio has increased recently, including Tidal, WiMP, Deezer's Elite version, PonoPlayer, and Sony's high-resolution Walkman, priced over $1,000. However, analysts note that consumers have shown little interest in these products, despite their high quality. For Jay Z, another potential motivation for acquiring a streaming service may be to expand the media portfolio of Roc Nation, which began as a music-focused joint venture with Live Nation Entertainment in 2008 and has since expanded to represent top athletes.",

The series, which follows siblings in a post-apocalyptic world, garnered 100,000 views without any promotional efforts. Following its release on Netflix, Hulu, and PlayStation, it attracted tens of thousands more viewers. According to Mr. Pizzolo, it's crucial to cater to both core comic book fans and new audiences. The inaugural series on the YouTube channel will feature a mix of comics from Black Mask and other independent publishers, including \"Liberator,\" which focuses on animal welfare activists, and \"Five Ghosts,\" which follows an adventurer possessed by literary characters. The channel will include links to purchase the comics and related merchandise.\n\nBlack Mask Studios was founded in 2012 by Mr. Pizzolo, a filmmaker, Steve Niles, a writer of horror novels and comics, and Brett Gurewitz, a musician and founder of Epitaph Records. The company was born out of \"Occupy Comics,\" a project aimed at raising funds for the Occupy Wall Street movement. This experience highlighted the challenges of publishing comics with a message. With the upcoming release of the animated version of \"Godkiller\" and \"Liberator,\" Black Mask will have a broader platform to share its message. Before the International Comic Con in July, the company will release the first part of the animated \"Godkiller.\" Kirkus Reviews has praised the comic's first volume, describing it as \"wickedly delectable\" and \"an experience rather than a story.\" Black Mask is also developing three comic-based TV series: \"Sinatoro,\" \"The Disciples,\" and \"Ballistic.\" Despite its small size, with only a handful of employees and freelancers, the company remains committed to its mission. Black Mask operates like a startup, with a scrappy and entrepreneurial spirit. As executive producers, we ensure that the creators of the comics are involved throughout the process. Historically, film and TV executives would often use comic books as a starting point and then depart from the original material, but now we're seeing a trend towards more faithful adaptations, which is a direct result of our hands-on approach.",

The difference is even greater if you opt for a policy with 3% annual inflation protection. The association found that a typical single woman will pay an average of 12% more than in 2013. Couples who buy a policy together may experience varying premium increases depending on the insurer. Genworth noted that its gender-specific pricing only applies to single policies. Insurers typically offer significant couples discounts, and the average premium for couples with inflation protection has risen by about 3% from last year. When considering long-term care insurance, it's crucial to explore ways to secure the lowest premium possible. Consumers should shop around as premiums for similar coverage can differ significantly among insurance providers. Insurance broker Rose Clayton advises women to keep the additional premium cost in perspective. While clients may initially be disappointed to learn that women pay a higher premium, it's not a deal-breaker. Instead, it serves as a reminder to plan for their golden years. A visit to a nursing home or assisted living facility can starkly illustrate the impact of women's longer lifespan.",

As a result, the amount banks can collect from retailers when consumers use debit cards will remain the same. For consumers, this means there won't be any significant changes for now. According to Adam Levitin, a professor of financial regulation and consumer protection, consumers shouldn't expect their fees to increase or their rewards to decrease. As part of the financial regulatory overhaul following the economic crisis, Congress aimed to cap the fees banks can charge retailers for debit card transactions. However, they left it to the Federal Reserve to write the rules, which ultimately reduced the fees to 21 cents per transaction, starting October 1, 2011, down from an average of 44 cents. On Friday, the US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia overturned a district court judge's July ruling, which had favored retailers. The original rule had been challenged by retailers, who argued that the Fed had been too generous to banks. If the July ruling had stood, experts said, it was possible that swipe fees could have been reduced further.",

According to Pew Research Center, 60% of two-parent households with children under 18 feature both parents in the workforce. For these families, the traditional 10-week summer break is no relaxing vacation. As Ellen Galinsky notes, \"Summer is particularly demanding because we often have unrealistic expectations of summer as it's supposed to be: indulging in ice cream, watching sunsets, and spending quality time at home. But it's not always that way.\" Not everyone has access to nearby family members who can provide childcare or the budget for a full-time nanny. Consequently, many families rely on summer day camps.

In a blog post, Duncan wrote that testing issues are draining the life out of many schools, emphasizing the need for teachers to adapt to new standards and tests that focus on more than just multiple-choice answers. Over the past four years, nearly 40 states have passed laws linking teacher evaluations to student performance on standardized tests, with many districts planning to use these evaluations to determine tenure, promotions, and firings. These laws were a condition of Education Department waivers from the No Child Left Behind law, governing how states receive federal education funding.

The accord, aimed at eliminating most tariffs over the next few years, was signed in Beijing during a state visit by Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir. The two economies, with Iceland's GDP of $14 billion and China's GDP of $7.3 trillion, are vastly mismatched, with trade between the countries being relatively small, totaling $402 million in 2011. While Iceland cannot offer significant new market growth, it could help China gain more influence in the Arctic region, which is becoming increasingly accessible due to global warming and polar ice retreat. China is seeking to join the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body promoting cooperation in the region, as a permanent observer. Iceland, a member of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area, will not grant China backdoor access to the European market through this trade deal. The country had been negotiating EU membership but suspended talks in January due to domestic opposition. If Iceland were to join the EU, it would have to terminate its bilateral trade deals, according to the EU trade commissioner's spokesman. The two governments also issued a joint statement calling for cooperation on human rights, gender equality, labor issues, Arctic affairs, geothermal development, culture, education, and tourism. With the Doha Round of talks under the World Trade Organization stalled, some nations are seeking partnerships at a lower level. Currently, two significant trade agreements are being discussed, both centered around the United States. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated between Washington and several Asia-Pacific nations, while a comprehensive trade and investment agreement is being considered with the European Union.

Home loan rates are unlikely to revert to traditional levels but will likely remain modest, having prompted millions of homeowners to refinance and contributed to the housing market's resurgence. As 10-year government bond yields rise in response to economic improvement signs and the Federal Reserve's plan to reduce bond purchases, mortgage rates have swiftly followed suit. On Thursday, 30-year fixed mortgage rates reached 4.25 percent, up from 4.12 percent the day before, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hinted at easing stimulus efforts later this year. Just a few months ago, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.5 percent, near a historic low.

The fortunes of new tech graduates and retiring lawyers fluctuate, but those with considerable capital, essentially the already wealthy, have fared well during the economic recovery. The 1% tends to be resilient, particularly during bad times, according to economists. A study by Treasury economists found that a quarter to a third of individuals in the 1% in a given year remained in that bracket for the following five years. As a result, the profile of wealth in the United States has remained relatively unchanged before and after the recession. The typical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white, and male, said Mr. Friedman. Warren E. Buffett exemplifies this profile, with his net worth increasing by approximately $10 billion over the past year due to his cash reserves and appetite for acquisitions. The tech industry has created hundreds of new top earners, mostly men, although often younger. David Duffield of Workday and Elon Musk of Tesla, among others, have benefited from the tech boom. Meanwhile, fields like finance, medicine, and energy continue to generate significant wealth, with financiers and business owners dominating the ultra-high-net-worth category. Three interconnected economic phenomena - stocks, houses, and loans - have driven the boomerang effect among the country's top earners, economists said. The rich suffered significant losses when the markets plummeted in 2008 and 2009, but those who held on or invested after then have been rewarded. The recent market gains have boosted the earnings and net worth of Americans who own stocks, primarily through vehicles such as mutual funds. However, the wealthy have benefited significantly more. The top 10% of households hold more than 80% of the value of stocks, either directly or through investments like mutual funds, according to Edward Wolff, a New York University economist. In addition to capital gains from selling their shares, shareholders have also benefited from the surge in dividend payments. Many companies paid out large dividends, totaling around $260 billion, before taxes on unearned income increased in January. Wealthier Americans tend to have a smaller portion of their net worth tied up in their homes, so the nationwide decline in housing prices had a less significant impact on them.

Germany's economy grew by 3 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, according to the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden. Most of this growth occurred in the first half of 2011, with the office forecasting a 0.25 percent contraction in the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months. Some economists now predict Germany's economy will contract in the first quarter of 2012, meeting the typical definition of a recession. Despite this, Germany's 2011 growth rate of 3 percent outpaced Canada's growth rate of around 2 percent and the United States' growth rate of 1.7 percent, according to Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.",

Spain's National Statistics Institute reported a 0.3% economic contraction between January and March, mirroring the same decline seen in the preceding quarter. A recession is generally characterized by two consecutive quarters of economic decline. The Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 1.6% by the end of trading, while the FTSE 100 index in London dropped 0.7%. Despite a Reuters poll predicting a 0.4% quarterly contraction, Spain's economy actually shrank by 0.4% compared to the same period a year earlier.",

The weight of college expenses on families and former students is well-documented in an era of stagnant incomes and increasing tuition and student debt. Financial concerns are a significant source of anxiety for undergraduates, with nearly three-fifths frequently worrying about having sufficient funds for daily expenses. Students who work the most hours at part-time jobs tend to feel the most financial pressure, with about three-fifths of those working over 20 hours a week reporting that their jobs conflicted with schoolwork. \"For too many students, financial struggles are a major barrier to achieving their academic aspirations,\" said Alexander C. McCormick, director of the survey. The survey polled 285,000 students at 577 four-year colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.",

        "Text": "Recent surveys of consumer and business confidence have plummeted to recession-era lows, sparking widespread anxiety. In response, businesses have drastically cut back on capital expenditures, including computers, delivery trucks, and equipment, largely due to concerns over higher tax rates and government austerity measures. However, some economists believe that businesses will increase spending if Congress provides clarity on fiscal policy, significantly reducing the risk of severe contraction. Businesses must have a list of projects they'd like to pursue, but have been delaying due to uncertainty. Once they have a clearer understanding of the future, including tax rates, they'll be able to revive those plans and implement them. Enhanced access to credit can make capital expenditures more appealing and accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been increasing in recent months, and the share of small business owners struggling to meet their credit needs has been declining. Corporate profits reached a record high in the third quarter, adjusted for inflation, and companies have accumulated significant cash reserves that can be used to invest in equipment or hire staff if they feel confident about the recovery. In contrast, consumers are still not financially buoyant, particularly since their disposable income has been stagnant or declining in recent months. However, consumers have made significant progress in reducing their debt, either by paying it down or having it written off through default, and they are also feeling more affluent due to the stabilization of the housing market. The country has finally cleared the excess housing inventory from the bubble years, and housing prices and construction are now on the rise. The pace of household formation is increasing, as young adults are finally moving into their own homes, as well as other Americans who had previously lived with family or friends. Eventually, young people can only live with their parents for so long. There are strong forces driving them to leave, both from the parents' perspective and the young adults', and as soon as they have the opportunity, many will take it.",

However, this perspective was being contested in several state capitals as the conference commenced. Republicans in various states have proposed legislation limiting teachers' unions to only negotiating compensation, excluding them from policy discussions. In Tennessee and Wisconsin, Republicans have proposed stripping teachers' unions of collective bargaining rights entirely. According to education historians, this is the most hostile political climate teachers' unions have faced since gaining legal bargaining rights. The Department of Education's conference brought together 150 districts to discuss collaborative work. Each district's superintendent, school board president, and teachers' union leader signed a pledge to work together to improve student achievement.",

According to the Commerce Department's report, released on Thursday, exports of goods totalled $126.4 billion and services $49.1 billion, while imports reached $219.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $43.7 billion - the lowest since December. The revised March deficit was $46.8 billion, down from the initial estimate of $48.2 billion. Economists had predicted the deficit would swell to $48.8 billion. A weaker US dollar has made American goods more competitive globally, while growing demand in developing nations has driven up export prices. The Commerce Department attributed the April surge in exports to increased sales of industrial supplies, capital goods, and consumer goods. The decline in imports was partly due to a decrease in automotive parts, vehicles, and industrial supplies, the department said.",
