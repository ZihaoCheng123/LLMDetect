However, she is incorrect in her assertion that abolishing private education is a futile cause. The systemic and unfair entrenchment of privilege through private education is morally wrong and distorts our society, often to a grotesque extent. This argument must continue to be made, without resorting to name-calling, until there is a consensus among both the disadvantaged 93% and the privileged 7% that we need to adopt a new approach.  ",

Its outgoing chairman, Terry Burns, fought hard to stay on, but the government declined to extend his tenure. As a result, Charles Gurassa, the deputy chairman of easyJet and a seasoned executive, has been appointed to take his place. The C4 board may not have a leg to stand on, but what qualifications does Gurassa bring to the table? He boasts an impressive track record, having served as chairman, director, or non-executive director of 27 companies since 2003. Gurassa has a wealth of experience, but it's largely in the private sector. Prior to his current role, he was a director of leisure services at British Airways and has experience in the travel industry. However, he has no experience in television, apart from watching Richard Branson sell Virgin Mobile to NTL and overseeing the sale of LoveFilm to Amazon. In short, he's skilled at selling companies, not producing TV content. Ofcom and Downing Street have endorsed Gurassa's appointment, replacing a chairman who was a late convert to the Awkward Squad. It's possible that David Cameron will follow a similar precedent when selecting a new BBC chairman. Heaven help the ideals of independent public service. We can only hope that Mr. Gurassa will uphold these values, but it's hard to hold our breath.\"  ",

        "Text": "It's tempting to think that the worst is behind us, at least for now. The recent rally in global stock markets, sparked by the Bank of Japan's decision to cut interest rates, has brought relief to many in the financial community. Oil prices, which plummeted to $27 (£19) a barrel just a fortnight ago, have risen to $34, up 40 cents on the day. However, the reality is quite the opposite. Investors are concerned that governments and central banks have yet to grasp the true extent of the global economic weakness, seven years after the financial crisis. The situation is precarious, with China's private debt levels reaching dangerous heights, Europe's banking system still reeling from bad debts, and consumers worldwide exhibiting nervous behavior. When a central bank acknowledges the importance of cheap money in driving investment and growth, investors rejoice. But when central bankers suggest that the world is recovering and ready for higher interest rates, investors panic. It's no wonder, given the recent reaction to the US Federal Reserve's smallest possible interest rate hike, which sent American consumers scrambling to stash their savings. New car sales declined in December, and consumer sentiment dipped in January, following a weak fourth quarter. The Fed noted that even a small rate hike would likely be ignored by US consumers, who are as resilient as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator. The Bank of Japan's interest rate cut is another sign of global economic weakness. Tokyo aims to generate domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and has introduced a negative interest rate, effectively charging deposits, to deter foreign funds and encourage domestic spending. The move has had the desired effect, with the yen falling against the dollar. We'll need to wait and see how this affects domestic demand. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has already put aside its hopes of following the Fed's lead. Governor Mark Carney previously hinted that a UK interest rate hike might be imminent, but those comments are now a thing of the past. His recent speeches suggest a more cautious tone. Given the Federal Reserve's potential struggles to increase interest rates by half a percentage point this year, largely due to concerns about the dollar's strength, it's unlikely that the UK would consider such a move. A rate hike would cause the pound to surge, making exports uncompetitive in foreign markets and leaving domestic businesses vulnerable to cheap imports. Carney is well aware that the recent closure of the Scunthorpe steel plant, a casualty of cheap Chinese steel imports, is just the beginning of the potential consequences. ",

However, Card Factory has confirmed that it is not charging for bags without handles, citing a clarification from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Since the tax was introduced, retailers like Tesco have reported significant reductions in single-use bag usage, with Asda noting a decline of over 90% in Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.

The allergy is so severe that even being in the same room as someone eating chocolate poses a threat to the child's health. In a letter to parents, Alltwen primary school's headteacher, Owain Hyett, explained that the school will be completely chocolate-free, including the staff room and office, to ensure the pupil's safety. The school has also asked parents to remove all traces of chocolate from their children's bags and to avoid packing chocolate products in their lunches. The catering department is working to replace chocolate products on the school menu, and staff will be responsible for ensuring that all areas of the school remain chocolate-free. The decision has sparked controversy among some parents, who feel that they were not consulted and that the ban is too broad. One parent questioned the practicality of the ban, asking how staff would enforce it and whether they would have to inspect lunchboxes for chocolate. The ban is part of a growing trend of schools taking steps to accommodate children with severe allergies, including a recent ban on birthday cakes in a Lancashire school. Many primary schools and nurseries have already implemented bans on nuts, such as peanuts and almonds, due to the rising prevalence of nut intolerance among children. In England, national regulations have prompted many schools to prohibit crisps and chocolate from being brought into lunchboxes due to health concerns. Specifically, a primary school in Kent is one of the institutions that has taken this step, going so far as to ban fruit juice from being brought in due to its high sugar content. ",

C&C, which also produces Bulmers and Magners cider in Ireland, attributed the decision to tough competition in the UK and Ireland over recent years.

Directors were set to meet this week to approve a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, but a final decision has been pending since October. During a visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, China's state nuclear firm CGN agreed to take a 33.5% stake in the project. However, EDF executives have delayed a final decision due to funding issues, according to French financial journal Les Echos. The company is reportedly seeking help from the French government to find new backers to join the project alongside CGN. Although directors are scheduled to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, no decision is expected until the next meeting, which will take place before the release of final results on February 15. EDF has declined to comment on the matter. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, and the UK government has faced criticism for agreeing to pay EDF £92.50 per unit of electricity, more than double the market rate. A group of EDF employee-shareholders has also urged the company to abandon the Hinkley project, citing concerns that it could put the company's survival at risk. Green campaigners argue that any fresh delay highlights the flaws in a deal intended to kickstart a new generation of nuclear power in the UK. \"The EDF board is clearly rattled by this crucial investment decision,\" said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace. \"This delay could signal the end of Hinkley.\" Sauven added that EDF managers and employee representatives on the board are concerned that the project is too risky and too expensive. He also criticized former Chancellor George Osborne for defending the Hinkley project.  ",

The stock is currently down nearly 3% at £10.01. Berenberg has reduced its target price to £10.90 from £11.60, with a hold rating, while Panmure Gordon is maintaining its sell advice. According to Panmure analyst Michael Donnelly, the significant decline in the share price following Capita's preliminary results and the departure of its chairman, Martin Bolland, does not yet reflect the increased risk in the business. Donnelly believes that the company's free cash flow growth rate of 4% compound annual growth rate is not sufficient and advises investors to sell. He has reduced his target price to 900p (12.2 times PE) from 1000p due to higher net debt and lower free cash flow, and expresses concerns about goodwill, growth, cash, and the quality of earnings. Donnelly also expects further impairment charges, following Capita's announcement of £105m in impairment charges from two divisions. Berenberg, on the other hand, notes that Capita's 2015 results were largely in line with expectations, driven by 4% organic growth and a 20 basis point underlying margin expansion. However, the company faces significant challenges in 2016, with only one quarter of its growth visibility and declining returns and free cash flow generation.

        "Text": "Glencore, a multinational mining company, has launched a legal challenge against the Australian government to reduce port access fees. In a recent filing with the Australian Competition Tribunal, Glencore Coal argued that the increased fees to enter the newly privatized Newcastle port, which produces over 170 million tonnes of coal annually, will significantly impact the profit margins of coal producers. The company's appeal comes amid declining share prices and job cuts in its zinc production operations worldwide. The challenge follows the New South Wales government's decision to privatize the Newcastle port as part of a joint venture with Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants, which subsequently increased port fees by 40-60% for vessels accessing the shipping channel. The Australian Competition Tribunal will review a 2015 decision by the then-acting treasurer, Mathias Cormann, who declined to declare the port's fees as excessive. If Glencore's appeal is successful, it would allow the company to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration, potentially leading to lower port fees. The tribunal battle will focus on technical issues related to competition laws, but it also touches on two critical policy areas: the privatization of state assets and concerns about price increases, as well as the long-term viability of coal mining ventures in Australia. In its tribunal documents, Glencore argues that the port's unconstrained pricing and monopoly over access to the port create uncertainty for coal producers and acquirers in the Hunter Valley. The company claims that the port's monopoly power will significantly impact the profit margins of coal producers operating in the Hunter Valley, particularly in the current operating environment where many mines are cash flow negative. The Australian government has yet to respond to Glencore's application. The case will also test the limited types of review available to the Australian Competition Tribunal in \"access\" cases, as established by new legislation in 2012. Glencore's financial struggles began shortly after its initial public offering (IPO) in 2011, when the company listed on the stock market. Initially, the share price was strong, but it has since plummeted due to the sharp decline in commodity prices. ",

United Biscuits, the parent company of McVitie's, Carr's, and Jacob's, has informed its retail clients - including Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, and Asda - that ginger nut supplies will be available from mid-March. According to a company spokesperson, McVitie's ginger nuts will start appearing on shelves around March 11-12, although availability may vary depending on the retailer. Supermarkets have been out of stock of McVitie's ginger nuts and Carr's water biscuits since January, and were running low on custard creams and bourbons after the factory was inundated with 5ft of floodwater on December 5. The Carlisle-based factory, which is the second-largest biscuit factory in Europe, supplies the UK and other countries worldwide. The company resumed production of its McVitie's Gold bars in January, after a five-week cleaning and repair process. Currently, four of the factory's eight ovens are operational, with ginger nuts being the first main biscuit line to be produced. The factory is expected to produce 7 million ginger nuts daily to meet demand, with bourbons, custard creams, and boasters to follow a couple of weeks later. Carr's water biscuits, which require the factory's special brick ovens and local spring water, are expected to be the last biscuit line to return to production, likely by the end of March. United Biscuits' manufacturing director, Mark Taylor, expressed satisfaction with the progress made, stating that production had resumed more quickly than expected. \"We're delighted with progress,\" Taylor said. \"We started slowly to iron out any issues, and we're not yet at full speed.\" Around 400 staff, contractors, and suppliers are currently working at the factory, approximately half its usual workforce. In January, United Biscuits caused a commotion when it was compelled to acknowledge that it had been unable to locate alternative production facilities after the flood, resulting in a shortage of some popular biscuits. The company responded by placing a tongue-in-cheek advertisement in the newspaper, headlined \"Flooding in water biscuit factory. Oh the irony.\" The ad acknowledged the significant damage sustained by the factory and the devastating impact of the heavy rain on the local community. Notably, this was not the first time the Carlisle factory had been affected by flooding; it had previously been hit in 2005, but was able to reopen thanks to a £1m government grant. According to Taylor, United Biscuits is currently exploring options with other manufacturers, including those in Thailand and Cockermouth, Cumbria, to enhance the Carlisle factory's flood defenses.

The company, which includes Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, and British Airways, expects to boost operating profits by approximately €1 billion in 2016.

When asked about the potential impact of the British EU referendum on IAG, Walsh stated that the company had conducted a risk analysis and did not foresee any material risks to its business. He emphasized that IAG is a global business with global ambitions, and the referendum's outcome would not alter its perspective.\n\nWhile acknowledging that consumers have benefited from open aviation in the EU, Walsh expressed that IAG does not expect the referendum's outcome to affect fares. Unlike Ryanair, IAG will not take a stance on the vote, believing it is best left to the electorate. However, Walsh personally supports Europe but believes it needs reform. \"I am pro-Europe from a personal perspective,\" he said, \"and I see the benefits it has brought. However, I have significant experience dealing with the European Commission, and Europe needs to be reformed – the concept of being part of a trading area is positive, but it needs to change.\" \"Simultaneously, Walsh cautioned the new Canadian owners of London City airport against increasing landing fees following their £2 billion acquisition from GIP.

        "Text": "The London property market is notoriously challenging to break into, but a recent auction sale took the concept of \"digging deep\" to a whole new level. A vacant front basement in New Eltham, south London, was put up for sale, marketed as a redevelopment opportunity for investors willing to take a risk on securing the necessary planning consents. Due to the lack of access, potential buyers were informed that there would be no internal viewings, as the space required excavation before it could be inspected. The leasehold for the basement, located beneath flats in New Eltham, was listed with Auction House at a guide price of £25,000 and eventually sold for £27,000. The property was sold by the freeholder, who is not the first to realize the potential value of the land beneath their buildings. In fact, another unexcavated basement in Croydon sold ahead of the auction, with planning permission already submitted. According to Andrew Binstock, an auctioneer, these types of properties are becoming increasingly common in his auction rooms. \"It's like selling roof space above a property, except this is the gravel underneath,\" he said. The idea is that the buyer will apply for planning permission, knowing that the freeholder's consent is already given. Chris Coleman-Smith, an auctioneer at Savills, noted that some investors are willing to speculate on these kinds of properties, particularly in central London where development opportunities are scarce. \"If they come off, great,\" he said. \"It's probably a lot of aggravation to get to that point, but if you can pull it off, it's worth it.\" For context, two flats in a neighboring building in New Eltham sold for £180,000 and £215,000 in 2015, making this potential redevelopment a potentially lucrative opportunity if planning permits.

The 25p weekday newspaper is expected to have a large print run of up to 2 million, but Scotland will receive only a fraction of that, with estimates ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 copies. The initial print run will be free on Monday, with 2,000 copies available in Edinburgh from Tuesday, and the price will rise to 50p two weeks after launch. Industry insiders believe the strategy is designed to protect Trinity Mirror's Daily Record, which sells 171,000 copies a day, making it the second best-selling newspaper in Scotland after the Sun. The small number of New Day copies being sent to Scotland are being transported from Oldham to Edinburgh, and a media source has described the move as \"prioritising the Daily Record\". The newspaper's spokeswoman explained that the limited launch in Scotland is due to the need to build up the title's Scottish content, and that there will be a phased roll-out of the New Day's distribution in Scotland as the brand expands. Despite the low number of copies heading to Scotland, Northern Ireland is expected to receive around 25,000 copies of the New Day. \"Although this new publication is not a direct competitor to the i, it may be a strategic move by Johnston Press to establish a foothold in the market with readers and advertisers before launching its own cut-price i edition in Northern Ireland.\" ",

Labour's Gareth Thomas and Conservative MP Steve Baker argue that this would bring more direct ownership and accountability to the broadcaster, rather than the current system, which allows for excessive government interference. In a letter to the Times, Thomas and Baker wrote that the BBC is a \"public service\" broadcaster, but its ownership and accountability are unclear. They argued that the BBC Trust, which is responsible for governing the broadcaster, is accountable to no one, creating a vacuum that allows government interference to occur. A mutual organization is owned by its members, such as employees or customers, rather than outside investors. Thomas and Baker believe that the current proposals, which would give the government more control over the BBC, do not address the issues of ownership and accountability. Instead, they propose mutualizing the BBC, which would give licence fee payers a direct say in the organization's governance. \"Becoming members and owners of the BBC would enable TV licence holders to address the ownership deficit. As members, they would elect representatives to hold the executive management accountable for their actions. Key issues like executive compensation and resource allocation would be decided at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) that would be open to all members, either in person or online. This would fill the accountability gap and provide a strong defense against political interference. Mutualising the BBC would not only lend credibility to the licence fee, but also foster a sense of unity between the BBC and its audience, which is essential for the BBC's success.\" ",

The companies warn that the bill, as it stands, could set dangerous precedents that may be replicated elsewhere and have far-reaching consequences for all parties, both in the UK and internationally. In a joint submission to the public bill committee, the companies express concerns that the bill's attempts to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction could allow the UK to force companies to comply even if they are not based in the country. They argue that this approach is unnecessary, as international agreements could achieve the same goal. The companies also criticize the bill for its lack of clear guidelines on how to handle encrypted communications. Specifically, they argue that the bill should include an explicit threshold for when a service can be required to provide decrypted content, rather than leaving it to be determined on a case-by-case basis. For companies that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Apple's iMessage or Facebook's WhatsApp, this could require a complete overhaul of their services. Apple and its colleagues submitted a statement to the government, urging it to clarify that actions taken under authorization do not introduce new risks or vulnerabilities for users or businesses, and emphasizing that eliminating vulnerabilities is a shared goal with the UK government. Although all the firms had previously criticized the snoopers charter in December, with Apple submitting a separate brief from its competitors, there was little evidence that the government had addressed their concerns when the final version of the bill was introduced in early March. Eric King, director of the Don't Spy on Us coalition, described the changes as \"cosmetic tweaks\" and warned that the bill was being rushed through without sufficient time for proper scrutiny. The Web Foundation, founded by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, condemned the final bill as \"a slap in the face for British democracy\". ",

This development comes as Curt Schilling, a former ESPN commentator, accused the sports channel of racism, citing his own recent termination due to transphobic comments on Facebook. The prevalence of racism in the media is often linked to the lack of diversity within the industry. The notion that the workforce in US media does not represent the population is not a new one. In 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders found that the media reported and wrote from a predominantly white perspective, with fewer than 5% of editorial staff members being African American. This figure has barely changed over the years. According to statistics from the American Society of News Editors (ASNE), in 2015, only 4.7% of newsroom employees were African American, despite making up 13.2% of the US population. Similarly, Asian Americans were underrepresented, making up 5.4% of the adult population but only 2.8% of newsroom staff. Hispanic people comprised just 4% of employees in 2015, compared to 17.4% of the US population. According to an analysis by Alex T. Williams, published in the Columbia Journalism Review, the problem is not a lack of qualified minority candidates, but rather three obstacles that hinder their entry into the media industry: inexperience on campus newspapers, the prevalence of unpaid internships, and a lack of social capital to gain access to hiring networks. A new civil lawsuit against the New York Times this week draws on statistics related to representation. The lawsuit cites a 2014 study by the Women's Media Center, which found that New York Times reporters were 3.5 times more likely to cite men as sources than women. In 2015, the Women's Media Center released a report for the second consecutive year, revealing that the New York Times had the largest gender gap in bylines, with only 32% of articles written by women compared to 68% written by men. The report did not include the Guardian, but a recent analysis of comments found that articles written by men outnumbered those written by women, although this disparity varied significantly by subject. According to human resources data, six out of 10 staff members at Guardian US are women. The figures, which include both editorial and non-editorial staff, show that three quarters of employees are white, 11% are Asian, 6% are black, and 4% are Hispanic. ",

This unseasonable warmth is a clear sign of the dangerous effects of climate change. The country has been setting temperature records left and right, with February being the most unusually warm month on record and March breaking that record just a short time later. In fact, March 2016 was the warmest March on record in Australia. The Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook predicts that above-average temperatures will continue across the country at least through May.\n\nAccording to David Karoly, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, climate change has increased the likelihood of March breaking temperature records in Australia by at least seven times. \"The previous record had a one in 43-year chance of occurring naturally, but now it happens about once every six years due to human-caused climate change,\" Karoly said. \"This is evidence that climate change is already happening and increasing the risks of extreme heat.\"\n\nBlair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology notes that while April may not set a new record, it will still be much warmer than normal. Throughout May, there is an 80% chance that temperatures across most of the country will be warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. By June and July, coastal regions will continue to experience unusually warm weather, but temperatures will return to normal in central and southern Australia.\n\nThe current warm spell is partly due to the monster El Niño event that occurred in 2015, which spread warm water across the Pacific Ocean. However, this is happening on top of the background of global warming, Trewin said. In an El Niño year, the world tends to experience extreme temperatures, while in other years, temperatures are merely above average. \"La Niña events were typically followed by normal or slightly cool global temperatures.\" ",

The Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, led by former National Highway Traffic Administration administrator David Strickland, aims to bring autonomous vehicles to the road across the US. The coalition argues that self-driving cars will reduce the severity and frequency of crashes, as 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. However, experts warn that tech companies may become better protected under the law than car owners if a self-driving car crashes. This could pose a challenge for personal injury lawyers, who are already concerned about the technology. Accident lawyer Daniel Vega worries that the lobbying group may unfairly protect tech companies and app makers over human car owners, leaving drivers responsible for accidents. Statistician Susan Paddock notes that it's challenging to test self-driving cars to ensure their performance, and that consumers will need to become comfortable with uncertainty before the technology is widely adopted. \"Even if autonomous vehicle fleets were to travel 10 million miles, it would still be impossible to draw statistically significant conclusions about their safety and reliability.\" \"Uncertainty persists,\" she added, \"and I'm unsure how the general public will react to this technology.\" \n\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, Strickland emphasized that the coalition's goal is to establish a single, national policy for self-driving cars, rather than navigating a patchwork of state regulations. \"The widespread adoption of self-driving vehicle technology will undoubtedly lead to safer and less congested roadways in America,\" Strickland said. \"To facilitate the deployment of this innovation, we believe that a clear, federal framework is essential, and the Coalition will work with policymakers to identify effective solutions that meet this goal.\" ",

The call comes as the work and pensions select committee confirms it will investigate the BHS pension scheme's £571m deficit and its impact on the state-backed Pension Protection Scheme. Committee chairman Frank Field plans to summon Green to testify before MPs as part of the inquiry. The collapse of BHS into administration, which puts almost 11,000 jobs at risk, will see the PPF take on the company's pension scheme. The retail sector suffered another blow on Tuesday with the collapse of clothing retailer Austin Reed, threatening over 1,000 jobs. Green and Dominic Chappell, who purchased BHS from Green for £1 in 2015, are facing scrutiny over their management of the retailer. Calculations by The Guardian reveal that Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments, and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of BHS. Meanwhile, BHS paid out £25m to Retail Acquisitions, led by Chappell, in the 13 months following the sale, for management fees, salaries, professional fees, and interest on loans. Labour MP John Mann has called on Green to repay £400m in dividends paid out of BHS or relinquish his knighthood. Mann stated: \"Sir Philip Green and his family profited greatly from BHS and its hardworking staff. He inherited a company with a healthy pension fund, but upon selling BHS, a significant deficit had emerged. \"Given that Green's family has taken £400m from the company, he must be held accountable for the actions taken during his tenure. \"A simple and honourable solution to this crisis is for Green to repay the dividends, live up to the name of his new yacht, 'Lionheart', or surrender his knighthood.\" \"The committee must examine the Pension Protection Fund and how the transfer of BHS's pension liabilities will affect the levy increases imposed on other eligible employers to fund the scheme. We will then assess whether the current legislation is robust enough to safeguard the contracts of future pensioners in occupational pension schemes.\" ",

According to the British Bankers Association, total lending reached £17.1 billion, a 64% increase from the same period last year and the highest figure since April 2008. In a rush to beat the April deadline, buyers hastily closed property deals, while remortgaging by existing homeowners also surged, driven by the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. The average mortgage loan size reached a record high of £184,200, surpassing the previous peak of £158,000 in April 2008. However, the lending figures reveal an increasingly imbalanced financial landscape, with borrowing by manufacturers for investment plummeting while buy-to-let speculation has soared. Lending to manufacturing companies, which had been growing at an annual rate of 12% in 2014, has come to a standstill, while construction lending is also declining. Meanwhile, personal borrowing on credit cards continues to rise, with British households making 223 million purchases in March, valued at £12.6 billion. Although the volume of purchases increased by 2%, the value fell by 1% compared to the same period last year. Mortgage brokers are bracing for a decline in lending in April, citing the rush of transactions in March. Adrian Anderson of Anderson Harris noted that while March was a bumper month, he expects April and May's lending figures to be more subdued, as many transactions were brought forward. He also cautioned that the mortgage market is not racing ahead, and that the surge in lending may not be sustained in the short term, as many borrowers still face affordability challenges. While some predict a decline in the housing market, others believe that the EU referendum could benefit first-time buyers. According to Jeremy Leaf, a former RICS chairman and north London estate agent, the withdrawal of investors from the market has created opportunities for first-time buyers.

        "Text": "A thinktank has warned that cities in northern England must become more productive if Chancellor George Osborne's vision of a \"northern powerhouse\" is to be realized. The Centre for Cities believes that the government's plan to bridge the economic gap between the south and north is too focused on intercity transport links and not enough on improving individual city performance. The proposed HS3 rail link, which aims to speed up east-west connections between major northern cities, is a key part of the government's plan to address the UK's economic imbalances. However, the thinktank argues that cities in the Rhine-Ruhr region of Germany and the Randstad region of the Netherlands, which the government cites as models for the northern powerhouse, are economically vibrant because individual cities are already strong, not because of better rail links between them. According to the Centre for Cities, the five most productive cities in these regions - Amsterdam, Bonn, Leverkusen, Haarlemmermeer, and Düsseldorf - are, on average, 40% more productive than their UK counterparts, Leeds, Warrington, Burnley, Liverpool, and Manchester. The thinktank notes that intercity commuter rail links in Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad are actually comparable to those in northern England. Alexandra Jones, the Centre for Cities' chief executive, emphasized that a successful northern powerhouse requires stronger, more productive cities. She said that the government's initiative has the potential to significantly impact the north-south divide, but only if it maintains its focus on boosting productivity in major northern cities like Manchester, Leeds, and Newcastle. These cities have the most potential for growth in the region, but are currently underperforming, especially compared to cities in more successful areas like Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad. To increase the chances of success, the Centre for Cities suggests that policymakers address the skills gap in northern cities, where fewer people are educated to degree level than in other areas of the UK. A think tank reported that nearly half of Reading's residents hold a degree, compared to just a quarter of those in Liverpool. To boost productivity, it would be more effective to enhance transportation within northern cities, allowing people to access job opportunities across their broader city region. Local policymakers should be granted more autonomy to tackle the unique skills and transportation challenges they face, rather than spreading limited resources and attention evenly across the entire region. According to Jones, \"By focusing most resources on addressing the economic challenges faced by large northern cities and their surrounding regions, policymakers can maximize the benefits for the north as a whole.\" ",

Chappell claims that Green failed to honor his promise to secure credit insurance for the business and did not leave sufficient funds in the company. \"Sir Philip Green never kept his word,\" Chappell told the Guardian. \"We worked tirelessly, but it was Green's interference and broken promises that ultimately led to the demise of BHS.\" Chappell revealed that he was forced to pay out over £20 million in upfront guarantees to keep key suppliers on board, using a significant portion of the £60 million in cash left on the balance sheet by Green. He admitted that Green did not provide a written guarantee for credit insurance, but claimed it was verbally promised. Chappell stated that over £20 million was spent on VAT, wages, and rent, leaving the business with no choice but to borrow money from the Dellal family at high interest rates to stay afloat. The Dellals' Allied Commercial Exporters (Ace) provided Chappell with £35 million in cash to demonstrate to Green's Arcadia group that he was a credible buyer for BHS, and subsequently made millions from property deals and loan agreements with the retailer. Chappell, who is set to testify before a parliamentary inquiry into BHS's demise next week, distanced the Dellal family from the company's problems, instead blaming Green and the management team, led by Darren Topp, for the business's poor performance during the eight-week Christmas period. \"We were unlucky, and Green's actions knocked us off course,\" Chappell said. Despite its efforts, Green's Arcadia group, led by finance director Paul Budge, claims to have provided BHS with more than £90m in cash and debt facilities, as well as over £100m in loan guarantees and £100m in property assets. According to Budge, the company gave Retail Acquisitions \"more help or assistance or support than we could have possibly given to try to make this business work.\" He emphasized that the business's failure was not due to a lack of support from Green's Arcadia, citing \"multiple reasons\" that likely contributed to its downfall. In the month following the deal, BHS incurred expenses of less than £80m, but was expected to receive receipts of £55m, resulting in an outflow of approximately £25m. This outflow could have been financed using cash on hand and property receipts, Budge noted. ",

The fate of Walden's tenure is uncertain, but the company's annual report reveals that he will be able to cash in over 650,000 shares and options, regardless of whether he stays on or leaves. Under the terms of the proposed takeover, Walden would receive 0.321 Sainsbury's shares and 55p in cash for every Home Retail Group share, as well as a 25p windfall from the sale of Homebase and a 2.8p dividend, worth £1 million. Walden's total windfall could potentially exceed £6 million, considering his 785,000 shares and share options, worth £1.3 million, which are subject to performance criteria and vest over the next three years. He may also cash in up to 1.4 million more share options, worth up to £2.3 million, if he meets performance targets over the next two years. The remuneration committee has not yet decided what will happen to bonuses and share awards linked to performance targets beyond the date of the takeover. If Walden leaves the company, he would be entitled to a payout of at least £676,500, including his basic annual salary and benefits. In the year ending February 2016, Walden's total pay package was £1.5 million, down from £2.4 million the previous year, due to a decline in his annual bonus and long-term share bonuses. He also sold over 1.2 million shares, worth nearly £2 million, to pay his tax bill on exercised share options. After falling short of earnings per share and total shareholder return targets, Walden's bonus payments decreased. Sainsbury's is planning to finalize its acquisition of Home Retail Group this autumn, but the deal may be delayed due to the competition regulator's consideration of an investigation into the £1.4 billion takeover. The Competition and Markets Authority has set a deadline of June 13th for public comments on the potential impact of the deal on consumers, and will announce by July 25th whether to initiate a preliminary inquiry.

Royal Mail, which was linked to PostNL in December, is up 7p at 539.5p in a down market. Analysts at Credit Suisse note that talk of mergers and acquisitions in the European postal sector is increasing, but they are cautious due to declining traditional mail volumes and limited opportunities for cost savings. They suggest that Royal Mail is more likely to drive consolidation than Deutsche Post DHL, but they do not see an obvious acquisition target. They also believe that Deutsche Post DHL will prioritize organic growth over acquisitions. However, Royal Mail may be more willing to consolidate the UK parcel market, which has overcapacity of 20%, or boost its GLS prospects in the European B2C express market once it resolves a labor dispute. With a strong financial position, Royal Mail's net debt is only 0.2 times adjusted EBITDA. Nevertheless, the analysts have previously expressed doubts about PostNL's ability to add value to Royal Mail, and they do not see any obvious acquisition candidates among Royal Mail's key parcel competitors, including DPD, Hermes, Yodel, and TNT Express.

The program has been successful, with over half of participants from last year's scheme accepting a job with the company, and has been expanded to include 20 women this year.

Ball, who works under the pseudonym Docubyte, developed a fascination with retro computers and began the project to celebrate them. He notes that it's rare to find machines that you can touch and interact with today, as most computers are now touch screens. Ball believes that pre-Apple era computers are often overlooked as design pieces, and his nostalgia for their \"naive\" aesthetic led him to seek out and photograph a range of machines from the latter half of the 20th century. He found the machines at the Science Museum in London, the Dresden Technical Collections, and the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, and then painstakingly enhanced the images with his colleagues at INK studio to make them look new. \"The retouching is crucial to the piece,\" Ball says, using the example of the Pilot ACE, an early 1950s computer designed by Alan Turing. Since there are no color photographs of the Pilot ACE when it was new, Ball and his team were effectively creating a new history by presenting the past in a new context. The series features eye-catching machines like the Harwell Dekatron, the world's oldest functioning computer, and the Control Data 6600, often called the first \"supercomputer.\" Ball says that the machines \"look nice,\" but he would also like to create a comprehensive book about computing history.

The Commons work and pensions select committee, which is already examining the £571 million deficit at the BHS scheme, announced on Friday that it will launch a comprehensive inquiry into the issue, likely to begin in the autumn. The spotlight has recently fallen on workers' occupational pensions due to BHS's collapse and Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees who were under retirement age when the company went into administration in March may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result of the collapse. The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain's largest defined benefit plans with 130,000 members, is also facing cuts as the government works to put it on a stable footing to facilitate a sale. The latest figures show that the scheme has liabilities of almost £15 billion and a deficit of £700 million. The chair of the committee, Frank Field, stated that the British Steel pension scheme's troubles are further evidence of a broader threat to one of Britain's greatest savings successes in the last century - occupational pension schemes. The committee's in-depth case study on BHS is highlighting how such schemes are already struggling due to rising life expectancy and record-low returns on capital. \"Pension law and regulation must urgently adapt to the issues of the future, rather than the problems of the past,\" Field said. \"We should not be under any illusions that British Steel is a special case. The entire savings edifice is at risk.\" The Labour MP noted that 11 million workers have private defined benefit pensions, but more than 5,000 of the associated pension schemes are in deficit, with a total shortfall of £805 billion. \"This will be a major inquiry that will consider radical solutions to one of the great problems of our time,\" he added. \"Recently, the committee collaborated with the business, innovation, and skills committee to conduct a questioning session with the heads of the Pension Protection Fund and the Pensions Regulator regarding the BHS scandal.

While free users can still access the web version of Evernote, those who need to sync their data across more than two devices will be required to upgrade to a paid plan. Additionally, Evernote has increased the prices of its Plus and Premium tiers, which now cost $34.99 and $69.99 per year, respectively.

The Plus tier allows for 1GB of data to be synced with the web each month, while the Premium tier allows for 10GB and also includes additional features such as business-card scanning and PDF annotation. In a statement, Evernote's CEO Chris O'Neill explained that the price increases were necessary to allow the company to continue investing in the software and delivering new features to users. \"Our goal is to continue improving Evernote for the long term, investing in our core products to make them more powerful and intuitive,\" O'Neill said. \"However, this requires a significant investment of energy, time, and money, and we're asking our most loyal users to help us make that investment in return for the benefits that will result.\" As a concession to Basic users, Evernote is also adding a passcode lock feature to the free tier.

On Wednesday, a Facebook spokesman confirmed that the company is not currently using location data, and that its suggestions are based on a variety of factors, including mutual friends, work and education information, networks, and imported contacts.\n\nFacebook's help section also states that its suggestions are based on a range of factors, including mutual friends, work and education information, networks, and imported contacts. Despite the company's denials, some users remain concerned about the accuracy and privacy implications of the feature. Despite the unclear nature of these \"other factors,\" Facebook's sometimes unsettling friend suggestions - which could be more accurately described as \"people you know, but have no intention of befriending\" - have been a topic of discussion since the feature was introduced in 2008. Last year, Vice's Motherboard investigated why users' online dating matches were appearing as suggested friends, but the results were inconclusive. Facebook denied using data from third-party apps like Tinder or OKCupid. The most logical explanation is that the platform's suggestions are based on its robust \"link prediction\" and modeling of its vast social network. A recent analysis of Facebook's friend graph found that just 3.57 degrees of separation exist between its 16 billion members, with an even smaller gap within the US. As Caitlin Dewey, the Washington Post's digital culture critic, noted last year, \"Facebook's friend-recommendation system isn't magic or malice - just really good math.\" Users concerned about Facebook's use of their location settings can refuse access to this information in their phone's privacy settings. Additionally, they can check which contacts have been imported and request removal on their \"invite history\" page. ",

        "Text": "Shares in Carpetright have plummeted by almost 20% due to concerns that the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU will negatively impact consumer spending on the high street. The company's chief executive, Wilf Walsh, has expressed caution about the potential impact of the referendum outcome on consumer confidence, citing challenging trading conditions in recent weeks. Despite reporting a 33% increase in underlying profits to £17.3 million for the year ending April 30, the company's shares dropped to a low of 216.88p before recovering to 225p by lunchtime. In the past, home furnishings retailers have been affected by slowdowns in housing transactions, which can trigger purchases. Carpetright's new financial year has gotten off to a rocky start, with like-for-like sales in the UK declining 7.6% in May before rebounding to a 6.3% increase in June. According to Walsh, the current atmosphere is unusual, with consumers not behaving in a predictable pattern. He noted that it's too early to gauge the full impact of the referendum on the company. Walsh, who joined Carpetright in 2014 to lead a turnaround, has been working to revamp the retailer, introducing a new store design and customer service improvements. While the brand is well-known, research has shown that only 50% of surveyed customers would consider shopping at Carpetright. This year, the company will invest £10 million in refurbishing 100 stores, replacing its outdated branding and introducing a new staff uniform. The retailer has also expanded its product range to include hard flooring, which has proven popular with customers. \"Carpetright still has a long way to go in its transformation, but we're clear on our direction and confident that our plans to reposition the business will lead to positive outcomes,\" said Walsh. Shore Capital analyst George Mensah noted that the UK's decision to leave the EU will likely increase Carpetright's sourcing costs, as 75% of its materials come from mainland Europe. \"The impact of the referendum will mainly be felt through the effects on imports and changes in consumer confidence and the housing market,\" he explained. \"While we're aware of the short-term challenges that may affect consumer sentiment, we remain optimistic about the company's prospects, as we believe the changes it has implemented are already yielding better returns for shareholders.\" ",

Asda's sales plummeted by 5.9%, its worst performance on record and the largest decline in the market. In contrast, Tesco, the best-performing major chain, saw sales drop by 1.3%, according to analysis from Kantar Worldpanel. This decline is more pronounced than the 5.1% and 1% falls reported last month. Discounters Aldi and Lidl, however, continue to thrive, with sales increasing by 11.5% and 13.8%, respectively, and their combined market share reaching a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is now just a hair's breadth away from surpassing the Co-op to become the UK's fifth-largest supermarket. The latest figures do not include the period following the referendum, but Kantar's head of retail and consumer insight, Fraser McKevitt, believes that the decision to leave the EU will likely bolster the discounters further. He notes that 40% of the food we consume is sourced from overseas, and any long-term change in exchange rates may lead to higher prices, causing consumers to seek out cheaper alternatives. McKevitt also believes that the immediate economic uncertainty is unlikely to cause a significant drop in grocery volumes, citing the resilience of basic food, drinks, and household sales during the 2008 financial crisis. A rise in prices may even be beneficial for the major supermarkets, which have seen a 1.4% drop in grocery prices over the three-month period. The decline in sales at Tesco and Morrisons was also attributed to store closures, as the companies adjust to changing shopper habits. Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, Mike Watkins, is more optimistic about a supermarket recovery later this year, citing the end of deflation and the impact of store closures soon to be behind us. According to Nielsen analysts, supermarket sales experienced a surge in the four weeks leading up to June 18, largely driven by a boost in sales of snacks, beverages, and gourmet items during the initial stages of the Euro 2016 football tournament. Beer, wine, and spirits sales jumped 6.2% year-over-year during this period, while crisp and snack sales rose 4.2%, marking the industry's first monthly sales increase in nearly a year. However, with England's early exit from the tournament following their loss to Iceland on Monday night, the brief Euro 2016 sales boost is likely to come to an end. ",

        "Text": "According to a recent industry survey, British retail sales slowed down in the months leading up to the EU referendum. The Confederation of British Industry's latest report shows that the balance of retailers reporting sales increases minus those reporting decreases fell to 4% in June, down from 7% in May. The survey, conducted between May 26 and June 14, took place before the UK's surprise decision to leave the EU. While some retailers, such as grocers, furniture and carpet shops, and hardware and DIY stores, reported an uptick in sales, others, including clothing retailers and department stores, experienced slower growth or even declines. Retailers anticipate a sales improvement in July, with the balance expected to shift to -10% from -5% in June, and orders expected to continue falling. The CBI noted that retail sales reported weak growth in the year to June, exceeding expectations of a modest decline and lifting sales slightly above average for the time of year. Orders placed with suppliers decreased in June, although at a slower pace than the previous month. Internet sales growth slowed in the year to June, falling below the long-run average, but is expected to rebound strongly in July. According to Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, the survey suggests that consumers were cautious in their spending in the run-up to the EU referendum, but did not completely abstain from spending. Archer noted that there was little evidence of a significant boost from the European football championships, which began on June 10, during the survey period. A major question now is how well or poorly retail sales will perform in July following the UK's vote to leave the EU. \"After the Brexit vote, it's likely that consumer spending will be heavily impacted for a while due to increased uncertainty, potentially higher unemployment, and reduced purchasing power. It's probable that purchasing power will be squeezed as inflation rises significantly, driven by a sharp decline in the value of the pound. A separate report from Lloyds Bank found that consumer spending on essential items decreased again in May, although at a slower pace than in previous months. In fact, spending on essentials has been declining for 18 consecutive months, with a 0.4% year-over-year drop in May. Food and drink, which accounts for 40% of essential spending, actually saw a 0.1% increase in May, following a 0.7% drop in April. However, spending on fuel continued to decline, falling by 4.4% in May.\" ",

Despite the impending closure, the Independent and Independent on Sunday managed to reduce their pre-tax losses from £8.5m to £6.9m in the year ending September 27, 2015, according to the latest available accounts. On a \"trading\" level, excluding certain expenses, the newspapers lost just £3.74m last year, bringing them close to breaking even. However, the print titles were still shut down in March, as the company sold off the i and shifted its focus to digital-only publishing. Despite the impending closure, the directors of Lebedev Holdings, which controls the Independent, London Evening Standard, and London Live, enjoyed a lucrative year. The five directors, including Alexander Lebedev and Steve Auckland, saw their take-home pay triple from £589,000 to £1.48m. The highest-paid director, who remained anonymous, received £953,000, up from £529,000 in 2014. At the Independent, the highest-paid director's pay doubled from £200,000 to £416,000. The seven directors of the subsidiary company that runs the Independent saw their pay more than double from £387,000 to £831,000. The increase in director pay was largely due to the addition of new directors between 2014 and 2015. The financial filings for Evgeny Lebedev's media assets show that the Evening Standard enjoyed a significant profitability boost in 2015, with pre-tax profits rising from £1.09m to £3.38m. On a \"trading\" level, profits rose from £1.35m to £4.5m. Given the challenging ad market in the UK, which has seen many national newspaper publishers report significant print ad declines, the Evening Standard's revenue rose from £62.9m to £71m. Independent Digital News and Media, the separate company spun off from the Independent print titles, made a net profit before tax of £1.27m. ESTV, the parent company of London Live, reported a substantial decrease in losses, from £11.5m to £6.34m, over the course of the year ending September 30, 2015. Since acquiring a majority stake in the Evening Standard in 2009 and the Independent titles in 2010, Evgeny Lebedev and his father, Alexander, have invested over £135m in their UK media assets. According to the company's filings, the amount owed to Alexander Lebedev, Evgeny Lebedev, and their affiliated companies as of September 27, 2015, was £126.46m, plus £9.35m in interest. This represents a significant increase from the £111m total commitment reported in the previous year's filings. Additionally, Daily Mail & General Holdings, the owner of the Daily Mail and a 24.9% stakeholder in the Evening Standard, provided an interest-free loan of £12.48m. ",

The broadcaster's share price plummeted by over 20% on Friday and continued to fall by more than 5% in early trading on Monday. By midday on Monday, ITV's share price had dropped to 164p, a significant decline from its pre-Brexit price of 220p and its one-year high of 280p. Investors' concerns about the impact of Brexit on ITV's advertising revenue have driven the company's market capitalization from £9 billion to around £6.5 billion in the days following the EU referendum. City analysts are now speculating that ITV could become a takeover target due to its declining share price and the UK's currency crash, which has seen the pound fall 10% against the US dollar. According to Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum, the increased likelihood of a takeover bid comes from the historical and present interest of major US media companies in the UK market. Whittaker believes that not only established media giants but also new media and tech companies may be interested in making a bid for ITV. NBC Universal, which owns the production company behind Downton Abbey, has been rumored to have had an interest in bidding for ITV in the past. John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, has a 9.9% stake in ITV, and Malone is also a major shareholder in Discovery, which has acquired European assets including Eurosport and the TV rights to the Olympics. Whittaker has recommended that investors \"buy\" ITV's stock, citing the company's undervalued price following Friday's share price fall. \"Despite the post-Brexit vote, the fundamentals of ITV's business remain unchanged. Even if we assume a significant decline in advertising revenue similar to the post-Lehman crisis, ITV would still appear undervalued with a attractive dividend yield. In fact, even in a worst-case scenario, ITV's stock price would still be considered cheap. Liberum's analysis compared the 8.3% decline in TV advertising in 2009, triggered by the global recession following Lehman Brothers' collapse, to the 8.7% fall in 2010. Meanwhile, media stocks continued to decline, with Sky falling by almost 3%, Trinity Mirror (owner of the Daily Mirror) dropping 10%, the Daily Mail declining by almost 4%, and WPP decreasing by 2.3%.\" ",

Among the 100 exhibitors, showcasing custom steel and titanium bikes, one builder stood out for his choice of material: carbon fibre. While most road bikes are now made of carbon fibre, custom frames built from the lightweight material are rare due to the technical challenges involved. However, Richard Craddock, based in Worcestershire, is overcoming these barriers. Craddock spent years designing cycles for various brands and racing for an amateur team in France before deciding to build a carbon bike tailored to his own needs. After almost four years of development and testing, he launched his Filament bespoke carbon frames to the public. Since then, he hasn't stopped building. So, what sets his carbon bikes apart? \"The primary unique selling point is custom geometry,\" says Craddock. \"Two riders of the same height could have different body types, and I can build a frame that accommodates their weight and dimensions exactly, without compromise.\" He achieves this through a combination of custom geometry, tube diameters, fibre and resin types, and the number and sequence of plys used for joining the tubes. Perfecting the joining process was a major challenge, enabling him to create custom frames without the need for expensive moulds. Now, his biggest challenge is meeting the demands of his customers. One recent project was building a bespoke carbon tandem bike, which its owners used to set a mixed-team UK 10-mile time trial record. Beyond geometry, paint job, and components, Craddock can offer bespoke features that are rare on off-the-shelf cycles. For example, the bike pictured features Sram's new wireless eTap gear-changing system, which Craddock was able to design a frame around, with zero provision for cables, unlike some major manufacturers who simply plug redundant holes with rubber. \"Despite the meticulous attention to detail that goes into each bike, Craddock's creations often come with a lower price tag than high-end mass-produced models from leading manufacturers. According to Craddock, most of his customers are discerning cyclists who have had their share of great bikes but are still seeking that perfect ride. His custom frames begin at £2,680.\" ",

People are clearly unhappy with the current state of affairs and want to be heard and see change – that's a political issue.\" When asked if business leaders could have done more to sway voters in favor of the status quo, Rose pointed to the growing disconnect between the \"man on the street\" and big business. \"There has been a loss of trust, and we need to think about how to rebuild it,\" he said. \"This erosion of trust has been building over time, since the last recession, and is fueled by issues like the banking crisis and the eurozone crisis, as well as business practices that people don't like. These cumulative grievances have left a bad taste in people's mouths, and we need to address them.\" After playing a key role at the campaign's outset, Rose was sidelined in March following a controversy surrounding his comments to a parliamentary committee, in which he stated that wages would increase if Britain left the EU. Although he maintains he was misquoted, his remarks were seized upon by the Leave campaign. Rose continued to work behind the scenes until the end of the campaign. \"It reminded me that politicians operate in a political arena, while business leaders operate in a business environment, and sometimes they communicate in different ways,\" he said, reflecting on his experience. When asked if mistakes were made in the Remain campaign's approach, Rose acknowledged that their message wasn't as strong as others. \"It's time to take a step back, put our heads together, and reflect on what happened over the coming days, weeks, and months,\" he said. \"The outcome of the vote sends a clear signal that not everything is perfect from a UK perspective,\" Rose said. \"Now, it's crucial to ensure that the UK's departure from the EU is handled effectively to minimize the economic impact on Britain.\" Rose emphasized the importance of preparing for the future, saying, \"There will be a lot of work to do, navigating a lot of uncertainty.\" He has previously predicted that leaving the EU would lead to a recession. \"I believe there will be a negative consequence,\" he stated. \"In simple terms, if the pound falls and remains low, prices will increase, and if prices rise, the cost of living will also increase.

Monaco continues to add more millionaires per capita than any other city, with a 6% increase in density since the last ranking two years ago.

According to its parent company, Centrica, falling gas and power prices led to the emergence of new suppliers, intensifying the competition for customers. The decline in customer numbers was also attributed to a large number of long-term contracts expiring simultaneously, leaving British Gas with 14.26 million accounts. However, customer numbers began to rise again in June, the company reported. Claire Osborne, an energy analyst at uSwitch, noted that British Gas's market share is being eroded by smaller and larger suppliers alike. She suggested that the only way for British Gas to regain customers is by launching competitive deals. Notably, British Gas is the only major supplier to have lowered its standard gas prices three times since the start of last year, making its standard variable tariff the lowest among the big six. However, its best deal is still significantly more expensive than the cheapest option on the market, making it likely that customers will find better savings by switching to other providers. Centrica reported a 6% decline in operating profit at its UK home business, which fell to £635 million, partly due to a one-off pension credit in the previous year. The decline also reflected lower energy consumption among customers. The company's total revenue fell 13% to £13.4 billion. Centrica has implemented £141 million in cost cuts in the first half and plans to achieve £750 million in savings by 2020. The company is currently reducing its workforce by 6,000 jobs, with plans to cut 3,000 staff by the end of the year.

The company plans to achieve this by opening 25 new restaurants, extending the operating hours of existing sites, and introducing new services such as table service. Business Secretary Greg Clark welcomed the announcement, stating that it is \"great news for the UK economy\" and that the government is committed to supporting businesses to thrive.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU, McDonald's is pushing forward with its expansion plans. The company's CEO, Paul Pomroy, emphasized that all new jobs will be permanent, with a mix of full-time and part-time positions. McDonald's has faced criticism for its use of zero-hours contracts, which affect an estimated 80,000 workers. However, the company is now offering staff the option to switch to fixed-hours contracts and has expanded a trial to nine restaurants, which has seen one in five workers opt for the change.\n\nThe company's decision to revamp its employment policy was driven by feedback from workers, who reported difficulties in securing loans, mortgages, and mobile phone contracts due to the uncertainty of their employment status. Pomroy stated that the company considered delaying its expansion plans after the EU referendum, but has instead chosen to accelerate its growth. He emphasized the importance of big businesses like McDonald's demonstrating confidence in the UK economy and offering reassurance to the public.\n\nPomroy drew parallels with the last recession, saying that he has learned a great deal from it and is now focused on positioning McDonald's as an \"employer of choice\" in the UK.

        "Text": "The New European, a pro-EU newspaper, will continue to publish beyond its initial four-week trial period after exceeding its sales targets, its publisher Archant has announced. Launched on June 24, the newspaper, aimed at the 48% of the UK that voted to remain in the EU, has sold more than 40,000 copies of its first edition, with subsequent issues also performing well. Archant has decided to continue producing the newspaper on a rolling basis, but made it clear that it will cease publication if interest wanes. In contrast, The New Day newspaper, which launched in February, saw its daily sales drop to an estimated 30,000 before it was shut down in May, despite its publisher Trinity Mirror targeting a circulation of 200,000 copies. The New European has attracted high-profile contributors, including novelist Howard Jacobson, journalist Jonathan Freedland, venture capitalist Saul Klein, and former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who has called for a second referendum. \"We're thrilled by the reaction and support we've received for this unusual newspaper launch,\" said Archant's chief content officer, Matt Kelly. \"We'll continue to publish as long as the zeitgeist demands it.\" Archant, primarily a regional publisher, has shown a willingness to experiment with focused projects, such as the \"pop-up\" New European, which went from concept to launch in just nine days. According to Archant's chief marketing officer, Will Hattam, the company's scale and agility allow it to produce a high-quality print product for a national audience while also being able to quickly adapt and profitably serve a newly formed community.

Italy's economy has been struggling for over two decades, with little to no growth and declining competitiveness in export markets. This sluggish growth has led to high levels of unemployment, resulting in a significant amount of non-performing loans that are now crippling Italian banks. The potential bad debts have nearly doubled to €360 billion over the past five years, accounting for 18% of all outstanding loans. While the non-performing loans are a symptom of the problem, they do not cause it. Unlike Greece, Ireland, and Spain, Italy did not experience an economic boom before the 2008-09 financial crisis, and its performance has been consistently poor. As a result, the economy is 10% smaller than it was before the crisis, and unemployment is high, particularly in southern Italy. Before joining the euro, Italy could have made itself more competitive by devaluing the lira, but that option is no longer available. This creates a significant risk: a European slowdown following Brexit, combined with Italy's already weak economy, could lead to bank failures and small investors being forced to absorb losses. If the Five Star Movement, which has pledged to hold a referendum on leaving the euro, were to come to power, the possibility of Quitaly could not be ruled out. In the event of a Quitaly, the single currency would likely collapse.  ",

The app update, part of Google's efforts to separate core phone features from operating system updates, is now available for Nexus and Android One devices, including the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. Building on its existing caller ID system, which has been available for several years, the new app extension helps identify suspicious business numbers not stored in your contacts. When an incoming call is flagged as potentially spammy, the app displays a prominent red banner and offers users the option to permanently block the number or whitelist false positives. While other third-party apps, such as Truecaller, have offered similar functionality for years, Google's integration of this feature into its default Android app marks a significant milestone. Apple iPhone users, however, have been limited by the platform's restrictive nature, but the upcoming iOS 10 update, set to release in September for iPhone 5 and newer devices, will introduce a caller ID extension system for spam alerts, potentially enabling similar functionality on iOS devices.

Specifically, 12% of agents have reported a decline in asking rents over the past 10 days. While Arla's report suggests that the rental market has so far responded to Brexit in a calm manner, the organization warns that continued uncertainty could lead to turbulence in the coming months. David Cox, managing director of Arla, emphasized the need for the new government to prioritize housing and the rental market, citing concerns that a lack of certainty could lead to institutional investors pulling out of the market, ultimately impacting tenants by reducing supply and increasing rents.\n\nThe report also found that almost 36% of Arla members have reported a reduction or no change in the number of prospective tenants looking for properties. Notably, overall supply and demand for rental accommodation increased in June, with prospective tenants seeing a 12% average increase and properties on agents' books rising by an average of 3%. According to Cox, the key takeaway from the Brexit vote is that supply and demand remain a significant issue in the rental market. If supply continues to dwindle against growing demand, renting will become more difficult and expensive for tenants, regardless of the eventual implications of Brexit. \"A recent report by the Taxpayer's Alliance, released on Monday, recommends slashing stamp duty on homes by half and eventually eliminating it altogether. The report argues that the current tax is exacerbating supply shortages and driving up rents for tenants. Specifically, it suggests abolishing the 3% surcharge on buy-to-let and additional homes, warning that investors will likely pass on the costs to tenants, further increasing rents.\" ",

        "Text": "According to a report released on Monday, the number of applications to build new shops has dropped by 9% over the past year, marking the seventh consecutive decline. In 2015, there were 6,700 applications for new retail developments, a decrease from 7,360 in the previous year. This represents a nearly 50% decline from the pre-recession peak of 11,900 applications in 2008. The report highlights the ongoing challenges faced by shopkeepers as consumers increasingly turn to online shopping, with many traditional retailers struggling to compete with online-only retailers like Asos and Boohoo. Despite efforts by traditional retailers to expand their online presence, many are failing to keep pace with online-only brands, which have contributed to the recent failures of retailers such as BHS, Austin Reed, and My Local. The report suggests that the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote could exacerbate these challenges, with potential negative impacts on the UK economy. According to Aimee Barrable of EMW, the continued success of online retailers has led to a decrease in the appetite for new shop openings, with many retailers instead opting to develop their online services or repurpose existing space. The recent high-profile closures could lead to an increase in available retail space, potentially attracting retailers looking to expand their high street presence. Additionally, some retailers may delay committing to new shop developments until the economic impact of the Brexit vote becomes clearer. Last week, official statistics showed a 0.9% decline in retail sales between May and June, exceeding the 0.6% decline expected by economists. While the decline was partly attributed to inclement weather, the figures also hinted at the impact of the Brexit vote on consumer spending.  ",

The FRC also issued the accountancy firm a severe reprimand. The fine was reduced from £3.5 million after mitigation and a settlement discount. PwC must also pay £750,000 towards the FRC's costs. The FRC stated that the original fine of £3.5 million would have been the largest ever. This penalty comes after PwC was sued by Cattles, which alleged that the accountants acted negligently in their auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis. Cattles claimed that the loan book of Welcome was weaker than stated in PwC's audit. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of creditors to Cattles, which lent to people with poor credit histories and entered into a financial restructuring scheme in 2011. PwC and its audit engagement partner, Simon Bradburn, have admitted that their conduct fell short of expected standards in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC stated that PwC had insufficient audit evidence regarding the loan loss provision and failed to identify inadequate disclosure of the impairment policy in the financial statements. The watchdog said that the disclosures were not in compliance with accountancy rules. Gareth Rees QC, executive counsel to the FRC, stated that the substantial fines imposed in this case reflect the seriousness of the audit failings and will send a strong signal to the audit community about the importance of upholding high standards of professional conduct in audit work. \"He commended PwC's and Bradburn's constructive approach, which facilitated the settlement. The admissions of misconduct have led to a substantial reduction in time and costs, and the fines imposed have been lowered as a result. PwC stated: \"Although the FRC acknowledged that we were deliberately misled by third parties, we acknowledge that certain aspects of our 2007 audit did not meet expected standards. Audit quality is a top priority for PwC, and the FRC's annual audit quality assessments have shown a trend of improvement in our work over several years.\" ",

Analysts at RBC have been analyzing satellite communication specialist Inmarsat and believe it could be a prime target for a bid. In a recent note, RBC analyst Wilton Fry wrote: \"Given Inmarsat's lower stock price, particularly in US dollar terms, the rapid evolution of the industry's competitive landscape, and historical precedents, we think it's reasonable to consider potential M&A activity.\" Fry went on to assess whether Echostar or Dish Network might be interested in acquiring Inmarsat. Echostar and Dish Network have recently secured funding and Echostar now has around $3 billion in cash reserves, which is likely to be used to fund new satellite projects. However, Fry believes there's a possibility that Echostar or Dish may consider acquiring Inmarsat due to the strategic and operational benefits of a combination. A potential bid for Inmarsat could help resolve several interlocking issues: Dish has a significant amount of US spectrum but needs terrestrial deployment, while Echostar and Inmarsat both own European S-band spectrum that could be used for mobile services. Mobile operators need spectrum to accommodate growing data demands, and Deutsche Telekom is involved in Inmarsat's S-band project and owns T-Mobile USA. Inmarsat is a global company that needs more Ka-band capacity, while Echostar has Ka-band capabilities but wants to expand globally. Combining Echostar's regional expertise with Inmarsat's global reach could fulfill Echostar's global ambitions, help Inmarsat add capacity in dense areas, protect Echostar's Hughes business, enhance in-flight opportunities, and counter ViaSat's aspirations while yielding significant operational savings from combined satellite control functions. \"In contrast to Inmarsat, Echostar has a significant cash reserve of $3 billion and lower debt levels, despite being smaller in size ($3.6 billion versus $5.0 billion) and having a lower rating (5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA versus 10 times). To illustrate, a 37% premium (12.5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA) with a 30% cash/70% equity structure would result in NewCo's debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.2 times, which is comparable to Inmarsat's current leverage. RBC has set a target price of £11.50 per share for Inmarsat, while its shares are currently trading at 805.5p, down 1p.\" ",

This modern spin on an ancient riddle is sure to delight partygoers and puzzle lovers alike. Three friends set out to a carnival with a 1.2-liter jerry can filled with rum punch. Upon arrival, they decide to split the drinks among three separate sound systems. To do so, they must divide the punch equally among themselves. Fortunately, they brought two large bottles to help with the task. However, they soon discover that these bottles lack measurements. One of the friends finds an empty 50cl Red Stripe can and a 15cl vial marked 'rave juice' on the ground. There's a nearby water tap to clean the can and vial. Using only these vessels and the knowledge that the jerry can initially held 1.2 liters of punch, how do the friends manage to divide the punch into three equal portions?

However, proponents of this idea should consider real-life examples. Is a child who excels in math but struggles with written communication a \"clever\" child or not? What about one who is skilled in reading and writing but has a talent for art and craftsmanship? Or a refugee who performs poorly on the 11-plus due to limited English proficiency? Is a child who barely passes the test because they missed weeks of school due to homelessness truly \"clever\"? Or one who barely scrapes by with private tutoring? The idea of categorizing children into \"clever\" and \"not clever\" is nonsensical, as is the notion that two types of schools are needed to provide different forms of education.\n\nI was thrilled to read Michael Liversidge's letter (24 August) about his academic achievements despite his poor O-level performance. I was a student at the same school, which had direct grant status at the time, and my father, Don, was one of Michael's history tutors. Shortly before our O-level exams, I recall overhearing Don refer to several of my classmates as \"nice guys, but not very bright.\" One of them, Chris Penny, went on to work at GCHQ, where he claimed to be a cleaner, although his funeral attendance last year suggested a more significant role. Another, Matthew Harding, left to become a tea-boy in a finance house, but he eventually owned the business and Chelsea football club. Good grades on academic exams are a clear indicator of academic aptitude, nothing more.\n\nThe selective school system not only resulted in the majority of students being rejected at age 11, but it also segregated children within families. In 1958, I took the 11-plus exam and was accepted into a grammar school, while my twin brother didn't pass and attended a secondary modern. Although I didn't excel enough to continue in the sixth form, I transferred to a further education college instead. There, I met someone who shared with me that he had also failed the 11-plus. His parents were so concerned about the social stigma associated with the local secondary modern that they sent him to a school in a neighboring town, whose uniform was unfamiliar to their neighbors.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the first batch of economic data since the June 23 vote shows that the service sector, which accounts for approximately 80% of the UK economy, expanded by 0.4% in July. This is a remarkable performance, given the turmoil in financial markets and the crash in business and consumer confidence that occurred during the same period. As a result, analysts are revising their growth forecasts for the third quarter, with estimates ranging from 0.4% to 0.5%. The upward revision to growth in the second quarter, from 0.6% to 0.7%, has also bolstered hopes of avoiding a recession. Prior to the Brexit vote, the economy had significant momentum, and while it is likely to slow in the second half of 2016, it will not experience two consecutive quarters of declining output, which is the technical definition of a recession.\n\nHowever, the government received less welcome news, as the UK's balance of payments deficit widened in the second quarter, reaching an alarming 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016. The deterioration in the UK's trade performance was the primary driver of this increase, highlighting the imbalance in the economy. In essence, domestic producers are struggling to keep up with consumer demand. The post-Brexit decline in the value of sterling will make exports more competitive, but it will also curb consumer spending by making imports more expensive. Turning around the balance of payments will be a significant challenge, regardless of the outcome of the referendum.\n\nIn terms of policy, the Bank of England may reconsider cutting interest rates again in November, given the economy's resilience in the face of Brexit. The current interest rate of 0.25% is already at a record low, and the bank may be hesitant to reduce it further. The Bank of England, Threadneedle Street, may choose to conserve its resources for future use, allowing Chancellor Philip Hammond to take the lead. Despite the recent positive growth news, stimulus measures in the autumn statement still seem likely. This is because the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote is likely to have a more significant impact on long-term business decisions rather than consumer spending. Hammond would be wise to temporarily pause deficit reduction during the two-year Brexit negotiation period, using the extra £30 billion to fund public investment. This approach would have a double benefit: it would help maintain economic growth and ensure that growth is more balanced. ",

Gone are the cassette tapes and plastic eyes, replaced by a 4GB hard drive and animated LCD eyes. Wicked Cool Toys, the company behind the revamped Cabbage Patch Kid doll, is bringing back Teddy Ruxpin after an early prototype was showcased at the Dallas Toy Fair. The toy is scheduled to launch in 2017, but Wicked Cool Toys co-president Jeremy Padawer couldn't resist sharing the news with YouTube's Mommy and Gracie Show, saying, \"The bear had to come out of the bag. We've shown Teddy a little early.\"\n\nThe company is targeting the original fans of Teddy Ruxpin, now grown up and becoming parents, who are nostalgic for the toy that was first launched in 1985. The toy was an instant hit, selling $93 million worth of units (1.4 million) in its first year and eventually selling over 8 million units and 11 million books. Teddy Ruxpin was one of the best-selling toys of the 1980s, alongside Polly Pocket, Glo Worm, Pound Puppies, and Glo Worm.\n\nThe original Teddy Ruxpin came with a slot for cassette tapes, which the toy would \"read\" to children while moving its eyes and mouth. The toy's creator, Ken Forsse, also wrote an accompanying fantasy world, following Teddy and his best friend, a caterpillar named Grubby, as they battled monsters and villains in a quest to find magic crystals. These stories were featured in the toy's accompanying story tapes and a 65-episode TV cartoon series.\n\nTeddy Ruxpin was named one of the most memorable and creative toys of the 20th century by the Toy Industry Association in 2003 and one of the greatest toys of all time by Time magazine. Despite its popularity, Worlds of Wonder, the company that first made Teddy Ruxpin, struggled after the 1987 stock market crash and filed for bankruptcy. The license to manufacture the toy was later sold to Hasbro, which released a new version in the early 1990s. As the license was transferred to other companies, Teddy Ruxpin underwent several updates, with the most recent version being released in 2006, featuring digital audio cartridges instead of cassettes. According to Michael Rinzler, founding partner of Wicked Cool Toys, \"Teddy Ruxpin's innovative play-pattern and integration of technology were well ahead of their time in the 80s, and with growing parental interest, now is the perfect opportunity to revive this beloved brand.\" The latest version of the toy comes equipped with a 4GB hard drive, capable of storing 40 stories, and can be paired with an iPad app, allowing children to read along as the toy narrates the stories. The toy's plushy hand features a button for navigating between stories, while a button in its foot enables a sing-along mode. For those seeking a blast of 80s nostalgia, the original Teddy Ruxpin commercial is available to view. ",

Despite my perfect payment history, with no missed payments or credit refusals, I've been told that there's no point in appealing the decision. If I choose to redeem my mortgage and switch to another lender, I'll face an early repayment fee of £3,000. Is this a fair request?\n\nAfter taking up my case, Nationwide has reviewed its decision and agreed to allow me to port my mortgage. The lender claims that it's their duty to assess customers' financial situations and ability to repay loans for every mortgage application.

        "Text": "House of Fraser's profits plummeted nearly 50% in the first half of the year, citing a \"very challenging retail environment\" due to unseasonable weather and Brexit uncertainty. The department store's underlying profits fell 46% to £5m, from £9.2m the previous year, excluding interest payments, tax, and other one-off items. The decline in profits was attributed to the increased cost of online delivery and a decrease in sales of House of Fraser's own brands. Total sales remained steady at £573.5m, but the group's established department stores experienced a 2.5% slump. Meanwhile, underlying sales, which include a 17.8% rise in online sales, showed a 0.9% increase. House of Fraser's CEO, Nigel Oddy, described the trading environment as \"extremely volatile\" and attributed the profit slump to a combination of factors, including record temperatures in September and uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum. Oddy noted that shoppers are now more likely to buy products to wear immediately, rather than waiting for sales. He also cited consumer confidence concerns about the impact of Brexit on household finances as a contributing factor. To combat these challenges, House of Fraser is introducing new brands and concessions, including five Hamleys toy areas and All Saints, Monsoon, and Mulberry. \"Despite struggling, the department store's performance stood in stark contrast to the impressive results of online retailer Boohoo.com. The company reported a remarkable 40% surge in sales and a 129% increase in pre-tax profits for the six-month period ending August 31. Boohoo.com's success can be attributed to its ability to attract 28% more customers and increase the average transaction value as it expanded its presence in Europe and the US, while also broadening its product offerings in menswear, lingerie, and plus-size women's clothing.\" ",

According to a recent trading update, summer bookings excluding Turkey increased by 4%, but a 40% decline in trips to Turkey resulted in a total booking decrease. Bookings in continental Europe were heavily impacted, particularly among German tourists who shunned Turkey, while bookings in the UK rose by 1%. Thomas Cook has been severely affected by terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Egypt, and Turkey since summer 2015, with the company offering customers with bookings to Turkey free cancellation after the failed military coup in July. Bookings from Belgium also decreased following the terrorist attacks on Brussels in March. The company warned in July that it had slumped to a quarterly loss and would miss its annual profit target. Thomas Cook's CEO, Peter Fankhauser, has stated that the travel industry is experiencing the most turbulent period he has seen in his 30-year career, citing terrorist attacks and other incidents as major factors affecting consumer confidence. Despite the challenges, Thomas Cook's shares rose 4% to 73p, with the company maintaining its reduced guidance for an operating profit of £300m for the year ending September 30, down from £310m the previous year. Group bookings were in line with expectations, with customers shifting their focus from Turkey to destinations such as the Balearic and Canary islands, the US, Bulgaria, and Cuba. Fankhauser noted that the summer season has progressed largely as expected, with customer demand remaining strong except for Turkey, where demand remains volatile. He also mentioned that sales for the winter season are in line with last year's figures, while summer 2017 bookings suggest that customers are booking early to secure their preferred destinations and hotels. Demand for holidays among UK consumers appears to be unaffected by the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote on June 23, with UK summer bookings excluding Turkey rising 13% and making Britain Thomas Cook's strongest region. The winter season has also started well in the UK, with bookings up 8%.  ",

What is the next number in the sequence: 23, 9, 20, 14, 14, 9, 20, 6,...?\n\n2. The series appears to be a code, where each term is the first letter of a monarch's name. For example, Mary I corresponds to the first letter \"M\", George III corresponds to the third letter \"G\", and so on. Why might Henry I be a fitting conclusion to this series?\n\n3. What comes next in the sequence: 2.1, 3.5, 3.3, 2.3, 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 1.8,...?\n\n4. What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 2, 9, 12, 70, 89, 97, 102,...?\n\nThe solutions to these puzzles are:\n\n1. The answer is 19, as the numbers correspond to the alphabet positions of the first letters of the words in the question.\n\n2. The code is indeed a clever one, as it spells out the word \"monarch\" when each term is taken to represent the first letter of a monarch's name.\n\n3. The sequence appears to be related to the layout of a QWERTY keyboard, where each term corresponds to the row and column position of a letter in alphabetical order.\n\n4. The answer is 112, as each number in the sequence is one less than the corresponding number when viewed upside down.\n\nBill, the creator of these puzzles, shares an interesting anecdote about how he came up with the fourth puzzle. He was approached by a Cambridge mathematician who was about to compete in a puzzle-solving competition against Oxford. The mathematician asked Bill to come up with an original puzzle for the informal portion of the contest, and Bill's creation was the result. Although no one was able to solve it, everyone agrees that the puzzle is fair and logical. \"I'd like to express my gratitude to Bill once again for allowing me to use these puzzles.

Simpson, who has spent five decades at the BBC, including his current role as world affairs editor, told The Guardian that the BBC and the National Health Service (NHS) should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups that don't have an axe to grind. He believes that both sides of the House of Commons frequently attack the BBC because it refuses to conform to their party lines. Simpson's strongest criticism was reserved for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, whom he accused of being involved in the Hutton affair and of colluding with Rupert Murdoch. \"It's astonishing to see the British prime minister cozying up to someone who has no interest in Britain, is deeply opposed to Britain, and is hostile to the country's main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. He believes that most governments he has worked with over his 50-year career at the BBC have a \"disgraceful political obsession\" to cut down the BBC. \"I'm not saying that cuts can't be made, but it's the brutality and ideological fervor with which they're implemented that's disturbing,\" he said. Simpson also criticized the government's decision to keep the BBC underfunded since 2010, saying it's \"absolutely disgraceful.\" He also expressed his disapproval of the draft BBC charter, which requires the corporation to reveal the salaries of staff earning over £150,000, saying it's just a way for the government to demonstrate its control. Simpson made these comments just three days after being released from the hospital, where he had been treated for kidney failure caused by a reaction to eating kedgeree. \"It's acceptable for individuals like myself, who receive favorable treatment. However, as you progress down the hierarchy, it becomes significantly more challenging. People are anxious about their job security... there's a harsh environment, particularly towards junior staff members.\"\n\n\"After a brief holiday to recharge, I'll begin filming the Panorama special. I plan to travel to Iraq, Russia, China, and possibly the US, and I'm eager to visit a particularly troubled region like the Congo.\"\n\nInitially, there was a plan for a short series, but BBC commissioners rejected it. \"They told me that we don't want current affairs journalists covering current events,\" I was informed. \"I believe what they meant was that nowadays they prefer to feature celebrities like Joanna Lumley.\"\n\nMy latest book, We Chose to Speak of War and Strife, is a tribute to the foreign correspondents of yesteryear, who I believe are a dying breed.

According to May's spokeswoman, the Prime Minister has consistently expressed her admiration for Carney's work and would be supportive of him staying on beyond his initial term. The spokeswoman added that May has a good working relationship with Carney and intends to continue it.\n\nCarney has stated that he will make a decision about his future plans before the end of the year, but has also emphasized the need to resolve the matter before then. His next public appearance will be at a press conference on Thursday to discuss the Bank's quarterly inflation report, which will be released for the first time since the Bank cut interest rates to a record low in August.\n\nMay's recent comments at the Conservative party conference, in which she criticized the side-effects of ultra-low interest rates and money creation under the quantitative easing program, had sparked speculation about a rift between Downing Street and the Bank. However, No 10 quickly apologized to Carney, insisting that the remarks were not intended to convey a lack of confidence in his leadership. Despite this, senior Conservatives, including William Hague and Michael Gove, have since launched strong attacks on the Bank's monetary policy.\n\nCarney has been the Bank's Governor since July 2013, when he initially stated that he would only serve for five years. \"He has been deliberating on whether to stick to his original plan or stay at Threadneedle Street until 2021.

From now on, new MacBook Pros, both with and without the new emoji bar, will quietly boot up as soon as they're turned on. The chime, which was first introduced with the Macintosh Quadra line of computers in 1991, served as a signal that the computer had passed its initial diagnostic tests and was ready to begin the boot sequence. Initially, the chime was a C-major chord, but it was changed to an F-sharp chord starting in 1998 with the release of the first iMac. While it was possible to mute the startup chime if the computer was muted before being turned off, the loud and often jarring sound had become more of a nuisance than a helpful indicator for most Mac laptop users. For many, the startup chime was a source of embarrassment, whether it was in a library, a coffee shop, or on public transportation. In any case, it's time to bid farewell to the Mac startup chime, which will no longer disrupt the silent startup ritual.  ",

However, it took 10 days for the order to arrive, and the tracking information showed that the case had not even left the warehouse. Beer Hawk's responses to my emails have been sporadic, with occasional promises that the beers would be sent out soon, but they never materialized. A review of recent posts on Reviews.co.uk reveals a pattern of dissatisfied customers, and I've also noticed negative feedback on their Facebook page, which is promptly deleted. When I check the status of my order, it remains stuck in \"pending\" mode. As a occasional customer, I was considering ordering more regularly, but the poor service has left me feeling let down and regretful, leading me to decide to take my business elsewhere.\n\nBeer Hawk, a specialist beer retailer, claims to \"hunt out\" the world's best beer from over 500 options. However, a quick internet search reveals that customers have had difficulties with delivery and customer service. When I contacted them, someone answered promptly, which led to a phone call from co-founder and director Chris France. France explained that the company has recently moved to new premises and upgraded its warehouse management system, resulting in a small number of delayed orders, including mine.

The British Infrastructure Group (BIG) has declared that the time for excuses from mobile network providers is over, citing the unacceptable state of mobile connectivity in some areas of Britain. In a report, the MPs argued that it is unacceptable that some parts of the country still have poor mobile coverage, while visitors from abroad can expect better reception due to their networks' national roaming capabilities. The group proposed an amendment to the government's digital economy bill, which would allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that fail to meet targets set in a 2014 agreement. Under that agreement, the four major network operators (MNOs) pledged to invest £5 billion in improving coverage across the UK by December 2017 in exchange for the government not introducing national roaming. However, the BIG report found little evidence to suggest that the mobile sector will meet its targets to provide coverage to 90% of the UK's geographic area, and is calling for a progress update by the end of 2016. According to Shapps, \"If you have a foreign SIM card and use it in the UK, you'll get better coverage than if you were using one of the UK's companies. It's astonishing.\" The MPs also urged customers to be able to terminate their mobile agreements without penalty if their operator fails to provide a satisfactory level of coverage in their area. A spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport stated: \"We understand the inconvenience of poor mobile coverage, which is why we have made it mandatory for each mobile network operator to provide coverage to at least 90% of the UK by the end of next year.\" The mobile phone operators claim they are working diligently to enhance coverage. An EE spokesperson told the Daily Mail: \"While we acknowledge the importance of increased mobile coverage for a digital Britain, this report neglects the significant advancements in mobile coverage since 2014.\" ",

However, the average cost-per-click fell 11%, down from a 7% drop in the previous quarter. Analysts had predicted a 7.9% decline. The decline in cost-per-click is attributed to the shift from desktop to mobile devices, where ad space is limited and cheaper.

The RBoS Shareholder Action Group, which represents 27,000 retail investors, issued the warning after reports that other shareholders were considering settling out of court. The group, one of at least three bringing claims related to the rights issue in 2008, is eager to take on Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March. The group is the only one suing Goodwin, who was RBS's CEO at the time of the £45 billion taxpayer bailout, and three of the bank's former executives. The legal action is on behalf of thousands of investors, both private and institutional, who lost money by subscribing to shares during the 2008 RBS rights issue. The announcement was made ahead of RBS's third-quarter results, which will be closely scrutinized for any further provisions related to the case. In August, RBS set aside £700 million for the case after mediation talks in July failed to reach a settlement. The total claim by all the investors involved totals £4 billion. The court action by disgruntled investors is just one of many factors that could feature in the bank's results on Friday, when it is expected to report further losses on top of the £52 billion it has already incurred since the bailout. The bank is also expected to provide an update on the potential spin-out of 300 branches, which were previously slated to be rebranded Williams & Glyn, as well as face questions about the alleged mistreatment of small-business customers.

An emailer asked why we should care about the fate of a newspaper in Argentina. While the tone of the question was somewhat chauvinistic, the importance of reporting on media developments elsewhere lies in its ability to provide a broader perspective on the \"worldwide phenomenon\" of journalism in crisis. The Buenos Aires Herald's editorial on the matter highlights a universal concern: the crisis facing the journalism industry. The paper expressed its \"unspeakable sadness\" at having to cease daily publication, citing the \"dramatic change\" in the media industry, which is driven by people's preference for accessing news for free online rather than through print. The Herald acknowledged that this shift could have severe consequences, including the potential loss of up to 2,000 journalist jobs in Argentina in 2016, which would have a significant impact on the profession. The paper is not immune to these changes, as it is reducing its staff significantly due to the transition to a weekly publication. In fact, 14 employees are leaving the company today. The Herald's history dates back 140 years, and it has had its share of notable moments, including its defiance of Argentina's military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s. The paper's editor at the time, Robert Cox, was forced into exile due to threats and intimidation, but his heroism was recognized in 2010 when he was granted honorary citizenship.

The £1.7 billion mine, which was approved last year after a lengthy planning battle, promises to restore the region's mining heritage and create over 1,000 jobs. The project received a significant boost on Tuesday when Sirius Minerals, the company behind the Yorkshire mine, announced a US$300 million deal with Rinehart's Australian agricultural company, Hancock Prospecting. The mine, situated on protected moorland overlooking Whitby and Robin Hood's Bay, aims to produce up to 20 million tonnes of polyhalite, a type of potash fertilizer, per year. Under the deal, Rinehart will acquire $50 million worth of Sirius shares and pay $250 million for a 5% royalty stream on the first 13 million tonnes of fertilizer produced annually, as well as the right to purchase up to 20,000 tonnes of product each year for use on her expanding Australian agricultural holdings. Rinehart stated that the project aligns with Hancock's focus on agriculture, as it delivers a new and natural product that has demonstrated improved yields in field tests across various crop types. She added that Sirius has a large, high-quality mineral resource and is located in a stable jurisdiction with a competitive tax rate, making it an attractive investment opportunity. The mine shaft, which is over a mile deep, was approved by a narrow margin in June 2015 after a four-year planning dispute that drew opposition from conservationists. Notably, the project was supported by 93% of local residents who wrote to the council, with 81% of those living within the national park. However, the project faced opposition from several organizations, including the National Trust, Natural England, the Campaign for National Parks, the North Yorkshire Moors Association, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, and the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. According to Sirius, the mine is expected to boost North Yorkshire's economy by 10%, injecting £48 million directly into the local area, which has struggled to recover from the decline of the coal and fishing industries. The mined polyhalite will be transported via a 23-mile underground conveyor belt beneath the North York Moors national park to a handling facility in Teesside. Chris Fraser, Sirius's managing director and chief executive, expressed his delight at signing the agreement with a reputable and experienced mining company, boasting strong leadership and a growing agricultural interest.

        "Text": "A surprising turn of events has occurred at the Student Accommodation Awards, hosted by Property Week, as a panel of 10 students invited to judge the \"student experience\" category refused to choose a winner in protest of increasing rent prices. The students, handpicked by Property Week, instead criticized the entrants for pricing out poorer students and contributing to the \"social cleansing of education\". The panel cited a 2015 study by the National Union of Students, which showed that university rent in the UK increased by 18% over two years, reaching an average of £146 per week. The report attributed the rise to the growth of private providers. In response to the students' decision, a spokesperson for the Student Accommodation Awards stated that the industry needs to do better and that the category would be removed from the inaugural event, with a review for 2017. The awards will continue to encourage the industry to prioritize the student experience.\n\nJenny Killin, welfare officer at the University of Aberdeen students' association, was part of the panel and expressed her concerns about the \"real student experience\" being a choice between paying bills or buying food. She emphasized that students are accumulating huge levels of debt, primarily to benefit private businesses. Killin tweeted an open letter to Property Week, pointing out that students' maintenance loans barely cover the cheapest rooms at some institutions. The letter emphasized that students cannot celebrate or award a \"for-profit sector\" that is failing many of their peers.\n\nThis development follows a series of university rent strikes and demonstrations coordinated by student activists over the past year. \"A recent blog post in the Guardian features an anonymous student activist who argues that rent strikes are more than just a complaint about rising student housing costs. Rather than being seen as entitled students complaining about paying rent, the activist contends that the real issue is that high rents are preventing poorer students from accessing higher education.

How many can honestly say that they do?\n\nRegarding worker representation on boards, Greg Clark's statement on BBC Radio 4's Today programme (\"We are not going to make it happen\") is concerning.

Murdoch invested $100 million in Theranos between 2014 and 2015, when the company's valuation was soaring due to its promise to revolutionize blood testing with low-cost finger pricks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Murdoch was part of a group of wealthy investors who pumped $632 million into Theranos's latest funding round, valuing the company at nearly $9 billion and making it the highest-valued private healthcare startup in the US. Before investing, Murdoch reportedly toured Theranos's laboratories in Palo Alto and inspected its proprietary devices. However, the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp, has published a series of investigative stories questioning the accuracy of Theranos's testing and management techniques. The WSJ investigation, which persisted despite intense pressure on its whistleblower from Theranos and its board of high-profile figures, led to a government investigation that found the company's practices put patients' lives at risk. As a result, Theranos's CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, was banned from the blood testing business for two years, and the company was forced to shut down its labs. The company, which Holmes founded at the age of 19 in 2003, is now facing both criminal and civil investigations by the US attorney's office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating whether the company misled investors and regulators. Some investors have launched a lawsuit against the company, claiming they were misled, and hope to attract others to join the suit. Other high-profile Theranos investors include billionaire Riley Bechtel, chairman of the private construction giant Bechtel Group, and Cox Enterprises, a family-controlled conglomerate. The company also secured big names for its board, including Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, both former secretaries of state. \"Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal uncovered a shocking revelation: Tyler Shultz, the 26-year-old grandson of former Secretary of State George Shultz, was the whistleblower who came forward with concerns about Theranos. Shultz, who joined the company in 2013, left Theranos in 2014 after his warnings were dismissed as arrogant, patronizing, and reckless. Neither News Corp nor Theranos chose to comment on the matter.\" ",

When I followed up with the bank, they insisted that their decision was final and wouldn't provide any further explanation. Searchlight, which has been fighting against racism and fascism for 52 years, is a well-respected organization that has published a magazine since 1975. We're not affiliated with any political party and are multi-faith. Our income comes from occasional grants, donations, and subscriptions, which are paid in by cheque, standing order, or bank transfer. We have very few international transactions and can't think of anything in our account use that could raise concerns. The only reason I can think of for the closure is that the fascist individuals and organizations we combat may have maliciously provided false information to the bank, and HSBC accepted it without investigation. This sudden closure is very disruptive, and we're applying to open new accounts with another bank, but we're unsure if they'll accept our application due to HSBC's actions.\n\nHSBC's response to our situation is concerning, as they're refusing to reconsider their decision, except for encouraging us to speak to the media. When I contact the bank, I receive a flurry of phone calls, and then senior officials beg for a meeting. However, the outcome is always the same: the four accounts are reinstated, but with no further explanation. The bank's press office is only willing to provide a vague statement, saying that they aim to provide the highest standard of customer service and work closely with customers to resolve issues as soon as possible. \"I'm increasingly receiving reports of bank accounts being closed without warning, often due to banks' overcautious reactions to US anti-money laundering regulations. HSBC, for instance, narrowly avoided prosecution by the US Congress, which may have led it to become overly vigilant in scrutinizing accounts with political or foreign transaction ties.

Over 100,000 people have signed a petition calling on Green to honor his promise to \"sort\" the pension scheme, which has more than 20,000 members. The petition, led by John Hannett, general secretary of the shopworkers' trade union Usdaw, will be delivered to Arcadia on Wednesday. Green had previously promised to address the pension scheme's issues during a parliamentary hearing in June, but has since failed to reach an agreement with the Pensions Regulator, which has launched legal proceedings against him and Dominic Chappell, the former owners of BHS. Hannett emphasized that Green needs to contribute more than £250m to the scheme, calling any less \"derisory\". He urged Green to \"do the right thing\" and fulfill his promise, stating that anything less would be unacceptable for former staff who spent their careers at BHS. The petition includes comments from BHS workers, such as \"This man's greed is unbelievable and I worked for him.\" The collapse of BHS in April led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a £571m pension deficit. A parliamentary investigation found that BHS was systematically plundered under Green's and Chappell's leadership, with Green and his family collecting at least £580m from the retailer while Chappell's company Retail Acquisitions received an estimated £17m.

Work on the foundation jackets is set to begin in the second quarter of 2017 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. The East Anglia One windfarm, which is valued at £2.5bn, will generate enough electricity to power 500,000 homes by 2020.

Harland and Wolff, which was formed in 1862, is based in Belfast and has a rich history of shipbuilding, including the construction of the Titanic. The company has survived by diversifying away from shipbuilding and has been involved in the construction of oil and gas rigs, as well as the recasting of Halfpenny Bridge in Dublin.

Born and raised in County Durham, Harry was the son of William Jones, a miner, and his wife, May (née Cowley). His father was forced to begin working in the mines at the age of 12 to support the family, while his mother, May, left school at 14 but was an avid reader. May's access to the library on the estate of the Backhouses, the Darlington bankers, where she worked as a housekeeper and her husband was a coachman, provided Harry with a pre-school education. The family relocated to Coventry in 1940 due to unemployment in Durham, where they experienced the challenges of wartime air raids. At the time, grammar schools were fee-paying institutions that only accepted a select few, and Harry was fortunate enough to secure a spot at King Edward VI school in Nuneaton. However, his secondary education was disrupted when the school was bombed, and pupils were forced to attend school only on Tuesdays and Thursdays to receive work to complete at home. Even when full-time schooling resumed, the school lacked essential facilities such as laboratories, a gymnasium, and a library. Despite these challenges, Harry excelled academically and was an exceptional student. In addition to his academic achievements, he was an accomplished rugby player, selected for Warwickshire's under-18 team, editor of the school magazine, and a talented actor who played Prospero and Bottom in school productions. He also won awards for public speaking and was recognized as the best all-around athlete. After completing his national service as a technical instructor, Harry claimed that the army taught him how to teach in just six weeks. He then went on to attend Birmingham University, where we met. Harry began his teaching career as a lecturer in English at West Bromwich and later became a senior lecturer in liberal studies at Ipswich. Throughout his career, he supported the movement to liberalize traditional technical colleges, which ultimately led to the establishment of new universities. As the head of department at Northampton College of Further Education, vice principal at Dacorum College in Hemel Hempstead, and principal at Borehamwood College of Further Education, he conceptualized a student-focused fusion of sixth-form college, technical college, and adult education, serving as a community resource. As principal of Isle College in Wisbech from 1978, he worked tirelessly to bring this vision to life. He fostered a sense of community among staff by encouraging them to participate in local events and was an active member of various organizations, publishing local history studies and delivering talks to local groups. In his retirement, starting from 1993, he enjoyed a wide range of activities, including literature, theatre, film, music, politics, and football. He remained open to new ideas and developed expertise in computer technology and the internet. A dedicated supporter of the Labour party, he believed it had provided him with the opportunities he had in life. However, nothing was more important to him than his family, whom he loved and cherished. He is survived by his spouse, two sons, Gavin and Duncan, and five grandchildren, Edward, Natasha, Louise, Sara, and Jeremy. ",

As part of the agreement, Sumitomo will acquire the trademark rights to the Dunlop brand overseas, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Mike Ashley, the founder and major shareholder of Sports Direct, acquired Dunlop Slazenger in 2004 for an estimated £40 million, three years before listing his sportswear retail chain on the stock exchange. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is synonymous with sports such as tennis, squash, badminton, and golf, and has been used by notable athletes including Rod Laver, John McEnroe, Steffi Graf, Darren Clarke, and Lee Westwood. Sports Direct stated that it no longer has the resources to manage international brands, and needs to focus on its core UK businesses and relationships with third-party brands. The Dunlop business generated a pre-tax profit of £4 million on sales of £41.8 million, according to Sports Direct. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, originally known as the Dunlop Rubber Company, has a tyre business and a sports division that produces tennis and golf equipment. The company already owns the rights to the Dunlop brand in other markets. Sports Direct has faced challenges in recent years, including criticism of its working practices and weak trading. In December, the company reported that profits had more than halved to £71.6 million in the six months to October 23. The company's chairman, Keith Hellawell, attributed the decline to an \"extreme political, union and media campaign\" against the company. An undercover investigation by The Guardian last year revealed that Sports Direct workers were being paid below the minimum wage, and a parliamentary committee report later compared conditions at the company's Shirebrook warehouse to a Victorian workhouse. Since the controversy, the company has been compelled to pay £1 million in back wages to employees and provide staff with guaranteed working hours. As a result, Sports Direct's stock price has plummeted by more than half over the past year, with shares currently trading at 272.4p. The retailer's profit margins have also been significantly impacted by the pound's sharp depreciation following the Brexit vote. Despite the challenges, Sports Direct still maintains a substantial portfolio of brands, including Slazenger, Everlast, Lonsdale, and Karrimor. ",

As the president of Germany's Bundesbank, Weidmann believes the Italian government should carefully consider whether to rescue the bank if it is in a precarious financial state. According to Weidmann, the bank must be financially healthy at its core in order for the measures planned by the Italian government to be effective. He emphasized that the funds cannot be used to cover expected losses, and all aspects must be thoroughly examined. Weidmann, a member of the ECB's governing council, made these comments in an article published in German newspaper Bild. The ECB has taken a tough stance with Monte dei Paschi, refusing to grant the bank additional time to find private investors. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan last Friday after the bank failed to secure €5 billion in private investment. The plan involves dipping into a €20 billion fund approved by the government earlier this month to prop up the bank. Monte dei Paschi's poor performance in the ECB's \"stress tests\" prompted the government to take action. The stress tests, designed to ensure that taxpayers are not left with the bill for multi-billion pound bailouts, revealed that Monte dei Paschi was in a weak financial position. The bank was instructed to improve its finances by the end of the year or face being wound down. Weidmann stressed that the rules are intended to protect taxpayers and place responsibility on investors. He believes that state funds should only be used as a last resort, which is why the bar is set high. Monte dei Paschi's troubles began to mount after the 2008 banking crisis, when it made a costly acquisition of Banca Antonveneta for €9 billion, more than doubling its size and making it Italy's third-largest bank behind UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. The deal, which was part of a complex bidding war involving Santander and ABN Amro, ultimately contributed to the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Monte dei Paschi's financial woes escalated three years ago, when it sought a €4 billion bailout from the government amid a scandal over derivatives contracts and allegations of fraud. The bank has since returned to the government for funding after talks with private investors fell through, with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund reportedly playing a key role in the collapse of the plan by refusing to participate. The Italian government already has a 4% stake in Monte dei Paschi. ",

Frustrated customers of the west London-based car hire booking firm, which acted as a booking agent for major car hire brands, have taken to social media to report the issue. \"I'm cancelling my rental car, keeping my money, and being given no other option just two days before I fly home for Christmas.

Although Atlaschoice is not a well-known brand, many customers may have used the booking agent website through TravelSupermarket, a popular travel comparison site. The company also partnered with several other major online travel businesses. The Christmas period is typically one of the busiest for car hire operators, and many customers may be unable to pay for their car hire a second time. A TravelSupermarket spokesperson told The Guardian that the company removed Atlaschoice from its listings three weeks ago. \"They missed paying us at the end of November, and we were unable to reach them, so we took them off our site as a precautionary measure.

In Speke, a low-income area in Liverpool, consumers were facing charges of £1.50 for every cash withdrawal. I established a working group comprising banks, consumer groups, and ATM operators, and the banks unanimously committed to maintaining a large network of free cash machines. As a result, a \"financial inclusion premium\" was introduced for operators of free cash machines in 1,500 under-served low-income areas. The importance of the free-to-use ATM network has grown significantly since banks have closed over 1,000 branches in the past two years. If we were to return to the patchwork of agreements that existed in the 1990s, when consumers faced excessive cash machine charges and challenger banks were penalized, it would be a disaster for both consumers and banks. It's crucial that, as part of the current negotiations, banks, ATM operators, the Payment Systems Regulator, and the Bank of England work together to agree a deal that ensures the long-term viability of a widespread network of free-to-use cash machines and promotes financial inclusion and competition.\n\nRegarding HSBC, when its chairman, Douglas Flint, appeared before the Treasury select committee in 2015, he expressed shame over a \"terrible list\" of issues. He wasn't wrong; the list included Libor manipulation, mortgage mis-selling, Forex rigging, and weaknesses in money laundering and tax avoidance at its Swiss subsidiary. Unfortunately, we can now add disregard for local communities and high streets to that list. Last year, HSBC closed over 200 branches, more than any other major bank, and it has just announced another 62 closures this year, including in my constituency of Wood Green. HSBC's commitment to being the \"world's local bank\" seems to be fading away. If this trend continues, it's possible that all branches will be gone by the end of 2019. This decision will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the many residents and businesses that rely on in-person services at local branches, as well as the dedicated staff who work at these locations. I have requested an urgent meeting with HSBC's leadership to discuss these proposals and will be urging them to reconsider their plan. As the Labour MP for Hornsey & Wood Green, I am concerned about the effects of this decision and will be advocating for a change in course. ",

At the company's annual meeting, CEO Ben Magara acknowledged that progress on building homes for its 33,000 employees had been slower than expected, but attributed the delay to the low price of platinum, which makes it difficult for the company to stay financially stable. The 2012 Marikana massacre, in which 34 people were killed, was sparked by a strike by workers demanding a living wage from Lonmin. The former Bishop of Pretoria, Johannes Seoka, who was on the phone with one of the victims when the police opened fire, believes that the company should take more responsibility for the tragedy. \"If they had engaged with the workers, the massacre would not have happened,\" he said. Seoka and Amnesty International are calling on Lonmin to accelerate its efforts to provide housing for its workers, many of whom live in informal communities without basic amenities like electricity or running water. Last year, Lonmin reached a deal with workers to increase the basic monthly pay of rock drill operators to nearly 12,500 South African rand (£744) by 2018, but one shareholder questioned the reasonableness of the wage demands. \"I don't understand what they want to spend it on,\" she said, comparing the amount to her own pension and disability allowance. Lonmin has taken steps to support the families of the Marikana massacre victims, including offering them jobs, paying for their children's education, and agreeing to improve housing and wages.  ",

        "Text": "Imperial Brands' shareholders have effectively blocked a pay increase for CEO Alison Cooper, a move that may have implications for other FTSE 100 companies seeking to boost their executives' bonuses. The company, which owns Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, unexpectedly announced on Thursday that it would not put its new pay policy to a vote at its annual meeting on February 1, as originally planned. The policy would have increased Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m per year by expanding bonus opportunities. The decision suggests that Imperial Brands did not expect to receive overwhelming support from investors. The influential proxy voting agency ISS had recommended voting against the policy, indicating a significant revolt was likely. Imperial Brands' chairman, Mark Williamson, stated that investors had changed their minds about supporting the plan. \"We have been engaging with shareholders for some time and while we received significant support, it is clear that views have shifted, and it is now in the best interest of the company to withdraw the resolution,\" he said. Williamson added that the board believes revising the policy is necessary to attract and retain top talent and ensure the company's sustainable growth. David Haines, chairman of the remuneration committee, argued that the pay rise was necessary not only for Cooper but also for other executives, as it is significantly below the average for companies of Imperial Brands' size. Critics of high pay saw the move as a warning to company executives against pushing through pay increases, but urged investors to maintain their pressure. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said, \"This is the first sign that some institutions will be more resistant this year, so it looks like good news.\" \"While one instance of effective criticism may not be enough to spark a'shareholder spring', the question remains whether asset managers will continue to actively engage in critical discussions. During her campaign to become prime minister, Theresa May drew attention to pay inequality. However, the government has since published a consultation that appears to backtrack on its initial plans to require workers to be represented on company boards to curb excessive bonuses. Recently, BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, which has hired George Osborne as an advisor, has signaled a more prominent stance on executive pay. As one of the top three investors in FTSE 100 companies due to its significant size, BlackRock has written to major companies on the stock market, warning that it will be monitoring companies that justify pay increases by comparing themselves to their rivals' pay.\" ",

The announcement was made at the Science Museum in London, where a Soyuz capsule that brought Peake and two other astronauts back to Earth in June is now on display. \"Reunited with Soyuz TMA-19M, which has a few scars from reentry,\" Peake tweeted on Thursday morning. The details of his next mission, including its name and schedule, have not been released, but it is unlikely to take place before 2019. European Space Agency missions to the space station typically last around six months.\n\nThe next European astronaut to launch into space will be Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli in May. \"It's what every astronaut wants to do,\" Peake told Sky News, adding that he and his fellow astronauts from 2009 are all expected to get a second mission to the space station, which is \"wonderful.\" Peake emphasized the importance and excitement of the work being done on the space station, saying it's natural to want to return. He also expressed a longing for the view of planet Earth, which he described as \"the most spectacular thing you can possibly see.\"\n\nPeake, a 44-year-old former helicopter test pilot and father of two from West Sussex, became the first British astronaut to join a European Space Agency mission in December 2015. He spent six months on the space station, during which he participated in over 250 experiments. Some of his notable achievements included running the London Marathon on a treadmill and inspiring over a million schoolchildren through educational outreach activities. One of the highlights of his time in space was a spacewalk with Nasa astronaut Tim Kopra, although the mission was cut short after Kopra noticed water leaking into his helmet. The Soyuz capsule, which carried Peake and his two crewmates, Kopra and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko, to and from the space station, measures less than two meters in width. His mission was dubbed \"Principia,\" a nod to Sir Isaac Newton's groundbreaking work on the laws of motion and gravity, which bears the same name. ",

        "Text": "The Governor of the Bank of England has cautioned that a new generation of online-only lenders is emerging, posing a threat to the financial system if not properly regulated. Mark Carney warned that these online lenders, untested in a recession, could trigger the next financial crisis if they fail to repay their loans, leaving customers with significant losses. He also highlighted the risk of cyber-attacks stripping customers of their digital money, leaving them without the traditional protection offered by regulators.\n\nCarney's warning comes after a similar warning was issued by Adair Turner, the former chief financial regulator, who warned that losses on internet-based loans could make even the worst bankers look like \"lending geniuses\". Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney noted that digital money could potentially allow millions of people excluded from the mainstream banking system to access loans securely. However, he emphasized the need for the authorities to adopt a more intense focus on financial regulations, lending rules, and operational and cyber risks to ensure the industry's growth is sustainable.\n\nIn the UK, online lenders, known as fintech lenders, have become increasingly popular, accounting for around 14% of new lending to small and medium-sized businesses last year. These lenders typically offer loans with funds provided directly by investors, similar to the securitized loans used by banks like Northern Rock before the 2008 financial crisis. Carney cautioned that the rapid growth of online lending could lead to emerging vulnerabilities that regulators would need to address.\n\nThe UK is expected to become a global leader in online lending, putting pressure on the Bank to adopt regulations that protect customers without stifling the industry. The growth of online lending has been hindered by the volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin, which has limited its adoption due to concerns about its value and security. In recent months, Bitcoin's value has rebounded, and the popularity of blockchain electronic wallets, which function like bank accounts, has led some analysts to predict a surge in adoption this year. Traditionally, payment services relied on cash, debit and credit cards, and wire transfers. However, fintech companies are now offering domestic and cross-border payment services on a large scale through digital wallets or prepaid e-money. According to Carney, tech firms take a share of payment revenues and often gain access to the entirety of customer transaction data. In doing so, they are systematically accumulating the kind of customer insights I used to gain through my daily interactions with customers as a bank teller, he noted, referencing his first job as a bank teller.

According to a Snap spokesperson, the changes aim to \"empower our editorial partners to maintain Snapchat as a trustworthy, factual, and safe environment for all users.\" The company has struggled to balance keeping the platform age-appropriate for younger users (Snapchat bars children under 13 from creating accounts, but allows 13- to 17-year-olds to use the service) with allowing publications on Discover editorial freedom. For instance, The Daily Mail has faced user complaints for frequently posting semi-nude images as its \"cover\" on the service. One user told The Guardian, \"I find it incredibly offensive that I can't opt out of seeing these images and that I'm forced to see them every time I open the app to see my friends' stories.\" Another user reported, \"A few weeks ago, a definite line was crossed. The image was of a completely nude female, taken from the side, so you can't see the nipples, but her breasts were dangling over her boyfriend who she was mounting. She was dressed on the bottom, and I believe her boyfriend was completely dressed.\" Due to the prominence of Discover features in the app, the cover story is visible to all users, including those who only use the service to communicate with friends and family. In July 2016, Snapchat faced a lawsuit over sexualized Discover stories, which was eventually settled out of court. Under the new rules, news organizations will need to provide justification or demonstrate editorial value before posting such stories to the service. Snap is planning to introduce a new tool in February that will enable publishers to age-gate their content, presenting different stories to users under and over the age of 18, according to the New York Times. In addition to the rules against questionable images, Snapchat Discover will also take steps to address the issue of fake news, a problem that has plagued many social networks. Going forward, publishers will be required to fact-check their Discover stories, both those published within the app and those linked to from it. While Snap gives publishers editorial independence, the company does follow up with them if readers raise questions about the sourcing, accuracy, or other factors of their content, according to BuzzFeed News.

Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on a regulator offering affordable arbitration was a major sticking point, as editors argued it would be a final blow to a struggling industry. This led to a litmus test for MPs and ministers, who were unsure how to proceed. As a result, the culture, media, and sport committee has given Ipso, a non-Leveson-compliant regulator, a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. If Ipso fails to do so, the recognition of section 40 will pass to its rival, Impress. The choice between the two schemes is clear: Impress charges £75 upfront for a three- to six-month process, while Ipso offers super-silky barristers for a downpayment of £300, with potentially much more to follow. A key difference is that Impress caps arbitrators' fees at £3,500, regardless of the outcome, and does not charge legal costs if the plaintiff wins. This has raised concerns among local newspapers, who fear they could lose financially. Ipso, on the other hand, has more flexible costings and obligations, but its fees are higher and less transparent. The question is, can we get some hard data to help make a decision? The answer depends on whether the demand for arbitration is as high as its proponents claim. So far, no one has taken advantage of the arbitration option, despite the fact that it is available. It may be that ordinary complaints regulation is sufficient, or that no-win-no-fee solicitors have already cornered the market. But can't we at least gather more information before making a decision? \"Can arbitration develop a single, comprehensive approach that applies universally?\" ",

The courses were arranged by trade unions in partnership with their employers, and the syllabuses were co-created by students and instructors. Topics covered included economic and social history, and students presented papers to one another, exploring subjects such as collective bargaining and global politics. I first met Peter in 1966 at Sheffield University's Department of Extramural Studies, where he had recently joined six months prior. He was committed to fostering students' independent thought and understanding, recognizing that adult education in the social sciences was a collaborative process rather than mere instruction. Throughout his life, Peter touched and enriched the lives of many, but perhaps his most enduring legacy stems from his work with the union-backed Society of Industrial Tutors. Born to Austen Smith and Isabel (née Reed), Peter was the son of a junior school headteacher in Sunderland. After leaving school, he studied economics at Manchester University and began teaching liberal studies at Stockport College of Technology in 1962. That same year, he met his future wife, Helen Naughton, while working for the Labour party in a north Manchester constituency. In 1965, Peter joined the extramural program at Sheffield University, and he and Helen married the following year. He played a key role in the Sheffield Vietnam campaign and led a large contingent to the famous anti-war protest outside the US embassy in London's Grosvenor Square in 1968.

We're considering this move to ensure that we can leave our respective shares of the property to our daughters, while still allowing us to remain in the property should either of us pass away. I believe this is a way to grant a \"life interest\" to the surviving spouse. Currently, as joint tenants, we have a joint will that leaves the property to the surviving spouse and, in the event of both our deaths, to our children. Additionally, our will stipulates that each of our six grandchildren will receive £10,000 when we both pass away, provided there is sufficient assets in our estate. If we become tenants in common, do we need to update our existing wills to reflect the new arrangement, specifically to provide for a life interest to the surviving spouse and to leave our respective shares of the estate to our daughters and grandchildren, as outlined in our current will?\n\nSMF Answer: Yes, if we decide to own our home as tenants in common by severing our joint tenancy, we will need to draft new wills. Additionally, since we currently have a joint will, which is not recognized under UK law, we will need to create individual wills that \"mirror\" each other, with identical provisions. It's not possible to specify in a will who inherits property that is jointly owned under a joint tenancy, as the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) upon the death of the other(s). However, if we own the property as tenants in common, we can specify in our will who inherits our share of the property upon our death. Nevertheless, simply leaving our share to our daughters does not automatically create a \"life interest\" in the property for our spouse. \"To ensure that your spouse can remain in the house until their death, your will must explicitly state this intention. Currently, as joint tenants, when one of you passes away, the surviving spouse will automatically inherit the property and have the right to live in it until their own death, without the need for a will to specify this. Upon the surviving spouse's death, your daughters will inherit the property, assuming they don't change their will to leave the property to someone else.

ITV's attempt to create a US-style daily chat show is understandable, but it's not suitable for the 10pm time slot, where viewers expect to stay informed about current events. As for the BBC's executive board, don't treat the selection process like a Paddy Power betting guide when Tony Hall retires. Charlotte Moore, James Harding, and James Purnell are still the top contenders, and it's difficult to predict a single winner without compromising the entire board's decision. As a result, all three candidates are waiting patiently for their chance to shine. However, it's important to note that Anne Bulford and Tim Davie, who made the transition from other roles to become BBC executives, don't have an inherent advantage in the race. This competition is far from over.  ",

        "Text": "Pret a Manger has reversed its decision to offer hundreds of teenagers unpaid work experience this summer, instead announcing that it will pay them an hourly wage. The company had initially planned to offer 500 16- to 18-year-olds a week of unpaid work experience in an effort to address its looming recruitment crisis. However, after facing criticism from campaigners, Pret's CEO Clive Schlee tweeted that the company will pay all participants its hourly starting rate, in addition to providing free food. The minimum wage for under 18s in the UK is £4 an hour, while for 18- to 20-year-olds it is £5.55 an hour. Pret's recruitment efforts are being impacted by Brexit, as the company relies heavily on non-UK workers and only one in 50 of its job applicants are born in the UK. The company's new work experience program, dubbed \"Big Experience Week\", aims to give participants a taste of various aspects of the business, including food production, customer service, and social responsibility. Pret's human resources director, Andrea Wareham, believes that the company's struggles to attract British applicants are symptomatic of a wider cultural bias against careers in the hospitality industry. Wareham argues that British schools and parents need to take the industry more seriously, as it has undergone significant changes and growth over the past 20 years. The company is concerned that it will struggle to recruit enough staff if it is forced to turn its back on EU nationals after Brexit. Pret hopes to offer permanent roles to participants who wish to apply after their work experience week and will stay in touch with those who want to remain in education and apply in the future. The company will promote its Big Experience Week initiative through partnerships with schools that are already part of its leavers program. Additionally, it will launch a social media campaign to raise awareness. To attract more British workers, Pret plans to boost recruitment advertising on social media, double the intake for its school leavers program, and collaborate with Jobcentre Plus. ",

As I sat behind the wheel, I wondered if I should be revving the engine or sipping coffee. The cabin is spacious, but it's marred by annoying quirks. The gear housing is loose, often slipping into second gear when I intended to shift into neutral. This inconsistency made me doubt my own abilities, as if I was trapped in a bad relationship. The car's frame design is unusual, with large plastic panels at the rear, which creates a blind spot when parking on a curve. The dashboard is cluttered with red accents, giving me a sense of unease, as if I was being told something important in a dream. The interior doesn't exude luxury, with a small, hard-to-read screen and storage compartments that don't align with my hand's natural reach. However, the Tipo has its redeeming qualities. It doesn't look or feel like a small car, and its emissions are impressively low – the first car I've driven in a long time to achieve under 100g/km. The exterior styling is a nostalgic ode to the 1980s, with curved lines that evoke a sense of retro charm. The boot space is ample for my needs, but I wouldn't dare try to transport anything larger than a shopping bag. The front seats offer generous leg room, while the rear seats are a bit cramped. The Fiat Tipo's design is so retro that it's reminiscent of the 80s, when it was common for not all family members to be equally comfortable. The turbo diesel engine, however, is a different story. In the city, it's sluggish to respond, then suddenly delivers a burst of power, as if it's been waiting for permission to unleash its full potential. On the motorway, the acceleration is smoother, especially in the higher gears, although the stiff posture can become tiring over time. After an hour or so, I started to feel restless, like I was watching a children's movie that lacked the magic of Pixar. The Tipo is a decent car, suitable for starting a family, but it may not be stylish or cool enough for some people's tastes. If you find it lacking in these areas, the problem may not be with the car, but with your expectations. On the other hand, I'm not sure I'm immune to these criticisms either. Here are some key stats about the Fiat Tipo:\n\n* Price: £18,545\n* Top speed: 124mph\n* Acceleration: 0-62mph in 9.8 seconds\n* Combined fuel consumption: 76mpg\n* CO2 emissions: 98g/km\n* Eco rating: 9/10\n* Cool rating: 6/10 ",

Perhaps it's the charming staff at Hennings wine merchants, or the knowledgeable bookshop employees who can guide you through the topographical section. I'm still searching for the perfect antiques dealers, but the towns are filled with plummy-voiced experts who could easily be suspects in a whodunit. And then there are the enigmatic figures who seem to operate behind the high walls of the stately homes that dominate the area, evoking the atmosphere of a Miss Marple mystery. The towns themselves are idyllic, with tile-covered cottages, porches dripping with roses, and wisteria galore. I even spotted a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Joan Hickson, the iconic actress who played Miss Marple, picking up a korma at Meghdoot's Indian restaurant.\n\nPetworth is often overshadowed by its famous stately home, which boasts works by Titian and Turner. However, Pulborough has a more worldly feel, with its railway station and connections to Horsham, Bognor Regis, and London. It's the kind of place where I imagine Agatha Christie's characters would have lived, surrounded by the sounds of jazz and the whispers of romantic scandals.\n\nDespite its charms, Petworth is also a bit too perfect, with coach parties and tourists flocking to the area. The looming walls of the stately home can make one feel like a peasant, and the town's exclusivity can be off-putting. However, it's well connected, with regular trains to Horsham, Bognor Regis, and London, as well as easy driving access to the A27, the coast, and Gatwick Airport.\n\nFor families, there are several excellent schools to choose from, including St Mary's CofE and Fittleworth CofE, which are both rated \"good\" by Ofsted, and the \"outstanding\" Weald and Midhurst Rother College.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to relax and soak up the atmosphere, the Angel pub in Petworth is a great spot, with its cozy inglenooks, medieval floorboards, and friendly locals who could easily be suspects in a mystery novel. \"Looking for a unique property? Consider Wisteria-ed stone cottages, Georgian town houses, 18th-century farmhouses, mills, and estates with land, as well as gabled old houses with a rich history. You'll find plenty of beautiful properties here, but be prepared to pay a premium. Prices range from:\n\n* Large detached homes and townhouses: £700,000-£2.5m\n* Detached and smaller townhouses: £400,000-£700,000\n* Semis: £275,000-£500,000\n* Terraces and cottages: £250,000-£400,000\n* Rentals: a few options available, with three-bedroom houses priced at £1,150-£2,000 per month.\n\nIf you're looking for a real bargain, consider a unique property like this 10-bedroom former railway station in Petworth, available for £1.4m through Chesworths.\n\nWhen you're not house hunting, enjoy the local amenities, such as the RSPB's Pulborough Brooks nature reserve, which features a well-stocked shop and a cafe with scenic views. Other attractions include Petworth House and the gardens of Parham House and Storrington, one of the country's finest Elizabethan manors.\n\nIf you live in Petworth or Pulborough, share your thoughts on the area by joining the debate below.

In England and Wales, personal insolvencies reached 24,531 between January and March, a 6.7% increase from the previous quarter and a 15.7% jump from the same period a year earlier. According to the Insolvency Service, this marks the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014. The rise in insolvencies coincides with a challenging period for UK households, as rising inflation and stagnant pay growth continue to squeeze incomes. The annual inflation rate has reached 2.3% and is expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the effects of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote begin to manifest in higher prices. Meanwhile, regular pay growth has slowed to 1.9% compared to a year earlier. Joanna Elson, CEO of the Money Advice Trust, expressed concern over the insolvency figures, stating that growing household debt and increased pressure on budgets from inflation are cause for worry. \"We anticipate a greater demand for free debt advice throughout 2017 and urge anyone struggling with their finances or concerned about falling behind to seek help as early as possible,\" she said. In the first quarter, individual voluntary arrangements accounted for 59% of personal insolvencies, debt relief orders made up 25%, and bankruptcies accounted for 16%. IVAs involve sharing debt among creditors, while DROs are available to those with less than £20,000 of debt who do not own their primary residence. Adrian Hyde, president of R3, noted that while borrowing rates remain at record lows, rising inflation and slowing real wage growth will restrict people's financial flexibility. \"Despite a few years of stability, personal insolvency rates are still relatively low, and the recent uptick in bankruptcies has been modest. However, the steady increase in personal insolvencies may signal that the post-recession surge in consumer borrowing and spending is beginning to plateau. The official statistics only tell part of the story, as hundreds of thousands of individuals on debt management plans are not included in the numbers. Meanwhile, the Insolvency Service reported a 4.5% rise in corporate insolvencies in the first quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase compared to the same period last year.\" ",

The pharmaceutical company's 2016 remuneration report received a similar level of opposition as three years ago, with nearly 40% of investors voting against it at the annual meeting in London. In contrast, the new pay policy received strong support, with 96% of investors backing it. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, received a total pay package of £13.4m last year, which included a £1.2m annual salary, a £1.2m annual bonus, and a £6.9m payment from a long-term incentive plan, as well as a one-off payment of £3.6m in compensation for lost bonuses. Royal London Asset Management, which holds 1% of AstraZeneca shares, voted against the remuneration report and the chair of the remuneration committee, but supported the new pay policy. AstraZeneca made changes to its long-term bonus plans after consulting with its largest shareholders, aiming to simplify and make them fairer. The company stated that its remuneration committee would continue to engage with shareholders to address any concerns following the annual general meeting. Two advisory groups, PIRC and Institutional Shareholder Services, had recommended that shareholders vote against the remuneration report and policy, citing the £6.9m long-term incentive plan payment as \"excessive\". AstraZeneca has faced several shareholder protests over executive pay in recent years, including a row that led to the ousting of its chief executive in 2012. This year, the housebuilding firm Persimmon faced a near 10% protest vote over executive pay, while Crest Nicholson pushed ahead with plans to pay out controversial bonuses despite a 58% rejection of its remuneration report.

The camera, available by invitation only in the US for $200 (£156), stands on a shelf and features four LEDs for lighting, a depth-sensing system, and a microphone array, similar to other Alexa-powered Echo devices. With its depth information, the camera produces blurred backgrounds in full-length selfies, allowing users to capture their best angles. The device can also record videos, giving users the opportunity to show off their outfits. However, the Echo Look is more than just a camera with Alexa, as Amazon's machine-learning system compares photos of different outfits and provides a \"style check\" to determine which one is most fashionable at that moment. According to Amazon, the style advice will improve over time as more users participate and fashion experts contribute their expertise. In addition to its fashion-focused features, the Echo Look performs all the usual tasks of other Echo devices, such as setting alarms, answering questions, and playing music. For users' peace of mind, a button on the side allows them to turn off both the camera and microphone.

The trial aims to recruit \"hundreds\" of participants with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs, who will be able to ride in the vehicles and provide feedback. According to Waymo's head, John Krafcik, the goal is to give participants unrestricted access to the fleet, allowing them to use the vehicles daily, at any time, to travel anywhere within a designated area roughly twice the size of San Francisco. Arizona has been actively courting self-driving car researchers, offering a more favorable regulatory environment and even launching social media campaigns to attract companies from Silicon Valley. The state's governor, Doug Ducey, has been aggressively pursuing companies like Uber, which was banned from testing in California after regulatory breaches. Waymo has been testing 100 self-driving minivans on public roads since earlier this year and plans to add another 500 vehicles to its fleet. Krafcik emphasized the importance of the trial, stating that the early riders will play a crucial role in shaping the development of self-driving technology, which has the potential to transform various areas, including personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics, and more, making our lives and cities safer, more convenient, and more accessible. Currently, Waymo's program is more like a subsidized taxi service than a fully open self-driving car release. While the company aims to develop vehicles that require no human intervention, its early trial involves having a test driver in each vehicle to monitor the rides at all times. As a result, households that apply don't need driving licenses or the physical ability to take control of the car. Waymo's corporate history is varied, having originated as a Google subsidiary called X Labs. When Google restructured into Alphabet, X Labs was spun off and rebranded as Waymo in 2016. This spin-off marked a new direction for the company, which had previously focused on building a fully autonomous car. Now, Waymo is taking a more collaborative approach, partnering with existing manufacturers like Chrysler to add self-driving features to production vehicles. ",

Would you rather be seen as creative geniuses, like Paul McCartney and Michelangelo, who are also left-handed? Research on handedness has uncovered a range of interesting facts. For instance, men are more likely to be left-handed. Studies have also suggested that left-handed college graduates earn more, and that low birth weight, mental illness, autism, cerebral palsy, heart disease, and certain types of cancer are associated with left-handedness. On the other hand, the idea that left-handed people die younger is a myth. Left-handed individuals do have an advantage in sports, as their opponents receive less practice against them. Additionally, they might be worse drivers, according to a survey conducted by a car insurance company. While this survey might be flawed, it's still worth discussing. The survey found that 28% of left-handed drivers had received a speeding ticket, compared to 19% of right-handed drivers. For parking tickets, the figures were 26% for lefties and 23% for righties. Over a 60-year driving lifetime, left-handed drivers caused an average of nine accidents, compared to eight for right-handed drivers. Interestingly, left-handed drivers were slightly less likely to have damaged their own car (35% vs 38%) and slightly more likely to have passed their driving test on the first attempt (53% vs 49%). \"It's important to note that this phenomenon may not be related to the skill level of left-handed individuals. It's possible that cars and roads were simply designed with right-handed people in mind. I've often thought that's the reason I receive so many parking tickets. Some might agree.

The bonus, which is part of a five-year incentive plan approved by investors in 2012, will be shared among the company's three co-founders and its finance chief. Based on the average share price over the past 40 days, the total bonus pot is worth £240m. The four directors - Christopher Miller, David Roper, Simon Peckham, and Geoff Martin - will receive 68% of the bonus, amounting to £40m each in shares. The remaining 32% will be distributed among 20 senior managers. The executives can sell shares to cover their £70m income tax bill but must retain at least half of the remaining shares for at least two years. The directors have a history of retaining their shares, having only sold them to cover tax bills in the past. The bonus plan is designed to align the interests of the directors with those of shareholders, with £3.5bn returned to investors over the five-year period. Melrose Industries has a track record of buying and turning around struggling manufacturing businesses, and its share price has soared from 42.97p five years ago to 236p on Wednesday. The company was founded and floated on the stock market in 2003 by Miller, Roper, and Peckham, who invested about £3m in the business. With its share price expected to rise further, Melrose Industries is likely to rejoin the FTSE 250 index soon. Despite declaring a statutory loss of £69.3m last year, the company made an underlying pretax profit of £96m, with revenues of £889m. The bonus payouts are among the largest in City history, but pale in comparison to the £70m compensation package awarded to WPP CEO Sir Martin Sorrell in 2015, which included a £63m payout from a long-term incentive scheme that sparked a shareholder revolt. Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of Berkeley Group, received paychecks of £21.5m and £23.3m over the past two years. At Melrose, Peckham was paid £987,000 last year, while Martin received £803,000, Miller £549,000, and Roper £548,000. A new three-year incentive plan, set to begin on Thursday, was approved by 83% of shareholders at the company's annual meeting earlier this month. This plan includes several \"shareholder-friendly\" provisions, such as malus clauses, which allow share payouts to be clawed back in certain circumstances. The size of the payout will depend on how much executives improve acquired businesses and successfully sell them.

The airline's response to the crisis has been heavily criticized, with hundreds of passengers left stranded and experts accusing BA of failing them. The value of BA's parent company, IAG, has taken a hit, with a staggering £500 million wiped off its value. Paul Charles, a crisis-response expert with experience at Eurostar and Virgin Atlantic, is baffled by BA's slow response to the crisis. \"You need to respond within an hour with a clear statement on what's happening,\" he says. \"It took BA's CEO seven hours to record a video message on Twitter. That's unacceptable.\" Charles, who now runs a travel consultancy, believes that BA's brand is strong enough to recover from this crisis, but notes that it's being eroded by the airline's poor response. \"When airlines don't have a good crisis plan in place, it can lead to a decline in their brand,\" he warns. United Airlines faced a similar crisis when it blamed a passenger who was dragged off an overbooked plane, but later admitted its initial response was wrong. The airline's stock price recovered after it apologized and improved its response. Malaysia Airlines was nationalized after the loss of two planes in 2014, highlighting the severity of the consequences of a crisis in the airline industry. According to Charles, airlines and airports have a unique ability to fascinate the public and media, which can amplify even minor crises. Effective crisis management plans typically involve clear command structures and a list of key stakeholders that the CEO personally contacts, including major corporate clients and travel agencies. Charles has handled his fair share of crises, but one of the most notable was a single complaint about the food on a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London. The complaint, which went viral in 2009, was made by an anonymous passenger who sent an email to Richard Branson, complete with photos of his meal and a humorous review. The passenger joked that the mashed potato looked like it had been \"passed through the digestive tract of a bird.\" This incident quickly turned into a global negative story, serving as an early lesson in the power of social media. Charles recalls that the company responded quickly and turned the situation around by offering the passenger a role as a food tester for future menus. ",

The project, which cost around $1,300, offered backers rewards such as replica dice and having their paper title inscribed on the monument. The idea for the monument was conceived by Igor Chirikov, director of the Centre of Sociology of Higher Education, who had been sitting on the concrete block in the institute's grounds for years. \"Peer reviewing is a matter of love and hate,\" Chirikov said, emphasizing the importance of peer review in ensuring the quality of research. He wanted to highlight the impact of reviewers on research, but with a touch of irony to motivate researchers who often receive negative feedback. The crowdfunding campaign poked fun at the academic process with satirical comments from anonymous reviewers, such as \"I would suggest a second feasibility study...and you should also assess viewer reactions over a 5-year period.\" The proposal also joked that the monument could become a site of academic pilgrimage, where researchers would visit to touch the \"Accept\" side and hope for the gods of peer review to smile upon them. Of course, some unsuccessful researchers might choose to curse the monument instead, and that's their prerogative. At the unveiling event, attendees were invited to wear masks as a tribute to the anonymous aspect of peer review. \"We are currently navigating a transformative period, where science is increasingly global.

In a statement to Senate estimates, Guthrie confirmed that the job losses, which she had previously signaled in March, were underway. This latest round of redundancies will affect senior and middle management roles based in Sydney. Guthrie acknowledged that redundancies are regrettable but necessary to fund the ABC's work. In March, she had announced that 150 to 200 positions would be made redundant, including efficiency initiatives in television and news that resulted in a reduction of approximately 70 employees. The ABC has begun consulting with affected employees in some divisions, with more consultations set to take place over the next few days. Guthrie also defended the ABC's digital presence, responding to criticism from Fairfax Media's CEO Greg Hywood. She emphasized that the public expects the ABC to make its full range of content, including high-quality journalism, available on all platforms, including digital. Guthrie rejected the notion that the ABC should be used as a scapegoat for the challenges facing the digital media landscape. Hywood had accused the ABC of stealing Fairfax traffic by aggressively expanding into digital news and then paying Google to prioritize ABC websites in search engine results. Guthrie countered that the ABC is simply providing high-quality content to its audience, which puts pressure on commercial media to adapt to the changing media landscape. ABC staff are bracing for job cuts on Thursday, when they will meet with management to discuss the latest round of redundancies. The cuts are expected to particularly affect Radio National. In the first round of job cuts in March, up to 85 technical staff on television programs, including 7.30 and Foreign Correspondent, were made redundant, despite Guthrie's characterization of the cuts as streamlining middle management. \"In the midst of significant upheaval in the media industry, the ABC's role in informing, educating, and entertaining the nation is more crucial than ever,\" said Guthrie. \"A thriving, productive, and effective ABC is essential, and it's more important than ever that we prioritize our responsibilities.\" As a public broadcaster, the ABC operates within a fixed budget, and the ABC Act requires us to be both efficient and effective in carrying out our duties. Guthrie referred to the planned cuts as \"eliminating duplication in certain content areas.\" We will allocate an additional $2.9 million to arts, science, and education, and an extra $2 million to new programming as part of a dedicated cross-platform education strategy. \"We are simplifying our organizational structure and reducing management layers, and the resulting savings will be invested in new initiatives that bring Australian stories to our audience,\" Guthrie explained. \"Every dollar we save will be used to create engaging, audience-facing content that showcases Australia's unique stories.\" ",

They offer a vital alternative to banks, payday lenders, and loan sharks. retailCURe, which is open to anyone aged 16 or over who works in retail or a support industry, aims to provide a solution for the 4.5 million people in this sector who are often on low pay. The retail sector is one of the UK's largest employers, but it also has a high number of part-time workers, and salaries in the sector have been declining. retailCURe is run by the retail industry for the retail industry, and other high street names supporting it include Iceland, New Look, and Pets at Home, with more expected to join. Members will have access to loans from £500 to £5,000 at interest rates ranging from 9.9% to 26.8% APR, with two-thirds of loans issued so far having an interest rate of less than 10% APR. In contrast, many payday lenders charge over 1,000% APR. The credit union is also offering \"market-beating\" rates up to 3% on its savings accounts. \"To become a member of retailCURe, you'll need to open a simple easy access account with a minimum deposit of £1 and commit to regular savings. Once you've done this, you'll be eligible to apply for a loan or additional savings accounts. Additionally, some employers will offer the option for employees to have their wages automatically deposited into their credit union account.\" ",

The company has reached an agreement with trade unions to safeguard the work of nearly a third of its 22,300-strong UK workforce for the next five years, as it prepares to double its engine production. Rolls-Royce has scrapped plans to close a precision machining facility in Derby, saving 150 jobs that were at risk, and will create 200 new positions by building a new testing facility for jet engines. The £150 million investment includes £90 million for the construction of a new testbed in Derby, Rolls-Royce's sixth in the city, where it will test its new range of UltraFan engines, which are designed to be more fuel-efficient than previous models. The testbed will also be used to test the Trent 900, Trent 1000, and Trent XWB engines, which power commercial jets such as the Airbus A380, Boeing's Dreamliner, and the Airbus A350. The overall plan also includes investment in Rolls-Royce's large engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility, as well as its sites in Hucknall and Annesley, Nottinghamshire. Unite, the trade union, has hailed the plan as a success, saying it \"effectively secures the manufacturing base of Rolls-Royce in the UK for the next 20 years, along with 7,000 high-quality jobs.\" Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, said: \"This is great news for our world-beating workforce making world-class engines and a testament to the hard work of our shop stewards and members. It's a good day for British manufacturing, but we must not let it be undone by a botched Brexit. The government must now play its part by pursuing a 'jobs first' Brexit and securing tariff-free access to the single market and customs union. Failure to do so risks future investment and decent high-quality manufacturing jobs.\" \"Rolls-Royce's decision to safeguard UK jobs arrives just four months after the company reported a historic £4.6 billion pre-tax loss, largely attributed to the effects of Brexit on the pound and the costs associated with settling corruption allegations. Business Secretary Greg Clark emphasized that the investment underscores the UK's vital role in the global aerospace industry. He also noted that the UK and Rolls-Royce are renowned worldwide for their innovative engineering expertise.\" ",

Scientists spent seven years tracking the elusive Cape York palm cockatoos in the unspoiled wilderness of northern Queensland, finally capturing the extraordinary behavior on camera. The footage shows 18 male cockatoos delivering over 130 drum solos, each with its own unique pattern and flair. Most of these performances took place in front of females, with the males adding embellishments such as calls, blushing, and raised feathers to win them over. Researchers from the Australian National University observed the birds preparing their drumming tools and then banging out sequences of 27 to 92 beats, showcasing their impressive rhythmic skills. The birds' drumming styles varied greatly, ranging from rapid-fire strikes to more laid-back, repetitive beats. According to the study published in Science Advances, the cockatoos' drumming behavior shares key elements with human instrumental music, including the manufacture of sound tools, consistent performance contexts, and individual styles. The researchers liken the birds to solo artists or drummers in rock bands, who have an internal sense of rhythm and generate the motor pattern to create the beat. This behavior is all the more remarkable, as tool manufacture is rare in the animal kingdom and is usually linked to foraging for food.  ",

As he stood by a tree laden with pods, a favorite snack of parrots, he waited patiently for the birds to arrive. His persistence paid off when a group of half a dozen parrots flew in, their striking red fronts and blue wing tips unlike any species he had previously encountered in the area. The parrots' distinctive calls, unlike any on record, left Gómez Garza in awe. \"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" he exclaimed. \"The different noise belonged to a different parrot.\" As an ornithologist and veterinarian at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Monterrey, Mexico, Gómez Garza was thrilled to have discovered a new species of parrot. An international team of scientists has now published research on the newly discovered blue-winged Amazon parrot, or Amazona gomezgarzai, in honor of its discoverer. Measuring 25cm in height, this parrot boasts a loud, short, and repetitive call reminiscent of the soundtrack to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of its calls eerily imitates that of a hawk, a natural predator of parrots. Scientists speculate that this mimicry may serve as a deterrent, scaring other birds away and leaving more seeds, fruit, and flowers for the parrots to feast on. After obtaining permission from the Mexican authorities, Gómez Garza captured a male and female parrot for further study, collaborating with Tony Silva at the University of Florida and Pawel Mackiewicz at the University of Wroclaw. DNA tests conducted on the parrots, described in the journal PeerJ, revealed that this new species evolved from the white-fronted parrots (Amazona albifrons) native to the region approximately 120,000 years ago. Due to the parrots' rarity, the tests were performed without causing them harm. \"In recent history, I believe this is the first time a scientific description has been completed without the species being threatened with extinction,\" said Gómez Garza. He noted that conservation plans are already underway to protect the species. Mackiewicz estimated that there are likely fewer than 100 blue-winged Amazon parrots remaining, making conservation efforts a top priority. According to Gómez Garza, parrots worldwide are vulnerable to habitat destruction. While the international illegal trade of parrots has decreased in recent years, it still persists locally for certain species. Gómez Garza emphasized that raising awareness will be crucial in saving wild parrots globally.\" ",

Ten was forced to halt trading and enter voluntary administration last month after financial backers Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon failed to guarantee a $250m loan. At a creditors' meeting in Sydney on Monday, Ten's administrators announced that leading shareholders Gordon and Murdoch, who now jointly own 22.5% of the network, along with James Packer, have agreed to provide the necessary funds to keep Ten operational. According to partner Mark Korda, the network has sufficient cash resources for now, but the shareholder guarantors will establish a financing facility by the end of the week to ensure Ten's continued operation. Ten reported a significant half-year loss of $232m in April and warned that its future as a going concern was uncertain if it couldn't secure another loan. The first creditors' meeting since Ten's voluntary administration on June 13 took place on Monday, and a 14-member creditors' committee was appointed to oversee the network's administration. The committee includes representatives from various stakeholders, including Ten employees, Cricket Australia, CBS, Fox, Endemol Shine, Fremantle Media, the Commonwealth Bank, and investment vehicles Birketu and Illyria. Judith Fox, CEO of the Australian Shareholders' Association, who was excluded from the meeting, expressed a preference for the network to be re-listed, the business to be salvaged, and shareholders' stakes to continue. The Australian Financial Review has reported that the Commonwealth Bank, a major creditor, may appoint a receiver as early as this week, but Korda downplayed the threat, saying a receivership would not impact Ten's long-term viability. \"David Gordon, the chairman of Ten, has received an apology from the Australian newspaper after it published an incorrect report on Monday claiming he sold most of his shares before the company went into voluntary administration.

In a blog post, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google Cloud, confirmed that G Suite's Gmail is not used for ads personalization, and that this change will also apply to the company's free consumer Gmail service.

The bank's total mortgage lending decreased by £1 billion to £11.6 billion in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, with buy-to-let lending experiencing a significant decline. Net lending, which takes into account customers who remortgaged away from Santander, fell by £200 million over the half year. Net consumer finance lending, which includes car loans and credit cards, dropped to £97 million from £266 million, partly due to a decrease in new car registrations. Santander UK Chief Executive Nathan Bostock attributed the decline to intense competition driving down interest rates to historically low levels and accused competitors of offering better rates on car loans and credit cards than mortgage customers. However, Bostock emphasized that the risks associated with car loans should be considered in a broader context, noting that the mortgage market is significantly larger than the unsecured lending market. He also pointed out that non-performing loans made up only 0.48% of the unsecured book of lending, and mortgage arrears remained very low. Bostock ruled out further rate cuts for the popular 123 account, which had its interest rate halved in November last year. The account, which has 3.6 million customers in the UK, was paying 3% interest on balances up to £20,000 before the rate was reduced to 1.5%. Despite slashing interest payouts on the 123 account, Santander's loyal retail customer base continued to grow, reaching 3.9 million customers. The average mortgage lent by Santander remained steady at £198,000, with the average in London and the south-east at £263,000 and in the rest of the country at £146,000. \"The typical buyer was found to be taking out a loan equivalent to 3.18 times their income, a slight increase from the 3.16 times seen in December 2016.

Thomas Cook, a tour operator, reports a surge in demand for Turkish holidays due to their affordability. According to Peter Fankhauser, the company's CEO, Turkey is an attractive destination at present, despite Germany's travel warning. Last year, Turkey's failed military coup led to a decline in visitors, prompting Thomas Cook to offer free cancellations to customers with existing bookings. However, the company has seen an 11% increase in summer bookings this year. Greece is also experiencing a resurgence in popularity, with bookings rising by 22%. Thomas Cook plans to restart holidays in Tunisia, following Britain's revised travel advice after a 2015 militant attack. The company's business has been impacted by security concerns in the Middle East and North Africa, leading to an increase in bookings to the western Mediterranean. However, this year has seen a rebound in traffic to these markets, while Spain has faced challenges. Overcapacity in Spain is putting pressure on tour operators' profit margins, and Thomas Cook is experiencing intense competition, which is affecting prices.

The Financial Conduct Authority estimates that the new regime will cost firms £550 million, with ongoing costs of up to £190 million. Initially, it was expected that the additional firms would be covered by the senior managers and certification regime (SMCR) from 2018, but the FCA's consultation document does not confirm this timeline. The SMCR, which came into effect for almost 900 banks and building societies in March 2016, was designed to address the lack of accountability among bank executives in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Under the regime, top managers must clearly outline their responsibilities and certify that their key staff are suitable for their roles. This certification must now occur annually, whereas previously, the FCA only approved individuals once, unless they changed roles. The FCA's consultation paper outlines five \"conduct\" rules for firms: act with integrity; act with due care, skill, and diligence; be open and cooperative with regulators; prioritize customer interests and treat them fairly; and maintain proper standards of market conduct. Two years ago, the Treasury called for the expansion of the regime, and also dropped a plan to reverse the burden of proof for managers, which would have required them to demonstrate they had acted correctly if wrongdoing occurred under their watch. Marian Bloodworth, an employment partner at law firm Kemp Little, notes that the change will also mean the end of the FCA register for most financial services employees, which has been a concern for those already in the regime, as it means there is no publicly available list of advisers for customers to review. The FCA warns that some cost increases will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, while senior managers may demand larger pay packages.  ",

This would provide customers with at-a-glance information about the security of their internet-ready equipment, similar to the energy efficiency ratings currently required for appliances like fridges and TVs. As the national policing lead for crime operations, Barton is advocating for this change as part of efforts to protect households from fraudsters and hackers in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the number of connected devices expected to surge to 21 billion worldwide by 2020, analysts are warning of a growing security threat. A recent report highlighted the risk of cyber attacks on devices like smartphones, watches, and televisions, with some even vulnerable to hacking. Barton emphasized that the security of IoT devices is a significant concern, stating, \"It's not just about what yoghurts you're eating; it's about the back door into your network.\" He believes that the industry should take responsibility for developing a suitable rating system for internet security, rather than waiting for a security breach to occur. Barton questioned why security ratings are not currently displayed alongside energy efficiency ratings, asking, \"Where are the security ratings? You've got a situation where we don't know what the security is like in the devices we're buying in the IoT. It's just not reported.\" One of the challenges in developing a straightforward rating system for internet security is that a device's vulnerability to cyber attacks can evolve over time as new software vulnerabilities are discovered and sophisticated hacking techniques emerge. Like computers and smartphones, most internet-connected devices are only as secure as their most recent software update, which patches flaws that could be exploited by hackers. However, Barton cautioned that we are still in the early stages of the internet of things, making it easier to create such devices today than it will be in the future when there will be tens of millions of products. He emphasized the importance of taking proactive measures to address the issue, stating, \"I don't want to look back and be accused of not raising the alarm to encourage greater action.\" ",

According to research from Citizens Advice, nearly one in five people struggling with debt have had their credit card limit increased without their request. The charity is urging the Financial Conduct Authority to ban the practice, which has raised concerns about a surge in lending. Unsecured lending has reached levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, prompting warnings from the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn, threatening financial stability.\n\nCitizens Advice CEO Gillian Guy said that irresponsible lending practices are exacerbating debt problems, such as offering more credit to people who already have thousands of pounds in unpaid debt. She emphasized that lenders must act responsibly and direct struggling borrowers towards free and independent advice and support, rather than offering them more credit.\n\nThe report found that people with long-term outstanding balances are more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users experiencing an increase in their limit over the past year without requesting it, compared to 12% of all credit card holders. Credit card debtors are also more likely to fall into long-term debt and struggle to pay off their debt compared to those with personal loans.\n\nOne pensioner who sought help from Citizens Advice was repeatedly contacted by firms offering more credit cards despite being unable to afford minimum repayments on her existing debts. She used these credit cards to pay essential bills and ended up with 21 credit cards and debts totaling £70,000.\n\nCitizens Advice has helped 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems in the past year. According to the Bank of England, total consumer debt grew by 10% in the year to June, reaching almost £201 billion. The outstanding debt has not reached such levels since December 2008, with £68.5 billion, or over a third of the current total, attributed to credit card debt. The rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance, and personal loans prompted the Bank of England to require banks to bolster their financial standing earlier this year. The Financial Conduct Authority is developing new regulations to safeguard consumers from debt spirals, with a focus on curbing the high costs of overdrafts and scrutinizing the booming car loan market. The regulator is planning to compel companies to reach out to customers struggling with persistent debt issues after 18 months, asking if they can accelerate their repayment plans. Those who continue to struggle would then be placed on a repayment plan. The watchdog estimates that 3.3 million people have become trapped in a persistent credit card debt cycle. ",

The Office for National Statistics, which moved from London to Newport, saw a 90% reduction in its London-based staff.

The agreement was reached with BHS's liquidators, FRP Advisory, and will drop legal action filed against Green's company. According to FRP, the liquidators of SHB Realisations, formerly BHS, have reached an agreement with Arcadia Group regarding several matters, including the floating charge dated April 14, 2015. As part of the agreement, over £30 million was released from reserves held in relation to Arcadia's secured claim and will be used to pay BHS unsecured creditors. The floating charge will also be released. The settlement avoids a lengthy legal battle between Green and BHS's liquidators. In a separate agreement, Green has agreed to pay £363 million to rescue the BHS pension scheme, avoiding another legal battle with the pension regulator. Dominic Chappell, who led the consortium that acquired BHS for £1 in 2015, is to be prosecuted by the pensions watchdog for failing to provide information for an investigation into the sale. Chappell's company, Retail Acquisitions, acquired BHS and later collapsed, resulting in the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of £571 million. The Pensions Regulator is prosecuting Chappell for failing to comply with three notices for information issued under section 72 of the Pensions Act 2004. Failure to provide such information without a reasonable excuse is a criminal offence that can result in a fine. In other news, Green has also announced a deal to buy four franchise-run Topshop stores in Australia, which collapsed into administration in May.  ",

This ambitious strategy was unveiled on Thursday in the final summer policy paper published by the Department for Exiting the European Union, ahead of the next round of talks in Brussels on Monday. The government argues that its unique position as a leading player in electronic commerce justifies special treatment from the EU in setting future standards. The regulation of online data has become a contentious issue globally, as technology companies and national security agencies face criticism for compromising personal privacy. Since the Edward Snowden revelations and subsequent high-profile privacy disputes with companies like Google, tensions between the EU and US have been particularly strained. The UK paper proposes that Britain be exempt from the usual European adequacy tests applied to third-party countries handling EU citizens' data and instead enter into a permanent harmonization agreement to ensure stability for companies. According to the policy paper, the government believes it would be in the interest of both the UK and EU to recognize each other's data protection frameworks as a basis for continued free data flows between the EU and UK from the point of exit until new arrangements take effect. The government is unwilling to disclose how it would maintain mutual recognition once standards diverge, but it hopes to establish a shared policy process where both sides agree on future changes. This concession is likely to be fiercely resisted by Brussels negotiators, who view it as an attempt to limit their autonomy to set EU rules. However, this principle could serve as a clue to the UK's approach in other areas of business regulation, such as financial services, where the City also seeks a lasting mutual recognition deal. \"The government declined to comment on Thursday on how a potential arrangement with the EU would address the issue of differing standards with the US, where the industry is largely based. However, it did note that current EU-US regulatory harmonization is limited, which could become a future advantage for the UK if it can negotiate separate deals simultaneously.\" ",

As a sound engineer at Iraqi TV and radio, Saad played a crucial role in establishing reputable recording studios in Baghdad. From 1960, he dedicated himself to teaching music at the Institute of Hope, a school for children with sensory impairments, where he developed innovative methods to reach his students. One of his most cherished projects was the music and ballet school he helped establish in Baghdad in 1968, where he served as a key staff member and played a significant role in directing the institution. Many of its students still fondly remember him, and his three children and four nieces and nephews are proud graduates of the school. Born in Baghdad, Saad was the fourth of six children to Mahmood Jasim Hikmat and Kadria Raoof Al-Attar, who worked for the Iraqi government. From a young age, Saad demonstrated a natural talent for music and the accordion, which his father encouraged. After completing his high school education, Saad was admitted to the Institute of Fine Arts (later the Academy of Fine Arts) in Baghdad in 1952, where he studied music with both Western and Iraqi teachers. He graduated as a skilled pianist, accordion player, and piano tuner, and further honed his craft through travels to Italy, Greece, Poland, and the former USSR. Saad had a deep appreciation for jazz, and his encounter with Duke Ellington in the 1960s was a highlight of his career. The Duke was impressed by Saad's talent, and his compositions, which included songs, school marches, and a ballet, blended elements of Western music. While Saad was not one for public performances, he was always willing to lend his skills to a good cause, such as playing Bach to accompany a church choir in Baghdad at the request of a priest. In 2003, Saad relocated to Amman, Jordan, where he continued to share his passion for music. \"He spent his time in that place teaching music privately and also volunteered to teach at the Institute of Light, an organization that supports visually impaired children. He leaves behind his wife, Rasmiya Mohammad Ali, a dedicated social worker whom he married in 1968, as well as their three children, Basheer, Omar, and Fatima.\" ",

Building on the concept of a German \"blessing bot\", Pepper's updated software allows it to chant sutras in a robotic voice while tapping a drum, providing a more affordable alternative to a human priest for funeral services. At a recent funeral industry fair in Tokyo, Nissei Eco showcased Pepper, a plastic molding maker, which is looking to disrupt the market by offering its services for just £350 per funeral, significantly cheaper than the average cost of £20,000 in Japan. With Japan's aging and shrinking population, many Buddhist priests are struggling to make ends meet, prompting some to seek part-time work outside their temple duties. According to Michio Inamura, Nissei's executive adviser, Pepper could fill the gap when a human priest is unavailable. Funeral organizers can even customize Pepper's appearance by dressing it in a Buddhist monk's robe and live-stream the ceremony for those who cannot attend in person. Buddhist priest Tetsugi Matsuo, who attended the expo, expressed interest in seeing if Pepper could convey the \"heart\" aspect of religion, which he believes is the foundation of faith. While Pepper has not yet been hired for a funeral, it seems likely that robots will eventually play a role in the funeral industry, given their increasing presence in various aspects of life.  ",

While the US edition of the WSJ will still be available in select cities at a later date, the paper plans to focus on encouraging customers in Asia and Europe to read its digital edition. The decision to discontinue the foreign editions was made due to the growth of digital subscriptions, which have increased by 322,000 in the most recent quarter, reaching a total of 1.27 million.

Palmer & Harvey, which was founded in 1925 and is owned by current and former employees, is struggling to stay afloat and is expected to receive funding from Imperial and Japan Tobacco International to keep its operations running while it negotiates a rescue deal with Carlyle, a private equity firm. The deal is expected to include an extension of Tesco's three-year distribution contract with Palmer & Harvey, which accounts for around 40% of the wholesaler's revenues.

The growth rate of personal bank deposits has slowed to its lowest annual rate since the financial crisis, with a mere 2.2% increase in August, the weakest month since May 2009. This decline is partly attributed to £1 billion being withdrawn from cash ISA accounts, as tax changes allow individuals to earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free. According to UK Finance, households are saving less each month, rather than borrowing more, as the growth in personal deposits has slowed alongside a slowdown in consumer credit borrowing. Annual growth in credit card borrowing slowed to 5% in August, down from 5.3% the previous month, while personal loan and overdraft usage fell by 1.6% on an annual basis. Overall, the annual growth in consumer credit slowed from 1.9% in July to 1.5% in August. Despite a decline in consumer confidence due to rising prices and Brexit uncertainty, retail sales growth suggests that shoppers have not yet cut back on spending. Retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August, following a revised 0.6% increase in July. There had been concerns that consumers were increasingly relying on credit cards and loans to fund their spending habits. However, the falling rate of bank deposits also indicates that consumers are drawing on their savings. According to the latest ONS figures, the amount of household money available for saving has fallen to an all-time low in the first three months of this year. The amount being set aside as savings has slipped to 1.7% of disposable income, a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. A year ago, this rate was more than three times the current rate. The purchasing power of British consumers is expected to face further strain due to inflation, with the Bank of England predicting that the consumer price index (CPI) will reach a peak above 3% in October. As of August, the CPI inflation rate stood at 2.9%, driven by the increasing cost of importing fuel, clothing, and food. The Bank of England has kept interest rates unchanged this month, but warned that it may raise rates for the first time in a decade as early as November to combat rising inflation. According to Mohammad Jamei, senior economist at UK Finance, \"Some households in the UK have chosen to save less, while others have not increased their borrowing.\" ",

A report from key UK banks, law firms, and fund managers proposes a \"bespoke\" free trade deal that would allow British and EU-based financial companies to sell products and services without tariffs, taxes, or quotas in each other's markets. The agreement would include a new joint dispute resolution body, comprising judges and independent experts, to resolve any breaches. If the UK loses its \"passporting\" rights, British pensioners and EU consumers could face dire consequences, including potential difficulties in paying out personal pension or insurance contracts. To address these concerns, the International Regulatory Strategy Group, sponsored by the City of London Corporation and TheCityUK, has developed a plan for a free trade agreement. The report, launched in Brussels by ISRG council chair Mark Hoban, a former City minister, suggests that setting up the free trade area would be straightforward, given the similarity of EU and UK regulatory regimes. Hoban emphasized that the plan is ambitious but would benefit the entire continent. He warned that if London loses its status as the world's leading financial hub, activity would likely shift to New York or Singapore, rather than within the EU, resulting in losses for businesses and families. Rachel Kent, a partner at Hogan Lovells and co-author of the report, noted that the proposed agreement mirrors the free trade area agreement between Canada and the EU, which aims to grant financial institutions reciprocal access to each other's markets in the future. According to Kent, the report's starting point is that both the EU and the UK have expressed a desire to secure future arrangements for free trade in financial services. She emphasized that an enhanced free trade agreement, as proposed in the report, is technically and legally feasible and would form a dedicated financial services chapter within a broader EU-UK agreement. The proposal includes a forum of regulators that would collaborate on a joint response to new global standards, as well as involvement in supervision and enforcement, with regular meetings. Kent highlighted that the 95-page report is the first comprehensive piece of work produced by any sector. Additionally, she suggested that the model could be applied to other highly regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals and aviation. ",

At first glance, the Giulietta is a stunning Italian car with a name that references the iconic love story of Romeo and Juliet. However, after spending a week with the car, you may find yourself seeking relationship counseling. Like many relationships, the Giulietta's charm wears off quickly.

The key fob's unlock sound is a jarring, ear-piercing beep that may be off-putting to some. While it's unusual to dismiss a car based on its security tone, the Giulietta's beep is particularly unpleasant. As you enter the car, you're met with a mid-size hatchback with a decent-sized boot, but the seats feel cramped and lack legroom for passengers in the back. The materials used throughout the car's interior are also lacking, with unyielding plastics that don't provide a pleasant tactile experience. The driver's touch points – the door handle, steering wheel, and gear stick – are particularly important, but they fail to impress. The instrument panel's tiny text is another disappointment, making it difficult to read. When you start the engine, it sounds promising, but the pedals' unusual arrangement is a strange problem to contend with. I'm torn between thinking the pedals are too high or too close together. As someone with size-10 feet, I've developed a peculiar habit on each drive: I have to remove my right shoe because I'm prone to accidentally hitting the brake and accelerating simultaneously. While this might be manageable for a rally driver, it's unsettling for a mere mortal like myself. Once you get past the initial jitters, the drive becomes exhilarating and rewarding. The Giulietta boasts a robust lineup of turbocharged petrol engines, as well as impressively efficient MultiJet turbodiesels. Opt for the 1.6-litre diesel, and you'll enjoy up to 74.3mpg while emitting a mere 99g/km of CO2. On the open road, the Giulietta truly shines – it's quiet, responsive, and comfortable.

Conceived by Berk Ilhan, the idea behind this product is rooted in the facial feedback hypothesis, which suggests that even fake smiling can boost mood and improve immune function. However, the evidence supporting this claim is shaky at best. What's more, it's possible to smile in front of a regular mirror without any special technology. The product features a screen with a camera that uses facial recognition to detect a smile, which then turns the screen reflective. Ilhan, the creator, has stated that he developed the mirror while studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York, after consulting with oncologists and cancer patients. One patient reportedly found it difficult to confront their illness, prompting Ilhan to take a rather literal approach.

Facebook, which has 32 million users in the UK, has already provided evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election to several US Senate committees. In the US, Facebook disclosed last month that an influence operation believed to be based in Russia spent $100,000 on adverts promoting divisive political and social messages over a two-year period. In a letter to Zuckerberg, Collins stated that the committee is investigating the phenomenon of fake news and its impact on political discourse. He requested that Facebook provide details about adverts and pages paid for or set up by Russian-linked accounts, including the amount spent and the number of views. The committee has called for more evidence by November 7th and has asked Facebook to take a strong stance on fake news, similar to its approach to child abuse images and copyright privacy. Facebook announced that it had updated its software in January to prevent false news from appearing in its \"trending topics\" section. The new algorithm takes into consideration not only the number of users sharing a topic but also the number of reputable news organizations publishing about it, as it is more likely to reflect real-world events being covered by multiple news outlets. In April, a pilot program was launched to help users identify fake news, but it only ran for three days. Despite these efforts, Facebook's attempts to combat fake news in the UK are trailing behind those in Germany, France, and the Netherlands, where the company is collaborating with established media outlets to flag disputed stories in users' newsfeeds. According to Collins, who spoke to the Guardian in April, he is not convinced that the company has sufficient fact-checkers to thoroughly scrutinize disputed content. ",

The former CEO of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) had initially requested to give evidence in private, and this decision was made public after five media organizations, including the Guardian, applied to the court to learn more about the \"special arrangements\" in place for his testimony. Mr. Justice Norris made his ruling after hearing the application from the media organizations, which came on the fourth day of the case. The case, brought by approximately 6,000 Lloyds investors, seeks £600 million in compensation, claiming that they were not informed about loans made to HBOS when they voted to approve the takeover in November 2008. The claim is against Lloyds and five of its former directors, including Sir Victor Blank and Eric Daniels, who are contesting the claim. Lloyds announced the HBOS deal in September 2008, just after Lehman Brothers collapsed, marking the beginning of the financial crisis. The UK government eventually took a 43% stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group but has since sold its remaining shares. In his ruling, Mr. Justice Norris emphasized that he is not conducting a public inquiry into the events of 2008. The case is expected to run for 14 weeks, with Sants scheduled to testify in December. The FSA has since been replaced by the Financial Conduct Authority. Blank and Daniels are set to testify in the coming weeks, along with three other former directors named in the case: Tim Tookey, Helen Weir, and Truett Tate.  ",

The circular sets the stage for a shareholders' meeting on December 19, demanded by activist investor TCI, which seeks to oust the company's chairman, Donald Brydon, over his handling of Rolet's departure. TCI, the Children's Investment Fund Management, had previously opposed Rolet's departure, but dropped its objections after the LSE announced that Rolet would leave immediately, a year earlier than planned. The circular urges shareholders to support Brydon, stating that non-executive directors unanimously agreed in October to implement a \"smooth\" succession plan for Rolet. It notes that shareholders had been asking about Rolet's future plans, as he had offered to step down if the merger with Deutsche Börse had gone ahead. The alliance was blocked by the European Commission in March. The exchange also revealed that \"aspects of Xavier Rolet's operating style\" were considered by the board when developing the succession plan, but did not provide further details. TCI had initially called for Rolet to remain CEO until 2021, but the circular suggests that there was uncertainty about his willingness to stay, which had negatively impacted his relationship with the board. The LSE had been urging TCI to reconsider its call for a shareholder meeting after bringing forward Rolet's departure date and announcing that Brydon would not stand for re-election at the 2019 AGM. The row prompted an intervention by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, whose comments appear to have accelerated Rolet's departure.  ",

Throughout his life's work, he dedicated himself to establishing pioneering institutions that championed the intelligent and innovative application of science and technology to create a more sustainable and equitable world. His impact extended globally, and his kindness and enthusiasm inspired a vast network of colleagues and friends. Born in Harden, West Yorkshire, to Evelyn (nee Brooke) and Herbert Oldham, Geoff was the son of a NatWest bank manager. He attended Bingley grammar school and studied geology at the University of Reading, later being accepted for further studies at both Cambridge and Toronto universities. Following his wedding to Brenda Raven in September 1951, they embarked on a journey to Canada just 10 days later. Geoff earned his PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto and worked in oil exploration, focusing on South America. However, he soon became disillusioned with the work and began to think about how he could use his skills to make a more meaningful difference. This led to a career change, during which he conducted research on science and technology in China and other Asian countries. As deputy director of SPRU from 1966 and later as its director from 1982 to 1992, Geoff drove policy research on science and technology in developing countries. He challenged the prevailing approach, which relied heavily on transferring technology and science from wealthy countries, and instead advocated for a greater emphasis on building the capacity of developing countries to create their own. This was a revolutionary idea at the time. Geoff also played a key role in establishing the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC) in 1970, which has been hailed as the \"jewel in the crown of Canadian aid.\" He then led the science and technology policy program at IDRC, fostering policy research across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In recognition of his contributions to science, Geoff was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1990. After leaving his position as director of SPRU, Geoff remained actively engaged in various advisory roles, including high-level positions with the United Nations, the IDRC in Canada, and with ministers of science and technology in China. He also became a dedicated champion for addressing gender disparities in science and technology, collaborating with international initiatives such as GenderInSITE. Throughout his career, Geoff played a significant role in shaping the field of science and technology policy research, leaving a lasting legacy on the organizations that fund, conduct, and utilize it. Geoff is survived by his loving wife Brenda, their children Keith and Janice, and their 10 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Unfortunately, two of his sons, David and Jon, preceded him in passing. ",

The university has made significant contributions to the local community and economy.

However, it is unclear whether Breakwell has personally contributed to these achievements or if they are the result of the hard work and dedication of overstretched academic staff. These staff have faced an eight-year pay freeze, pension cuts, constant threats of redundancy, and ever-increasing workloads and targets, which have led to widespread stress, demoralization, and fear. \"In the context of tax avoidance scandals, university vice-chancellors are not overpaid. The shift of power from academics to administrators in teaching and research has led to the emergence of a new type of academic manager who excels at navigating the complex and constantly changing bureaucratic systems used to assess teaching and research. These managers have become similar to tax accountants, who are often well-compensated for their expertise. If tax accountants are paid large sums for their efforts, it would be unfair to pay university administrators, including vice-chancellors, any less.

The schools watchdog, Ofsted, has reported a significant decline in inspection outcomes for smaller, fee-paying schools, particularly faith schools. Latest figures show that 49% of private faith schools inspected by Ofsted were judged to be less than good at their most recent inspection, while 26% were deemed inadequate. This information was released as part of Ofsted's report on the inspections of non-association independent schools, which are smaller, fee-paying schools not affiliated with the Independent Schools Council. There are approximately 1,000 such schools. As of the end of August, 68% of these schools were judged to be good or outstanding at their most recent inspection, a four percentage point decline from the previous year. While independent special schools, which make up 40% of the group, have shown improvement, the decline in outcomes for other independent schools, including faith schools, is described as \"stark\", with the proportion judged good or outstanding decreasing from 79% in 2014 to 60%. According to Ofsted, part of the reason for the decline is the introduction of new standards three years ago that focus on leadership and fundamental British values. Since the Trojan horse affair in Birmingham in 2014, all schools have been required to teach and reflect British values. The Ofsted report, published on Thursday, stated that the new standards on fundamental British values assess requirements related to written policies on the curriculum, the quality of teaching, and the spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development of pupils. Notably, a higher proportion of weaker faith schools are failing to meet these requirements compared to schools with no faith. Specifically, 81 out of 139 independent Muslim schools were found to be less than good at their most recent inspection, while 39 were deemed inadequate. According to the report, a significant proportion of Christian schools received a rating of less than good, with over half of the 58 Jewish schools inspected deemed to be either \"requires improvement\" or inadequate. The decline in ratings was also attributed to Ofsted's takeover of inspections at faith schools, which led to a more substantial drop in the number of schools judged to be good or better than expected. Ofsted is concerned that struggling schools are taking too long to improve and has expressed particular worries about safeguarding, which was found to be ineffective in 17% of inspected schools. In contrast, independent special schools are making notable progress, with 78% of them rated good or outstanding, up from 74% in 2014. Only 9% of these schools were judged inadequate, compared to 19% of other independent schools. ",

National Grid confirmed that a shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a Russian field targeted by US sanctions arrived at storage facilities in Kent on Thursday night. Russian media touted the delivery as a way to \"keep Britons from freezing this winter,\" while the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted, \"Feeling cold? Help is on the way.\" However, industry experts believe the UK is likely to be a stopover for the gas, which could fetch a higher price in Asia. Ed Cox, editor of global LNG at ICIS, cautioned against assuming Russian gas will supply the UK, noting that another empty LNG vessel is waiting outside the Isle of Grain to pick up the cargo. \"The prices are much more attractive in Asia and India than they are in Europe,\" he said. Market sources told ICIS that the LNG was expected to be picked up by the other ship. A National Grid spokesperson clarified that the gas had not entered the national pipeline network that supplies homes and businesses. The Christophe de Margerie tanker arrived at the Isle of Grain on Thursday and has been offloading its gas to storage tanks before a planned departure on Friday. The icebreaker, which set off earlier this month from the Yamal LNG project in the Russian Arctic, is jointly owned by Novatek, China National Petroleum Corporation, and Total. The project is affected by US sanctions against Russian energy projects, although not directly by UK sanctions. Following the shutdown of a major North Sea oil and gas pipeline in mid-December due to a crack discovery, the UK's gas prices surged. However, Ineos, the owner of the Forties pipeline system, has since repaired the crack and expects normal operations to resume around the new year. UK gas prices have since returned to normal levels, and according to Cox, the true story behind the price hike is not Russian gas, but rather imports from Belgium. Cox noted that the UK is on track to see record-high gas pipeline imports from Belgium, potentially reaching a four-and-a-half-year high. ",

The majority of this cost is attributed to the \"repatriation tax,\" a measure designed to encourage multinational corporations to bring back the trillions of dollars they hold overseas to avoid tax. Goldman Sachs, which reported profits of $7.4 billion last year, stated that the enactment of the tax legislation will result in a reduction of around $5 billion in its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017. Two-thirds of this reduction is due to the repatriation tax, while the remaining third is attributed to the implementation of the territorial tax system and the revaluation of US deferred tax assets at lower corporate tax rates. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank explained that the tax overhaul will lead to a decrease in its earnings, primarily due to the repatriation tax and the implementation of the territorial tax system.\n\nThe recent tax overhaul in the US, approved by Congress last week, includes significant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals. The reduction in corporate tax rates, from 35% to 21%, is intended to encourage multinational corporations to repatriate their cash from overseas. According to Citigroup, US companies are estimated to hold around $2.5 trillion in capital overseas. Companies had previously maintained that they had a responsibility to their shareholders to keep this money abroad rather than bringing it back to the US and paying large tax bills.\n\nThe tax overhaul will allow Apple to repatriate its $252.3 billion foreign cash reserves without incurring a significant tax burden. Apple's large amount of untaxed profits held overseas has become a major political issue and a challenge for the company. Amgen, a drugmaker, has stated that it expects to pay between $6 billion and $6.5 billion to repatriate its cash to the US. Goldman Sachs has also reported that the rest of the $5 billion reduction in its profits will come from the cost of implementing the territorial tax system and changes that will make it more difficult for companies to deduct past losses from future tax bills. Barclays has estimated that the change to \"deferred tax assets\" will cost it around £1 billion. The tax changes were implemented under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who praised the bill as \"great for hardworking workers\". Prior to his government role, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, until 2002. ",

The Met Office forecasting service predicts that global temperatures will exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels in the period from 2018 to 2022, and may even temporarily breach the 1.5C threshold set by the Paris climate agreement in 2015. \"It's now possible that continued warming from greenhouse gases and natural variability could combine to cause a temporary spike above 1.5C in the next five years,\" said Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the Met Office.

Last year was the second hottest on record, with no significant boost from the El Niño effect. The 1.5C threshold was set as an ambitious target at the Paris climate conference because scientists believe that a world warmer than that would be prone to extreme and unpredictable climate events, leading to consequences such as droughts, habitat loss, food insecurity, and mass migration. Previously, some predictions had suggested that the threshold would not be breached until the 2040s. However, Met Office scientists emphasize that a single year of temperatures above 1.5C does not necessarily indicate a sustained period of warmer temperatures.

The college, led by the innovative Roy Macklin, focused on the character and experience of its students rather than formal qualifications, in response to the severe teacher shortage caused by Rab Butler's 1944 Education Act. During the war, Edgar worked as a shipwright in Portsmouth dockyard, but he felt a calling to primary school teaching and shared Macklin's vision of education as a guide for living, rather than just a narrowly vocational or academic pursuit. The college offered a 50-week intensive course for mature students, mostly former servicemen and women, who brought practical skills and worldly experience to the classroom. These students, who had often traveled extensively, were seen as particularly talented and effective educators by heads and school inspectors. Born in Portsmouth to a family of skilled dockyard workers, Edgar was the son of John and Lilian (known as \"Cissie\"). He attended the Northern grammar school until the war disrupted his further education. During his first teaching practice in Portsmouth in 1950, he encountered children who had never seen the sea, despite being just a mile from the water, and others who had no shoes. Edgar taught at Horndean primary school in Hampshire for many years, working late to prepare individual learning cards for each child and taking every opportunity to extend lessons into the village and surrounding countryside. He was an integral part of village life, and he and his wife, Iris (nee Lott), whom he married in 1950, were active members of the local Merchistoun Hall community association. In his free time, he studied for a diploma in education. Edgar's opposition to the 11-plus, as well as his union membership, slowed his career development, which was considered unconventional at the time. In 1970, Edgar was appointed deputy head at Wildground junior school in Hythe, near the New Forest. Upon his retirement in 1984, he led guided walks in his free time. In 2001, Edgar and his wife Iris relocated to a sheltered housing complex in Southsea, where his older sister Joyce, a former headteacher, was also living. Edgar dedicated himself to caring for both his sister and wife until their passing. Throughout his life, Edgar remained a teetotaller and non-smoker. Seventy years after leaving the dockyard, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a condition common among former employees. Just hours before his death, Edgar was working on the Guardian quick crossword puzzle. Edgar leaves behind two sons, Kevin and [your name], three grandchildren, Ann, Martin, and Sam, and a great-granddaughter, Freyja. ",

According to sources, staff will be transferred to surviving restaurants wherever possible. Prezzo is one of several high-street restaurant chains to announce restructuring plans, as companies face challenges such as rising business rates, increased staff costs, and fragile consumer confidence. The crowded casual dining sector is also experiencing stiff competition, following the influx of private-equity backed firms. Last month, Byron's creditors agreed to a CVA, and Jamie's Italian entered into a similar arrangement this month. Prezzo's directors believe the company is in better shape than either Byron or Jamie's Italian, having made a profit of £5m last year and holding £11m in cash reserves. However, the CVA will still reshape the business, cutting out less profitable restaurants to reflect declining sales. A CVA involves creditors agreeing to forgo some of what they are owed by a business rather than risk it going out of business altogether. \"When a restaurant chain is facing financial difficulties, a common solution is for landlords to accept reduced rent payments. A Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) requires the agreement of creditors who collectively hold a claim of more than 75% of the company's outstanding debt, with the remaining 25% being bound by the same terms if the CVA is approved.\" ",

According to the 2018 QS world university rankings, published on February 28, the UK is home to the world's top universities in 10 subjects, two more than last year. UK universities occupy a third of the top three positions globally, but these are concentrated in the arts and humanities. In contrast, UK universities have only topped the world's lists for engineering and technology subjects twice, whereas they have made the top three lists for arts and humanities subjects 10 times. The rankings come as the UK government is considering funding reforms that may lead to universities reducing fees for social science and humanities courses due to their lower costs, while science and technology courses may become more expensive. The results demonstrate the resilience of the UK's universities in the face of Brexit. According to Ben Sowter, research director at QS, \"While there are still concerns about the UK's relationship with EU research programs and student mobility frameworks post-Brexit, these results offer grounds for optimism.\" At least one UK institution was ranked in the world's top three in 32 of the 48 subjects. Seven UK universities lead the world rankings in 10 areas, with the University of Oxford excelling in four subjects: anatomy and physiology, archaeology, English language and literature, and geography. This makes it one of only three universities to perform best in more than one subject, along with Harvard University, which tops the rankings in 14 subjects, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which tops the rankings in 12 subjects. The University of Cambridge has been ranked as the world's best in anthropology, after failing to achieve a top spot in any subject last year. The Royal College of Art has been recognized as the world leader in art and design, with the UCL Institute of Education ranked first in education. The University of Sussex has taken the top spot in development studies for the second time, outperforming Harvard University. Meanwhile, Loughborough University leads the way in sports-related subjects, and the University of Sheffield excels in library and information management. The University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford are notable for having the most top 10 departments, with 37 and 35 subjects respectively.

Meanwhile, official data released earlier this month showed that inflation remained high at 3% in January, resulting in savers losing money in real terms. This may help explain the significant decline in popularity of cash ISAs, with government data revealing a £20 billion drop in investments over the past 12 months. However, interest rates appear to be on the rise. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney recently informed MPs that there will likely be \"more than three rate increases\" in the coming years. Lloyds, on the other hand, predicts a gentle increase in the official interest rate, reaching 1.25% by 2020 (currently 0.5%). To secure the best rates, savers must lock their money away for a fixed period. Charter Savings Bank is offering a table-topping 2.25% interest rate on its five-year fixed-rate ISA, up from 2.11%. The bank has also increased its one-year and two-year fixed-rate ISA rates to 1.46% and 1.67%, respectively. Virgin Money is offering 1.66% on its two-year fixed-rate ISA. Another reason why cash ISAs may be out of favor is that some individuals now view them as unnecessary. Since April 2016, the first £1,000 in interest earned on savings is tax-free for basic-rate taxpayers, and £500 for those on the higher rate. This is known as the personal savings allowance, which means most people no longer pay tax on savings interest. The only strong argument in favor of cash ISAs is that the money will remain tax-free indefinitely. Alternatively, shares-based ISAs offer a vast range of options. Index trackers, which aim to match the gains and losses of indices such as the FTSE 100, can be a cost-effective way to access the stock market, with fund managers like Vanguard, Legal & General, and Fidelity offering low fees, often below 0.1% per year, and in some cases as low as 0.06%.

Over the past four months, emergency dispatchers have received approximately 1,600 accidental calls from the centre, with no one on the other end. According to police dispatcher Jamie Hudson, these calls have been coming from Apple and are taking up valuable seconds away from real emergencies. \"We're able to quickly identify the location of the call, so when we receive one from Apple, the address will pop up with their location,\" Hudson explained. The refurbishment centre handles Apple devices, including iPhones and Apple Watches, which recently gained 4G connectivity in some models, allowing them to make emergency calls without requiring a phone or internet connection. Dispatchers have reported hearing people in the background discussing Apple devices, maintenance, and repairs, but it's unclear how the calls are being triggered. Both the iPhone and Apple Watch can make emergency calls without a SIM card or phone contract. The calls began shortly after the release of iOS 11 in September, which introduced an \"Emergency SOS\" feature that can automatically call emergency services and contacts through a series of gestures. Apple devices can trigger the emergency call feature in different ways, such as rapidly pressing the power button five times on older iPhones or pressing and holding the power button and volume button on iPhone 8 and X models. On the Apple Watch, pressing and holding the power button is enough to trigger the emergency call. In a statement, Apple said it is aware of the 911 calls originating from its Elk Grove repair and refurbishment facility and is working with local law enforcement to investigate the cause and prevent future incidents. Ottawa County dispatchers reportedly contacted local news station WNEM to express frustration over the fact that Apple Watch users were making 10 accidental calls per week. Meanwhile, Tolland County issued a warning to smartwatch owners after noticing a surge in unintentional wrist-dials. Additionally, some Apple HomePod users have been left annoyed by the device's tendency to leave unsightly marks on their furniture, with some even joking that they don't want to be told to \"oil my wood\" in response to the issue.

        "Text": "The UK Treasury is considering a new tax on digital companies like Facebook and Google, as it pushes for a global agreement on a fairer system for taxing online businesses. Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to announce the results of a consultation on updating the tax system to reflect the nature of digital businesses in next month's spring statement. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride emphasized the need for digital companies to pay \"fair\" levels of tax, suggesting a system where tax is levied based on where companies earn their revenue, rather than just taxing profits. Stride noted that digital companies are generating significant value in the UK through their platforms, but the current tax regime is not taxing these activities fairly. He expressed the government's desire to move towards a fairer system. Treasury sources revealed that the government's first preference is to reform the international tax system through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but if progress cannot be made at the global level, the UK would be prepared to implement unilateral changes. Several large digital companies have faced criticism in recent years for paying very little tax in the UK, often through complex avoidance schemes. Facebook, for example, paid just £5.1m in corporation tax in the UK last year, despite revenues nearly quadrupling to £842.4m due to increased advertising sales. The OECD's efforts to reform its tax policies have been hindered by a disagreement between countries. Some nations, such as the United States, want to impose higher taxes on internet companies, while others, like Luxembourg and Ireland, prioritize attracting foreign investment by maintaining low corporate tax rates. Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD's director of tax policy, recently expressed frustration, stating, \"Countries are left with a sour taste in their mouths because there's no consensus on taxing the profits of digitalized companies.\" A recent report from the Royal Society of Arts proposes increasing taxes on companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Apple as a potential means of funding a universal basic income for all citizens.

        "Text": "According to the Australia Institute's latest national energy emissions audit, the large Tesla battery in South Australia is consistently meeting the peak energy demand each day, effectively \"taking the straw off the camel's back.\" The report also shows that emissions from the National Electricity Market (NEM) decreased in January, reaching their lowest levels since 2004, largely due to the federal large-scale renewable energy target.\n\nEnergy expert Hugh Saddler analyzed the consumption and output of electricity from the Hornsdale Power Reserve, which includes the Tesla battery. He found that the battery follows a consistent pattern, charging overnight when wind generation is abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices are at their peak.\n\nWhile only 30% of the battery's 100MW capacity is devoted to trading, the rest is used to stabilize the energy system by maintaining the grid frequency at 50 Hz and 240 volts. Despite the relatively small contribution to demand smoothing, Saddler notes that the battery is still providing a valuable service, demonstrating the important role energy storage can play in the system.\n\n\"The SA battery is providing critical power at the critical moment, taking the straw off the camel's back,\" Saddler said. The battery effectively time-shifts wind generation, exploiting the difference in wholesale energy prices throughout the day. \"The world's biggest battery, in SA, is working in harmony with wind farms,\" Saddler added.\n\nPeak wind production is the cheapest way to charge the battery, and it stands ready to fill demand gaps if they emerge. The battery charges up overnight, when prices are low, and then hits the grid at the right time to keep price spikes lower than they would be otherwise.\n\nThe Australia Institute's report also found that emissions from the NEM decreased to 152.8 Mt of CO2-equivalent in January, the lowest level since 2004. \"Despite relatively flat demand, the decrease in coal-fired power generation was driven by the increased output of large-scale renewable energy projects and the decline of Australia's aging coal-fired power station fleet. However, Saddler emphasized that with the renewable energy target nearing completion, Australia urgently needs a post-2021 energy policy to reduce its reliance on coal in the National Electricity Market.\" ",

        "Text": "The UK's economy grew at a slower pace than initially estimated in the final quarter of 2017, further widening the gap between Britain and other major economies as it prepares to leave the European Union. The Office for National Statistics revised its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter down to 0.4%, missing economists' forecasts that the rate would remain unchanged. The revised figure was attributed to lower-than-expected production and a decrease in consumer spending, which was influenced by the price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker performance in the final quarter of the year led to a downward revision in the UK's overall growth rate for 2017, which was revised down from 1.8% to 1.7%, the weakest rate in five years. As the global economy continues to recover, the UK is falling behind other major economies, including Germany, which grew by 2.2% in 2017, France, which grew by 1.9%, and the US, which expanded by 2.3%. According to Darren Morgan, a statistician at the ONS, a small number of revisions to various industries, including mining, energy generation, and services, contributed to the downward revision in quarterly growth. Services continued to drive growth at the end of 2017, but consumer-facing industries slowed due to price rises, which squeezed household budgets. The UK economy's reliance on consumer spending for growth has decreased, as households have become more reluctant to spend due to falling real pay and inflation outpacing wage growth. Household spending grew by just 0.3% in the fourth quarter and by 1.8% in 2017 overall, the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012. Businesses also appeared hesitant to invest, with business investment remaining flat in the final quarter of 2017. The downward revision in growth came a day after the ONS released figures showing a surprise increase in unemployment in the three months to December. \"The disappointing economic data presents a potential challenge for the Bank of England, which had previously hinted that it may raise interest rates as soon as May. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes that the latest GDP figures indicate the economy is still fragile and does not require another rate hike so soon.\" ",

The decline in earnings to $38.5 million, down from $83 million a year ago, comes on the heels of a similar profit drop reported by Domain, a real estate listings company spun off from Fairfax in November. Fairfax's chief executive and managing director, Greg Hywood, revealed that the company is offloading 35% of its smaller community titles in New Zealand, known as Stuff, to accelerate the shift towards digital revenue. This move may affect up to 60 staff across various titles, including NZ Dairy Farmer and Christchurch Mail. However, there was a bright spot on the digital front, as online subscriptions to Fairfax's Australian Metro mastheads, including the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and the Australian Financial Review, increased by almost 50,000 to over 283,000. Hywood credited the company's next-generation publishing model, which includes new websites and apps, for driving engagement and revenue growth. Fairfax's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation rose 1.3% to $146.9 million, while underlying net profit slipped 9.9% to $76.3 million. Hywood highlighted earnings per share of 3.3 cents and announced an interim dividend of 1.1 cents per share, fully franked. He also signaled that Fairfax is open to collaborating with Rupert Murdoch's Australian newspaper arm to reduce printing and transport costs, and will take advantage of opportunities arising from media consolidation to benefit shareholders. Fairfax Media has taken the next step in its recent positive talks with News Corp Australia, aiming to achieve industry-wide efficiencies in printing and distribution. The company has already had success in collaborating with News on shared trucking and printing titles in Queensland, and is now building on this partnership by jointly appointing advisors to explore deeper strategic opportunities. Fairfax's joint venture with Nine, streaming service Stan, has seen significant growth, with an active subscriber base of 930,000 and an 83% increase in subscription revenue driven by original content such as Romper Stomper and new seasons of popular shows like Unreal, Billions, Better Call Saul, and Younger. Meanwhile, the company is facing challenges in its New Zealand business, where it is appealing a high court decision upholding the country's competition regulator's ruling to block a merger between NZME and Stuff.

The changes come after a tumultuous two weeks for the company, which is still reeling from the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. One of the new features, a unified privacy dashboard, was previously discussed by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, back in January. In a blog post announcing the changes, two Facebook executives acknowledged that the company has more work to do to enforce its policies and educate users about their data choices. They noted that users have been complaining that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that the company must do more to keep people informed. Facebook's chief privacy officer and deputy general counsel, Erin Egan and Ashlie Beringer, stated that most of the updates have been in the works for some time, but the recent events have underscored their importance. The new features will be available to all users, not just those in countries covered by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25. On mobile devices, users will now be able to access all their settings in a single place, rather than having to navigate through nearly 20 different screens. They will also have a separate \"privacy shortcuts\" menu, which provides a centralized hub for options related to data protection, ad personalization, and on-platform privacy. Additionally, Facebook is introducing a new \"access your information\" tool, which allows users to find, download, and delete their Facebook data. However, the company is not committing to making it easier for users to delete their accounts entirely. Currently, Facebook's option to permanently delete an account is hidden in the help menu, taking a backseat to the non-permanent \"deactivation\" option that leaves all user data on Facebook's servers and accessible to its data-mining tools. Despite this, Facebook claims that it will make changes to its terms of service and data policies in response to user feedback, including updates that will increase transparency. According to Facebook, these changes are aimed at transparency, not at gaining new rights to collect, use, or share user data, as stated by Egan and Beringer. ",

The 48-second video was shot in April 2016 but only recently posted online. Biologists from the WCS describe the footage as the \"first known video documentation of a wild elephant exhibiting such behavior,\" leaving scientists and experts scratching their heads.\n\nAccording to the WCS, the elephant may have been using charcoal, which has toxin-binding properties that could have medicinal value for the animals. Charcoal is also a natural laxative and is commonly found in forests after wildfires, lightning strikes, or controlled burns. While elephants have not been observed blowing ash before, animal self-medication, or zoopharmacognosy, is a relatively common phenomenon in the animal kingdom.\n\nStudies have shown that other animals engage in self-medication, such as red colobus monkeys in Zanzibar, which eat charcoal to counteract toxic substances in their food. Bonobos have also been observed swallowing leaves with rough surfaces to remove parasites from their systems. Additionally, red and green macaws eat clay to kill bacteria in their systems, and pregnant elephants in Kenya are believed to eat leaves that may help speed up the delivery process.\n\nIndia is home to more than 27,000 Asian elephants, which make up about 60% of the global population, according to a 2017 census.

The #deletefacebook movement gained momentum after it was revealed that Facebook had shared the personal information of 50 million users with a Cambridge psychologist, without their explicit consent, which ultimately ended up in the hands of election consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Despite user requests to delete their accounts, Facebook instead pushes users towards \"deactivation,\" which leaves all personal data stored on the company's servers. When users attempt to permanently delete their accounts, Facebook suggests downloading a copy of their data, which reveals the extent of the company's data harvesting practices. One user, Dylan McKay, reported that his data logs contained metadata from every cellular call he made between October 2016 and July 2017, as well as metadata about every text message he received or sent. Many other users expressed unease upon discovering the extent of the data being logged, including contacts in their address books, calendars, and friends' birthdays.

Facebook requests permission to upload personal data for specific reasons, such as uploading address books to help users find friends and improve content prioritization. The Messenger app for Android requires permission to access call and SMS logs for similar purposes.

Machin, who has previously worked at Asda, Sainsbury's, and Tesco, collaborated with M&S Chairman Archie Norman on the turnaround of Coles Supermarkets in Australia. Norman, who has been critical of M&S's performance, warned last year that the company had been \"drifting\" for over 15 years and pledged to lead a radical overhaul of the business alongside CEO Steve Rowe. As a result of Machin's appointment, the current food division head, Andy Adcock, will leave M&S at the end of April, after a decade-long tenure that began in 2009. Rowe expressed confidence in Machin, stating, \"He gets food retailing and has first-class experience driving change in large food retailers.\" M&S's food halls, once a crown jewel, have struggled in recent years, with Rowe attributing the decline to high prices, mistakes in product offerings, and attempts to reduce waste that resulted in empty shelves. The company has since scaled back plans to open new food stores. Rowe emphasized the need for M&S to \"sharpen its prices, improve its products, drive profitability, and grow market share,\" and believes Machin is the right leader to achieve these goals.

This announcement is a setback for Lloyds Banking Group, which acquired HBOS in 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employees, were sentenced to prison in 2017 for perpetrating the fraud, which centered on the Reading branch of the bank. A judge described the scheme as \"utterly corrupt\" and devastating for small business owners, who were cheated, defeated, and left penniless. The scam occurred between 2003 and 2008 and involved Lynden Scourfield, a former HBOS employee responsible for overseeing struggling businesses. Scourfield was bribed by David Mills, the owner of a financial consultancy, to load loans onto struggling companies and refer them to Mills's business. Many of the firms went bankrupt, and some owners lost their homes. Although the original investigation resulted in sentences totaling over 47 years, controversy surrounding the case has persisted. The NCA will conduct a six-month pre-investigative review into allegations of fraud related to the HBOS branch in Reading, at the request of Thames Valley Police. The review will examine allegations that fell outside the scope of the original investigation. The NCA stated that several companies have reported significant fraud allegations, including claims of asset stripping through corrupt consultants and fraud and money laundering. The sums involved could be substantial, running into tens of millions of pounds. Lloyds initially denied any wrongdoing at its Reading branch, but following the conviction of two former employees, the police and crime commissioner of Thames Valley Police claimed that HBOS must have known about the fraudulent activities in its Reading branch as early as February 2008. Lloyds has welcomed the investigation and pledged to fully cooperate with the NCA.  ",

The festival, which celebrates unusual cars, will feature mint-condition Austin Allegros and cherished Datsun Sunnys, and Ian's Invacar is sure to be a crowd-pleaser. Although the Invacar was effectively banned from the road in 2003, Ian managed to secure insurance, tax, and testing for his vehicle, which has revealed a significant oil leak and carburettor fault. Despite these issues, Ian has only managed to drive 17 miles so far, let alone the 170-mile trip ahead. The AC Invacar Model 70 was designed to be a standard invalid carriage, with the engine from the Austrian-built Fiat 500, a Steyr-Puch air-cooled flat twin of 493cc and 20bhp. Between 1972 and 1977, around 18,000 Invacars were built, with AC and Invacar Ltd each producing half of that total. Invacar Ltd was founded by the same company that built Greeves motorcycles, which also built the first Invacar in 1948. The Invacars, all of which were ice blue, were often referred to as Thundersley Invacars due to the company's base in Thundersley. However, the scheme was eventually ended in 1977 due to safety concerns, including the lack of crash protection, instability, and the fact that wheelchair users did not need to take a proper driving test to operate the vehicles. A decision was made to allow individuals who already owned an Invacar to keep it, but the program ultimately came to a close in 2003. Within a week, the remaining Invacars (estimated to be several hundred) were collected from their owners. The cars were leased to the end user. When Ian took his TWC 725K for its inaugural drive, he found it both terrifying and exhilarating, but was also plagued by numerous issues. It will be a minor miracle if he makes it to the festival without any major setbacks, but we wish him the best of luck.

The new model comes as Snapchat tries to bounce back from the disappointing performance of the first generation, which generated significant buzz when it was initially released in limited quantities in November 2016, but failed to sell well after its wider release. Over the lifetime of the product, Snap managed to sell only 220,000 units, which ultimately led to the company writing off unsold inventory worth almost $40 million. This time around, the new Spectacles will be available on Snap's website for £149.99 and will launch simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada, and France, with a wider European release to follow. Like the first model, the Spectacles can capture video in short 10-second increments, recording in a circular format that can be viewed in the Snapchat app or exported for other uses. However, this new version can also take still photos with a resolution of 1642 pixels, 50% higher than the previous model's video resolution, and can even shoot underwater. The glasses also feature stereo mics and post-processing to reduce noise, allowing for clearer and higher-quality sound. Snap's decision to recommit to Spectacles is surprising, given that many competitors are abandoning the smart glasses market. Intel, for example, launched its own smart glasses in February but cancelled the project in April, citing market dynamics that didn't support further investment. Similarly, Google Glass, which was launched in 2013, was met with controversy and eventually discontinued in 2015. Snap believes that its focus on hardware is crucial to its future success. Snap's co-founder, Evan Spiegel, views the company as a \"camera company\" at its core. This perspective extends beyond traditional photo and video tools to encompass features that enable augmented reality technology and innovative ways to interact with digital elements in the physical world.

The cold snap led to a significant drop in demand for plants and garden furniture, adding to the company's woes. The poor March trading resulted in a 15.4% decline in like-for-like sales for the first three months of 2018, worse than the 15.1% decline in the previous quarter. Wesfarmers, Homebase's parent company, had planned to convert the chain into a Bunnings store, but only 23 of the 250 stores have been converted so far, and it is unclear if the company will continue with the costly refurbishments. The company's managing director, Rob Scott, had previously considered pulling out of the UK market, citing the disastrous takeover of Homebase. Wesfarmers wrote off A$1bn (£543m) earlier this year due to the failed takeover, and is now reportedly considering offering over £100m to find a buyer or pursuing a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to dump loss-making stores. The decline in sales has been partly attributed to the actions of the original Australian management team, who axed senior managers and key departments, including home furnishings, which had appealed to British shoppers. Damian McGloughlin, a former B&Q executive, has been brought in to run the chain. The Bunnings group managing director, Michael Schneider, stated that progress on several Homebase projects is \"satisfactory,\" focusing on improving store standards, ranges, and promotions.  ",

If approved by investors, this deal would be one of the largest pharmaceutical transactions in history, ranking behind Pfizer's $112 billion acquisition of Warner Lambert in 2000. The revised offer values Shire at £49 per share, approximately £5 more than Takeda's initial bid. After rejecting several previous offers, Shire's board stated that it would be willing to recommend the revised proposal to shareholders, subject to satisfactory resolution of the remaining terms, including a due diligence review by Shire of Takeda. The company has set a new deadline of May 8th for the negotiations to be concluded, although this date may be extended. If the deal is completed, Shire shareholders would own approximately half of the combined company, with shares listed in Japan and the US. According to Atsushi Seki, a pharma analyst at UBS, \"With Shire's board willing to recommend the deal, Shire's acquisition becomes realistic, but there are still several hurdles to overcome, including the absence of other bidders and a special shareholder meeting to approve the deal.\" Britain's largest pharmaceutical company, GSK, has ruled itself out of the bidding process, while US company Allergan, which produces Botox, dropped out earlier this month. Shire's shares in London closed at £38.20, down 2.8%, below the offer price, indicating skepticism in the market about the deal. Takeda's shares plummeted over 7% on the Tokyo stock exchange, reflecting concerns that a deal of this size could put excessive pressure on the company's finances. The acquisition would give Takeda Shire's lucrative rare diseases portfolio, propelling the Japanese company, led by CEO Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global pharmaceutical companies. Founded in 1986 above a shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, Shire is best known for its ADHD medication Adderall, but has focused on rare diseases in recent years. \"While headquartered in Dublin for tax reasons, the company's actual operations are centered in Boston.

According to the regulator's annual survey, the percentage of British social media users who consider Facebook their primary online profile has decreased from 80% to 70% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the popularity of WhatsApp has surged, with 16% of internet users now considering it their main online profile, up from 7% a year ago. Although primarily a messaging service, WhatsApp is becoming a significant platform for discussing news and sharing information through groups centered around specific interests. The shift away from Facebook is particularly pronounced among younger internet users, with 13% of 16- to 24-year-olds naming Snapchat as their preferred social media platform, while 9% prefer Instagram over Facebook. The Ofcom survey, which interviewed 1,875 individuals aged 16 and above, found that the decline in Facebook's popularity occurred before the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which raised concerns about Facebook's data usage and damaged the company's reputation. Despite this, Facebook may not be overly concerned, as the company remains the dominant player in the social media landscape, with over half of British adults having an account. Furthermore, the shift in attention to WhatsApp and Instagram is not catastrophic for Facebook, as both platforms are already owned by the company. The Ofcom survey also found that the average British adult spends 24 hours a week online and is becoming less reliant on traditional television, with over half of adults now watching on-demand or streaming content. Despite the report's findings, many internet users lack a clear understanding of online regulation. Specifically, nearly a third of users mistakenly believe that YouTube regulates video content posted by the general public, thinking that rules govern offensive, harmful, unfair, inaccurate, or biased content. While most Britons believe the benefits of being online outweigh the risks, many expressed concerns about the impact of prolonged internet use. In fact, a significant proportion of users reported feeling overwhelmed by their online connectivity and wished to reduce their online time. Moreover, nearly half of internet users have encountered hateful content online in the past year. According to Ofcom, there is a significant wealth divide in how Britons use the internet, with poorer individuals relying more heavily on smartphones and exhibiting lower levels of online confidence and critical understanding. Facebook declined to comment on the report's findings. ",

A comprehensive study by US researchers found that even a small increase in temperature can lead to a decline in exam scores. The study, which analyzed data from over 10 million secondary students across 13 years, revealed that a 0.5°C rise in average temperature corresponds to a 1% drop in average exam scores. In the UK, the situation is even more challenging, as air conditioning, which could potentially mitigate the negative effects, is rarely found in British schools. It's not surprising, given that the hot periods in the UK are relatively rare and don't justify the cost of installing air conditioning. However, June is the month when average high temperatures tend to exceed 21°C (70°F), which is when the negative effects on exam performance become apparent. This raises the question of why we schedule important exams during this time, when distractions like sports tournaments and heatwaves are common. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow students to take their exams online when it's most convenient for their learning and comfort? While it may seem like a simple idea, changing the academic year is actually a complex issue. Schools, large firms, universities, and even the law courts follow a similar September-to-July schedule. Moreover, the UK government, which is also subject to this schedule, may find it difficult to argue for changing the system when they themselves benefit from it. The UK's rigorous exam marking system, which relies on students taking tests at the same time, may be overly rigid, but it has a significant benefit: the scores required for a given grade change each year based on average scores. \"Fortunately, if a sweltering summer temporarily impairs children's cognitive abilities, they shouldn't suffer any lasting consequences.

The sale could involve around 10% of the bank, generating approximately £3 billion, but would still result in a significant loss for taxpayers, who bailed out RBS during the 2008 financial crisis. The Treasury's long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return RBS to the private sector, but the current share price may delay this decision. RBS's value has decreased by about 12% since the government last sold off shares in 2015, and the government is prepared to write off a significant portion of the £45.5 billion it spent on the bailout. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the company responsible for managing the Treasury's assets, declined to comment on the potential sale. However, according to a Sky News report, bankers and investors are expecting an announcement as early as this week, with one fund manager stating that the City is \"abuzz with speculation\" about an imminent sale. The government's decision to resume its share disposal plan was facilitated by a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month, in which RBS agreed to pay $4.9 billion to settle an investigation into the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages. The settlement, which was less than half the worst-case scenario, has paved the way for the government to resume selling off its stake in RBS. Chancellor Philip Hammond has stated that the agreement will allow the government to proceed with the sale, which has already led to a sharp increase in RBS's shares. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that the government will raise £15 billion from the sale of its stakes over the next five years. RBS is set to hold its annual general meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, which will be buoyed by the bank's first annual profit since the crisis and its promise to resume paying dividends. \"While some shareholders may push for greater oversight and executive compensation reform, tensions are running high due to a scathing report exposing widespread mistreatment of small businesses by RBS following the financial crisis. The bank's recent decision to shut down 162 branches and eliminate 800 jobs has further stoked discontent. RBS has declined to comment on the matter.\" ",

A devastating example of this is Burnt Yates school in north Yorkshire, a small rural primary school with excellent facilities and a dedicated trust, which will close its doors at the end of the academic year. Despite its rich history, dating back to 1760, the school was unable to find an academic partner to take it over, and its efforts to amalgamate with other schools were unsuccessful. The school's demise can be attributed to a series of poor decisions by the local authority, culminating in a poor Ofsted report that sealed its fate. The community rallied around the school, but ultimately, the lack of funding meant that closure was the only option. I blame Michael Gove's academies plan, which has led to the erosion of local accountability and the loss of schools like Burnt Yates, which would still be thriving if it weren't for his policies.\n\nRegarding the civil servant quoted in Michael Rosen's letter, I must correct the record. The department does, in fact, publish data on sponsored academy primary schools, which have been forced out of local control. The statistics show that these schools, along with free schools, consistently underperform compared to average schools. This is not surprising, given that sponsored academies tend to have a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. What is more concerning is that, despite having more time to improve, the results of these schools do not show any significant improvement. As a former primary school governor in Cornwall, I can attest to the devastating consequences of the academies program. The governors were dismissed, the headteacher was pushed out, and the school was effectively taken over by a neighboring institution. \"According to the latest SATs results, the ACE academy chain's performance has fallen even further below average. Last year's results at other ACE schools were only marginally better. The lack of effective oversight has enabled ACE to expand its network by taking on more schools and opening a new free school, despite its modest academic achievements.

        "Text": "The earliest known case of dandruff has been discovered in a small, feathered dinosaur that lived around 125 million years ago. Paleontologists found tiny fossilized skin flakes on a crow-sized microraptor, a meat-eating dinosaur with wings on all four limbs. Similar flakes were also found on two other feathered dinosaurs, beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, as well as a primitive bird called confuciusornis. The fossilized skin flakes are the only evidence scientists have of how dinosaurs shed their skin. Unlike modern reptiles, which typically shed their skin in large sheets, the feathered dinosaurs shed their skin in tiny flakes. According to Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork, \"This is the only fossil dandruff known. Until now, we had no evidence for how dinosaurs shed their skin.\" Images taken with an electron microscope show that the fossilized dandruff is extremely well-preserved and almost identical to that found on modern birds. Like human dandruff, the skin flakes are made up of tough cells called corneocytes that are rich in the protein keratin. The study, published in Nature Communications, suggests that dinosaurs with feathers evolved skin to cope with their plumage as far back as the Middle Jurassic period. \"Even in the early stages of feather evolution, they had already adapted their skin to this more modern structure,\" McNamara said. The fossilized remains of the animals were found in rock formations in northeastern China. Beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, which grew to over 2 meters in length, were significantly larger than the 1-meter-long microraptor. Unlike modern birds, which have fatty corneocytes that help them lose heat during flight, the dinosaur dandruff cells lacked fat, suggesting that the animals did not generate as much heat, possibly because they were not capable of flying long distances or at all. Many dinosaurs with feathers were not skilled fliers. \"Rather, their feathers had multiple functions, including keeping them warm, blending in with their surroundings for camouflage, and potentially showcasing their vibrant colors to attract mates with dazzling displays.\" ",

Sainsbury's Bank was informed and raised an indemnity against Santander to recover the money, but told me that my credit file wouldn't be corrected until the issue was resolved. Although the Santander account has been closed, the bank loan still appears on my credit report. This situation seems to be a blatant disregard for my right to have inaccurate information corrected.\n\nThe high cost of relying on two large financial institutions to communicate is evident in this case.

According to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board, the vehicle's guidance system detected the pedestrian, a 49-year-old woman, six seconds before impact, but the emergency braking system was not activated to avoid \"erratic vehicle behavior\". Instead, the system relied on the human backup driver to intervene, but it did not alert the driver to the impending danger. The vehicle was traveling at 43 miles per hour when it struck the pedestrian, who was pushing a bicycle across a boulevard in Tempe, Arizona. The report states that the sensors detected the need to brake 1.3 seconds before impact, but the brakes were not applied until after the fatal collision. In an interview with NTSB investigators, the backup driver said she was monitoring the self-driving interface at the time of the accident. In response to the incident, Uber has suspended testing in Arizona and will focus on more limited testing in Pittsburgh and California. The company is also conducting an internal review of its self-driving vehicle program and has brought in a former NTSB chairman to advise on its safety culture. The NTSB's preliminary report is not intended to assign blame for the accident, but rather to provide an initial analysis of the incident. An expert in liability law has suggested that the incident highlights the need for greater regulatory oversight in the testing of self-driving vehicles, and that Uber's decision to suspend testing in Arizona is a significant setback for the company. \"States must exercise extreme caution when establishing and regulating these programs to avoid a patchwork of 50 different systems.

The CMA has been investigating the industry since October and has identified several areas of concern. While the CMA did not name the specific companies under investigation, major players like Expedia and Booking.com are among those being scrutinized. The regulator is examining whether a hotel's ranking on a website is influenced by the commission it pays, which could lead to hotels that pay more commission being prioritized. The CMA has expressed concern that the way booking sites display information about room availability, such as the number of people looking at a room and how long a price is available, can create a false impression of availability and pressure customers into making a hasty decision. According to the CMA, 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites, but many have found that the final price paid was inflated by unexpected extra charges such as taxes and booking fees added later. The CMA's chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, emphasized the importance of transparency in the industry, saying, \"Booking sites can make it easier to choose your holiday, but only if people can trust them.\" The regulator is demanding that the sites review their practices and provide a response within the next few months.

The retailer described the past year as \"very difficult\" and noted a 3.6% decline in sales at its established UK stores for the year ending April 28. Carpetright's trading has been severely impacted in the first eight weeks of the current financial year, particularly due to the withdrawal of products by some suppliers and the hot weather, which has kept customers away. The company had announced its store closure plan in April, which put 300 jobs at risk, and is now seeking rent reductions of up to 50% on 113 additional stores through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).

Prior to that, life expectancy in Britain had been steadily increasing, with men born in the 1920s and 1930s enjoying unusually long and healthy lives. This increase in lifespan has had far-reaching impacts on various aspects of life, including housing, healthcare, and pensions. As a result, the NHS requires increasingly large sums of money, the state pension age has had to be raised, and house prices have been driven up by people living in their homes for longer. However, a recent analysis by the Office for National Statistics has revealed that the trend of increasing longevity has come to a halt. The ONS found that the trend line stopped in 2010 and has remained flat since then. The reasons behind this sudden halt are unclear, but potential factors include austerity measures, reduced NHS spending, flu outbreaks, rising obesity and diabetes rates, and the increasing prevalence of \"multimorbidity\" - where individuals develop multiple health conditions simultaneously. The ONS did not attempt to identify the cause of the halt, but instead aimed to verify whether the statistics indeed show a decline in longevity. The study's findings are concerning, as they indicate that the trend towards improving life expectancy has slowed significantly. According to the ONS, the slowdown began in the second quarter of 2009 for men and soon after for women. The analysis also found that between 2011 and 2013, and again between 2014 and 2016, only a small number of local authorities in England showed statistically significant increases in life expectancy for both men and women. This is a stark contrast to the equivalent period 10 years earlier, when many more local authorities reported significant increases in life expectancy. While it's possible that this is just a temporary blip, other concerning data from the weekly register of deaths in England and Wales this year adds to the worrying trend. The statistics reveal that the number of deaths is significantly higher than the average over the past five years. While the academic discussion surrounding stagnation in longevity has primarily focused on austerity and the National Health Service (NHS), there are other substantial financial implications to consider, particularly for pensions. Pension companies repeatedly advise savers to plan for a retirement lasting 25 years or more, but maybe this assumption is flawed. Just a year ago, the Government Actuary's Department proposed a potential state pension age of 70 for individuals currently under the age of 30. It's possible that they were incorrect in this estimation as well. Perhaps we should now reconsider increasing the state pension age and instead focus on maintaining the current age. ",

However, in the UK, women make up only 11% of the engineering profession. Engineering is responsible for many everyday conveniences, such as roads, bridges, and clean water, as well as cutting-edge technologies like AI, robotics, and smartphones. To encourage more women to pursue engineering, we must effectively communicate its diverse applications to young women. By doing so, we can inspire a new generation of women to join a field that offers the opportunity to work on innovative projects that shape the future. Once women are in the profession, we must strive to support and empower them to reach their full potential. According to the Create the Future report, a global study by the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, 92% of respondents believe that engineering has a significant impact on people's daily lives. A more balanced engineering sector is crucial for building a better future for all. - Yasmin Ali, Ambassador, Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.

According to a report by Sky News, Ashley was approached by bankers advising House of Fraser to consider a £50m loan. In June, House of Fraser announced plans to close 31 of its 59 stores, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. The retailer secured a temporary reprieve from its lenders, who agreed to extend loans while it undergoes restructuring under a company voluntary arrangement scheme. C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, had agreed to invest £70m in House of Fraser, conditional on the CVA being implemented. However, the CVA plans are now in doubt due to a legal challenge in Scotland, where a group of landlords argue that the restructuring plan would unfairly harm their financial interests. House of Fraser's CEO, Alex Williamson, has described the CVA as the \"last viable\" option for the business. After winning a legal challenge to obtain House of Fraser's business plans, Ashley gained valuable information that could aid an investment bid. Ashley acquired his 11% stake in House of Fraser in 2014, when 89% of the business was sold to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a deal worth £480m. He also has a 29.7% stake in Debenhams and strategic investments in businesses such as Goals Soccer Centres and French Connection. House of Fraser is one of several retailers to seek controversial CVAs as Britain's high streets struggle with rising costs, weak consumer confidence, and competition from online-only rivals like Amazon.

In 2015, the Pension Regulator (TPR) requested information about the brewery's pension plans to ensure the Yorkshire-based brewer and pub owner was providing enough funding for the final-salary pension schemes of over 2,000 employees. However, Smith, 73, dismissed the request as \"tiresome\" and refused to comply, prompting the TPR to launch court proceedings. The company and Smith pleaded guilty to the offence in May, and on Monday, they were sentenced at Brighton magistrates court. The court fined the brewery £26,750 and its chairman £8,000, as well as ordering costs of £1,240. Judge Teresa Szagun criticized the brewery's tone, calling it \"deliberately inflammatory,\" and said the company's refusal to provide information had put the future and security of 2,000 employees at risk. The total fine, including a victim surcharge and costs, came out to £27,990. Nicola Parish, a representative of the TPR, stated that \"issuing a court summons and receiving compliance with our requests will not halt criminal proceedings, as Mr. Smith has recently learned.\" Samuel Smith Old Brewery operates a network of 300 pubs across the UK.

They're considering using the scheme to get on the property ladder, but they're unsure after reading negative reviews. As their parent, I'm worried about the potential stress and fear they might experience if they choose this path. Should they instead aim to save longer for a bigger deposit to buy an older property?\n\nI think my sons are wise to be cautious about the Help-to-Buy scheme. If they can afford to buy a property without using the scheme, it would make more sense. According to the Help to Buy Buyers' Guide published by the Homes and Communities Agency, if you can already secure a 90% mortgage, you should carefully consider whether a Help-to-Buy equity loan is right for you. There may be better options available.\n\nHelp-to-Buy can be a good option if you're looking to buy a new-build property from a registered house builder and need the 20% equity loan (40% in London) to complete the purchase. However, it's not suitable if you don't want a new-build Help-to-Buy home or don't need government assistance. Unlike the government bonuses paid into Help-to-Buy and Lifetime ISAs, the Help-to-Buy equity loan is not free money. Although there's no interest to pay in the first five years, you'll need to pay a monthly management fee of £1. After five years, interest will start to be charged on the loan.\" \"The primary concern with an equity loan is that if house values increase, so does the amount you'll need to repay, either when you sell the property or make a voluntary repayment (incurring a £200 administration fee). Furthermore, interest rates on Help-to-Buy mortgages are less competitive than those for standard mortgages. Considering your sons have mixed opinions about the Help-to-Buy scheme and are under 40, I recommend they opt for the free government funding that comes with saving in a Lifetime ISA for property purchase.\" ",

Research has shown that only 16% of Wikipedia editors are female, and a mere 17% of entries about notable individuals are about women. A 2016 study by Oxford University revealed that the majority of content about most African countries on Wikipedia was written by editors from Europe and North America, with only 16% of content about sub-Saharan Africa being written by people from the region. In contrast, most entries about European countries were written in Europe.\n\nThe language of a Wikipedia entry has also been found to influence the sources used, leading to different versions of the truth. For example, an English-language article about Russia's annexation of Crimea cited 24% of sources as Ukrainian and 20% as Russian, whereas the German version cited only 10% of sources as Russian and 3% as Ukrainian.\n\nA 2011 study analyzed almost 30,000 Wikipedia entries about US politics and found a slight bias towards the Democrats. The study found that entries were more likely to use Democratic phrases (such as \"civil rights\") than Republican phrases (such as \"illegal immigration\").

The newspaper's original story, published on December 15 under the headline \"Another human rights fiasco!\", falsely claimed that Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed had been caught with a bomb and had won £33,000 in compensation because British soldiers had kept him in custody for too long. However, the judge's decision to award al-Waheed compensation actually stemmed from his unlawful imprisonment and mistreatment by British armed forces during the Iraq war. The newspaper ran the story despite the judge concluding that the claims about al-Waheed being caught with a bomb were \"pure fiction\" and had been discredited shortly after his detention. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) ordered the correction after finding that the Daily Mail had breached rules on accuracy in its reporting of the case. Ipso stated that the newspaper's failure to clarify that the bomb claims had been disproven seriously misrepresented the basis of the judgment. The judge found that there was no evidence to support the claim that al-Waheed was an insurgent and that he had been detained without legal basis for 33 days in 2007. The compensation award was broken down into £3,300 for unlawful detention, £15,000 for being beaten after his arrest, and £15,000 for ill treatment. The Daily Mail defended its reporting by stating that it had relied on a three-page summary of the 239-page judgment and previous reporting on the case. However, Ipso rejected this explanation, arguing that it was unreasonable for the newspaper to rely on previous press coverage that referenced the \"red-handed\" claim without verifying the accuracy of the information. According to the newspaper, a major internal investigation was conducted after the decision to publish, and as a consequence, seven senior staff members received strongly worded disciplinary notes. These notes made it explicitly clear that if similar errors occurred in the future, the employees' careers would be in jeopardy. ",

Initially, it was set to take off in October, but the project has faced numerous delays since its inception in 1996. Initially, the budget was estimated at $500 million and the launch date was slated for 2007. However, the mission's technical requirements proved to be extremely challenging, leading to delays and cost overruns. In 2011, the US Congress considered canceling the mission, but ultimately capped the cost at around $8 billion. The latest delay, caused by anomalous test results that require investigation, will bring the total budget to approximately $9.6 billion (£7.8 billion). The source of the additional funding is currently being debated. During a recent testimony before the House Science Committee in Washington, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine suggested that the agency might slow down the development of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and redirect funds to JWST.

According to BP's CEO Bob Dudley, the deal is \"transformational\" and will significantly enhance the company's US shale presence. The acquisition will increase BP's US oil and gas production by nearly 20% and marks a new era of growth for the company, which has been recovering from the financial burden of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The deal covers 470,000 acres of assets, including fields in the Permian Basin in west Texas, the Eagle Ford in south Texas, and Haynesville in east Texas and Louisiana. Analysts have praised the deal, with Eagle Ford being considered the most valuable due to its scale and economics, and the Permian offering the greatest long-term potential. BHP purchased the fields in 2011 but has struggled to make them profitable, leading to their sale last August. BP believes its approach will differ from BHP's, bringing $350 million in synergies from its other US operations and capital efficiencies. According to Bernard Looney, CEO of BP's upstream division, the acquisition gives the company access to some of the best acreage in the best basins, including the Permian Basin, which is considered the most-talked-about oil play in the world. While BP was not desperate to make a deal, the company believes the quality of the resources made the acquisition worthwhile. Following the deal's completion, BP's US production is expected to increase from 744,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 885,000 boe/d. According to Maxim Petrov, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the deal \"transforms BP's US business\" by making it more competitive with its peers. BP is making conservative assumptions about the amount of oil and gas that can be pumped in the short term, due to regional bottlenecks in infrastructure such as pipelines. According to Looney, the company believes that the infrastructure will be fully developed within the next two years. The acquisition will be entirely financed through cash and is being partially funded by the company's decision to divest its interests in the Greater Kuparuk Area in Alaska, which is expected to generate $5-6 billion. BP's deal significantly surpasses its recent $200 million investment in Europe's largest solar company and its £130 million purchase of the UK's largest electric car charging network. BHP has announced that it will return the proceeds from the sale to its investors, and as a result, its shares closed the day up 2.3% in Australia, at A$34.40. In contrast, BP's share price declined by 1.5%. The company's largest transaction in recent history was its acquisition of Atlantic Richfield, an American oil company, in 1999. ",

In 2016, a staggering 2.3 million debt cases were referred to bailiffs by local authorities, according to data provided to the House of Commons Treasury committee. The report criticized the \"overzealous\" pursuit of debtors, saying that the public sector should be setting an example for responsible debt collection, but instead, its approach risks further entrenching financial difficulties. MPs called for a reform of the debt collection approach, urging it to meet industry best practices. The report highlighted evidence from StepChange, a debt charity, which found that one-third of its clients had council tax arrears averaging £1,000. Phil Andrew, from StepChange, expressed concern about the aggressive tactics used by government agencies to collect debts, including the quick resort to bailiffs. The case of Jerome Rogers, a 20-year-old courier who took his own life after being pursued by bailiffs for two parking fines, has raised concerns about the need for fundamental changes to the debt collection industry. Earlier this week, Creditfix, a personal insolvency firm, identified 55 councils across the UK that consistently reject payment plans offered by those in financial difficulties, leaving them with no choice but to declare bankruptcy. Gillian Guy, CEO of Citizens Advice, welcomed the report, saying that MPs are right to criticize the government and local authorities for their poor debt collection practices, which fail to protect vulnerable individuals. The report also made several other recommendations, including the urgent introduction of caps on high-cost credit, such as overdraft fees, by the Financial Conduct Authority. The report also proposes reforms to the tax relief on pension contributions, deeming it an inefficient way to encourage people to save for their retirement. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, noted that the inquiry highlighted several weaknesses in household finances, including excessive debt, inadequate rainy day savings, and insufficient pension savings. According to Morgan, the committee's report presents a series of recommendations for the government to consider, aimed at helping households build more resilient financial foundations. She emphasized that while financial regulators and guidance bodies have important roles to play, the government should not shift responsibility to them. ",

The surge in its share price has propelled the company's value to nearly match that of Royal Mail and surpass the combined stock market value of WH Smith, Debenhams, the AA, and Saga. Fever-Tree's rapid growth can be attributed to the soaring popularity of premium gin, which has doubled UK sales to £1.2 billion in the past six years, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. A YouGov poll found that gin is the most beloved spirit in the UK, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favorite. Riding the wave of gin's popularity has transformed Fever-Tree into one of the UK's fastest-growing major companies, making co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow multi-millionaires in the process. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005, naming it after the colloquial term for the cinchona tree, the bark of which produces quinine, a key ingredient in tonic water. Since the company's stock market float in 2014, Rolls has sold shares worth over £150 million, while Warrilow has sold shares worth £41 million. They still own 14% of the company, a stake worth nearly £600 million, and received payouts of over £630,000 on Tuesday after the group increased its dividend by 40%. Fever-Tree's shares jumped by as much as 15% to an all-time high of £39.87, driven by profits rising by a third to £34 million in the first six months of the year, on sales up 45% higher to £104 million. The shares settled back to give the company a stock market value of £4.2 billion, still more than 30 times its value when it floated four years ago. Fever-Tree reported particularly strong performance in the UK over the Christmas period, with an \"impressive rate of sales growth,\" but noted that it still has room to expand. Warrilow noted, \"While this milestone is impressive, we still have a substantial opportunity ahead of us across all our regions as Fever-Tree continues to shape the mixer category's future.\" Additionally, Fever-Tree announced two new distribution agreements: one in the US with Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, a leading wine and spirits distributor, and another with Grupo Damm, a Spanish company that produces Estrella Damm, a well-known beer from Barcelona.

The single-decker bus will operate autonomously within the company's depots until the necessary laws are changed to permit passenger transportation. The bus is being adapted with technology similar to that used in a recent trial of driverless pods in Greenwich, south-east London. According to Stagecoach, the bus will be able to park and refuel itself within the depots, as well as navigate to wash points, without the need for a human driver. The company believes that wider adoption of self-driving buses could lead to safer and more efficient operations, as well as increased space within its depots.\n\nEven when the bus is on public roads, the sensor system could provide earlier warnings to other road users, such as cyclists or pedestrians, who may be in blind spots or approaching unexpectedly. Sam Greer, Stagecoach's UK bus engineering director, described the project as exciting and potentially transformative, stating that it could improve safety and efficiency within depots and, in the long term, revolutionize bus travel.\n\nThis move by a traditional bus operator using a full-size vehicle could mark a significant step towards the wider adoption of autonomous vehicles in the UK, where so far only smaller pods and shuttle vehicles have been used in public spaces. In contrast, passenger services using small driverless vehicles have been trialed in France, while China has tested larger driverless buses on major city roads in Shenzhen. The trials in Greenwich suggested that passengers may be more receptive to larger autonomous vehicles for public transportation than smaller pods. While driverless trains have been in operation for some time, researchers found that users had concerns about sharing vehicles with strangers, with 85% of participants expressing comfort with autonomous technology but only 46% willing to ride-share. \"Many respondents indicated that they were not willing to pay a substantial amount above the standard bus fare to use autonomous driverless pods.\" ",

The company's name was born a year later, after their prototype successfully completed the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire. Aston Martin made its international racing debut in the 1922 French Grand Prix, but faced financial struggles and was rescued in 1926 by a group of investors. The company developed a reputation for engineering and design, competing in the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars increased in the 1930s, with a record 140 cars built in 1937. In 1947, English industrialist David Brown acquired the company, expanding operations and relocating production from Kensington to Feltham. The company moved its production base again in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. The iconic Aston Martin DB5 was introduced in 1963, and its famous partnership with James Bond began a year later in the film Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery. Bond has since driven an Aston Martin in several films, including GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and Skyfall. The company changed hands several times in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1987, Ford Motor Company acquired a 75% stake. The DB moniker, inspired by David Brown's initials, was revived with the introduction of the DB7 in 1993, the year Ford took full ownership of the company. Aston Martin opened its first purpose-built factory in Gaydon, Warwickshire, in 2003. The company returned to racing in 2005 with the DBR9, a race car based on the DB9 road car. In 2007, Aston Martin was sold to a consortium of two Kuwaiti investment houses, Investment Dar and Adeem Investment, for nearly £1 billion. \"Today, Aston Martin is one of the world's leading sports car manufacturers, thanks in large part to the efforts of its current CEO, Andy Palmer. Palmer has successfully transformed the company by updating its product range and guiding it back to profitability after a period of financial losses.

The partnership will use technology from both companies to create purpose-built Toyota cars that will be deployed across Uber's ride-sharing network starting in 2021. Toyota's investment values Uber at $72 billion, despite the company's significant losses of $4.5 billion in 2017. According to Shigeki Tomoyama, Toyota's executive vice-president, the agreement marks an important milestone in the company's transformation into a mobility company, enabling the safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing.\n\nThe deal is a significant step towards Uber's revival of its self-driving business, which was halted following a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona, in March. Uber subsequently withdrew its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers, and closed its self-driving testing hub in Arizona. Under the new agreement, Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota's Guardian technology, which offers some automated safety features but does not enable fully autonomous driving.

According to the company, the hackers gained access to the accounts by using email addresses and passwords stolen from other websites. Superdrug has assured customers that payment card information was not stolen.\n\nIn response to the breach, Superdrug is advising customers to change their passwords and has notified the police and Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber-crime arm, of the incident. The company has also apologized for any inconvenience caused by difficulties customers may be experiencing when trying to change their passwords. One customer reported trying and failing to change her password on four different devices.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of high-profile data breaches to affect high street retailers. Last month, Dixons Carphone revealed that personal data belonging to 10 million customers may have been accessed illegally, nearly 10 times as many as initially thought.  ",

        "Text": "Elite private schools are urging universities to reduce the use of unconditional offers for undergraduate places, citing concerns that students may become complacent and not strive for high A-level grades. According to Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents many of the country's most prestigious independent schools, students tend to \"take their foot off the gas\" after accepting unconditional offers, which do not require specific A-level grades. Buchanan, a former headteacher, believes that students will carry their academic achievements with them throughout their careers and thus should be motivated to work hard. He is calling on universities to only offer unconditional places to students who have been interviewed or whose schools have provided additional information. Historically, only a small number of students received unconditional offers, but the government's removal of the cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities to expand and compete aggressively for students and tuition fees. While there is limited evidence on the impact of unconditional offers on students' final grades, private school heads have long been concerned about the potential impact on their school's results and league table rankings. Some employers place significant weight on A-level grades when recruiting for graduate trainee programs, which means that students who underperform may struggle in the job market. The HMC's call follows that of Education Minister Sam Gyimah, who in July criticized the rise in unconditional offers as \"completely irresponsible to students\" and urged universities to limit their use. Typically, universities make conditional offers, specifying the A-level grades required to secure a place. However, in a more competitive market, unconditional offers have become more common, even among research-intensive institutions in the Russell Group. According to Ucas, the administrator of university applications, 7% of the 950,000 offers made this year were unconditional, with roughly one-fifth of the 250,000 applicants to English universities receiving at least one such offer. Ucas noted that unconditional offers were more prevalent for older students who already held qualifications, as well as for those applying to creative arts courses who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties. University vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers, citing their benefits in allowing for earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation.

        "Text": "A recent phonics screening check for six-year-olds has revealed that white boys from disadvantaged backgrounds are significantly underachieving even at the earliest stage of their education. According to the results, which were broken down by ethnic group, gender, and free school meal eligibility, white boys who receive free school meals (FSM) are the lowest-achieving group, with only 62% meeting the required standard. Although the results show a two percentage point improvement from last year, disadvantaged white boys still lag behind their peers. Overall, more than four in five pupils (82%) met the expected standard in the phonics screening check, a one percentage point increase from 2017. Chinese girls who do not receive FSM were the highest-performing group. The phonics screening check involves pupils reading a list of 40 words aloud, half of which are nonsense, and the pass mark was set at 32. Pupils who do not meet the standard will retake the check at the end of year 2, by which time 92% are expected to meet the required standard. The analysis also revealed that fewer than half (44%) of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) reached the pass mark, compared to 89% of pupils with no identified SEN. The Department for Education also published provisional results for key stage 1 teacher assessments, which showed a slight drop in the number of six- and seven-year-olds reaching the expected standard in reading and maths. In reading, 75% of children reached the expected standard, down from 76% last year, while in maths, 76% reached the required mark, compared to 75% in 2017. The government reported that 163,000 more six-year-olds are on track to become fluent readers than in 2012, when the phonics check was introduced. However, the test remains controversial among some teachers and parents, with a recent survey finding that 85% of heads believe the test should not be compulsory and 65% of teachers want it scrapped. Wendy Scott, a representative of the More Than A Score campaign group, stated: \"Heads, teachers, and parents are in agreement that the phonics check is a waste of valuable teaching time. Instead of fostering a love of reading, five and six-year-olds are spending months being drilled on nonsensical words solely to prepare for a test.\"\n\nSchool Standards Minister Nick Gibb said: \"This is a significant achievement, having a positive impact on the education and lives of hundreds of thousands of children. We are committed to ensuring that every child, not just most, has the opportunity to reach their full potential.\" ",

The sprawling 1.12-hectare property on Sydney Harbour has been in the hands of the Fairfax family for over a century. Cannon-Brookes, co-founder of software company Atlassian, expressed his delight with the purchase, stating that he and his family are looking forward to continuing the legacy of this beautiful Sydney home. The family is particularly excited to raise their four young children in this historic property. Fairwater is the largest privately held property on Sydney Harbour and one of the most significant heritage homes in Australia. Built in 1882, the waterfront estate stretches from New South Head Road to Seven Shillings Beach and has been the residence of the Fairfax publishing family since 1900. The property was previously owned by Mary Fairfax, who passed away in September last year. According to the New South Wales heritage register, Fairwater is of rare historic, aesthetic, social, and scientific significance. During Mary Fairfax's long residence, the home was adorned with priceless artworks, including a 2-metre tall bronze nude Rodin sculpture and paintings by Chagall, Degas, and Arthur Boyd. The property was listed for sale this month, despite rumors that it would be bequeathed to the state of NSW, and reportedly took less than two weeks to sell. Atlassian, founded by Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar in Sydney in 2002, was worth $29.9 billion at the beginning of September. The pair, who attended the University of NSW together, are now among the 10 richest Australians. Interestingly, Farquhar, Cannon-Brookes' business partner, purchased the neighboring estate Elaine for over $70 million last year, which was previously owned by the Fairfax family.  ",

According to Bentley's CEO, Adrian Hallmark, the company is stockpiling some components and switching to a different port to bring in certain parts ahead of Brexit. Bentley produces around 11,000 cars per year in Crewe. If a Brexit deal is not reached by the end of the year, Bentley may stockpile more parts and close its factory for a few extra days, Hallmark said. The majority of Bentley's key parts, including engines and bodies, come from the European Union, primarily Germany. \"We may work for four days, or we may have a longer Christmas break and a longer Easter break if there is no deal, so that we can smooth the period between now and the middle of next year,\" Hallmark explained. BMW has already announced plans to shut its Mini plant for a month after the UK's departure from the EU on March 29, in an effort to minimize the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Britain's car manufacturers, many of which are foreign-owned, are concerned about the potential for tariffs and long delays in importing components. Over half (56%) of the parts used by British car manufacturers come from abroad, with the majority (79%) coming from the EU, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. \"In the best-case scenario, a no-deal Brexit would be an annoying impact on our annual profitability, while in the worst-case scenario, it would be quite damaging,\" Hallmark said. \"A full no-deal Brexit would hurt our company, limiting our ability to invest.\" Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's largest car manufacturer, warned last month that a hard Brexit could result in tens of thousands of job losses and cost the company £1.2 billion per year, wiping out its profits. Aston Martin has relocated approximately 2,000 staff to a three-day workweek at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands. The luxury car manufacturer is stockpiling engines in preparation for Brexit and is even considering airlifting components if motorway traffic to and from Dover becomes severely disrupted. A Bentley spokesperson confirmed that this contingency plan is also being considered by the company, although no such measures are currently in place. \"All options are being explored at this time,\" the spokesperson stated. This announcement comes as Bentley continues to struggle financially, with the company reporting a significant decline in sales. Between January 1 and September 30, Bentley sold 6,654 vehicles, a 12% decrease from the 7,498 vehicles sold during the same period the previous year. The company's sales revenue dropped to €1.1 billion (£980 million) from €1.3 billion, and its operating loss widened to €137 million from €31 million, largely due to exchange rate fluctuations and delays in the launch of the new Continental GT model.

The 182-year-old House of Fraser store, located on Deansgate, was on track to close its doors in January after Mike Ashley's Sports Direct failed to agree on new rental terms with the building's landlords. However, a deal was reached on Friday night, with the Manchester city council playing a crucial role. Council leader Sir Richard Leese praised the outcome, saying it was \"fantastic news for the city\" and that the council was proud to have played a constructive part in saving the iconic store and hundreds of jobs. Leese thanked all parties involved for their cooperation in the process.\n\nThe rescue deal comes as a welcome boost for Ashley, who is set to appear before MPs on the housing, communities and local government committee next week to discuss the future of the high street. Ashley has been vocal about his desire to see more done to support struggling high streets, and has called for landlords and politicians to take action. He bought House of Fraser out of administration in August for £90m and has since pledged to keep 23 of its 59 stores open. Ashley is currently in talks with landlords and has offered rock-bottom rents in some cases.\n\nIn a statement announcing the Kendals deal, Ashley said that when landlords, local authorities, and retailers work together, \"the outcomes can be outstanding.\" He added that the deal demonstrates that with cooperation, the high street can be revitalized. A massive Kendals store, spanning nearly 390,000 square feet, was acquired by a private investor in 2016 for £85 million. Manchester City Council had previously hailed the store as an institution, praising its iconic art deco design as a treasured aspect of the city's architectural heritage.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, the industry's professional body, warns that the public sector, including the NHS and schools, may face a shortage of skilled workers for up to seven more years, based on current demand. The Office for National Statistics recently revealed that the number of EU citizens arriving in the UK for work has reached a six-year low. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief UK policy director, commented on the situation, saying: \"These latest statistics underscore the ongoing trend of declining net EU migration, which is exacerbating skills shortages across all levels in the UK. In 2018, a staggering 92% of businesses cited Brexit as a major obstacle to recruiting and training staff. This means that hospitals, schools, and housebuilders are already struggling to find the staff they need. The proposed ban on overseas workers earning less than £30,000 will only make the situation worse.\" Research by the REC found that candidate availability is declining month by month, with 75% of employers reporting that they have little or no capacity to expand.

Osamu Masuko, CEO of Mitsubishi Motors, announced that the alliance will now be led by the heads of the three companies, rather than a single figurehead like Ghosn. Speaking in Tokyo, Masuko stated that the alliance's capital structure was not discussed during a recent meeting in Amsterdam, but changes to the governance structure are seen as a possibility. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three companies, has been in detention for 10 days and may be charged with a crime after his detention is extended for another 10 days. The arrest has raised questions about the future of the alliance, which has been led by Ghosn since its inception. While Nissan and Mitsubishi quickly removed Ghosn as chair of their respective boards, Renault chose not to do so and has allowed him to remain as chairman and CEO. The alliance's leadership, excluding Ghosn, met in Amsterdam for an operational review, which was scheduled before the arrest. The meeting focused on operational issues, including research and development, basic components, and technology sharing. A separate meeting of the Renault-Nissan BV board would be required to remove Ghosn from his position. In a joint statement, the three companies reaffirmed their commitment to the alliance, stating that they have \"all – individually and collectively – emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\" The statement added that the alliance has achieved significant success over the past two decades and remains committed to its goals. Car industry analysts have questioned whether Renault can maintain its dominant position in the alliance. Renault has a significant stake of 43.4% in Nissan, which in turn owns 15% of Renault and 34% of Mitsubishi. The alliance's combined output in 2017 reached 10.6 million cars. In recent years, Nissan has been the primary contributor to the alliance's profits, leading some analysts to speculate that any restructuring could result in a more prominent role for the company.

The meeting was marred by the sudden stoppage of the webcast, preventing those not in attendance from watching a debate about issues including Ridding's multimillion-pound pay package. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) chapel at the Financial Times had already reached a low point in its relations with management in the summer, when it emerged that Ridding had received a £2.6m salary while the newspaper made an operating profit of £5.2m. The backlash prompted Ridding to return about £500,000 of his pay, but the NUJ chapel has now passed a vote of no confidence in him, citing his failure to address serious concerns at the Financial Times. The chapel's statement accused Ridding of demonstrating a \"complete disregard for transparency\" by stopping the live broadcast, which prevented all staff from hearing the questions and responses.

In a recent interview, US President Donald Trump warned China that he plans to impose higher tariffs on Chinese goods, sending stock markets in London and New York tumbling on Tuesday. Trump's comments, published in the Wall Street Journal, made it \"highly unlikely\" that he would heed Beijing's call to refrain from increasing tariffs starting next year. This move would raise the existing 10% US import tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from January 1. Economists at Rabobank warn that if the US-China trade war escalates further, the global economy could suffer significantly over the next decade, potentially losing up to 2% of GDP growth by 2030. Senior economist Hugo Erken notes that an ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond their borders, with no real winners in a globalized economy. Trump's comments also suggested that Apple products, such as iPhones and laptops, could be subject to tariffs, despite previously being exempt. This sparked a sell-off in Apple shares, putting the company at risk of losing its title as the world's most valuable firm to Microsoft. Recent developments, including the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Mexico, and Canada, have helped to cool tensions between the White House and other countries. \"Despite previous optimism, Trump has recently hinted at imposing higher import tariffs on China.

In November 2016, attackers gained access to Uber's cloud servers using stolen credentials and downloaded 16 large files containing sensitive information, including the records of 35 million users worldwide. The compromised data included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and the location where they signed up, as well as drivers' weekly pay, trip summaries, and in some cases, driver's license numbers. The Information Commissioner's Office found that the breach was caused by inadequate information security measures and was exacerbated by Uber US's decision not to disclose the attack, instead opting to pay $100,000 to the hackers in a \"bug bounty\" arrangement. The ICO noted that this was not a typical bug bounty scenario, as the hackers maliciously exploited the vulnerability and stole personal data, rather than simply identifying and reporting the issue. As a result, none of the affected individuals were notified of the breach, and the company only began monitoring accounts for fraud 12 months later. The potential fine was reduced due to the fact that Uber's European branches were not informed of the breach, and there was no evidence that the compromised data was misused. In a related case, Uber US was ordered to pay $148 million for failing to notify drivers about the breach. \"We have implemented numerous technical enhancements to strengthen the security of our systems, both immediately following the incident and over the years since.

Wylie, who chose to waive his anonymity, described the tool as \"Steve Bannon's psychological warfare mindfuck tool\" and expressed concern about Cambridge Analytica's activities. The piece was part of a series of articles Cadwalladr has written on the subject, which have earned her numerous awards, including the Orwell journalism prize. The Foreign Press Association awards ceremony took place in London on Monday evening, where Cadwalladr was recognized for her work. Other winners included David Goldblatt and Daniel Nolan, who won the sports story of the year award for their Guardian long read on Viktor Orban's football obsession. Hannah Rae Armstrong was nominated for the same award for her Guardian long read on sheep fighting, and Sophie Elmhirst was shortlisted for the arts culture story of the year award for her Guardian long read on the woman who turns actors into stars.

According to the ABC, the payout was made in accordance with Guthrie's contractual entitlements, which were determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, a body that oversees the pay of federal public servants. The ABC confirmed the sum after verifying it with individuals involved in the negotiations.\n\nGuthrie was terminated by the ABC board just two years into her five-year term as managing director. The decision came after she clashed with former chairman Justin Milne over several issues, including allegations that he pressured her to consider political sensitivities in Canberra. The controversy led to Milne's resignation, and Guthrie has since launched a case against the ABC with the Fair Work Commission, alleging \"adverse action\" by the board.\n\nGuthrie, the first female managing director of the ABC, received a total remuneration package of $963,991 in the previous financial year. The $800,000 payout is likely to consist of entitlements such as superannuation, leave entitlements, and salary in lieu of notice. If Guthrie's case is successful, she could receive significantly more in damages.\n\nGuthrie and Milne have both been invited to appear before the Senate ABC inquiry on Friday, which is investigating allegations of political interference. Guthrie's spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.  ",

The target is Elysium Planitia, where the InSight probe will gently touch down to analyze seismic activity on the red planet. Despite sending more probes to Mars than any other planet, more than half of these missions have failed, with the final stages of landing proving particularly perilous. The thin Martian atmosphere, which is just 1% of Earth's, poses a significant challenge, as there is little friction to slow down a spacecraft. This has contributed to past failures, making NASA engineers nervous as they guide their $800 million InSight craft on a 300 million-mile journey to a tiny target zone measuring just 15 miles by 6 miles. If InSight passes through this precise keyhole, it should land in the middle of Elysium Planitia. However, it will still need a heat-resistant capsule, parachute, and rockets to slow down from 12,000mph to 5mph and ensure a soft and safe landing after a seven-minute descent. The most recent attempt to land on Mars was made two years ago by a European probe, which unfortunately crashed on the planet's surface. Despite this, NASA remains confident of success. The InSight mission, which stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, aims to help scientists understand the early evolution of Mars and other planets in the solar system, including Earth, by using instruments to probe deep beneath the planet's surface and measure temperatures and seismic activity.

In a recent experiment, scientists removed parts of the heart from both river and cave-dwelling fish of the species Astyanax mexicanus and found that while the river fish were able to regenerate tissue, the cave fish only developed scars. The salamander's remarkable ability to regrow a lost tail to its full length is a complex process that involves cells migrating to the wound and slowly regenerating the tail over the course of a few weeks. The regenerated tail is fully functional and identical to the original, with the spinal cord and nerves fully restored. The axolotl, a relative of the salamander, is even more impressive in its regenerative abilities, able to regrow not just its tail but also its limbs, skin, and almost any other body part. In fact, researchers have found that each time a limb is removed, it regrows almost perfectly, making the axolotl a valuable subject for studying human limb regeneration. Starfish, with their five limbs, are able to regrow arms that detach from their central disc, and some species have even been observed to regrow an entire body from a lost arm. To accomplish this, starfish store nutrients in the detached arm until they are able to regrow their mouth. The sea cucumber has a remarkable ability to rapidly mend its organs, regrowing damaged parts and healing deep wounds in as little as a week. This remarkable skill is crucial for the sea cucumber, as it often jettisons certain organs as a distraction technique to defend itself against predators like crabs and turtles.  ",

According to accounts filed at Companies House, Odey received £1.5m from Odey Asset Management in the year ending April 5, a 72% drop from the £5.5m he earned in the previous year. The hedge fund, which Odey founded in 1991, reported a 52% decline in profit to £8.8m, largely due to his bets against the pound and various UK retailers not yielding immediate results. Odey Asset Management has taken a £149m short position against UK shops, banks, estate agents, and property companies. However, the fund has performed exceptionally well in recent months, as the pound has continued to fall and the share prices of several British businesses Odey bet against have plummeted. The fund has gained more than 50% so far this year, including a 7% return in October, making it one of the world's top-performing hedge funds, according to the Financial Times. Last month, the fund made millions from a bet against Intu, the shopping centre owner, whose shares dropped 42% after a proposed takeover collapsed. Odey also benefited from a £33m bet against Debenhams, whose shares have declined by 85% over the past year. Odey was a prominent supporter of the Brexit campaign and donated almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit efforts. He made huge bets against the pound and government bonds leading up to the June 2016 referendum and reportedly made an estimated £220m profit when the pound collapsed following the leave victory. The day after the referendum, Odey told the BBC that he felt like he was experiencing the Italian expression \"Il mattino ha l'oro in bocca\" (the morning has gold in its mouth), and that he has since boasted that each day of Brexit-related political crisis is a \"good day\" for him and his hedge fund. \"He recently told the Times that he had a good day, despite the pound falling 2% that day. According to him, bad days often work in his favor. He has consistently called for Prime Minister Theresa May to resign and has expressed a desire for Boris Johnson to take her place.\" ",

The crash occurred when servers controlling Alexa became overwhelmed with questions and requests, causing the digital butler to respond with a generic message: \"Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you right now.\" The outage, which began around 10am GMT, left Amazon customers unable to play festive music, turn on their living room lights, or access cooking instructions for Christmas dinner. Richard Hyland, a Twitter user, sarcastically remarked: \"What a perfect time for Amazon's Alexa to crash - just when people might want to register new devices, play music, or access recipes.\" Alexa functions by sending voice commands from an Amazon Echo device to a server, where a computer interprets them. The instructions are then sent back to the Echo, which plays music, reads the weather, and performs tasks such as turning on lights. Around lunchtime, Amazon's customer service account tweeted that some Echo devices in Europe had experienced intermittent connectivity issues over the past two hours, but assured customers that the issues had since been resolved. An Amazon spokesperson later confirmed that the company had experienced a brief issue that intermittently affected some Alexa customers' ability to interact with the service, but said the Alexa service was now operating normally.

As someone who's not always great at identifying a clear winner, I've often found myself at odds with car designers when it comes to aesthetics. In fact, I've previously deemed the Porsche Cayenne, Nissan Juke, and Range Rover Evoque to be three of the ugliest cars of the past decade - yet all three have gone on to achieve massive success. The latest iteration of the baby Range Rover is likely to be even more popular than its predecessor, which is now in its second generation as a compact SUV. While some elements remain the same, such as the clamshell bonnet and bulging wheel arches, the overall design has matured, becoming more sophisticated, clean, and less pretentious. Under the hood, significant changes have been made, including the addition of mild-hybrid systems to all automatic variants, which will reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. One of the most impressive new features is the \"ClearSight Ground View\" system, which uses cameras on the side mirrors and front axle to provide a \"through-the-bonnet\" view on the infotainment screen, designed to eliminate those \"blind faith\" moments when navigating steep slopes or tight parking spaces.

Official statistics revealed that the economy recovered from the cold winter earlier in the year, as consumers splurged during the World Cup and a prolonged heatwave. However, more detailed data from the Office for National Statistics showed that consumers, burdened by rising utility bills and transportation costs, had to rely on their savings to maintain their spending habits, as their disposable income remained stagnant. According to Rob Kent-Smith, statistician at the ONS, households have spent more than they earned for an unprecedented eighth consecutive quarter, raising concerns about their ability to sustain their spending and drive the economy. Recent surveys have fueled concerns that consumer spending is losing momentum, with several high street retailers reporting dismal sales in November. The online retailer Asos's surprise profit warning has added to these concerns, as analysts had grown accustomed to web-based operators weathering the spending downturn. Business investment has declined for the third consecutive quarter, a trend not seen since the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. This cumulative effect is expected to reduce GDP growth in the final quarter of 2018 to nearly zero. The Bank of England attributed the decline in business investment to Brexit uncertainty, although the risk of border disruptions has led to increased spending on warehousing and port capacity. Companies are stockpiling goods at their highest level since 2016, suggesting they are under pressure to build large inventories in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit. Earlier on Friday, the GfK monthly health check found consumer confidence at its lowest level in five years, and a Lloyds bank monitor registered the lowest business morale since the 2016 Brexit referendum. The Bank of England lowered its growth forecasts on Thursday, predicting quarterly expansion of 0.2% for the last three months of 2018 and the first three months of 2019.  ",

The protest, which began on Friday afternoon, has locked down Broadcasting House, preventing BBC staff and guests from entering or leaving the building. Security personnel are keeping the protesters, who are calling for a meeting with the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, away from the entrance. The activists, who are demanding that the BBC broadcast about climate change with the same level of urgency as it did during World War II, have also organized protests at BBC offices in several other cities, including Bristol, Glasgow, Cambridge, Birmingham, Truro, Sheffield, Bangor, and Berlin. The campaign group, which launched two months ago, has gained international attention and support from public figures, including former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Since its launch, Extinction Rebellion has used civil disobedience tactics, including blocking bridges and gluing themselves to government buildings, to draw attention to the threat of climate and ecological change. The BBC has faced criticism for its coverage of climate change, particularly for giving airtime to climate change skeptics, such as Lord Lawson, who disagree with the scientific consensus. In response, the head of news, Fran Unsworth, has acknowledged that the corporation has struggled to get climate change coverage right, saying that \"climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.\" She emphasized that to maintain impartiality, the BBC doesn't need to feature individuals who deny climate change; it's similar to not including someone who disputes Manchester United's 2-0 win last Saturday.

According to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK auto industry lobby group, UK car factories produced 1.52 million vehicles last year, a 9.1% drop from 2017. Production for the domestic market fell by 16.3%, while investment in British car manufacturing almost halved to £588.6 million, the lowest level since 2012. The SMMT attributed this decline to Brexit uncertainty, with Mike Hawes, the organization's CEO, stating that \"investment is effectively stalled\" and that the industry is waiting to see what happens before making further investments. The global automotive industry is already facing multiple challenges, including declining car sales in China and a slump in demand for diesel vehicles in Europe. However, UK-based manufacturers are particularly concerned about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on their businesses, which rely heavily on \"just-in-time\" deliveries of parts. Delays at the border could be costly and risk British jobs, according to Hawes. He emphasized that Brexit uncertainty has already caused significant damage to output, investment, and jobs, and that severing frictionless trade links with the EU and other global markets could have devastating consequences. The SMMT analysis revealed that two-thirds of UK car exports go to countries with preferential trading arrangements, including the EU and the US, which would default to less favorable World Trade Organization terms if there is no transition period. EU countries accounted for more than half of the UK's car exports in 2018. Some major parts manufacturers, such as Germany's Schaeffler, have already cited Brexit as a reason for relocating jobs abroad. Ford's European president, Steven Armstrong, recently refused to rule out the possibility of closing plants that employ thousands of workers if a no-deal Brexit occurs. Hawes dismissed claims made by some Brexit-supporting MPs that German carmakers will pressure the EU to offer the UK a better deal than currently on the table, calling them \"utter nonsense\". He also expressed skepticism about the idea of a managed no-deal Brexit without a transition period, describing it as a \"fantasy\". Hawes joked that if this scenario is considered \"Project Fear\", then they are successfully making it a reality. ",

This mortgage is not suitable for anyone without a family member who has a spare chunk of cash they're willing to use to help them get on the housing ladder.

This figure jumps to a whopping 40% for mothers of two children. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from Manchester and Essex universities, analyzed biological data from 6,025 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, the largest survey of its kind worldwide. The researchers controlled for various factors that could influence the results, such as age, ethnicity, education, occupation, and income, to isolate the impact of working hours and family conditions on stress levels. The study, published in the journal Sociology, found that neither working from home nor having flexible working hours had a significant effect on women's chronic stress levels. However, reducing the number of working hours did have a positive impact on stress levels. According to the researchers, work-family conflict is a significant contributor to increased psychological strain, stress, and decreased wellbeing. Parents of young children are particularly vulnerable to work-family conflict, which can have adverse effects on their stress responses. The study's findings are based on 11 biomarkers that measure the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems, which can indicate poor health and increased risk of death. The researchers conclude that chronic stress, resulting from repeated stressful events and combinations of social and environmental stressors, can have a significant impact on overall health. A recent study revealed that women working full-time while raising two children had biomarkers indicating chronic stress, including hormone levels and blood pressure, that were 40% higher compared to women working full-time with no children. Women working full-time with one child had 18% higher levels of stress than those with no children. According to Dr. Benzeval, flexible work practices aim to help employees achieve a better work-life balance, which should reduce work-family conflict. While the study found that reduced-hours flexible work arrangements did help moderate the relationship between family and work stressors, there was limited evidence that flexible work arrangements, such as flexplace or flextime, were associated with lower chronic stress responses. Notably, the researchers also discovered that reduced work hours could lead to lower chronic stress markers for fathers. ",

According to the latest report from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly distributive trades survey, retail businesses increased their stock-to-sales ratio in January to its highest level since February 2008. The report, closely monitored by the Bank of England for early indicators of the UK economy, reveals that retailers anticipate a decline in demand and have built up inventory in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit at the end of March. As the UK's exit from the EU remains uncertain, a growing number of companies are intensifying their plans for a potentially chaotic no-deal Brexit. Luxury carmaker Bentley and retailers such as Dixons Carphone and Pets at Home have announced measures to secure their supplies in the event of disruptions at British ports. According to Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, \"We're seeing early signs of companies preparing for a no-deal Brexit, with some wholesalers reporting that they're stockpiling in case the UK exits the EU without a deal.\" The CBI's distributive trades survey, which has been running since 1983, polled 103 retailers, wholesalers, and motor traders between December 27 and January 14. These companies represent a third of all employment in retailing. January sales volumes stabilized after a challenging festive trading period, but were still below average for the time of year, marking one of the worst periods since 2011. Sales of clothing, footwear, and leather goods, as well as hardware and DIY items, declined, while grocers and online sales reported increased volumes. The CBI predicts a more optimistic outlook for the coming month, with retailers expecting sales volumes and orders to rise in the year to February. According to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"Retailers should be experiencing a surge in sales right now, thanks to the increasing pace of real wage growth and the ongoing growth in employment. However, the heightened uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which is reflected in the sharp decline in consumer confidence surveys towards the end of last year, is prompting consumers to be more cautious in their spending habits.\" ",

According to a report from TV measurement body Barb, Netflix now has 9.7 million UK subscribers, compared to Amazon's Prime Video service, which has around 4.9 million users. The report reveals that Netflix added 2.2 million new subscribers in the year to the end of the third quarter 2018, more than double the 1.1 million subscribers Amazon gained during the same period. Netflix's growth has been fueled by a $13 billion budget for producing and licensing TV shows and films.\n\nThe report also highlights that while Netflix remains the most popular streaming service, Amazon has managed to attract a significant number of subscribers with families who have young children. This may be due to Amazon's unique offering, which bundles its video service with its Prime subscription package, which includes perks such as one-day delivery and access to Amazon Music. The report suggests that the presence of young children and the convenience of on-demand content and next-day delivery may be enticing families towards Amazon.\n\nOverall, the UK's three largest subscription video-on-demand services - Netflix, Amazon, and Sky's Now TV - have added 3.45 million customers over the year, taking their combined total to 16.2 million. This represents a 27% annual increase and is more than the number of subscribers to traditional pay-TV packages from providers such as Sky, BT, Virgin Media, and TalkTalk. Sky's Now TV, in particular, has seen a significant increase, adding almost 200,000 customers to reach a total of 1.6 million subscribers. According to Barb's report, there has been a significant surge in the number of UK households that subscribe to two or more paid streaming services, increasing by 40% year-on-year from 2.8 million to 4 million. In the third quarter, nearly 12 million UK households had access to at least one of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Sky's Now TV, representing a 22% year-on-year growth. The report also highlights a notable increase in the daily viewing time on services like Netflix, which rose by 17% year-on-year to 46 minutes. Interestingly, the 16- to 24-year-old age group spends significantly more time watching content each day, averaging 63 minutes. ",

        "Text": "Metro Bank's shares plummeted to record lows on Wednesday, following the lender's surprise announcement that it needs to raise an additional £350 million just months after its previous capital increase. The high street challenger also revealed that it is under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority over a significant accounting error that was first disclosed last month. The news was made public alongside the bank's annual results on Tuesday night. Metro Bank's share price continued to fall on Wednesday, dropping by over 26% to around 950p just before the London market closed. The company's shares have lost half their value since the accounting issue was revealed. In January, Metro Bank confirmed that hundreds of millions of pounds in commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been misclassified in terms of risk. While the bank initially claimed to have discovered the error on its own, it later emerged that the Prudential Regulation Authority had actually caught the mistake. In response to the debacle, CEO Craig Donaldson has decided to forgo his annual bonus, which was worth £800,000 in 2017. He has also offered to resign, but has been given the full backing of the board and will remain in his position. After apologizing to investors, Donaldson denied that the latest capital raise was influenced by the loans misclassification. The bank raised £303 million from investors last July, after which Donaldson ruled out further capital increases to fuel the lender's growth in the medium term. When asked to respond to criticism over his change of heart, Donaldson said that the bank would always seek to raise capital when it was in its best interests and that the recent decision was made to raise capital ahead of the bank's growth. John Cronin, a financial analyst at Goodbody, described the recent slowdown in deposit growth and Metro Bank's consistent need for more core capital as \"serious concerns\". \"He noted that it's still uncertain how the stock will perform in the coming days, but predicted that shares could drop to 729p. Royal London Asset Management, a major shareholder in Metro Bank, expressed concerns about the recent accounting error, citing it as a warning sign for investors. 'Governance issues often serve as a warning sign, and this case is no exception,' said the company. 'We are requesting a meeting with Metro Bank to discuss the steps they are taking to alleviate shareholder concerns and strengthen their governance and accounting practices.'\" ",

The study by the Resolution Foundation found that the retail industry has the highest rate of redundancies in the economy, with a sharp increase in shop closures across the country. The report comes as major high street retailers such as Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, and HMV announce job cuts and store closures. The decline in consumer spending, exacerbated by inflation following the Brexit vote, and changing shopping habits have all contributed to the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar stores, which typically employ more workers. The study revealed that a worrying 31% of retail workers who lose their jobs end up unemployed, compared to the average of 26% across all industries. Furthermore, two in five former retail workers are unemployed for at least six months, with younger workers facing greater risks. The report found that three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30, despite this age group making up only a third of the retail workforce. According to Daniel Tomlinson, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, \"life has become tougher for those leaving retail, who are more likely to find themselves unemployed – and for longer, too.\" While policymakers cannot reverse the shift towards online shopping, they can and should focus on supporting those most affected. The study also found that there has been a long-term decline in retail employment in the UK since 2003, with the number of jobs in the sector shrinking from 10.8% to 9.5% of the overall workforce, equivalent to 320,000 missing positions. \"Contrary to the stereotype of being a 'nation of shopkeepers', Britain now has a lower proportion of workers in wholesale and retail compared to Germany, according to the report. Despite multiple rounds of job cuts, the job market has adapted by creating new opportunities in industries such as hospitality and social care, although the increasing redundancy rate presents new challenges. The report also notes that the retail sector remains a low-paying industry, with the average hourly wage of £8.80 being approximately a third lower than the average pay across the entire economy, which stands at £12.73 per hour.\" ",

The consumer group advises travelers to pack essentials like food, water, and even nappies to help them survive prolonged delays. Alicante airport, which serves popular resorts like Benidorm, is expected to be the most severely affected, with visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote, and Málaga also likely to experience significant delays. Which? estimates that if EU airports spend an extra 90 seconds processing each UK passport, it could add five hours to the processing time for a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers. Alicante airport is particularly vulnerable due to its high volume of UK arrivals, processing up to 10 planes from the UK in a single hour. In total, 2.9 million British passport holders pass through the airport each year. While Portugal has announced plans to introduce special UK lanes at Faro airport and Funchal to facilitate fast-track access for British passport holders, regardless of the Brexit outcome, Spain has yet to confirm its position. Rory Boland, travel editor at Which?, warns that airports can be chaotic even in normal circumstances, and a no-deal Brexit could lead to extremely long queues. Until a deal is reached or airports announce alternative arrangements, travelers should prepare for the possibility of lengthy queues and pack accordingly, including essentials like food, water, and baby supplies. The analysis was based on data from the European Tourism Association (ETOA). According to the UK government's official advice in the event of a no-deal scenario, British tourists would not be entitled to use the designated lanes for EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals. They may be required to present a return or onward ticket and could face additional checks to ensure they have sufficient funds to cover the duration of their visit. Despite the potential challenges, Aena, Spain's largest airport operator, does not anticipate chaos at airports this summer, citing the high stakes involved. In fact, Aena believes that once the initial uncertainty is resolved, UK traffic can continue to thrive in both the short and long term. ",

The FTSE 250-listed company has revealed that it is actively discussing the disposal of assets exceeding its £500 million target for 2019, following the sale of £570 million in property last year at an average price 7% below its book value in December 2017. The company is under pressure from activist investor Elliott Advisors, which owns a 5% stake, to accelerate its disposal plans after a 9.3% decline in property values in 2018. Hammerson's tenants include Patisserie Valerie, which recently avoided administration after a management buyout, as well as House of Fraser and New Look, which have both undergone company voluntary arrangements to avoid insolvency. The latter two have been forced to close stores and seek rent reductions from their landlords.\n\nHammerson's CEO, David Atkins, acknowledged that 2018 was a challenging year, particularly in the UK, due to tenant failures, structural shifts in retail, and a more cautious consumer. He noted that the company's destinations outside of the UK performed better, with a strong contribution from premium outlets. Hammerson's annual adjusted profit fell by 2.4% to £240.3 million, despite abandoning a planned £3.4 billion buyout of rival Intu and fending off a £4.9 billion takeover approach from Klépierre. The company has focused on its flagship malls as it navigates the shift to online shopping, citing the continued popularity of such centers for \"big day out\" experiences and strong growth in luxury sales. Elliott supports Hammerson's accelerated asset disposal program and the company's decision to add two independent non-executive directors to a new investment and disposal committee. Since June, Hammerson has used the sale proceeds to reduce its debt by £179m, bringing the total debt down to £3.4bn. The company plans to further reduce its debt to below £3bn by the end of the year. ",

Was this decision a good one? The answer is likely self-evident. Joe, the owner of Joe's Music, a small musical instrument and accessory shop in Willoughby, Ohio, made the declaration in a recent Facebook post. In the post, he wrote, \"Dear Trump sympathizers, I'm truly sorry, but I feel unclean and dirty accepting money from you. Please, politely shop somewhere else. I'd rather starve and close the store than participate in wrongdoing.\" He also posted a similar message on his shop's front door, essentially telling Trump supporters to stay away. The reaction was swift and overwhelming, with both supporters and detractors weighing in on social media and via phone calls. While some people expressed support for Joe's decision, others threatened him and his business. The police have had to increase their presence around his store as a result. Joe was caught off guard by the intense attention and ultimately backed down from his comments, removing the sign, deleting the Facebook post, and issuing an apology. He acknowledged that he had been insensitive to the feelings of Trump supporters and apologized for hurting them. However, the damage had already been done, and the news had gone viral. The incident serves as a cautionary tale for small business owners who may not be prepared for the intense political backlash that can come with taking a public stance. It's a reminder that taking a stand in politics requires a certain kind of personality and a thick skin. Joe should have stuck to his music, as he now faces the daunting task of rebuilding his business. Hopefully, this incident will soon fade from memory, and he can return to doing what he does best. However, the experience serves as a valuable lesson for small business owners who wish to engage in politics: think carefully before taking a public stance, as the reaction may be unexpected and costly. In Joe's case, his political views may ultimately alienate half of his customer base, depending on their stance on the president. It's clear that politics and small business don't mix. Instead of voicing his opinions, Joe would be wise to focus on understanding how Trump's policies will impact his trade and finding ways to benefit or adapt to them. His political views are best left for the voting booth. ",

You half expect to see someone sporting a vintage mutton-chop or waxed moustache queuing up at Morrisons or Arthur Conan Doyle filling up his Prius at the local petrol station. In the late 19th century, Cromer and its neighboring towns, Overstrand and East Runton, were the epitome of luxury, earning Overstrand the nickname \"village of millionaires.\" Today, the area is still dotted with large, beautifully restored homes in the Arts and Crafts style.\n\nWhile Cromer may have lost some of its former luster over the years, it has undergone significant revitalization efforts. The municipal gardens are now sparkling, and the streets are filled with independent shops. While the town still has its share of shabby areas, its unique character remains intact. Visitors can still enjoy the town's famous crabs, the stunning tower of St Peter and St Paul, the historic boarding houses clinging to the cliffs, and the picturesque lanes of fishermen's homes. The town's pier, in particular, is a standout, with its fin-de-siècle architecture and stunning views of the North Sea.\n\nOf course, Cromer is not without its drawbacks. It is located a significant distance from major cities and has limited motorway access. Additionally, coastal erosion is a concern in the area.\n\nFor those who do make the trip, there are plenty of amenities to enjoy. The town has several excellent primary and secondary schools, and the local train station offers regular services to Norwich and other nearby towns.

The Saatchi Gallery in London will be the sole UK venue for a global tour of 150 original artifacts from Tutankhamun's tomb, including 60 that have never left Egypt before. The tour marks the centennial anniversary of British explorer Howard Carter's sensational discovery of the boy pharaoh's tomb in 1922. After the tour, the treasures will be permanently displayed at the newly built Grand Egyptian Museum near the pyramids of Giza. \"Come and see them while you can,\" urged Mostafa Waziry, secretary general of the Egyptian ministry of state for antiquities. \"Visit them before they return to Egypt forever.\" The exhibition will feature a gold-inlaid miniature coffin containing the king's liver, a gilded wooden bed with lion feet, and a gilded wooden shrine depicting intimate scenes of royal domestic harmony. One of two life-sized guardian statues of the king, which flanked the sealed entrance to his burial chamber, will also make its debut outside of Cairo. Unfortunately, Tutankhamun's famous golden death mask will not be part of the show. The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb is considered one of the most significant archaeological finds in history. Carter's account of the moment he first laid eyes on the tomb's treasures is still awe-inspiring: \"Details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold – everywhere the glint of gold... I was struck dumb with amazement.\" When some of these treasures left Cairo for a 1972 exhibition at the British Museum, a record 1.6 million people visited, resulting in chaotic queues. The treasures from the tomb last appeared in London in 2007 at the O2, and the revenue from that exhibition was used to protect Egypt's antiquities and monuments. The 2020 exhibition will depart from previous ones by delving into the symbolism and importance of the king's burial artifacts. According to Philippa Adams, director of the Saatchi Gallery, \"The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb is a timeless tale known globally, and this exhibition will showcase these historic treasures in an innovative and immersive manner. We're thrilled and honored to host this culturally significant exhibition.\" The touring exhibition, which began in Los Angeles last year, will visit 10 cities worldwide. The Saatchi Gallery will host \"Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh\" from November 2, 2019, to May 3, 2020. ",

Epic Games has confirmed that it has suspended its ad campaigns on the Google-owned platform, joining Nestlé in temporarily halting its advertising on the site amid the latest controversy surrounding inappropriate content. A YouTube user named Matt Watson recently posted a video exposing a \"wormhole\" that leads to a softcore pedophile ring on the site. Watson demonstrated how, with a new YouTube account, users can easily find videos filled with provocative comments about children. He stated in the video, \"Pedophiles are trading social media contacts, sharing links to actual child pornography in YouTube comments, and trading unlisted videos in secret. YouTube's algorithm, due to a glitch in its programming, is facilitating their ability to do this.\" The scandal poses a significant challenge for YouTube, as the videos themselves are not necessarily problematic. Most of the videos feature young girls engaging in innocent activities, such as playing, exercising at home, or participating in gymnastics. The issue lies in the comments section, where YouTube users have left sexually suggestive messages and shared tips on how to take compromising still images of the children while pausing the videos. After watching a few such videos on a new YouTube account, Watson described how the site's algorithm would serve up an endless stream of videos featuring apparently underage children with inappropriate comments in the comments section. Many of these videos were also accompanied by ads from major brands like Nestlé, Fortnite, and Disney. The reaction to the story from the broader YouTube community has been mixed, with some prominent YouTubers accusing Watson of overreacting and criticizing him for going public with his claims that pedophiles were using the site's comments section. YouTubers accuse Watson of attempting to drive away advertisers, which would deprive them of their significant income and potentially trigger an \"adpocalypse\". This accusation is reminiscent of previous instances where large advertisers withdrew their support from the platform due to concerns about YouTube's inability to ensure their ads did not appear alongside disturbing or inappropriate content, such as videos from terrorist organizations or hate groups. In response to the latest allegations, a YouTube spokesperson stated: \"We condemn any content that endangers minors as abhorrent and have clear policies prohibiting such content on our platform. We have taken swift action by deleting accounts and channels, reporting illegal activity to the authorities, and disabling comments on tens of millions of videos that feature minors. While there is still more work to be done, we are committed to improving our systems to detect and prevent abuse more effectively.\" ",

In a pre-vote press conference, Dunkerton confidently declared, \"I'm confident we'll win,\" as he seeks to rejoin the company he left last year. The multimillionaire entrepreneur received a late boost to his campaign, with two key shareholders, Investec and Schroders, appearing to back his bid to regain control. The duo, who control around 10% of Superdry's shares, join Dunkerton and designer James Holder, who founded the fashion label in 2003, in their fight against the company's current management. Holder is also seeking to return to designing clothes for the brand, which has struggled with declining sales and profits. To succeed, Dunkerton needs to secure a simple majority of votes cast on Tuesday. However, one insider suggests that the outcome is far from certain, saying, \"It could go either way.\" The tension ahead of the vote was heightened on Friday when Schroders refused to commit to supporting Dunkerton, stating that it would make its decision based on the best interests of its clients and the company. Superdry has received public backing from Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds around 10% of the company's shares, as well as from proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Pirc, whose views influence passive investment funds. \"Sutherland, who stands at 6ft 6in, is reportedly prepared to defend himself against Dunkerton's accusations, which include being out of his depth in the fashion industry and leading a failed strategy. Superdry rose to fame in the 2000s by selling branded hoodies and vintage T-shirts, but Sutherland believes the brand needs to evolve and move forward. However, it's clear why Dunkerton is upset, given that his 18% stake has lost over £150m in value since he left the company, and the company's market value has plummeted so severely that it has been removed from the FTSE 250 index. The stakes are high on Tuesday, as Superdry has warned shareholders that Dunkerton's return will likely lead to a mass exodus of board directors.

In addition to his research on the peasantry, he made significant contributions to the study of Russian émigrés in Britain during the final decades of the Tsarist regime. Born in Richmond, south-west London, John was adopted by Henrietta (née Grundy) and Albert Slatter, a wine taster. He attended Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith and later read Russian and French at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1966. It was during his time at Cambridge that I became close friends with John. In the summer of 1964, we traveled to Moscow to attend a language course, and it was on that trip that I introduced him to Irene Gottlieb, a student of Russian at the University of London. They were married on July 30, 1966, the day England won the World Cup. After completing his master's degree in social sciences and PhD on the peasantry and rural Soviets in the early years of Soviet power at the University of Birmingham, John joined the Centre for Russian and East European Studies as a lecturer in Russian history and language at the University of Durham, where he spent the remainder of his academic career. Irene, who was also a Russian language teacher, joined him at the university. John was a fit and active individual as a student, but in his 40s, he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. As his health declined, he continued to engage with Russian culture and current events through films, satellite television, and documentaries, and he maintained his love of music, which spanned classical, jazz, and beyond. It was John who first introduced me to the music of Charles Aznavour and Mozart's sublime G minor Piano Quartet. After retiring in 2003, John and Irene continued to spend their summers in Antibes, France, until recently. \"John, despite his own health challenges, was a devoted and supportive partner to Irene, who faced significant health issues.

        "Text": "Global financial markets plummeted on Friday, driven by growing concerns about a slowdown in the global economy, after eurozone factory output plummeted at its fastest rate in nearly six years. The sharp losses on European and Wall Street stock exchanges came after data showed that economic growth in the European single currency bloc remained weak in the first quarter of 2019, dispelling hopes of a rebound from a weak finish to last year. Economists attributed the poor industrial output figures to a slowdown in China and the global economy, raising the prospect that growth for the rest of 2019 would be weaker than expected. The New York stock market slumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped 2% and markets across Europe suffered steep losses. The IHS Markit flash purchasing managers' index for euro area factory output, which tracks early warning signs of economic stress, showed that output contracted the most since December 2012, a period marked by the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis. Analysts attributed the decline to disruptions caused by Brexit, but noted that faltering demand for exports amid the US-China trade dispute had a more significant impact. Germany's manufacturing sector, which has increasingly relied on exports to China in recent years, recorded its steepest decline in output in seven years, with new factory orders deteriorating to the greatest extent since the financial crisis. Much of Germany's industry woes are linked to China's slowing economy, which was triggered by US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on Chinese goods in a bitter trade standoff with Beijing. Chinese car sales fell for the first time in almost 30 years last year, a significant blow to several German car manufacturers, which rely heavily on China as their largest export market. Germany narrowly avoided recession last year, and the PMI index, compiled by surveying around 5,000 companies across the euro area, showed that Germany and France were the worst performers. Other parts of the eurozone recorded stronger growth. According to Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, the survey suggests that the economy is expected to grow by around 0.2% in the first quarter. Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, notes that the bigger picture is that the eurozone economy is still moving at a slow pace, with Germany's manufacturing recession and Italy's broader downturn holding the region back.

        "Text": "Airbnb has taken a significant step towards avoiding strict national regulations after an advisor to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) recommended that the company be classified as a digital service provider. According to Maciej Szpunar, one of the ECJ's advocates general, Airbnb should be considered an information society service, which would allow it to operate freely across the EU. Szpunar rejected claims by a French tourism association that Airbnb should be subject to the same accounting, insurance, and financial obligations as traditional real estate providers. Airbnb, which is registered in Ireland, argues that its commercial activities in matching property owners with guests seeking accommodation do not constitute real estate brokerage. Szpunar stated that the French government had failed to properly notify the European Commission and Irish authorities of its intention to apply French law to Airbnb. He described the company as an online service that connects potential guests with hosts offering short-term accommodation. It remains unclear what the ECJ's opinion would have been if the French authorities had made the required notification. The opinion is non-binding, but the ECJ typically follows the advice of its advocates general in 80% of cases. Airbnb welcomed the opinion, saying it provides a clear overview of the applicable rules. The development is likely to benefit Airbnb, which has been fighting claims from cities worldwide, including Paris, Amsterdam, and Barcelona, that its services are changing neighborhoods and require stricter regulation. France is Airbnb's largest market after the US, and Paris is its biggest single city market, with approximately 65,000 listed homes. An Airbnb spokesperson said: \"We appreciate the advocate general's opinion, which provides a clear overview of the rules applicable to collaborative economy platforms like Airbnb and how these rules foster opportunities for consumers. We also aim to be good partners, having worked with over 500 governments worldwide to help hosts share their homes, follow the rules, and pay their fair share of taxes.\" \"Moving forward, our goal is to collaborate with all stakeholders to prioritize the needs and benefits of local communities in the development of sustainable travel practices for the 21st century.\"\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments!

Do you grasp it firmly and enthusiastically to show your eagerness? Do you take it gingerly to demonstrate respect? Or do you opt for something more unique, like a secret handshake? According to Nilesh Dosa, a youth mentor at Ernst & Young, schools are failing to teach young people the fundamental skills they need to succeed in interviews, including proper handshaking techniques. \"We're producing academically talented students who lack the essential skills for the workforce,\" he says. Etiquette consultant Jo Bryant agrees, emphasizing that a strong handshake is crucial in making a good impression. \"You can have all the qualifications in the world, but if you enter an interview with poor body language, eye contact, and a weak handshake, you won't get the job,\" she warns. \"Your interviewer needs to like you and want to be around you.\" So, what is the correct way to shake hands? Bryant advises: \"Maintain eye contact, be firm, and ensure your palms are together. Avoid bone-crushing, but also don't be too limp - that's a sign of underconfidence.\" She notes that a handshake that's too limp can feel like an empty gesture, while one that's too firm can be seen as arrogant. And what about sweaty hands? Unfortunately, they're hard to avoid, but Bryant suggests striking a balance between confidence and humility to make a positive impression. \"When interacting with someone, you can discreetly wipe your hands before meeting them, not in their presence. Avoid using dominating body language, such as placing your hand on top of theirs or clasping their forearm. Bryant advises being natural and not trying too hard, as this can come across as wooden. To improve your handshaking skills, she recommends practicing with a friend and seeking feedback. This may seem unusual, but it's similar to how you would practice other social skills. Just as you would with any other skill, you can practice handshaking with a friend and get feedback on whether you're doing it correctly.\" ",

The sale, expected to be completed by the end of June, includes the Newcastle Herald, the Land, and Queensland Country Life. The company will retain a commercial relationship with the new owners and will continue to print some of its metropolitan mastheads, such as the Sydney Morning Herald, in regional areas. According to Hugh Marks, CEO of Nine, the sale aligns with the company's strategy to exit non-core businesses and focus on its digital assets. Marks stated that Nine will continue to work with the new owners where there are mutual benefits to both parties.\n\nAntony Catalano, the former boss of Domain, had previously attempted to block the sale of Fairfax to Nine by buying up to 19.9% of Fairfax shares. The deal includes $10 million worth of advertising for Nine in ACM properties over the next three years. The ACM group of newspapers was previously owned by Rural Press and was sold to Fairfax Media in 2007 for $3 billion.\n\nMarks had flagged the potential sale of the community papers soon after the merger with Fairfax last year. Nine is still in the market to sell its remaining former Fairfax properties, Stuff and Events. Marks told staff that Catalano and Thorney Investment Group saw the \"future potential\" of the newspapers, which no longer fit into Nine's national advertising strategy. \"'They have a unique opportunity to achieve their future goals in a way that a publicly traded company like Nine might not be able to,' Marks said. 'I think the change in ownership is a positive development and sets the company up for success in the future.' Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance media director Katelin McInerney urged Catalano and Thorney to prioritize job security, fair working conditions, and editorial independence. 'There are approximately 650 editorial staff employed across the country by the ACM group,' McInerney said. 'It's crucial that the individual audiences for each of the group's mastheads are respected. 'The ACM mastheads have fiercely loyal readers. The newspapers must continue to provide local news, information, and entertainment to the communities they serve. Their readers are entitled to have local editorial content, not generic news generated elsewhere.'\" ",

While some may dismiss it as a fringe belief, the US Navy is taking the matter seriously, reportedly preparing new guidelines to encourage pilots to report any \"unexplained aerial phenomena\" without fear of ridicule. The term \"unidentified flying objects\" is no longer sufficient; from now on, we'll refer to these events as \"unexplained aerial phenomena.\"\n\nThe concept of alien abductions was popularized in the 1990s through TV shows like \"The X-Files,\" which led many to believe that extraterrestrial life was real. However, it's been revealed that the characters Mulder and Scully were fictional, leaving some to wonder how people continue to claim alien abductions. The answer is simple: people are wrong. Or is it?\n\nDr. Young-hae Chi, a lecturer at Oxford University, takes the alien abduction theory seriously, despite not being a psychologist or materials scientist. He teaches Korean at the faculty of oriental studies, but has also spoken at conferences about the topic. In a 2012 lecture, he disputed the idea that visiting aliens have sinister plans to take over the world, instead proposing that their secret breeding program to create alien-human hybrids is a noble effort to save humanity from environmental disaster.\n\nDr. Chi has written a book expanding on his theories, but critics may question whether he has any concrete evidence to support his claims. While the recent warming of the Earth is well-documented, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of an alien breeding program. While some alleged alien abductees claim to have experienced \"sexually oriented actions with aliens or other human abductees under mind control,\" I remain skeptical. Apparently, some recall seeing jars containing hybrid toddlers and fetuses on the alleged alien spaceships. I acknowledge that these individuals may have undergone a traumatic experience, but is there any concrete evidence to support the existence of aliens? Unfortunately, the lack of detectable evidence may be due to the fact that aliens allegedly reside in a different dimension. This sounds similar to the concept of ghosts, which are also often associated with unexplained phenomena. While it's true that \"the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence,\" I believe it's also important to consider the quality of the evidence presented. ",

Lebedev and his father, Alexander, won the highly competitive bid for the license to launch London's first dedicated TV channel six years ago, a prized asset in the government's plan to establish dozens of local TV channels across the UK. The license was considered the most valuable TV license to be awarded since Channel 5 in 1997. A glamorous launch party in 2014 featured high-profile guests, including David Cameron, George Osborne, Elizabeth Hurley, Hugh Grant, Naomi Campbell, Ralph Fiennes, Tracey Emin, and Anna Friel. Initially, the plan was for London Live to help drive profitability across the Lebedevs' media portfolio, but it has instead become a financial drain. Despite hopes that the station would break even by 2017, London Live has never turned a profit, accumulating losses of £30 million to date, according to Companies House filings. Lebedev is reportedly in talks with That's Media, which owns licenses for 20 local TV stations, including Manchester, Cambridge, and Oxford, about potentially selling London Live. That's Media has been building a network by acquiring struggling local TV franchises, including five from STV in Scotland and Mustard TV from Archant in 2017. Lebedev has also held talks with David Montgomery, former CEO of the Daily and Sunday Mirror, who is now a director at Made Television. The value of the loss-making London Live to an existing local TV operator is unclear, but Archant sold Mustard TV to That's Media in exchange for a small stake in the local TV group. A spokesperson for London Live stated, \"The local television sector is rapidly evolving, and as a significant player in the largest UK market, we regularly receive approaches for the business.\" \"We refrain from discussing private business matters in public, so we won't comment on any specific conversations. Lebedev began exploring potential sales or mergers with local TV rivals and larger broadcasters about a year ago for London Live. Since its launch five years ago, London Live has faced repeated rounds of job cuts and has made repeated requests to Ofcom, the local TV regulator, to scale back its commitments to local programming and news.\" ",

According to Dr. Mehmet Hakan Ozdener, this finding opens up the possibility of using scents to influence our food choices, such as adding a subtle aroma to food to make it taste sweeter and reduce sugar intake. When driving at night, many people experience a phenomenon called motion-induced blindness, where the red lights of cars in front of us temporarily disappear if we glance at oncoming traffic. This effect, first observed in a lab in 1965, occurs when the brain ignores visual information when it's presented against a moving background. A fascinating connection exists between hearing and vision in speech perception, known as the McGurk effect. When the auditory component of a syllable is paired with the visual component of another, it can create the perception of a third sound. The sight of cutlery can significantly impact how we perceive the flavor of food, according to research conducted by the University of Oxford in 2013. For example, yoghurt tastes sweeter when eaten with a white spoon compared to a black spoon. There is a surprising crossover between smell and sound in human perception, with various experiments showing that people can associate certain smells with musical instruments and pitches. University of Oxford researchers found that participants consistently paired specific smells with certain instruments and pitches, such as a piano being associated with a fruity scent and brass with a musky odor. This phenomenon is thought to be caused by the olfactory tubercle, an area of the brain that responds to both auditory and olfactory stimuli.  ",

Despite repeatedly claiming it is \"ready to start\" building the mine, Adani has publicly blamed the Queensland government for delays in approving necessary management plans. However, environmental groups argue that the shortfall in Adani's water permits is evidence that the company's readiness claims are unfounded and intended to exert political pressure on decision-makers. Public records show that Adani holds two short-term water permits, for Mistake Creek and the Belyando River, which expire in April and June this year. These permits allow the company to extract a combined 1775 megalitres of water. Adani's own modeling, completed by consultant CDM Smith, estimates that the Carmichael mine will require 3358ML of water during the first year of construction. Carmel Flint, from the environmental group Lock the Gate, stated that the new information suggests Adani does not have the necessary water permits to construct the mine, further evidence that its claims of being ready to start work are false. \"Adani has created a fake sense of urgency for approvals ahead of the election and has achieved its goal of securing a rushed approval from the Morrison government, which was tainted by political interference,\" Flint said. In response, Adani stated that it has the necessary water permits required for mining operations, but did not address the project's construction phase specifically. The company also mentioned that it has alternative potential water sources for the mine site, including groundwater, rainwater, and recycled water. Tom Crothers, the former Queensland government general manager of water allocation and planning, stated that the amount of water Adani could access without additional permits would be a mere \"puddle\" and far from sufficient to make up for the shortfall. Adani's claims to be ready to start construction on the Carmichael coalmine have become a hot topic on the federal election campaign trail. Just before the government entered caretaker mode, the federal environment minister, Melissa Price, approved Adani's groundwater plans. This approval has allowed LNP politicians and candidates in Queensland to claim that the project is being delayed by the state Labor government, citing the need for state approval of key management plans. In response, Adani has intensified its advertising campaign, featuring billboards, print ads, and letterbox drops that criticize the Queensland government for \"moving the goalposts\". In a statement to Guardian Australia in March, Adani denied that its campaign was political, claiming instead that its goal was to inform Queenslanders about the true status of its project. ",

The company initially sought damages of around $150,000 from each farmer, claiming they broke the law by sourcing and dealing the potatoes. However, when the case went to court in Ahmedabad, India, PepsiCo offered to settle the dispute amicably. The case has sparked outrage among farmers and others, who fear PepsiCo is using its influence to interfere with India's food supply. The role of foreign companies in producing and selling food in India is a contentious issue, particularly when it comes to genetically modified crops. According to Kapil Shah, an activist defending the farmers, the case is about \"India's seed sovereignty, food sovereignty, and country sovereignty.\" He added that it's spreading panic among farmers.\n\nSeveral farmers' groups in India have come together to protest the court action. Ambubhai Patel, vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, a farmers' association linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), said they are lobbying the government to support the accused farmers and punish those harassing other farmers. Patel warned that the government cannot allow such intimidation and vowed to fight against it in court and on the streets if necessary. PepsiCo claimed that the farmers who grew its patented potatoes without permission were hurting the interests of many people who work with the company to produce potatoes for its Lay's crisps. The company supplies seeds to these farmers and subsequently buys back the potatoes. In a statement, a PepsiCo spokesperson said, \"PepsiCo is India's largest process-grade potato buyer and one of the first companies to work with thousands of local farmers to grow a specific protected variety of potatoes for our Lay's crisps.\" The company's spokesperson later clarified that they were forced to take legal action as a last resort, and are deeply committed to resolving the issue. PepsiCo has faced criticism in the past for its environmental impact, including a boycott in an Indian state in 2017 due to concerns over excessive water usage in its manufacturing process. The recent controversy has stirred up memories of the drought, with some commentators expressing concerns that PepsiCo may be using the legal system to punish individuals who use the same groundwater used in their products. As one journalist, Ravi Nair, pointed out on Twitter, \"Let's hope PepsiCo won't sue people for using the same groundwater used in Pepsi.\" ",

This figure excludes litigation and conduct charges, which would have resulted in a £1.5 billion profit compared to a £236 million loss in the same period last year.

Barclays' international business, which includes the investment bank, saw a decline in pre-tax profit to £1.1 billion, while its UK business reported a rise in profits to £600 million, driven by strong mortgage applications. Staley stated that the bank cut bonuses to reduce costs and is \"very comfortable\" with its cost targets, which amounted to £3.3 billion in the first quarter. The bank took a £400 million charge in 2016 to align bonuses with revenues. \"We are using our discretion around variable compensation to manage our costs and deliver expected profitability,\" Staley said.

Research has revealed that the dominant commercial cultivar grown in Hawaii originated from a single tree in southern Queensland in the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was established using a single cultivar from Australia that was repeatedly cloned, resulting in a lack of genetic diversity. This lack of diversity has led to concerns about crop productivity, disease resistance, and the ability to grow macadamia trees in new areas. Researchers hope that their findings will lead to the discovery of wild trees and more \"novel genes\" that could improve the crop.\n\nBy analyzing genetic markers, researchers from the University of Queensland and Southern Cross University were able to trace the origins of Hawaii's macadamia industry back to Queensland. They found that the Hawaiian cultivar had distinctive gene markers in common with a small crop of trees in the Mooloo area, near Gympie, which is 160km north of Brisbane. Historical records show that seeds from these trees were taken to Honolulu in 1896.\n\nDespite being found in a narrow band of subtropical rainforest, Australia's native macadamia trees have a rich genetic diversity compared to commercial crops. This means that there is hope for discovering diverse genes in Australian forests and even in backyards. The researchers found that there is a strong geographic pattern to the diversity of macadamia trees, with all the diversity coming from south-east Queensland and northern NSW. The Hawaiian germplasm is very narrow, meaning it has only come from one locality.\n\nThe researchers also found that some unique genetic markers in commercial trees could not be matched with known wild trees. This could be due to the loss of diverse genes in the wild through land clearing, or it could be that they continue to exist in domestic cultivated plants. According to him, some of the lost diversity might be found in cultivated plants, parks, gardens, or backyards. The oldest known cultivated macadamia tree is located in Brisbane's city botanic gardens, which was planted in 1858. Hardner emphasized the importance of focusing on forest conservation, citing climate change and land clearing as major concerns. He noted that about 90% of the wild macadamia population is found on private property, highlighting the need to identify and prioritize unique gene pools for conservation. Since macadamias are only a few generations removed from their wild ancestors, they still have a lot of potential for improvement through selective breeding. Australia's macadamia industry is significant, with the crop accounting for 14% of the country's total horticultural exports in 2017. ",

This was the first hearing since May 2, when the US government began making its case for his extradition to face trial for what they described as one of the largest breaches of classified information in history. However, Assange's solicitor, Gareth Peirce, informed the judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Thursday that he was too ill to appear by video link from prison. The next hearing is scheduled for June 12. The senior district judge, Emma Arbuthnot, suggested that the next hearing may take place at Belmarsh Prison in south London, where Assange is being held, if it is convenient for all parties involved. The US has requested Assange's extradition, which was initiated after his removal from the Ecuadorian embassy in London on April 11. He faces charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years. However, he could face decades in a US prison after it was revealed last week that he is also being charged with violating the Espionage Act by publishing classified information through WikiLeaks. Prosecutors have announced 17 additional charges against Assange for publishing hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and files on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Assange, 47, was previously charged with attempting to hack a Pentagon computer system, as outlined in a secret indictment that was revealed shortly after his arrest at the Ecuadorian embassy. WikiLeaks stated on Tuesday that Assange had been moved to the hospital wing of Belmarsh Prison due to a \"dramatic\" loss of weight and deteriorating health. \"Mr. Assange's health had already significantly deteriorated after seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy, where he was subjected to conditions that were incompatible with basic human rights,\" WikiLeaks said in a statement. \"During the seven weeks he has spent in Belmarsh, his health has continued to deteriorate, and he has dramatically lost weight. The decision of prison authorities to move him to the hospital wing speaks for itself.\" Assange is currently serving a 50-week prison sentence for breaching bail conditions to avoid extradition to Sweden. \"He sought refuge in the embassy in 2012 to evade extradition on charges of sexual assault, which he claims are unfounded, but was arrested last month after his asylum status was revoked.\" ",

However, a recent announcement from the Department of Energy (DoE) suggests that the country's natural resources are also imbued with freedom. According to a news release, the US undersecretary of energy, Mark W Menezes, has dubbed the country's natural gas reserves \"freedom gas\" in an effort to promote increased exports. The DoE has approved the expansion of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal off the coast of Texas, which Menezes claims will spread \"freedom gas\" throughout the world by providing a diverse and affordable source of clean energy to America's allies. The concept of \"freedom gas\" may seem vague, but it's being measured down to the smallest unit. Steven Winberg, another DoE official, expressed his approval of the move, stating that the US is promoting an efficient regulatory system to export \"molecules of US freedom\" to the world. It's unclear whether members of the Trump administration are aware of the absurdity of the concept, but Energy Secretary Rick Perry seems to believe in it. In a recent statement, Perry compared the country's efforts to deliver \"freedom gas\" to Europe to the liberation of the continent from Nazi Germany occupation 75 years ago.  ",

Consumer advocacy group Which? sent letters to nine airlines in December, warning them that they may be violating consumer laws by retaining clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger fails to show up for the first leg of the same booking, forcing some customers to pay hundreds of pounds for replacement flights. In many cases, airlines can resell the same tickets, effectively doubling their earnings for a single seat. Of the nine airlines contacted, only Flybe agreed to modify the clauses, although it has not entirely removed them. The airlines that retained the clauses were British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Air France, Singapore, Qatar, and Swiss. KLM, on the other hand, does not cancel the return flight ticket if the first leg is missed. Instead, it charges a fixed-rate fee ranging from €125 to €3,000 to passengers at the airport. In one instance, a customer was forced to pay over £600 to British Airways after he and his wife were barred from the second leg of their return trip from London to Pisa. The customer had booked an outbound flight with a different airline after the first leg with British Airways was cancelled due to an airline strike, and he was only offered a replacement two days later. Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) added to the pressure on airlines, expressing concern over their failure to remove the no-show clauses. Which? called for the \"rip-off\" no-show clauses to be banned, citing Austria's example, which banned the practice in April. Caroline Normand, Which?'s director of advocacy, stated: \"It is unreasonable for an airline to cancel a passenger's return flight – often without warning – simply because they've missed the first leg of their journey.\" \"Airlines have exploited this tactic for far too long, leaving passengers miserable, stranded, and out of pocket by hundreds or even thousands of pounds. According to the CAA's report, their enforcement powers are limited, suggesting that government intervention may be necessary to address the issue. The CAA has criticized airlines for failing to provide clear and transparent key terms documents, which it considers unfair to passengers who must comply with terms they cannot understand. Airlines claim that these clauses prevent passengers from taking advantage of cheaper return flights, which are sometimes offered instead of single tickets. (Note: This article was corrected on July 1, 2019, to clarify that KLM does not typically cancel return leg tickets if the outbound flight is missed, but instead charges a fixed-rate fee for the missed flight.)\" ",

The tragedy occurred when two galleries overlooking an open excavation pit collapsed at the same mine site where six lives were lost in 2016. Glencore, the world's largest mining company, has confirmed that at least 19 illegal miners were killed when part of the open-pit mine in the Kolwezi area collapsed, and further fatalities are possible. According to Richard Muyej, the governor of Lualaba province, at least 36 \"clandestine artisanal diggers\" lost their lives in the accident. Glencore, which owns 75% of the Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) through its Katanga Mining subsidiary, has blamed the illegal miners for trespassing at the copper mine and putting their lives at risk. The miners were working along two narrow strips cut into the side of the open pit, known as \"benches\", when they caved in, resulting in the loss of life. Glencore has reported a growing number of artisanal miners trespassing at the mine, with an estimated 2,000 illegal miners gathering on the site every day. The company has expressed concern about the \"daily intrusions\" posing a significant risk to its employees, operating equipment, and the illegal artisanal miners themselves. In a statement, Glencore emphasized that the incidents were not linked to the mine's operations and would not affect production. The company is assisting search and rescue operations with local authorities and urging all illegal miners to cease trespassing on the site, which poses a risk to their lives. Deadly mining accidents are common in the DRC, where high unemployment and the pursuit of copper for sale often lead to dangerous conditions. Glencore is working to inform local communities of the dangers associated with illegal trespassing on mining sites, stating that the safety and security of its employees, contractors, and host communities is of paramount importance to KCC. KCC will take all necessary steps to guarantee the safety of its employees and will continue to collaborate with all relevant parties, the company stated. This accident marks Kamoto's deadliest incident since 2016, when a 250-meter pit wall collapsed, resulting in the deaths of six miners, five of whom were Kamoto employees. At the time, a union leader attributed the relatively low number of fatalities to a temporary suspension of work at the mine. Following news of the collapse, Glencore's shares plummeted 4.9% to 263.9p, wiping £1.8 billion from the value of the Swiss-based energy company. Katanga Mining, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, was fined $30 million (approximately £24 million) by Canadian regulators last year for misleading investors by overstating its copper reserves. Additionally, Katanga was forced to halt cobalt sales late last year after discovering uranium contamination in its supplies. ",

Born in Coventry, Norman was the son of Florence (née Wilday) and Cyril Dewis. His education was cut short when his father, a coal merchant and carter, died in 1934, forcing Norman to find work. After an initial stint with Humber, Norman became an apprentice at Armstrong Siddeley. When World War II broke out in 1939, Norman joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and served as a rear gunner on Blenheims until he was medically discharged due to a kidney infection. He then worked as an Air Ministry inspector. In 1945, Norman moved to Lea-Francis, where he became chief tester, but joined Jaguar in 1952 as a test driver and development engineer, a role he held until his retirement in 1985. Norman soon became involved in disc brake testing, as Jaguar, in collaboration with Dunlop, was instrumental in developing this new technology. He had also competed in his own 500cc single-seater and participated in several races for Jaguar, including the 1952 Mille Miglia, where he co-drove with Stirling Moss in a Jaguar C-type. Although they did not finish, this marked the first time a car equipped with disc brakes had competed. In 1953, Norman set a speed record in an XK 120 at Jabbeke in Belgium, achieving a speed of 172.4mph. He was also one of the Jaguar D-type drivers in the 1955 Le Mans, where he witnessed the worst motor racing accident in history, which occurred when a Mercedes-Benz hit a group of spectators, resulting in over 70 fatalities. After completing his driving duties, his co-driver went off course, allowing Mike Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb to win in the D-type. Norman played a key role in the development of the world-beating E-type. For the E-type's launch at the 1961 Geneva motor show, Norman had to make a last-minute dash across Europe in one of the demonstration cars. Norman was involved in testing the XJ13 racing car prototype, which unfortunately never got to see any action. However, his first test drive ended in a crash at the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA) in 1971, and he was fortunate to escape with only minor injuries. After retiring, Norman served as a global ambassador for Jaguar, making numerous trips to the US, often behind the wheel of a classic racing car. He also wrote his autobiography, with the help of Paul Skilleter, and was honored with an OBE in 2015. Norman married Nan (Nancy Miles) in 1947, and she passed away in 1993. He is survived by his son, Graeme, and daughter, Linda, as well as four grandchildren. ",

The idea that women will rule the world, and perhaps even the galaxy, is not a far-fetched notion. In fact, it's possible that men have had their time in the sun and it's now women's turn to take the reins. According to this theory, women will either quietly eliminate men in their sleep or simply leave them behind as they colonize space. However, this raises the question of how they plan to reproduce without men's involvement. The answer is that the interplanetary matriarchy only needs a supply of frozen sperm to get started. While it's possible that men might resist this plan, new research suggests that frozen sperm can survive in space with no adverse effects. In fact, scientists have found that by subjecting sperm samples to weightlessness, they can collect and store it for future use. This raises the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth, allowing the matriarchy to impregnate themselves as needed.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the absence of sexist remarks and stereotypes could actually contribute to a more cohesive and efficient all-female space mission. In contrast, all-male missions in the past may have been plagued by similar issues. According to Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut in space, NASA did investigate the effects of all-male crews years ago. \"In 2017, she revealed to an audience that the US had conducted a secret study on long-term space travel, which suggested that to prevent conflicts, the crew should consist only of individuals of the same gender - either all men or all women. The study reportedly concluded that an all-female crew would be a better option, as men might argue over who should be in charge. This is, after all, a pattern that has been observed throughout human history. While it's true that an all-female spacecraft would likely still see some romantic entanglements, at least the risk of pregnancy during a space flight would be eliminated. One could joke that the sperm would be safe, but it's unlikely that the men on board would declare themselves kings of the ship once the women departed.\" ",

The letter, signed by FIFA, UEFA, the Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, and the Asian Football Confederation, among others, expresses frustration and disappointment after nearly 18 months of failed legal efforts to shut down the service. The authorities condemn beoutQ's theft of their intellectual property in the strongest possible terms and demand that Saudi Arabia's authorities support them in ending the widespread breaches of their intellectual property rights. The letter reveals that nine law firms in Saudi Arabia have declined to take on their copyright theft case, leaving the authorities with no choice but to seek alternative means to shut down the broadcaster. The authorities have reached the conclusion that it is no longer possible to find legal representation in Saudi Arabia willing or able to act on their behalf and are now forced to pursue other options to address the problem of piracy. They are calling on the Saudi Ministry of Culture and the Saudi government to take swift and decisive action against beoutQ. The illegal service, which was launched in 2017, gained popularity after broadcasting the 2018 World Cup and has continued to operate despite condemnation from various organizations, including the All England Lawn Tennis Club, which has twice accused beoutQ of illegally streaming Wimbledon. The BBC and Sky have also spoken out about the issue of piracy of their programming. BeoutQ is transmitted internationally on 10 channels by the Saudi-headquartered satellite firm Arabsat, which has the Saudi state as its largest shareholder, and also offers streaming. Initially, a pirate feed was stolen from Qatar's beIN Media Group, which owns beIN Sports and Miramax, and was rebranded as beoutQ. This move was seen as evidence that Saudi Arabia was directly targeting its neighbor. In February, beIN Media, which has 55 million pay-TV customers worldwide, chose not to renew its five-year contract with Formula One due to the significant impact of the piracy on its operations. The company has invested heavily in content rights, including the Premier League, Champions League, World Cup, NBA, and NFL, and is now reassessing which rights it can afford to maintain. ",

        "Text": "The US Department of Justice is launching a comprehensive antitrust review of major technology companies, amid growing concerns about their increasing dominance and influence. The investigation will focus on allegations that these companies are illegally stifling competition and undermining innovation. According to the Department of Justice, the review aims to address the widespread concerns expressed by consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs about search, social media, and online retail services. Without the discipline of competition, digital platforms may prioritize their own interests over consumer demands, warned Makan Delrahim, Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division. The review will scrutinize the practices of online platforms, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. The investigation comes amid calls from lawmakers, including Democratic presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren, for greater oversight of these companies. Last week, Facebook, Google, and Amazon faced intense questioning from lawmakers on the House subcommittee on antitrust, commercial, and administrative law over their control of markets such as digital advertising, e-commerce, and cloud computing. Lawmakers grilled Amazon over its fees for third-party sellers and whether this creates a monopoly, and questioned Facebook executives about their practices of targeting startups for acquisition and copying features from companies that decline to be acquired. The hearing also saw lawmakers question Facebook about its plans to launch a global cryptocurrency, Libra. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio criticized Facebook's \"breathtaking arrogance\" in attempting to launch a digital financial service despite its history of major privacy scandals. In July, the Federal Trade Commission approved a $5 billion fine against Facebook for its handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. \"Facebook is dangerous,\" Brown said, likening the company to a toddler playing with matches. \"It has repeatedly burned the house down and called every attempt a learning experience. Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and money?\" The Department of Justice investigation is already underway, according to the Wall Street Journal's report on Tuesday. \"A private presentation was held by critics of major tech companies, who briefed lawmakers on their concerns and reasons for advocating for the breakup of these firms. Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple have yet to respond to inquiries for comment.\" ",

However, the CPA does not have a monopoly on scientific arguments, and good science is a critical and iterative process that is inherently imperfect and subjective. History has shown us that even well-intentioned scientific discoveries can have unintended consequences, such as the development of DDT, thalidomide, and leaded petrol. Similarly, the overuse of antibiotics in livestock farming was once considered acceptable, but we now know that it was based on incomplete science.\n\nGiven the limitations of scientific inquiry, we should exercise caution and apply the precautionary principle when making decisions about the use of chemicals and other substances in our environment. Unfortunately, scientific inquiry has often been slow to address the impact of synthetic chemicals, microplastics, and airborne pollution on our health and the environment. However, we are now beginning to ask these questions and seek answers.\n\nThe CPA argues that intensive agriculture is necessary to feed the world's population, but this approach is not sustainable in the long term. By shifting towards sustainable farming systems that prioritize the production of healthy, plant-based foods, we can reduce our reliance on animal feed and preserve natural habitats. This approach would also help to sequester carbon, improve soil health, and promote biodiversity.\n\nUltimately, we need a fair and transparent food system that prioritizes the health and well-being of both people and the planet.

The pilots' union, Balpa, can now schedule strike dates with two weeks' notice, but has decided to wait until after further talks with the airline. The airline had argued that the strike ballot was invalid, but the high court rejected this claim on Tuesday. The ballot, which was announced on Monday, saw 93% of BA's 4,000 pilots vote in favor of taking industrial action over a rejected three-year pay deal. Despite being legally entitled to call a strike, Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said the union will not set dates until after further talks with the airline at Acas this week. Strutton emphasized that the airline has admitted that even one day of strike action would cost more than what the pilots are asking for, and urged the airline to negotiate on pay and rewards. A BA spokesman expressed disappointment with the court's decision and stated that the airline remains open to talks, adding that it will continue to pursue all avenues to protect customers' holidays this summer. The pilots had sought an above-inflation pay settlement, including a profit share scheme, arguing that they took pay cuts during the financial crisis and should now benefit from the airline's recovery. BA, which carried up to 145,000 passengers a day, had offered a 11.5% pay increase over three years, which Balpa disputes. The airline pointed out that a similar pay offer had been recommended by other trade unions to their members. \"Thousands of airport workers are planning strikes, which could impact holiday flights and cause disruptions at Heathrow airport, British Airways' main hub, this summer. The strikes are set to begin on Friday and continue throughout the summer. Heathrow's CEO, John Holland-Kaye, has accused Unite of calling the strikes as a way to flex its muscles. He claims that Unite deliberately chose the first weekend after the school summer break, Heathrow's busiest period, to stage the walkouts. Holland-Kaye has stated that the strikes will result in longer security queues, but he assured that the airport is working hard to ensure that as many families as possible can travel safely and efficiently, despite the unnecessary strike action.\" ",

Kelvin stepped down as CEO in March following allegations of inappropriate behavior towards staff, including forced hugs. According to recent reports, Kelvin, who owns 35% of Ted Baker, is willing to support a buyout and work with the company's existing management. The news sent shares soaring, closing at 951p on Monday, a 13.5% increase. The company's share price has plummeted by more than half since early January, following two profit warnings and descriptions of \"extremely difficult\" trading conditions. In March 2018, the shares traded at £32.14, valuing Ted Baker at £1.4 billion. The company is now valued at around £424 million, with Kelvin's stake worth £148 million. Following Kelvin's departure, his former finance director, Lindsay Page, has been running the company, assisted by executive chairman David Bernstein, a former chairman of French Connection and the Football Association. An acquisition could be backed by private equity firms, which are flush with cash, or a consortium of other investors, according to the Mail on Sunday, which first reported the potential bid. Kelvin, 63, is currently on an extended family holiday in the US and is said to be considering his options after leaving the company he founded over 30 years ago. In his farewell message to employees, he stated that he would take time to consider his \"next adventure.\" He denied all allegations of misconduct, which were first reported by the Guardian, but said he was leaving to remove a distraction from the business. Sources indicate that any talks about a potential bid are likely to be informal at this stage. Representatives for Ted Baker and Kelvin declined to comment on the matter.  ",

The fund has invested £10 million in Atom Bank, maintaining its 18% stake, as part of a broader £50 million fundraising round that also attracted investment from BBVA, Perscitus, and Toscafund. However, Woodford's involvement in the funding round failed to boost investor confidence, and the fund's shares fell 1.6% to a new low of 53.1p. This marks the first major investment decision made by Patient Capital since June 3, when Woodford suspended his flagship Equity Income Fund due to a string of poor investments and a surge in customer withdrawals. The suspension, which has been extended to July 29, has trapped over 290,000 retail clients and billions of pounds of investments. Woodford Patient Capital Trust's shares have plummeted 32% since the Equity Income Fund was suspended. The fund declined to comment on the new investment. Patient Capital had previously committed to investing £20 million in Proton Partners, a cancer treatment company, but that announcement was made in February, before the Equity Income Fund's suspension.

The sale is not expected to impact discussions regarding the rest of British Steel, as exclusive talks continue between the government's official receiver and Oyak, the Turkish military pension fund. TSP Projects, a York-based company that designs and builds large rail infrastructure projects, will be integrated into Systra. The proceeds from the sale will likely be allocated to British Steel's lenders, which will help to address the company's financial issues. The sale price was not disclosed, but Systra will also assume TSP's £70m pension liabilities, a legacy from the company's days as a division of British Rail before privatization. Craig Scott, TSP Projects' CEO, emphasized that the liquidation of British Steel did not pose a threat to his company, which has been performing well and has a strong client base, including Network Rail, Siemens, and Costain. Scott expressed his satisfaction with the sale, stating that TSP Projects will now be able to focus on its core business under a new permanent owner. He noted that both Systra and TSP Projects are growing companies, and as a result, none of the company's 400 employees will lose their jobs, and there may even be opportunities for new hires. TSP Projects has worked on notable projects such as the redevelopment of King's Cross and Reading stations, and is currently involved in infrastructure projects at Gatwick airport's station and upgrades to the TransPennine Express rail route.

Franco Manca's unique menu, featuring sourdough pizzas, green cola, and vegan cheese, resonated with changing consumer tastes. The contrasting fortunes of the two chains were highlighted by Pizza Express's falling profits and decision to halt new restaurant openings, while Franco Manca attracted more customers and capitalized on declining rents to expand its operations. Pizza Express reported a 7.7% decline in underlying profits to £32.4 million for the six months ending June, and opened only two new branches during the period. The company plans to focus on upgrading its existing sites and revamping its menu rather than expanding its physical presence. Pizza Express's CEO, Jinlong Wang, stated that the company is taking a measured approach to growth in the UK and Ireland, prioritizing investments in its existing estate over new site openings. Founded in 1965, Pizza Express expanded rapidly in the 1990s and became a staple for families seeking affordable dining options. However, the casual dining market has struggled since 2016, with overcrowding and rising costs squeezing margins, particularly in the saturated Italian-themed segment. Jamie Oliver's Italian chain recently closed, and Prezzo and Strada have shut branches amid a sector-wide downturn that prompted landlords to reduce rents. Franco Manca, founded in 2008 in Brixton, south London, has managed to thrive in this environment, expanding its operations while other chains struggled. Franco Manca's owner, Fulham Shore, reported strong sales from its five new restaurants opened in the first 21 weeks of its financial year and is in talks to expand outside of London. According to Fulham Shore's chairman, David Page, Franco Manca's increased revenue is driven by new restaurant openings and growing customer numbers. \"We're observing a trend of more properties entering the market with decreasing rents, and we plan to capitalize on this opportunity. Prior to Pizza Express' sale to private equity groups in 2003, Page served as its CEO. He later co-founded Clapham House, which operated chains such as Gourmet Burger Kitchen, before selling to Nando's in 2010. Fulham Shore, the parent company of The Real Greek, acquired Franco Manca in 2015. According to Peter Martin, vice-president at CGA, a food and drink consultancy, \"In today's fast-paced and competitive market, consumers crave novelty, and there's an abundance of options.

Over 300 workers at the company's Cork facility alone have had their contracts terminated, according to former employees, with more being sent home from other European sites. The staff had been on paid leave since August 2, when Apple announced it was suspending the \"grading\" program for a thorough review, following a Guardian report that revealed workers frequently heard confidential medical information and intimate conversations while reviewing Siri recordings. The contractors, employed through third-party firms, were initially sent home on August 2, with many told there was no work due to \"technical errors\". However, last week, the contracting firms were informed by Apple that the grading work would be terminated, leading to mass job losses with little notice. Despite some employees having concerns about the ethics of the program, there is widespread anger about the way the job losses have been handled. \"I'm relieved the truth came out,\" said a former contractor, who wished to remain anonymous due to a still-active non-disclosure agreement, \"although I was involved in the work and I just lost my job. We constantly discussed the ethics of the job, but we didn't know how to bring it up.\" The former contractor also criticized Apple for taking no responsibility for the employment and treatment of contractors, saying, \"They do what they want, and when they're done with your project or they mess up, they tell your vendor company to let you go, which they do. It's been coming for over a year. How could they not see this coming? Did they think about protecting their employees at all, or just their reputation?\" Many of the laid-off workers feel they have been left without protection after the scandal. \"In Cork, over 300 workers were expected to be let go with just one week's notice, with no redundancy package in place.

However, we still applied for an optional certificate of lawfulness from Lambeth council, only to have it rejected in September. It turned out that the council's planning department had unilaterally changed the rules in August 2018 without informing residents, builders, or architects, effectively making L-shaped dormers no longer considered permitted development - a decision that contradicts the rules in other London boroughs. Six weeks after the rejection, we received an enforcement notice. Interestingly, the government's guidance states that certificates of lawfulness are optional, and many builders don't bother to apply, which may mean there are hundreds of \"illegal\" lofts in Lambeth. This sudden change in rules creates a trap for builders and undermines the purpose of permitted development legislation, which was intended to simplify small projects by freeing them from red tape. The government's guidance is clear that L-shaped dormers are permitted, and at the time of our application, Lambeth council accepted this. However, Lambeth council chose to apply its new rules retrospectively, citing appeal decisions since summer 2018 that have shown government inspectors often don't recognize L-shaped dormers as permitted development. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government simply states that the interpretation of permitted rights is the responsibility of the local planning authority. \"If you believe the authority has misinterpreted your rights, you can appeal. You may have already done so and won, but it's left you £5,000 out of pocket. Unfortunately, the court refused to award you costs, citing that it was reasonable for the council to review its approach given a series of recent appeal decisions. Your experience highlights the complexity of the law, which can be frustrating for those seeking to extend their home.

The two companies have confirmed they are discussing an all-stock merger, but there is no guarantee a deal will be reached. They have declined to comment further on the discussions until a deal is announced. Altria spun off Philip Morris International in 2008, with Altria focusing on the US market and PMI on international sales. Philip Morris International is valued at $121 billion, while Altria is valued at $88 billion. Analysts have predicted a merger could happen as the companies face declining cigarette sales and the rise of vaping. Altria recently acquired a 35% stake in Juul Labs, the maker of popular e-cigarettes, for $12.8 billion. The e-cigarette market has grown 97% in the past year, with Juul's sales increasing 783% between June 2018 and June 2019. Altria has also made moves to enter the cannabis market, acquiring a 45% stake in Canadian firm Cronos Group for $1.8 billion. Cannabis is now legal in Canada and 10 US states, as well as the District of Columbia. Philip Morris International has also diversified its business, investing in Juul-rival iQOS, a device that heats tobacco rather than burning it. The device is now available in 48 markets worldwide and will be launched in the US next month. Philip Morris International has about 11 million iQOS users globally. In July, the company lowered its earnings forecast and warned of lower demand and declining shipment volumes. Rival British American Tobacco completed its takeover of Reynolds American Incorporated in 2017, creating the world's largest tobacco company. The merger was also prompted by declining sales and the growing popularity of e-cigarettes and vapes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 1.1 billion people smoked tobacco in 2015. WHO estimates that smoking claims the lives of around 6 million people annually. Despite public health efforts, tax hikes, and regulatory measures, smoking rates are decreasing in many parts of the world. However, the World Health Organization notes that smoking is on the rise in the eastern Mediterranean region and across much of Africa. Following confirmation of the talks, Philip Morris International's (PMI) shares plummeted by 8%, while Altria's shares surged by nearly 8%. ",

The reported 34% reduction in major cardiac events is based on a 2.9% chance of benefit over five years for individuals, with no impact on mortality. Archie Cochrane, a pioneer in evidence-based medicine, emphasized that we should ask three questions of any intervention: can it work, does it work, and is it worth it? While the relative risk reduction provides insight into population benefits, it's the absolute risk reduction that answers the crucial 'is it worth it?' question. Many patients might hesitate to take a medication if they're told there's a 97% chance they won't benefit from it over five years and it won't improve their life expectancy. Considering the differences between the UK and rural Iran, where the study was conducted, as well as the risk of over-medicating healthy patients and potential side effects, it's unclear whether the polypill is worth the effort. Only by examining absolute risk-reduction figures can we make an informed decision. Dr. Peter Trewby Richmond, North Yorkshire • It's not surprising that medical researchers often prioritize big pharma, but the notion of promoting a polypill as a broad solution to prevent illnesses in large populations takes this approach to a new level. What's particularly concerning is the composition of this pill. If it's implemented universally, the aspirin component may harm many patients who are prone to bleeding. Additionally, including substances aimed at lowering 'bad' cholesterol is misguided.\" Experts widely agree that high cholesterol levels are not a disease in themselves, but rather an indication of increased oxidative stress in the body's cells. Therefore, instead of treating a single biomarker with medication, it's more effective to address underlying chronic diseases by focusing on the root causes: unhealthy lifestyles and nutrition. ",

Over 1,000 people lost their jobs when the Ballymena-based company, which pioneered the low-floor bus, went into administration earlier this week. Wrightbus's failure marks the UK's second significant insolvency of the week, following the demise of Thomas Cook. The company had been searching for a buyer, but talks with Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by JCB heir Jo Bamford collapsed at the end of last week. Former director Jeff Wright, son of Wrightbus founder Sir William Wright, is calling for an end to the intimidation. \"There have been sinister developments involving threats to the lives of Wright family members, and I'm asking all elected representatives and influential community figures to help put an end to this intimidation and fear,\" Wright said. The closure of Wrightbus has been devastating for its loyal and skilled workforce, and the loss of the company has been shattering for the Wright family, who have nurtured it for over 70 years. \"Generations of families have worked alongside ours over the years, and this is deeply and personally felt by everyone,\" Wright added. The company is committed to providing its administrators, Deloitte, with all necessary information to establish a future plan for the bus manufacturing operation. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson ordered the iconic red Routemaster buses from Wrightbus during his time in office. Trade unionists have criticized Johnson for not doing enough to save the ailing firm, which faced major cashflow problems and declining demand. The company's collapse came after Johnson told parliament that his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus, although a government source has denied giving any such assurances. A source with knowledge of the company's board has also disputed reports that the government has offered support. Ballymena has faced significant job losses in recent years, following the closure of Michelin's tire manufacturing sites and Gallaher's tobacco facilities.

Born in Cricklewood, north London, to Christina, a homemaker, and George, a businessman, he attended Banff grammar and Aberdeen central schools before studying mathematics and physics at Aberdeen University. After completing his studies, he joined the Admiralty's scientific research department in London, where he worked during World War II. Following the war, he returned to Oxford to pursue a second degree in philosophy, politics, and economics at Corpus Christi College. After a brief stint at the Foreign Office, he was elected a fellow of St John's College, Oxford, where he became a popular and respected tutor. He was a champion of reform in college affairs and was known for his ebullient personality. In 1974, he became the chief executive of OUP, a position he held until his retirement in 1988. During his tenure, he transformed the organization, enabling it to thrive despite economic challenges. After his retirement, he became the warden of Keble College, Oxford, and played a key role in shaping its future. In his later years, he was a frequent guest at various Oxford colleges, where he was beloved for his kindness, wit, and generosity of spirit.

Knowles appeared on Fox News's The Story on Monday, where he launched a scathing attack on Thunberg, who is currently campaigning in the US to raise awareness about the climate crisis. This was not the first time a Fox News personality had criticized Thunberg, as Laura Ingraham had previously compared her to the characters in Stephen King's horror story Children of the Corn. Thunberg had given a powerful speech at the United Nations summit, accusing world leaders of betraying young people by failing to take action on the climate crisis. Knowles, who was invited to discuss Thunberg's speech and the climate crisis, was dismissive of both, stating that if the issue were truly about science, it would be led by scientists, not politicians and a \"mentally ill Swedish child\" who is being exploited by her parents and the international left. Fellow commentator Christopher Hahn immediately criticized Knowles, saying, \"You're a grown man attacking a child. Shame on you.\" A Fox News spokesperson subsequently apologized to Thunberg and viewers, calling Knowles's comment \"disgraceful\". Fox News has also announced that it has no plans to book Knowles as a guest in the future. Meanwhile, the channel has remained silent on Ingraham's previous attack on Thunberg, in which she incorrectly suggested that Thunberg wanted people to \"cede control of our economy, our way of life, our way of transport, how many children you want to have, and if we don't go along, we will be punished by our own children\". Stephen King has no sequel titled \"Children of the Climate\", as the title is a fictional creation. However, King's novel \"The Children of the Corn\" tells the story of a group of children in a remote town who believe anyone over the age of 19 should be killed. Meanwhile, Curtis Ingraham, the brother of conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, quickly responded to her recent statements, accusing her of making right-wing pronouncements for financial gain. He stated: \"It's clear that my sister's paycheck takes precedence over the world her three adopted children will inherit. I can no longer apologize for a sibling I no longer recognize. Instead, I will continue to speak out against her monstrous behavior and bullying commentary, which stems from her anger.\" ",

The FRC has the authority to investigate and sanction auditors and accounting professionals who are members of the profession. The regulator announced its consideration of an investigation after the government expedited the Insolvency Service's probe into Thomas Cook's collapse. Thomas Cook's auditor is EY, which took over from PwC in 2017. Both EY and PwC are among the UK's four largest accountancy firms. Thomas Cook has had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years as its financial struggles deepened, and it has faced questions about its accounting methods. Sten Daugaard became chief financial officer in December 2018, replacing Bill Scott, who quit after less than a year due to Thomas Cook's profit warning. Scott had replaced Michael Healy in January 2018, who had served as CFO for five years. The FRC stated, \"In light of recent developments at Thomas Cook, we are considering whether there is a case for investigation and enforcement action as a matter of urgency, in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.\" Daugaard changed Thomas Cook's accounting practices to include items that had been treated as exceptional costs for several years, including payments to directors and meeting banking covenants. EY disagreed with Thomas Cook's treatment of these items. In its first-half results reported in November, Thomas Cook recognized £28m in charges, including a £14m write-off of payments from hotels and £14m in flight disruption and business transformation costs. Daugaard told analysts in November that when he reviewed the company's books, he noticed the significant size of the exceptional costs. In May, Thomas Cook reported a £1.5bn first-half loss and issued its third profit warning in less than a year. The company had £1.2bn in debt and was forced to write down the value of its MyTravel UK package holiday business by £1.1bn. In its May accounts, EY expressed \"significant doubt\" about whether Thomas Cook could continue as a going concern. Thomas Cook ceased operations in the early hours of Monday, leaving 9,000 UK jobs in jeopardy and stranding 150,000 British tourists abroad. In response, the Civil Aviation Authority has launched a temporary airline, utilizing 40 chartered jets, to facilitate the return of stranded travelers. The Financial Reporting Council's enforcement division conducts investigations and may bring legal action against auditors, actuaries, and accountants if there is evidence of misconduct or a breach of professional standards.

Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who led the acquisition spree that left Thomas Cook with over £1 billion in debt, received more than £17 million during his nearly four-year tenure as CEO, boosted by bonuses awarded for slashing 2,800 jobs following the merger with MyTravel. He departed in 2011 as the company teetered on the brink of collapse. His successor, Harriet Green, was paid £4.7 million for less than three years, plus a share bonus worth an additional £5.6 million. She donated a third of the bonus to charity after the tragic deaths of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning in Thomas Cook accommodations in Corfu. Green also claimed £80,000 annually to cover her hotel expenses at the five-star Brown's hotel in London, where she resided during the week. Peter Fankhauser, who was at the helm when the company went bankrupt, received £8.3 million, including £4.3 million in bonuses. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, urged Thomas Cook bosses to \"examine their consciences,\" while the party's shadow minister of consumer affairs, Gill Furniss, called on them to return their bonuses. Meanwhile, a group of international hedge funds that bet against Thomas Cook have profited from its collapse. Nearly 11% of the company's shares were \"shorted\" ahead of its collapse. Short-sellers borrow shares in a company, sell them, and then buy them back at a lower price to pocket the profit. Two hedge funds, London-based TT International and Minneapolis-based Whitebox Advisers, made up the bulk of the shorts, holding around 7% of the company's shares, according to ShortTracker data. \"Hedge funds other than Thomas Cook are poised to reap a significant gain from their investments in credit default swaps, a type of insurance that provides a payout when a company fails to meet its debt obligations. If Thomas Cook had successfully negotiated a deal over the weekend, these investments would have been essentially worthless. However, following the company's collapse, credit default swap payouts are now expected to total $250 million (£201 million), according to reports from Bloomberg.\" ",

To achieve this, the company is investing £6.3 million in upgrading its two UK factories to produce eco-friendly alternatives, such as recyclable paperboard and biodegradable wraps and boxes. This move is expected to reduce plastic waste by 850 tonnes annually, equivalent to the weight of 425 black cabs, 67 double-decker buses, or 10 blue whales. The switch will involve removing 250 tonnes of plastic rings used to hold beer can packs together (117 million plastic rings in total) and 600 tonnes of shrink film used for additional packaging around trays during shipping. As part of AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, Budweiser Brewing Group UK & Ireland produces over 870 million cans of beer each year and has a portfolio of popular brands, including Beck's, Bud Light, Budweiser, Corona, Michelob Ultra, and Stella Artois. Paula Lindenberg, president of Budweiser Brewing Group UK & Ireland, said: \"This announcement ensures that the UK's favorite beers will soon come in recyclable paperboard packaging, empowering consumers to make more sustainable choices. We're proud of our progress so far, but we recognize that more needs to be done to address the issue of single-use plastics.\" The company is also committing to using 100% locally sourced barley and 100% renewable electricity generated from solar power. By removing plastic rings from all its UK products, including the popular Stella Artois pint can four-pack, Budweiser hopes to make a significant impact in reducing plastic waste on supermarket shelves. Plastic pack rings, also known as hi-cones or yokes, have been a standard packaging device for over 50 years but have become an environmental concern due to their contribution to ocean pollution and harm to marine life. Last year, Carlsberg announced plans to replace plastic rings with recyclable glue, highlighting the industry's growing efforts to find sustainable alternatives. Diageo is transitioning away from plastic packaging in multipacks of its Guinness, Harp, Rockshore, and Smithwick's beers, replacing it with fully recyclable and biodegradable cardboard packs. In a recent announcement, Coca-Cola revealed plans to abandon plastic shrink wrap packaging for multipack soft drink cans in western Europe, opting instead for 100% recyclable cardboard. The new cardboard multipacks will be rolled out for four, six, and eight packs of cans across all brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Dr Pepper, Fanta, Lilt, and Sprite. ",

The standoff occurred at the Orangers hotel, where guests were not allowed to leave until they paid a 6,000 Tunisian dinar (£1,680) fee. According to reports, buses sent to transport the holidaymakers to the airport at Enfidha were turned away by security. Maddie Clamp, 26, and her boyfriend Shaun Holmes, 30, from Derby, described being locked within their holiday complex as management tried to secure payment from their guests. \"They wouldn't even let us out of the hotel,\" Holmes said. However, by Sunday, the standoff had been resolved and guests were allowed to leave. A local Thomas Cook representative worked late into the night and returned on Sunday morning to address guests' urgent queries. The company stated that any guests who had paid the hotel had been refunded. A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: \"We are aware that a small number of customers were asked to pay for their hotel room before leaving Les Orangers in Tunisia. This has now been resolved and customers flew home as planned. We continue to support our customers in all our resorts.\" Lynn and Peter Taylor from Newcastle, who had traveled to Tunisia with Thomas Cook, reported that guests leaving the hotel had been asked for extra payment. \"Those who were due to leave today had letters slipped under their door,\" said Lynn Taylor. \"The hotel was asking for 6,000 TD. I think one old lady paid it. We didn't.\" The hotel refused to comment on its communication with Thomas Cook, only confirming that guests are now free to enter and leave the premises. Tunisia's tourism industry is still recovering from the devastating impact of two terror attacks in 2015, which severely damaged the sector and resulted in the mass killing of predominantly British tourists at the Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba near Sousse. The UK was particularly affected, as a government travel warning was in place from June 2015 to July 2017, advising against travel to Tunisia. Thomas Cook was one of the first companies to resume flights to Tunisia, announcing its return in February 2018. The British consulate in Tunis is aware of the situation and is providing assistance as needed. ",

        "Text": "A public servant in the home affairs department has expressed concerns to Parliament that the department's whistleblowing scheme is ineffective, citing a failed investigation into a staffing incident involving a senior executive. The anonymous submission to the Senate committee on press freedom alleges that a public interest disclosure (PID) was made in 2017 regarding an issue with hiring practices involving a senior executive. However, instead of conducting an independent investigation, the report was sent back to the department for handling. The outcome of the investigation is unclear. The government has repeatedly emphasized the importance of the public interest disclosure process for reporting issues, rather than leaking information to the media. Home Affairs Secretary Michael Pezzullo has stated that the department will investigate and prosecute public servants who leak sensitive information to the public. According to Pezzullo, department officers are trained to report issues through three channels: internal disclosure, the ombudsman, or the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (Aclei). The submission reveals that the public servant initially contacted Aclei and the ombudsman, but the matter was ultimately handled internally. The submission states that the PID report was made to the ombudsman, which referred the matter back to the department. An executive-level assistant director was assigned to investigate, but there was no communication with the whistleblower for four months. The submission questions the independence of the investigation, suggesting that it would be unlikely for an executive-level investigator to make adverse findings against a senior executive. The submission concludes that the department's handling of the matter was flawed and lacked an independent investigation. \"When it comes to reports involving senior executives, it's crucial that there is a higher level of independent scrutiny and ongoing oversight of the ombudsman or a national integrity commission, especially if the ombudsman chooses not to investigate PID reports. A public servant with over 30 years of experience in the sector described the situation as 'worthy of an episode of ABC's Utopia', where the Australian Federal Police (AFP) is called in by the department head in home affairs to investigate leaks that harm the minister for home affairs, such as the au pairs saga.

The retailer has partnered with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders over £30 in interest-free instalments. Clearpay, an Australian firm, is one of the fintech companies that has gained popularity among millennials on tight budgets, along with its rival Klarna. Many of M&S's competitors, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services, and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shoppers, including families with young children. M&S says its customers are increasingly seeking ways to spread the cost of larger purchases, and the Clearpay service enables them to do so by spreading the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800, and customers can manage their payments through a phone app without needing to apply for credit. Unlike traditional credit products, fintech firms like Clearpay and Klarna make money by earning commission on the sales transaction, although some also offer interest-bearing products. Shoppers who use these plans tend to spend more frequently, making it an attractive proposition for retailers like M&S, where clothing sales are declining. Over 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports, and Boohoo, work with Klarna, which has more than 3 million British customers. Clearpay, which launched in the UK just three months ago, has already gained over 200,000 active customers. However, not everyone is a fan of this form of credit. Simon Wolfson, CEO of Next, has expressed concerns that it might be dangerous, saying that there is a difference between spreading the cost and just deferring it. \"Sue Anderson, a representative from the debt charity Stepchange, expressed concern that these payment plans may inadvertently encourage individuals to spend money they don't have. 'These services are marketed to consumers as a convenient option to \"try before you buy\", but the unintended consequence is that people may take on debt they wouldn't have otherwise considered.'\" ",

Whittaker and another organizer, Claire Stapleton, had previously left Google after alleging that they had been retaliated against by management. At the rally on Friday, Rivers had expressed pride in her actions, stating that she believed everyone had the right to know what their work was used for. The public protest and firings are the latest signs of growing labor unrest at Google, which has seen an increase in employee activism over the past two years. Many employees have been demanding a say in how their work is used, as well as their rights as workers. Google employees have voiced their discontent with several company projects, including a contract to supply AI technology to the US Department of Defense's drone program, a censored search engine for China, and cloud services to the fossil fuel industry. A notable example of employee dissatisfaction was the walkout by approximately 20,000 employees over the company's handling of sexual harassment cases. Many employees have also spoken out about Google's extensive use of subcontracted workers, who often have fewer rights and benefits than regular employees. In a strongly-worded Medium post on Monday night, a group of worker-organizers expressed their outrage at the company's actions. They accused Google of illegal retaliation against employees who are exercising their right to organize, describing it as \"classic union busting\" and vowing to resist it. ",

        "Text": "The Fearless Girl statue has taken on many meanings for many people. The 4-foot bronze sculpture of a defiant young girl, hands on hips, facing down the status quo, has been both criticized as a cynical marketing stunt and celebrated as a symbol of new feminism. Now, she is at the center of a court battle to stop her from being replicated worldwide. The original Fearless Girl appeared overnight in March 2017, just before International Women's Day, in downtown New York, standing opposite the Charging Bull statue near Wall Street. Commissioned by State Street Global, an asset management company, the sculpture was intended to promote a fund investing in companies with diverse gender representation. It quickly became a sensation, drawing crowds of selfie-takers. Even Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a long-time critic of Wall Street and a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, used the statue to promote her policies. Sculptor Kristen Visbal has since created multiple copies of Fearless Girl, which now stand in cities such as London and Oslo. However, on Monday, State Street took legal action to stop the Fearless Girl from spreading further, seeking to have a statue removed from Federation Square in Melbourne. In a lawsuit against Maurice Blackburn, the Australian personal injury firm that commissioned the Melbourne piece, State Street argues that the replicas violate its trademark and dilute its message. According to the New York Times, State Street's lawyer, David Studdy, claimed that Maurice Blackburn used the Fearless Girl campaign to promote itself. State Street has also sued Visbal, the sculptor, for making other copies, citing trademark violations. Visbal's lawyers argue that State Street's moves are designed to \"rob her of making a living from her art.\" The statue has been a mixed blessing for State Street, raising its profile but also highlighting its own record on gender equality. In October 2017, State Street paid $5 million to settle charges that it had underpaid about 300 women in its employ. \"According to a report by the Guardian, State Street had a history of rejecting gender equality proposals at several prominent companies, including Alphabet (the parent company of Google), American Express, and Bank of America, all of which are among the world's largest corporations.\" ",

While the NUS supports the strike, not all students agree with the decision, with many expressing criticism towards the lecturers. Within hours of the strike announcement, a petition was launched to demand reimbursement for lost contact hours, with many students concerned about the potential impact on their end-of-term grades. Some students feel that they are paying tuition fees and therefore expect a full term of teaching, while others are frustrated about the lost time and the potential effect on their grades.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that the frustration is mutual between staff and students. Both parties feel that universities are becoming impersonal and poorly run, with staff being treated like employees in a business rather than educators. Instead of directing our anger towards the lecturers, we should focus on the institutions that are forcing them to strike. It's not as if tuition fees are solely spent on tutors' salaries; in fact, academics' pay has fallen by 17% in real terms since 2009.\n\nFurthermore, more than half of academics are on temporary contracts, which adds to their daily stress and contributes to the \"epidemic\" of poor mental health among higher education staff, according to a recent report. The UCU also reports a 15% gender pay gap and a decline in pensions due to changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). Under these conditions, it's unrealistic to expect students to receive the best education possible.\n\nAs NUS vice president Claire Sosienski-Smith noted, \"Students won't be happy about missing lectures, but they're not happy about studying in institutions where their staff are underpaid and overworked.\" It's not accurate to assume that this strike will damage our university careers. Many lecturers are ensuring their students won't be abandoned, and some are even leaving pre-prepared work and practical tips to help students make the most of the lost time. \"Lecturers demonstrate a genuine concern for the academic well-being of their students. It's a testament to their dedication that they undertake such a demanding role without adequate recognition. The success of this strike hinges on universities recognizing that students stand firmly behind their lecturers and acknowledge the need for change. As students, we have a crucial role to play in sustaining these strikes, maintaining pressure to achieve fairer working conditions. I intend to hold my vice-chancellor accountable by asking what measures they are taking to address the issue. - Joshua Curiel, 19-year-old student at the University of Kent\"\n\nI made some minor changes to improve the clarity, grammar, and flow of the sentences, while maintaining the original message and tone.

According to figures released by the central bank, the party planners racked up a bill of £96,188 for the event, which was held at the Bank's sports club in Roehampton, south-west London, and hosted nearly 2,500 staff and their families in July. The costs included £52,200 on food and soft drinks, £30,000 on family entertainment, and nearly £2,000 for equipment and £12,000 for \"other\" undisclosed expenses. The total cost of £96,188 is slightly higher than the £95,673 spent on the event in 2018, raising questions about the bank's commitment to reviewing its expenses. In May, the Bank's board members were questioned by MPs about their expenses, including the summer party bill. Dorothy Thompson, a Court director, defended the party, saying it was an annual event that cost £40 per head and did not include alcohol. However, she also acknowledged that the Bank was looking to cut costs and that the event was under review. The Bank has already planned to shut its 32-acre sports ground and lease it to a commercial operator to cut costs. As a result, the 2019 Governors' Day was likely the last to be held at the plush sports centre. The Bank's incoming governor, Andrew Bailey, who takes over in March, will need to find a new venue if the event continues in 2020. The Bank of England made significant changes to its employee benefits last year, including reducing meal and hotel allowances, following a controversy over a £390,000 travel bill incurred by two economics advisers over a period of two-and-a-half years. The advisers, Anil Kashyap and Donald Kohn, were found to have submitted questionable expenses, with Kashyap claiming £11,000 for a flight from Chicago to London and Kohn submitting expenses for an £8,000 flight from Washington to London, as well as £469 for taxis for a single meeting. The Bank of England released a statement defending its Governors' Day tradition, which is open to all employees and their families, saying it aims to recognize their hard work and dedication.

For several years, scientists have been fascinated and perplexed by these sudden, low-frequency radiation events, which release more energy than the sun does in a day and vanish instantly. Known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), these enigmatic signals appear at random and without warning, leaving astronomers unsure of when or where they will occur next. Over 60 FRBs have been recorded to date, with the only consensus being that they are unlikely to be extraterrestrial greetings. A breakthrough discovery was made a year ago when scientists identified a repeating radio signal and traced it to a dwarf galaxy 3 billion light-years from Earth. Further observations suggested that the burst was generated by extremely powerful magnetic fields, effectively ruling out the possibility of alien laser signals. A team of astronomers from several Canadian universities has now announced the discovery of a second repeating radio signal. The team's breakthrough came last summer, shortly after activating the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope in British Columbia. The findings were published in two papers in Nature and presented at a news conference at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle on January 9.  ",

However, a new study by the Pew Research Center reveals that nearly three-fourths of Facebook users are unaware that the company compiles and shares their personal traits and interests with advertisers on its platform. When users did discover this information on their \"Ad Preferences\" page, half of them felt uncomfortable with the company's collection of this data. The study, which surveyed 963 American adults with Facebook accounts, suggests that many consumers remain unaware of how much of their online behavior is tracked, where the data is compiled, and even that Facebook has a page that lists this information. Pew Research Center focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, due to its significant role in the global media ecosystem. According to Lee Rainie, Pew's director of internet and technology research, Americans prioritize privacy as a fundamental value, but their online behavior suggests a disconnect. Rainie hypothesizes that this inconsistency may stem from a lack of understanding about how their personal information is harvested and analyzed. The finding that 74% of Facebook users were unaware of the company's data collection practices highlights the need to educate Americans about these systems.  ",

The report, released by the United Nations, highlights that nearly 500,000 land species are now at risk of extinction due to threats to their natural habitats. The Sundarbans, a 4,000-square-mile region in Bangladesh and India, is home to the world's largest mangrove forest and a diverse ecosystem that supports hundreds of animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. However, 70% of the region is only a few feet above sea level, making it vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Researchers predict that the warming planet will be \"enough to decimate\" the few hundred Bengal tigers remaining in the region. By 2070, the study concludes that there will be no suitable tiger habitats remaining in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. The findings, which rely on climate scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, add to previous studies that have made similarly dire predictions for wildlife in the Sundarbans. In 2010, a study by the World Wide Fund for Nature projected that a sea level rise of 11 inches could reduce the number of tigers in the Sundarbans by 96% within a few decades. Climate change has already had a devastating impact on the world's endangered mammals, with a recent study finding that it has harmed almost half of them. The new report's lead author, Sharif A. Mukul, and his colleagues examined the risks to the tiger population beyond sea level rise, which accounted for only 5.4-11.3% of the projected habitat loss in 2050 and 2070. They found that other climate-related factors were more significant threats to the Sundarbans' tigers, which are one of the largest remaining populations of wild tigers in the world. Since the early 1900s, habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal trade of animal parts have contributed to the global tiger population decline from around 100,000 to fewer than 4,000. A recent study has discovered that the Bangladesh Sundarbans will likely experience a decline in its population due to an increase in extreme weather events and changes in vegetation. As the Sundarbans flood, the likelihood of conflicts between humans and tigers will rise, as the animals venture out of their natural habitat in search of new land. According to Dr. Mukul, an assistant professor of environmental management at Independent University, Bangladesh, \"Many unforeseen consequences could arise. The situation could worsen significantly if a cyclone hits, a disease outbreak occurs, or a food shortage develops.\" Notably, a landmark report by the United Nations's scientific panel on climate change, released in October, warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current rate, the Earth's atmosphere will warm by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2040.

Additionally, there were shallow moonquakes occurring just a few miles beneath the surface, which couldn't be fully explained. However, a recent study published in Nature Geoscience suggests that these shallow quakes were caused by a combination of escaping internal heat and Earth's gravitational pull, triggering movements along numerous young faults. This discovery implies that the moon is still tectonically active, raising concerns about the potential for shallow moonquakes at future lunar bases. It also sparks questions about the moon's evolution, particularly given its small size and the assumption that internal heat should have long since escaped into space.

A general rule of thumb is that you're not seeing the Earth pass through the comet's most recent orbit, but rather the remnants of its previous passes. For example, during the Perseid meteor shower, you're seeing meteors that were ejected from Comet Swift-Tuttle's visit in 1862 or earlier, not from its most recent pass in 1992. This is because it takes time for debris from a comet's orbit to drift into a position where it intersects with Earth's orbit, according to Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office.\n\nTo get the best view of a meteor shower, find a location with a clear view of the entire night sky, ideally with dark skies, away from city lights and traffic. Look for a spot with a wide, unobstructed view to maximize your chances of spotting the show. Meteor showers are typically visible for a set period, but they peak in visibility from dusk to dawn on a specific few days, when Earth's orbit crosses through the thickest part of the cosmic stream. The peak times of meteor showers vary, with some lasting only a few hours and others several nights. The showers tend to be most visible after midnight and before dawn.

        "Text": "A Federal District Court judge in Manhattan rejected the argument on Monday. Judge J. Paul Oetken wrote in his decision, \"The court acknowledges that the SALT cap is a unique provision, but the states have failed to demonstrate that it exceeds Congress's broad authority to impose taxes.\" The lawsuit was joined by three other states: New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland. The cap on state and local tax deductions, which was previously unlimited, was introduced as part of the 2017 tax law to offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the cap and related provisions are expected to generate nearly $700 billion in revenue over the next decade. Independent analyses suggest that even in high-tax states like New York, most residents received a modest tax cut under the 2017 law. Other provisions of the law, such as reduced marginal tax rates, offset the loss of the deduction for many families. The state and local tax issue poses an awkward challenge for Democrats, who are seeking to restore a tax break that primarily benefited high-income earners. Prior to the cap's implementation, households earning $200,000 or more accounted for roughly half of the nearly $600 billion in state and local tax payments deducted on federal tax returns. However, Democrats argue that the SALT cap unfairly penalizes states with progressive tax policies, making state and local taxes more expensive for residents. This could hinder states' ability to raise taxes, particularly on wealthy residents, and increase pressure to cut spending. In their lawsuit, the four states claimed that the SALT cap constitutes a coercive effort by the federal government to influence certain states' tax policies.  ",

        "Text": "Evolutionary biologist Julia Sigwart from Queens University Belfast in Northern Ireland has an intriguing explanation for why chitons roll into balls: \"To get to the other side.\" It's a behavior that dates back to the time of trilobites, which became extinct around 500 million years ago. These ancient creatures would curl up into a ball for protection, and their modern-day equivalent, the chiton, has a similar ability. Despite its appearance, which resembles a flattened piece of shrimp nigiri, the chiton is a marine mollusk that clings to tidepool rocks rather than being served on a dinner plate. Like trilobites, several other animals, including three-banded armadillos, pill bugs, and hedgehogs, can also roll into balls. Many scientists believed that this behavior, known as conglobation, was a defense mechanism against predators. However, Dr. Sigwart, who has studied chitons, has questioned this assumption. If a predator can swallow an animal whole, she reasoned, rolling into a ball would not provide sufficient protection. In a series of lab experiments, Dr. Sigwart found that chitons roll into balls to help them reach new locations after losing their footing. Her research, published in Biology Letters, suggests that chitons are capable of making decisions and may be more intelligent than previously thought.  ",

However, tracking the frequency of these destructive storms is challenging due to the limited availability of records, which date back only about a century and a half. Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery by compiling a 1,500-year history of hurricanes in the Bahamas, using sand and shell fragments extracted from submarine caverns known as blue holes. According to their findings, published in Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology in October, hurricane activity has fluctuated significantly over time. Notably, recent hurricane activity in the Bahamas has been relatively low compared to historical highs, despite intense activity in other parts of the Atlantic. The scientists attribute these fluctuations to changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, as well as volcanic activity. Following the destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian, Lisa Kennedy, a geographer at Virginia Tech, describes this historical record as a \"wake-up call.\" She notes that we are still in the early stages of understanding hurricane patterns and processes within the context of long-term history. Blue holes, formed when carbonate rock erodes and collapses, are revered by divers for their deep, clear waters and are also important repositories of scientific data. Hurricanes deposit coarse materials like sand, gravel, shells, and coral fragments into these holes, making them valuable keepers of the historical record.  ",

Unlike humans, who only lose one set of teeth over their lifetime, dinosaurs frequently shed tens or even hundreds of sets due to their unique dental habits. Herbivorous dinosaurs, which needed to chew through tough plant material to sustain their large bodies, often replaced their teeth frequently. However, researchers were surprised to discover that a carnivorous dinosaur, the only known cannibal, replaced its teeth even more frequently than some herbivores. The dinosaur's habit of chewing on the bones of its prey may have contributed to its rapid tooth replacement rate, scientists hypothesized. The findings were published recently in the journal PLoS One and focused on several meat-eating dinosaurs, with Majungasaurus crenatissimus emerging as the star of the study. This 20-foot-long apex predator, which lived on what is now Madagascar around 70 million years ago, left behind a remarkable fossil record, including several complete skeletons, hundreds of fragmentary skeletons, and tens of thousands of shed teeth. \"This is quite unusual,\" said Michael D.

With its iconic yellow-and-red color scheme, \"No Music, No Life\" slogan, and expansive aisles stocked with LPs and CDs, Tower Records dominated the retail music industry before the digital era. At its peak, the chain had over 200 stores across 15 countries and annual sales exceeding $1 billion. However, debt and shifting consumer habits ultimately led to its closure in 2006. Solomon's journey began at his father's drugstore in Sacramento, where he sold used jukebox records as a teenager. From there, he built a retail empire that was renowned for its vast selection of music and the vibrant culture that surrounded it. Tower Records' employees were passionate music aficionados, and the stores, which stayed open till midnight, became gathering places for fans. The locations on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood and Broadway in Greenwich Village became popular tourist attractions, and even attracted celebrity devotees like Bruce Springsteen and Bette Midler. However, Tower Records' most famous patron was Elton John, who would often visit the Hollywood store early in the morning. A 2015 documentary, \"All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\" features footage of John browsing the aisles and purchasing vinyl records in the 1970s. Solomon's reliance on debt to fuel Tower's expansion ultimately became a burden on the company's finances, particularly by the early 2000s. The decline of the music industry, exacerbated by online piracy, also took a toll on Tower Records. The company suffered significant losses, including $10 million in 2000 and $90 million in 2001. In 2004, Tower Records' parent company filed for bankruptcy in the United States, and two years later, the company closed its 89 American stores after liquidation sales. Outside the first store in Sacramento, employees left a poignant message: \"All things must pass.\" In October 2006, a Tower Records store near Lincoln Center in New York was bustling with shoppers seeking out final deals, as photographed by Michael Nagle for The New York Times.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, physical album sales in the United States, which reached a high of 785 million in 2000, plummeted to 103 million in the most recent year, as music consumption shifted towards digital formats.

It appears as though they are belching, singing, or screaming the catchphrase \"Feed me Seymour,\" a phrase reminiscent of their Hollywood cousin. This unusual pitcher plant, Nepenthes ampullaria, is native to Southeast Asia and the Malay Peninsula. The \"Seymour\" it's referencing is actually the worm larva of Xenoplatyura beaveri, a fungus gnat that develops inside the plant's mouth. When mature, the gnat resembles a mosquito with impressive biceps.\n\nThis unlikely duo has a peculiar relationship. The plant provides a safe haven for the gnat larva to eat and develop, while the larva, in turn, builds a web across the plant's lips, captures and devours other insects, and then deposits its ammonium-rich waste into the plant's pitcher. The plant, in turn, feeds on these nutrients. This unusual arrangement is an example of \"mutualism,\" a concept explored in a recent study published in Biology Letters.\n\nResearchers, including Weng Ngai Lam, a graduate student in botany at the National University of Singapore, have conducted laboratory experiments to simulate this insect-plant interaction in the wild. Their findings suggest that cohabitation may have benefits for these obscure organisms. The study of tiny pitcher plant communities like this one may uncover secrets about plant and insect life, revealing the intricate relationships that exist in the natural world.  ",

The 33-foot-long whale, which weighed only 13,000 pounds, was swept onto the rocky shore on February 27. Despite being still growing, the whale was unusually underweight, with a typical adult sperm whale reaching up to 120,000 pounds. A necropsy revealed that the whale's stomach and intestines were clogged with 64 pounds of trash, including plastic bags, ropes, netting, and a plastic drum, which it was unable to digest or pass through its system. This caused severe inflammation, leading to the whale's decline and eventual death. Sperm whales, which can dive to great depths to hunt squid, often linger near the surface, making them vulnerable to ingesting floating debris that may be mistaken for food. Unfortunately, pollution in the ocean has devastating effects on wildlife, particularly in areas where buoyant debris accumulates in \"islands\" of trash that float above or just below the surface. One such area, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is estimated to contain at least 87,000 tons of plastic. As plastic pollution continues to grow, some scientists believe it may have a greater impact on animal populations than climate change. In 2008, two whales were found on a beach in Northern California with bags and netting in their stomachs, likely discarded by fishermen. One whale's stomach had ruptured, and the other, which had consumed over 160 pounds of trash, likely starved to death as the garbage obstructed its stomach. The authorities in Murcia have released the results of a necropsy conducted by the El Valle Wildlife Recovery Center as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the impact of plastic and trash in the coastal region's waters. Volunteers are working to clean up local beaches and are urging the public to be more mindful of their plastic waste disposal. \"It's crucial that we address this issue through both cleanup efforts and education, making sure our citizens are aware of the importance of protecting our environment,\" said Ms. Rosauro.

By analyzing the genetics of loggerhead turtles, researchers discovered that the turtles swim in a large loop from their nesting grounds in North Carolina and Florida to North Africa, before returning to nest on beaches within a 40-50 mile radius of their birthplace. The study suggests that the turtles imprint the unique magnetic signature of their home beach, a process known as geomagnetic imprinting. According to Dr. Kenneth Lohmann, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and senior author of the study, this knowledge is crucial for restoring sea turtle populations to areas where they once thrived before being hunted to extinction. He also notes that similar principles may be applicable for restoring salmon and other fish populations to their natural habitats, as many birds and fish also rely on magnetic fields for navigation.

According to a 2017 study published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, a single cloud of spores can spread over 40 miles or more from its original source. The gypsy moth is the adult stage of a caterpillar species that poses a significant threat to tree canopies. Introduced from France in 1869, the gypsy moth's feeding habits are more destructive to trees than those of native tent caterpillars, which it resembles. A fungus that specifically targets gypsy moths was first detected in the Northeast in 1989, although efforts to introduce it as a biological control measure began as early as 1910. In 2000, a coordinated program was launched by 11 states and the US Forest Service to combat the gypsy moth infestation. While the program has not completely halted the spread of the moths, it has significantly slowed their advance. The Cornell researchers are hopeful that the natural fungal predator can be harnessed to control the gypsy moth population and reduce the reliance on insecticides.  ",

The series marks Baron Cohen's first starring role on TV since 2004, when HBO aired the final season of \"Da Ali G Show\". \"Who Is America?\" has been in development for over a year. The show's format appears to be consistent with Baron Cohen's previous work, which blurred the line between satire and reporting by featuring the star in disguise, interviewing unwitting subjects. On Sunday, Baron Cohen's Twitter account linked to a trailer that began with the phrase, \"Imagine if Sacha Baron Cohen had been undercover, secretly filming a new show for a year.\" The trailer then showed a snippet of former Vice President Dick Cheney signing what Baron Cohen's new character referred to as his \"waterboard kit\".

Despite this, technical hurdles remain, such as delivering drones in urban areas, and regulatory challenges may prove even more significant. The Federal Aviation Administration is gradually authorizing drone delivery tests in the US, including a forthcoming pilot program with Wing in Virginia. In an effort to turn regulatory requirements into a business opportunity, Wing is developing software that enables unmanned aircraft to navigate the skies, essentially creating an automated air traffic control system for drones. Meanwhile, Alphabet's other new unit, Loon, is building high-altitude balloons to deliver internet connections to rural or disaster-stricken areas. These massive balloons, which operate in the stratosphere at an altitude of around 13 miles above ground, use wind currents to cluster around areas with poor connectivity. Loon collaborates with local telecommunications companies to enhance cell service on the ground, acting as a temporary, floating cell tower. Loon, which originated in 2011 within X, has since traveled over 18 million miles, providing internet connectivity from Brazil to New Zealand. Last year, Loon delivered connections to Peru following floods and Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.  ",

        "Text": "When you drip water onto a hot pan, the droplets will behave like tiny, speeding hovercraft, sliding around on cushions of steam. This phenomenon is known as the Leidenfrost effect, which has been observed by cooks and scientists alike. German doctor and theologian Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost first described the effect in his book on the properties of water in 1756. However, French scientists have recently made a new discovery about the behavior of these skittering drops. When the droplets are small enough, about a millimeter in diameter, the heat from the pan causes them to tilt and rotate, which propels them to roll. This phenomenon was previously unknown because scientists had not attempted to pin a water droplet to a precisely flat surface before. Additionally, the clear color of water makes it difficult to see the liquid's movement. It was previously thought that the droplets moved due to air currents or sliding down a slope, but the new research shows that they can move independently. \"It's surprisingly simple,\" said David Quere, a scientist at the Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris. \"The drop is running away, and it has a little motor inside, which is surprising.\" Quere and his colleagues published their findings in the journal Nature Physics this week. To observe the Leidenfrost effect, droplets of water were placed on a very flat, very hot, nonabsorbent surface held in place by a needle. The surface must be at least 400 degrees Fahrenheit, well above the boiling point of water, for the effect to occur. Some recipes use this test to determine whether a pan is hot enough. Large drops, measuring over 1.5 millimeters in diameter, have a flattened shape, resembling puddles. Within each drop, two convective cells rotate in opposite directions, much like two wheels spinning towards each other, canceling out each other's motion. The flow within the drop was visualized using tracers mixed with the water. As the water evaporates, the droplet shrinks and becomes nearly spherical, allowing for only one convective cell to exist. When the needle is lifted, the smaller droplet speeds away in the direction of its convective spin. The researchers' next step is to guide the droplets through channels or temperature gradients. There are still fundamental phenomena to be explored, such as why the surface temperature must be significantly higher than the boiling point for the drops to levitate. Interestingly, there is currently no clear answer to this question. ",

Just three decades ago, we had no idea if there were planets beyond our own solar system. In 1995, astronomers made a groundbreaking discovery when they found that a star in the constellation Pegasus was wobbling due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet, an exoplanet that was scorching hot and inhospitable to life. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive spectroscopes that can detect the subtle changes in starlight caused by an orbiting planet. As a planet orbits its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again, a phenomenon that can be detected by these advanced instruments. The Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, revolutionized the field of exoplanet hunting by discovering thousands of planets in a small patch of the Milky Way. Unlike earlier methods, Kepler didn't look for wobbles; instead, it searched for small dips in starlight caused by a planet passing in front of its star. Kepler's findings were astounding, revealing a diverse range of exoplanets, including systems with multiple planets, icy worlds, scorching hot planets, and even planets from other galaxies that had been absorbed by the Milky Way. In recent years, astronomers have made significant progress in directly imaging exoplanets, capturing blurry but tantalizing glimpses of alien landscapes. We've also discovered a free-floating planet not bound to any star, as well as signs of planets being born, including dark rings of dust around newly formed stars. The next generation of planet hunters is now on the horizon. On April 16, 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, will launch from Cape Canaveral and spend two years scanning the entire sky for minute dips in brightness caused by nearby alien worlds. TESS is equipped with four cameras that can cover a 96-degree swath of the sky, which it will divide into sections and study for 27 days at a time before moving on to the next. \"In two years, we will have mapped the entire sky. TESS will follow an unconventional orbit, venturing as far as the moon every two weeks before returning to Earth and releasing a flood of data to enthusiastic astronomers. As a planet hunter, TESS's discoveries can be further studied by the next generation of telescopes on Earth and in space. If fortunate, TESS may uncover planets with lakes, oceans, and atmospheres rich in chemicals, allowing us to detect signs of habitability or even life. The gases on these planets could reveal whether they are capable of supporting life similar to our own. The Milky Way is estimated to harbor more planets than stars, with a vast diversity that remains largely unexplored. In our quest for life and meaning in the universe, our own planet remains the ultimate benchmark.\" ",

A recent discovery by Dr. Currie and his team has revealed that this partnership between ants and antimicrobial bacteria has been in existence for tens of millions of years. The key evidence came from two 20-million-year-old ants found trapped in amber in the Dominican Republic. One of the fossilized ants had specialized pockets on its head, known as crypts, which are also seen in modern ants and are believed to house the fungus-protecting bacteria, actinobacteria. The other ant specimen was found with gas bubbles on its body, likely produced by the respiration of the actinobacteria. \"It's as if the ants are mobile pharmaceutical factories,\" said Dr. Currie, a co-author of the study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This finding suggests that, like ants were ahead of humans in cultivating crops, they also preceded humans by tens of millions of years in partnering with microbes to produce antibiotics. Dr. Hongjie Li, an evolutionary biologist in Dr. Currie's lab and the lead author of the study, discovered the bacteria in the amber ants while inspecting the specimens using a scanning electron microscope at the Smithsonian Institution. \"It was a surprise to me,\" Dr. Li said. The team combined this finding with data on 69 other ant species to reconstruct the ant's evolutionary tree. The results indicated that ants established their partnership with bacteria tens of millions of years ago, shortly after they developed their fungus-farming abilities.  ",

A recent study suggests that Aesop's fictional account may have been rooted in reality, as researchers have found significant differences in the diets of urban and rural rodents. By analyzing the remains of brown rats that lived in and around Toronto between 1790 and 1890, scientists discovered that city rats enjoyed a more varied and stable diet compared to their rural counterparts. Just as in Aesop's classic tale, city rats thrived on the abundance of human waste, while country rats struggled to survive. According to Eric Guiry, an archaeologist at Trent University in Ontario and lead author of the study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, city rats had a significantly higher proportion of meat in their diet. \"The difference is evident in their bones,\" Guiry noted. Guiry and his co-author, Michael Buckley of the University of Manchester, are pioneers in the field of paleoproteomics, which uses ancient bone proteins to gain insights into an animal's behavior. Guiry's interest in applying this technique to rats was driven by a desire to learn more about human populations in the 1800s without having to analyze human remains. The research also has practical implications for cities seeking to better manage their rodent populations.  ",

What's remarkable is that the lander doesn't have a microphone - instead, its seismometers, designed to measure marsquakes, picked up vibrations in the air, which are essentially sound waves. The winds, which were blowing at a moderate 10-15 miles per hour, caused the lander's solar panels to vibrate, and the seismometers recorded these vibrations. According to Thomas Pike, a scientist from Imperial College London, the process is similar to how humans hear sound. The solar panels act like the eardrum, the spacecraft structure is like the inner ear, and the seismometers function like the cochlea, converting vibrations into nerve signals. The recorded vibrations have a frequency of up to 50 Hertz, which is audible to humans as a low rumble. NASA has also created a version of the recording that boosts the sounds by two octaves. Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator of the mission, described the sounds as \"unworldly,\" saying they evoke the feeling of wind or ocean waves, but with an otherworldly quality. A second instrument, an air pressure sensor, also detected sound vibrations, although at a much lower frequency that is only audible to certain animals, such as elephants and whales. Here is a recording of the air pressure sensor's readings, sped up by a factor of 100, which raises the pitch by over six octaves. The sounds are lower in frequency because the instruments are not sensitive to higher frequencies. On Mars, the air is incredibly thin, with a density only about 1% of Earth's, which makes it more conducive to low-frequency sounds. The two Viking landers that NASA sent to Mars in 1976 were equipped with seismometers that captured some wind noise, but the recordings were made at lower sampling rates and didn't pick up any sounds at audible frequencies. According to Dr. Banerdt, the Viking seismometer did detect movements of the spacecraft, but it would be a stretch to describe them as sounds. NASA attempted to send microphones to Mars on the Mars Polar Lander spacecraft in 1999, but it crashed during landing. The Phoenix Mars lander was also equipped with a microphone, but it was left turned off to avoid any potential problems during landing. ",

According to Hartmann, there are two routes by which we perceive our own voice when speaking. The first path is the same one we use to perceive most other sounds, where sound waves travel through the outer, middle, and inner ear. However, because our vocal cords vibrate when we speak, a second internal path is created, where those vibrations are conducted through our bones and directly excite our inner ears. This internal path emphasizes lower frequencies, making our voice sound deeper and richer to ourselves, Hartmann explained.

This move is a significant blow to Crackle, as it has been the home to the show for nearly a decade. In addition to the show, Seinfeld has signed a production deal with Netflix, which will see him perform two stand-up specials and develop both scripted and non-scripted content. In recent months, Netflix has been aggressively pursuing top comedic talent, including Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Amy Schumer, all of whom are set to release stand-up specials on the platform. The company has reportedly been willing to spend big to secure these deals, with Chris Rock's upcoming stand-up shows costing a whopping $40 million. Details of Seinfeld's deal with Netflix were not disclosed. \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" has been a flagship show on Crackle for four and a half years, earning an Emmy nomination for best variety series last year. However, Seinfeld's relationship with Crackle has been strained since Sony's TV chairman Steve Mosko left the company last year, and the show has been on the market since at least October. Hulu was also in the running to acquire the show, but ultimately lost out to Netflix.  ",

It might seem logical to assume that meteorites that fall on Earth would be similar to asteroids that pass through our neighborhood, but surprisingly, scientists have found that's not the case. According to Philipp R. Heck, curator at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, \"That's what everybody would have expected,\" but planetary scientists were surprised to discover that the most common types of meteorites on Earth are not common in space. In a recent study published in Nature Astronomy, an international team led by Dr. Heck has shed light on the mystery. The researchers found that mineralogical evidence in some meteorites pointed to a massive collision in the asteroid belt around 466 million years ago, long before dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Dr. Heck estimates that during this time, skywatchers would have seen about 100 times more shooting stars than we see today. To investigate meteorites that landed on Earth before this collision, Dr. Heck and his colleagues turned to ancient limestone from Russia, which is around a million years older. They extracted 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite from almost 600 pounds of rock. These crystals remain unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, allowing scientists to determine that 41 of them originated from space and were once part of specific types of asteroids. The mix of meteorites from this ancient period was strikingly different from what we see today, with more than a third belonging to a type called primitive achondrites, compared to less than half a percent today. Geology professor Tasha L. Dunn, who studies meteorites at Colby College in Maine, praised the research, saying, \"It's really inventive, their approach.\" According to Dunn, the findings align with the growing understanding that the composition of meteorites is shaped by the history of asteroid collisions in the asteroid belt, rather than the proximity of asteroids to Earth's orbit. Pierre Vernazza, a researcher at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille, France, who first identified the discrepancy between asteroids and meteorites in 2008, believes the new paper opens up new avenues of research. For instance, many achondrite meteorites originated from Vesta, a large asteroid that was severely impacted about a billion years ago. However, not all achondrites share this origin. As Vernazza noted, \"In the case of the other achondrites, we don't have a well-known source yet.\" ",

With only around 4,000 remaining in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, the endangered species is struggling to survive due to poaching, habitat destruction, and human conflicts. The main issue, says Madhu Chetri, a biologist at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, is when a snow leopard enters a livestock pen, where it may devour a few goats and sheep or, in extreme cases, massacre over 100 animals in a single enclosure. If the cat becomes trapped, a tragic outcome often follows. \"The herders will usually kill it in retaliation,\" Chetri explains. To address these conflicts, Chetri and his team have been studying the dynamics between humans and snow leopards in Nepal's Central Himalayas. To achieve this, they spent over 150 days tracking snow leopard scat, analyzing the excrement to uncover clues about the cat's diet and feeding habits. This research could eventually inform conservation strategies aimed at reducing contact between snow leopards and farm animals.

According to NASA research scientist Noah Petro, \"These things are very subtle... If it's a cloudy night, you might not even notice it.\" The best time to observe the eclipse is around 7:44 p.m. Eastern time, when the moon's top will appear slightly gray. As for the comet, it will pass close to Earth, about seven million miles away, which is 30 times the distance between our planet and the moon. Unfortunately, its distance means it will be challenging to spot without binoculars or a telescope.

The study, published in The Journal of Experimental Biology, involved housing a group of retired Navy dolphins and a retired killer whale in a large tank with a trainer for six months. The goal was to observe and measure the energy expenditure of these marine mammals as they performed various behaviors, such as swimming through oversized hula hoops.\n\nThe researchers, led by Terrie M. Williams from the University of California, Santa Cruz, found that dolphins and whales use more energy when swimming quickly than when cruising at normal speeds. This may seem intuitive, but it challenges the common assumption that marine mammals, which are known for their impressive diving abilities, have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve energy and oxygen.\n\nTo conduct the study, the team worked with trainers to encourage the marine mammals to engage in different behaviors, such as resting, swimming in a straight line, or diving to swim through hoops. The animals' breathing, oxygen intake, heart rate, and swimming patterns were measured across various settings. The results showed that there was little difference in energy expenditure between resting and swimming at average speeds. However, as the animals swam faster, they had to exert more energy due to water resistance, which nearly doubled their normal energy use when swimming at their fastest pace.  ",

Waymo is also competing with Uber in the development of autonomous car technology and is involved in a lawsuit over alleged trade secret theft.\n\nDetails about the deal between Waymo and Lyft remain scarce, with the companies declining to comment on specific products or timelines. The partnership offers Lyft a new entry point into the market, as the company has previously stated it will not develop its own self-driving car technology. \"General Motors acquired Cruise Automation, a self-driving technology startup, for over $1 billion in cash and stock last year. Since then, Cruise has started testing GM vehicles on public roads in California.\" ",

During Monday's broadcast, Brzezinski revealed that Conway would allegedly denounce Trump in private after promoting him on television. \"She would say 'Blech, I need to take a shower' because she disliked the candidate so much,\" Brzezinski said, describing Conway's supposed attitude. Scarborough echoed Brzezinski's statements, saying that Conway had told them she only took the job for the paycheck and would soon be done defending Trump. \"But first, I have to take a shower, because it feels so dirty to be saying what I'm saying,\" Brzezinski mockingly quoted Conway as saying. However, Conway responded to the hosts' claims on Tuesday, calling them \"absurd\" and \"not true.\" Conway initially worked for a super PAC supporting Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, but joined the Trump campaign after Cruz dropped out. She became Trump's campaign manager in August and frequently appeared on TV in support of him. Brzezinski announced in February that she would no longer book Conway on the show, citing concerns that Conway would spread falsehoods. Last week, Brzezinski renewed her criticism, calling Conway \"not credible\" and criticizing CNN for featuring her. \"Your hosts look pained when they interview her because they know they're just doing politics porn,\" Brzezinski said, addressing the rival network. Ms. Conway has faced intense criticism from the media since she defended the White House's claims about the size of President Trump's inauguration crowd by introducing the concept of \"alternative facts\" in January. A recent clip of Anderson Cooper, a CNN anchor, reacting with disdain to her comments during an interview drew widespread attention, prompting Ms. Conway to label the reaction \"possibly sexist\" and attribute it to an anti-Trump bias in the media. Despite having a cordial relationship with President Trump in the past, the hosts of \"Morning Joe\" have increasingly criticized him in recent months. In response, President Trump has stated that he no longer watches the network. ",

The Internet of Things (IoT), which includes wirelessly linked gadgets like security cameras, thermostats, and baby monitors, has been a prime target for cybercriminals seeking to infiltrate or disrupt networks. For instance, a recent major cyberattack, facilitated by compromised devices, brought online traffic to a standstill. To gain a better understanding of how hackers can exploit smart devices, refer to a detailed post on the Heimdal Security blog. In many cases, weak security on both the network and devices themselves has created vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit. However, there are steps you can take to fortify your home network's defenses. To start, ensure your home network router is using a strong, unique password that differs from the default one it came with. Your router's manufacturer should provide instructions for changing the password. Additionally, change any default passwords on your smart devices and use distinct passwords for each one. Furthermore, install any available firmware updates or security patches provided by the device's manufacturer to stay protected.  ",

When Charles Darwin visited the islands, it was the diverse range of finch beaks that helped him comprehend how a single species could evolve into multiple forms. Now, the Galapagos cormorants, the only species of cormorant that has lost the ability to fly, have enabled scientists to pinpoint the genes responsible for this species' divergence from all other cormorants approximately two million years ago. These genes, present in birds, mammals, and most animals, including the commonly studied nematode C. elegans, are also found in some algae. Their effects vary, however. In humans and cormorants, the genes influence bone growth. In humans, mutations can lead to severe diseases, while in birds, they resulted in smaller wings and a weaker breastbone, making flight less effective. Alejandro Burga, a researcher in the lab of Leonid Kruglyak, chairman of human genetics at UCLA's medical school, analyzed the DNA of these and other cormorants with his colleagues.

A team of scientists sought to understand why senior cows are so adept at survival. Is it because these elk are naturally more cautious, which allows them to evade hunters more effectively? Or can cows learn to avoid hunters over their lifetime, even if they start out more daring? Research published in PLOS One suggests that both factors are at play. By tracking dozens of female elk over several years, the authors found that, overall, cautious cows were more likely to survive. However, they also discovered that individual cows could adapt their behavior and adopt stealthier strategies as they aged. As cows got older, they tended to move shorter distances and seek safer ground if they sensed a higher risk of encountering hunters.  ",

The resignations are a significant blow to the network's reputation at a sensitive time, as it has faced intense criticism from President Trump and his supporters, who have labeled its reporting as \"fake news\".

However, wolves do not recognize human-drawn boundaries and can roam freely across the region. A recent study published in Wildlife Monographs suggests that efforts to control wolf populations outside the preserve have had negative effects on the wolves living within it. The study found that when the Alaskan authorities were culling wolf populations outside the preserve, the survival rates of wolves within the preserve were lower than usual. This highlights the importance of communication and cooperation between wildlife managers within and outside preserve boundaries, with potential implications for wildlife management programs globally. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has invested millions of dollars since the 1990s in an intensive predator management program, initially using sterilization and later shooting and killing hundreds of wolves from helicopters. The program aimed to increase the population of the Fortymile caribou herd in the surrounding lands, but after decades of effort, the herd still only peaks at around 50,000 to 60,000, down from an estimated hundreds of thousands in the 1970s. Research has suggested that these efforts may not be effective in increasing caribou numbers in the area. Over 22 years of monitoring wolves in the preserve using radio collars, researchers led by John Burch, a National Park Service wildlife biologist, found that wolf survival rates decreased during lethal management outside the preserve. \"Every single wolf pack left the preserve,\" Dr. Burch noted, as the state only targeted wolves outside the preserve, while many wolves that ventured outside the preserve were shot and killed.

These ticks, which are looking for their first blood meal, can be found on forest floors, suburban estates, and urban parks across North America and Europe, where tick-borne disease is on the rise. Typically, they feed on white-footed mice and other small mammals that are notorious for harboring pathogens that can infect humans. However, a new study suggests that the surge in tick-borne disease may be linked to a decline in traditional mouse predators, which could otherwise keep mouse populations in check. If mice were scarcer, larval ticks might feed on other mammals and birds that don't carry diseases harmful to humans, or they might struggle to find their first meal. Ticks need three meals to reproduce, and humans are only at risk of contracting diseases from ticks that have previously fed on infected hosts.\n\nTo investigate this theory, lead researcher Tim R. Hofmeester, then a graduate student at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, set up cameras in 20 plots across the Dutch countryside to monitor the activity of foxes and stone martens, key predators of mice. The plots were located in both protected areas and areas where foxes are heavily hunted. Over a two-year period, Hofmeester also trapped hundreds of mice and voles in the same plots, counted the number of ticks on them, and tested the ticks for infection with Lyme and two other disease-causing bacteria.

We cry in response to a wide range of emotions, from the loss of loved ones and violence to heartbreak and even the joy of a sweet kiss or meaningful words. Sometimes we don't cry when we should, and other times we cry for no apparent reason. Amidst all this emotional complexity, it's refreshing to appreciate the straightforward explanation behind why onions make us tear up. Onions release a chemical called lachrymatory factor, or LF, which irritates our eyes when it reacts with other substances. Simply peeling an onion won't cause our eyes to water, but chopping, cutting, crushing, or smashing one will. This is because the onion's cells break open, allowing two previously separate substances to combine and form a potent chemical irritant. According to Josie Silvaroli, an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University, this chemical reaction is similar to tear gas, as it releases a gas that hits the eyes and sensory nerves, causing them to tear up. The lachrymatory factor evolved as a defense mechanism to protect onions from microbes and animals, including humans. When an onion is damaged, it triggers this defense mechanism, releasing the chemical reaction as its cells break down.  ",

This shift would mark the latest in a series of changes to Fox News's prime-time schedule, which has been in flux since the departures of Megyn Kelly and Bill O'Reilly earlier this year. The network is also facing unprecedented competition from MSNBC, whose hosts have seen a surge in popularity among liberal viewers since the presidential election.  ",

Madden had already been in advanced talks to join AMC, which was looking for a new head of original programming following Joel Stillerman's departure to head up programming at Hulu. In his new role, Madden will oversee a range of popular shows, including the hit series \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Better Call Saul\", which is up for several Emmy Awards on Sunday. He will also play a key role in AMC's in-house studio and will be responsible for programming at Sundance TV. During his time at Fox, Madden was involved in the development of shows such as \"The Shield\" and \"The Americans\", and his focus on grittier, more complex programming is reportedly a better fit for cable networks like AMC.

On Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan ruled that a lower court had made an error in dismissing a defamation lawsuit filed by three former members of the fraternity featured in the 2014 article. The original ruling had dismissed the lawsuit, stating that the three men - George Elias IV, Ross Fowler, and Stephen Hadford - had not shown that the article was about them personally, aside from their affiliation with the fraternity. However, the appellate judges disagreed, ruling that the article could be seen as \"of and concerning\" Elias and Fowler, and sending the case back to the district court for further proceedings. While none of the men were named in the article, details like the setting of the alleged rape and descriptions of the men's interests could have led a reader familiar with the fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, to identify Elias and Fowler, according to the lawsuit. The judges upheld the original dismissal in the case of Hadford, whose only identifying feature was his fondness for riding his bike around campus.  ",

After years of conservation efforts by the Chinese government, including the restoration of bamboo forests and the establishment of national reserves, the panda population has made a remarkable recovery. In September 2016, the pandas were officially removed from the endangered species list, with an estimated population of 1,864 - not including cubs. This is a significant increase from the low of around 1,200 in the 1980s. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned that climate change and other factors could still devastate the pandas' habitat in the long term, making any population surge a temporary victory. The fragmentation of the panda population, which is now confined to just six mountain ranges and 30 isolated groups, is also a major concern. According to Dr. Ouyang and her colleagues, Chinese conservation efforts have had a positive impact on panda habitats in recent years, and planned changes are expected to reduce pressures on the pandas and their habitat in the short term. However, infrastructure development, tourism, and other human activities could undermine these improvements. The researchers recommend several steps to prevent the pandas from becoming endangered again, including improving connectivity between isolated panda populations by building habitat corridors and reducing habitat fragmentation. They also suggest establishing \"ecological red lines\" to physically separate panda habitats from human development, expanding panda preserves, and restricting tourism in national parks containing pandas.

While many are too racy to print, one tale stands out as a testament to the mansion's infamous reputation. Sharan Magnuson, a former Warner Bros. executive, has a story that many women can relate to. Magnuson arrived in Hollywood in 1980 to pursue an acting career and soon discovered a side of the Playboy Mansion that few people dared to discuss - at least, not if they wanted to be invited back. \"At first, it was enchanting,\" Magnuson recalled in a phone interview on Thursday, just after Hugh Hefner's passing. \"Glamorous, fun, and the mansion was immaculately maintained. The banquet spreads were exquisite, and you'd step outside to find flamingos and monkeys. Hef, who would descend from his quarters later, was always gracious and charming.\" However, not all of Hef's male guests shared his gentlemanly demeanor. In the mid-1980s, Magnuson, then known as Sharan Lea, and her girlfriend were invited to the mansion for a Sunday movie night. Although she was not naive and had a reputation for being part of a hard-partying crowd, she was still taken aback when a guy who had seemed friendly earlier cornered her outside, near the famous grotto with its three massive hot tubs and shelves stocked with large bottles of Johnson's Baby Oil. \"He suddenly had nine hands,\" Magnuson said, recounting the incident. \"He tried to get me into the cave, and when I refused, he physically restrained me.

It has the capacity to release over 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash in a single event - a staggering 2,500 times more material than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which claimed 57 lives. This could blanket most of the United States in a thick layer of ash, potentially plunging the Earth into a prolonged period of volcanic winter. Yellowstone's most recent supereruption occurred 631,000 years ago. However, it's not the only buried supervolcano on the planet. Scientists believe that a supereruption occurs every 100,000 years, prompting questions about when the next such event will occur. To better understand this phenomenon, scientists are studying Yellowstone's past to uncover the secrets behind these rare and violent events. The early findings, presented at a recent volcanology conference, have revealed a surprising discovery: the forces driving these events can move much faster than previously thought. The initial evidence suggests that Yellowstone's most recent supereruption was triggered by new magma entering the system just decades before the eruption. Previous estimates had assumed that the geological process leading up to the event took thousands of years to unfold.  ",

The revelation came as the company reported a narrower net loss in the third quarter and a 14% increase in daily active users. However, the disclosure may further damage Twitter's reputation, which is already under scrutiny over its role in Russia's election meddling, its handling of abuse and harassment on the platform, and concerns about its slowing user growth worldwide.

As a result, the company lowered its monthly active user count by 2 million for the first and second quarters of this year and by 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Avrich claims that the original film, titled \"Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project,\" was watered down, and he now feels a moral obligation to rework it in light of the sexual harassment and rape allegations against Weinstein. Speaking from Ottawa, Avrich stated that he wants to expand the documentary beyond its initial 11-minute conclusion, which focused on Weinstein's behavior as a sexual predator. However, Avrich must first resolve the issue with IFC Films, a division of AMC Networks, which acquired the distribution rights to his documentary in 2010. Avrich has long alleged that IFC subsequently requested edits to the film and ultimately decided against a theatrical release to appease Weinstein, who was a powerful figure in Hollywood at the time. IFC has consistently denied these claims, releasing a statement on Wednesday that said: \"The film was made available on various platforms, including Netflix, iTunes, and our own streaming service. We believe we provided suitable distribution for the documentary, as we do for the six to eight documentaries we distribute annually. We asked the filmmaker to remove 30 seconds of footage that we deemed non-essential to the story.\"  ",

As it expanded, it sent out dark, twisted tendrils called rhizomorphs to explore the underground darkness and forage for sustenance. Today, this enormous organism covers an area the size of three Central Parks beneath the Oregon soil, potentially weighing as much as 5,000 African elephants. Known scientifically as Armillaria ostoyae, this behemoth is affectionately referred to as The Humongous Fungus, and it's officially recognized as the largest known terrestrial organism on the planet by the United States Forest Service. However, its impressive size comes with a deadly drawback: it's a highly destructive forest pathogen. While none have reached the same colossal proportions, other Armillaria species are also prevalent in North America, Europe, and Asia, causing root rot disease in forests, parks, orchards, and vineyards. What sets these fungi apart is their ability to send out stringy rhizomorphs that target weak trees, colonize their roots, and ultimately kill and consume them. A team of international scientists, led by Hungarian researchers, has made a breakthrough in the fight against these fungal giants. In a recent study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, they uncovered the genetic secrets behind Armillaria's remarkable ability to develop its unique rhizomorphs, grow to enormous sizes, and excel at killing host plants.

Research suggests that our sense of smell can vary in sensitivity over the course of 24 hours, with our noses being most effective during the hours leading up to sleep. A recent study published in the journal Chemical Senses found that this fluctuation is linked to our internal circadian clocks. The study, led by sensory researcher Rachel Herz at Brown University, aimed to explore whether the senses of taste and smell in adolescents influence obesity. To conduct the experiment, 37 adolescents aged 12 to 15 spent nine days in a lab, following a strict schedule to regulate their sleep-wake cycles. This allowed researchers to focus on the circadian clock's impact on the body, including metabolism. While more research is needed to determine the applicability of these findings to adults, Dr. Herz notes that the composition of smell receptors in the nose appears to remain stable throughout adulthood, although there is evidence that the body's internal clock may undergo changes.

Your current Christmas tree is lovely, but it's a far cry from the most stunning ones out there. These extraordinary 'trees' aren't plants at all, but rather the intricate homes built by Christmas tree worms on coral reefs around the world. These marine creatures construct their tubes using calcium carbonate secretions and emerge to feed, reproduce, and breathe using their branchial crowns. As you snorkel through the waters, keep an eye out for these vibrant, spiral-shaped cones that resemble miniature decorated firs. According to marine biologist Orly Perry, who's studied these 'trees' as part of her doctoral research, they're \"really pretty, very colorful, very festive, and Christmassy.\" Most of these worm 'trees' grow no more than an inch from the tube's opening, but they make up for their small size with dazzling displays that resemble the work of a skilled candymaker. In the Gulf of Aqaba, near Eilat, Israel, Perry has observed many of these 'trees' displaying a kaleidoscope of colors, including purples, greens, and whites. However, they can also be found in a range of other colors, and some even sport a solid winter white hue. Unlike other creatures, Christmas tree worms don't burrow into the coral; instead, they latch onto dead spots or wounds and begin constructing their tubes. By synchronizing their tube growth with the coral's growth, the worms ensure that their homes remain stable and accessible. Once settled, these worms stay put for up to 30 or 40 years, unable to relocate. As Perry notes, \"it's crucial to find the right place\" to settle.\" The locations where these larvae settle are not arbitrary. They appear to have a specific preference for certain coral species, often opting for less aggressive ones. Some species within the Spirobranchus genus have a fondness for artificial surfaces, while others have been found to thrive on specific types of coral. In fact, Mrs. Perry discovered a potentially new species in the Gulf of Eilat that has a peculiar affinity for plastic buoys and metal surfaces on piers and staircases. It's possible that the larvae are drawn to these preferred habitats by signals emitted by older worms that have successfully colonized similar locations in the past. In these optimal environments, the worms are able to grow to their full size. According to Mrs. Perry, this phenomenon is reminiscent of human behavior: \"If you're comfortable in a place, everything is happy, and that's true for these worms too. Their size is directly impacted by their habitat choice.\" ",

However, a recent study published in Veterinary Pathology has found two cases of cancer in naked mole rats housed in zoos. According to Martha Delaney, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and lead author of the study, these cases do not rule out the possibility that naked mole rats may hold a clue to fighting cancer, but rather provide additional clues about what makes them less susceptible to cancer. \"Now that we have two cases of cancer in naked mole rats, we can study the colonies from which they came to understand why they are more prone to cancer compared to other zoo and research colonies,\" Dr. Delaney explained.

To investigate, researchers at two forest research sites in Minnesota tested the respiration rates of 10 tree species from boreal and temperate forests over a period of three to five years. The trees were subjected to two conditions: ambient temperature and a 6-degree warmer temperature, achieved using heating cables. To examine long-term temperature adaptation, the scientists compared three factors: carbon dioxide release in ambient conditions, carbon dioxide release in the warmer conditions, and carbon dioxide release during short-term exposure to the warmer temperature (minutes or hours). When analyzing the results, they found that trees acclimated to warmer temperatures increased their carbon dioxide release by a significantly smaller amount than trees exposed to the same short-term temperature increase.

However, before moving on to the kindness aspect, she made racial comments that ultimately led to her termination on Wednesday. The shooting, which occurred on March 9 in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, killed five people, including a pregnant woman, and remains unsolved, with no arrests made and no suspects publicly identified. In her March 21 Facebook post, which was later edited and deleted, Bell played detective, making some critics feel that her comments relied on harmful stereotypes. \"You don't need to be a criminal profiler to imagine the mental picture of the killers who shattered so many hearts two weeks ago,\" she wrote. The post continued to describe the suspects as \"young black men, likely in their teens or early 20s\" who had been in the system before and were familiar with the police. Bell also mentioned a hardworking young black man she saw working at a restaurant, praising him in a way that some saw as condescending. \"I wonder how long it had been since someone told him he was special,\" she wrote. Bell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Station officials removed her from the air last week and distanced themselves from her remarks, with President and General Manager Charles W. Wolfertz calling her comments an \"egregious lack of judgment\" in a broadcast address. In a statement, WTAE-TV's parent company, Hearst, said her comments were \"inconsistent with the company's ethics and journalistic standards.\" Ms. Bell, who has been a part of the station since 1998 and has earned 21 regional Emmy Awards, issued an apology on her Facebook page, which has since been removed. In her statement, she acknowledged that some of her words may have been hurtful and could be perceived as racist. She expressed regret for causing offense and apologized sincerely. One of her supporters defended her, saying, \"She spoke the truth, and those responsible for her termination should be ashamed.\" This is not the first time Ms. Bell has faced criticism for her comments. In the past, she has been forced to apologize for remarks perceived as offensive to African-Americans, according to Media Matters, a liberal watchdog organization. In 2010, after a segment on sunscreen, Ms. Bell made a comment to her black co-anchor, saying, \"I want whatever you're using.\" She later apologized, saying that her words didn't come out as intended and had unintentionally offended some people.

The documents, published by the Center for International Environmental Law, suggest that the industry had a deep understanding of climate change as far back as 60 years ago. According to Carroll Muffett, the environmental law center's director, Exxon's predecessor, Humble Oil, was aware of rising CO2 levels and the potential for global warming as early as 1957. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies, and other organizations had formed a group called the Smoke and Fumes Committee to monitor pollution research and use science to undermine environmental regulations. Muffett believes that this committee's actions would be echoed in later efforts to discredit climate science. The Center for International Environmental Law's work was first reported by Inside Climate News, which has previously published stories suggesting that Exxon Mobil understood the risks of climate change from its own research and used that knowledge to plan activities such as Arctic drilling. Exxon Mobil's own research also funded climate denial groups until the mid-2000s. The investigations have led to a surge in activism against the company and the energy industry, with the hashtag #exxonknew. Attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, have demanded information from Exxon about its internal research and funding of climate denial. Inside Climate News announced that its article on Wednesday is the first in a series based on the environmental law center's work and documents. Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers dismissed the new allegations as absurd. Exxon Mobil is pushing back against an investigation into its knowledge of climate change, claiming that the inquiry is not credible. The company is being investigated by four attorneys general, including Claude Earl Walker, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islands, who is working with a private law firm. Exxon Mobil filed a response in Texas, accusing Walker and his team of misusing their power and violating the company's constitutional rights. The company argues that it has no physical presence in the Virgin Islands and therefore is not subject to the jurisdiction of the island's courts. ",

As I observe these changes, I am left wondering whether our college and university faculties are prepared to teach a diverse student body. Unfortunately, I believe they are not.

These institutions assume students' potential for success, rather than viewing students of color through a deficit lens. They also teach in a way that focuses on students' needs, rather than the professor's convenience. Additionally, MSI faculty members collaborate to develop curricula and empower students, allow students to bring their full identity to the classroom, and provide culturally relevant assignments that connect to students' communities.

The experience in California over the past two decades serves as a stark warning. Prior to the statewide ban on affirmative action in 1997, the incoming classes of undergraduates at Berkeley and UCLA were roughly 8% African-American. In contrast, last year's incoming classes saw a significant decline, with only 4.3% of UCLA's students and 2.8% of Berkeley's students identifying as African-American. Meanwhile, the percentage of black college-age residents in California remained unchanged during this period. This stark reality demonstrates the impact of California's ban, which was the result of a ballot initiative. It is peculiar that, despite the ongoing debate over affirmative action, few dispute the importance of diversity in generating innovative ideas. Without a diverse student body and faculty, universities will struggle to achieve excellence in teaching, research, and intellectual discovery. Furthermore, without the ability to consider race in admissions, achieving diversity will become an unattainable goal for many institutions. While preserving the consideration of race in admissions is crucial, it is insufficient.

For some, this may be accompanied by other sensations: a sudden pain in the back, a kick in the lower abdomen, or an urgent need to use the restroom. These symptoms are reminiscent of those experienced by individuals who have passed a kidney stone, a condition that may surprisingly be triggered by certain roller coasters, according to a new study. To investigate this phenomenon, researchers created a silicone cast of the inside of a kidney and used it to study the effects of roller coasters on kidney stones. The study found that moderate-intensity, rattling roller coasters may be effective in dislodging small kidney stones in the outer ducts of the kidney and propelling them towards the ureter, the tube connecting the kidneys and bladder. The researchers' report, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, suggests that riding these roller coasters could be a potential treatment for patients with kidney stones that are five millimeters or less in diameter. \"The idea is to dislodge these small stones before they grow into larger, more painful stones,\" said Dr. David Wartinger, a professor emeritus at Michigan State University and one of the study's authors. Dr. Wartinger was inspired to conduct the study after treating multiple patients who had passed kidney stones after visiting an amusement park. One patient in particular stood out, who passed kidney stones after each of three consecutive rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Disney World in Florida. Dr. Wartinger teamed up with Dr. Marc Mitchell, a urologist at the Doctors Clinic, to create a 3D-printed silicone cast of a patient's kidney. They filled their life-size model with kidney stones and urine and headed to Disney World, where they took 20 rides on Big Thunder Mountain, holding their model at kidney height and observing the movement of the kidney stones. A recent study found that the back of a roller coaster is a more effective spot to try and dislodge a small kidney stone, with a success rate of 64% compared to just 17% at the front. Each year, over 300,000 Americans seek emergency care for kidney stones, often due to severe pain caused by a large stone lodged in their ureter. However, it's unlikely that a roller coaster ride would provide relief for those with larger stones. According to Dr. James Borin, a urologist at New York University, this study is specifically designed for individuals with small kidney stones. For now, if you're aware of having a small kidney stone and are interested in trying the roller coaster method, it's recommended that you consult with your urologist. Who knows, you might be able to eliminate your kidney stone while also having a thrilling experience – a true case of \"killing two birds with one stone.\" ",

Mark Thompson, CEO of The New York Times Company, said in a statement, \"The Wirecutter and The Sweethome's practical approach to product recommendations aligns with our newsroom's values and standards. Their guides, which focus on helping readers make informed purchasing decisions, are in line with our goal of creating products that are essential to our readers' daily lives.\" Founded in 2011 by technology journalist Brian Lam, a former editor of Gizmodo, The Wirecutter provides recommendations for gadgets and electronics, such as TVs and headphones. The Sweethome, which focuses on home products, was also part of the acquisition. The Wirecutter was initially published as part of The Awl network, founded by Choire Sicha and Alex Balk, both former Gawker Media employees, with the goal of providing in-depth product reviews rather than frequent updates.

Wenner, the founder and owner of Rolling Stone, defended the magazine in a libel trial in federal court in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying that the publication was wrong to fully retract a discredited 2014 article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia. According to Wenner, much of the material in the article was accurate, and he argued that the magazine had followed the highest standards of journalism in investigating the allegations. Wenner claimed that the magazine did not confront the accused rapists, but instead focused on verifying the account of the woman at the center of the article, known as Jackie. He attributed some of the blame to Jackie, whose story began to unravel shortly after the article's publication two years ago. Wenner said that journalists are powerless to stop individuals who are determined to commit fraud, and he disagreed with the decision to retract the entire article in response to a critical report by The Columbia Journalism Review in 2015. While Wenner acknowledged that the magazine had retracted the specific allegations made by Jackie, he believed that the bulk of the article, which detailed ways to improve the University of Virginia's handling of sexual assault cases, was still valid.

Growing up as the son of a single mother who lost her job during the recession, Gray knew he would need significant financial aid to fund his college education. After a seven-month long and arduous search for scholarships, Gray successfully raised $1.3 million by applying for and reusing essays on leadership and community service, while also avoiding scams. During his time as a student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Gray turned his experience into a social enterprise, developing an app called Scholly that matches students with personalized lists of scholarships. Scholly quickly rose to the top of the iOS App Store after Gray pitched it on \"Shark Tank.\" In just three years, Scholly has been downloaded over a million times and has helped students secure more than $50 million in scholarships. Now 25, Gray has been recognized as one of Forbes's \"30 Under 30\" and Oprah Winfrey's \"SuperSoul 100.\" As someone from Birmingham, Alabama, Gray initially felt the need to leave his hometown to pursue a career in technology entrepreneurship. He wanted to break the cycle of poverty and create a better life for his younger brother and sister, who were 4 and 2 years old when he started college. Gray's success has been both surreal and emotional, as he has been able to achieve his goal of helping a large number of people. Initially, Gray's goal was not to become a billionaire, but rather to make a positive impact on his community. It was only when he realized the vast market for scholarships that he understood the potential for Scholly to become a successful business. During his time at Drexel, Gray was surrounded by students from diverse backgrounds, including those from affluent families who still required financial assistance to fund their education.  ",

The Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, where chemicals like DDT and Agent Orange were once manufactured, has contaminated the surrounding waterways, allowing toxic substances to seep into the bodies of aquatic animals. Miraculously, some of these animals have survived, including the Atlantic killifish, a small, silver fish that has adapted to thrive in this toxic environment. According to a recent study published in Science, the killifish's ability to survive in polluted waters is a remarkable example of evolution in action. Researchers first discovered the fish's tolerance to toxic waters in the late 1990s, and since then, they have found that distinct populations of killifish have independently developed similar genetic adaptations to survive in highly polluted areas along the Atlantic coastline. The new study reveals that evolution can occur independently in different populations, and that similar genetic changes can emerge in response to extreme environments. According to Diane Nacci, a biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency, the study provides a valuable example of how animals can adapt to rapidly changing environments. The researchers, led by Noah Reid, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Connecticut, compared the genomes of 384 killifish from polluted and less-polluted areas, finding that a single genetic pathway was responsible for the pollution tolerance in all regions, although with slightly different patterns of genetic changes in each population.

To do so, simply book a trip with one of the many local dive shops and get ready for an unforgettable adventure. The boat will take you just a few yards from the beach, and from there, you'll dive in and swim down a few feet to witness the breathtaking sight of \"fish clouds\" above you. For the best view, consider heading out early, but don't worry if you can't make it soon - the sardines are present every day. Unlike the famous sardines that migrate to South Africa's coastal waters by the billions during the summer, the Philippine sardines are a year-round attraction. The sardines' unique schooling behavior, known as a \"bait ball,\" is thought to confuse predators and help the fish survive. However, it's not a foolproof strategy, as evidenced by a 2010 video captured by conservation biologist Simon Oliver, who observed a thresher shark using its long, sickle-shaped tail to stun and devour the sardines. The sardines' presence near Cebu's beaches remains somewhat of a mystery, as they were previously unknown in the area until recent years. According to Dr. Oliver, the science on the populations of these fish is lacking, and it's unclear why they've emerged in such numbers. While the sardines may not be permanent residents, Dr. Oliver believes they've found a niche in the area, much like any other species that adapts to its environment. It's possible that a small number of eggs drifted into the waters around Cebu and were able to thrive due to the presence of few predators, an abundance of plankton, and ideal water temperatures. The sardines seem to migrate between locations, such as between Pescador Island and the shores of Moalboal. If this favorable setup were to change, they may disappear for good. ",

The strategic goal of Panther, Jay Z's company, is to expand globally and scale up Aspiro's platform, technology, and services. Jay Z's interest in Aspiro may be driven by his desire to tap into the niche market of high-fidelity digital music. Aspiro's WiMP and Tidal services, available in a few European countries and the US, respectively, offer lossless audio formats that are significantly higher in quality than those of Spotify and most other streaming services. WiMP has 512,000 paying subscribers, according to Aspiro's latest quarterly report, while Tidal has not disclosed its customer numbers, although it charges $20 per month, twice the average rate of most streaming services. The number of companies offering high-quality digital audio has increased recently, including Tidal, WiMP, Deezer's Elite version, PonoPlayer, and Sony's high-resolution Walkman, priced over $1,000.

This benefit has been a staple of the liberal arts school, located near Charlotte, North Carolina, for an impressive 95 years. The service was originally introduced in 1920, when the all-male student body was expected to dress formally, complete with dress pants, starched collars, and ties. According to Jan Blodgett, the college archivist, the laundry service has been a beloved tradition ever since. However, come next month, this perk will come to an end. While freshmen students appreciate the convenience, only about a third of seniors continue to take advantage of the service. The college attributes this decline to the abundance of laundry machines available on campus, which are also free to use. By discontinuing the laundry service, the college expects to save around $400,000 per year, which it plans to redirect towards educational initiatives.  ",

According to Jesse Slome, spokesman for the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, women typically account for approximately two-thirds of long-term-care insurance claims paid annually. Last year, insurance companies paid out $7.5 billion in claims. As a result, women will now pay several hundred dollars more per year in long-term-care premiums compared to men, according to the association's 2014 report, which is based on data from insurers.\n\nFor a single 55-year-old man in good health buying a new policy, the average annual premium for a policy providing $164,000 in current benefits without inflation protection would be $925. In contrast, a woman of the same age and health would pay an average of $1,225 per year for the same policy, a difference of $300 or more than 30 percent. The difference in premiums is even greater if you opt for a policy that builds in 3% annual inflation protection, compounded annually. For this option, a 55-year-old healthy man would pay $1,765 per year, while a woman would pay $2,307.\n\nThe association found that a typical single woman will pay an average of 12% more than in 2013. The impact of gender pricing on couples who buy a policy together varies by insurer, with some companies pricing policies based on their rates for single men or women, while others offer a blended couples rate. Genworth noted that its gender-specific pricing only applies to single policies. Insurers typically offer significant couples discounts, and the average premium for couples with inflation protection has risen by about 3% from last year. When considering long-term care insurance, it's essential to explore ways to secure the lowest premium possible. According to Mr. Slome, consumers should shop around as premiums for similar coverage can differ significantly among insurance providers. Insurance broker Rose Clayton of Orange County, California, recommends that women keep the additional premium cost in perspective. While clients may initially be disappointed to learn that women pay a higher premium, Clayton notes that it's not a deal-breaker. Instead, it serves as a reminder to plan for their golden years. As Clayton pointed out, a visit to a nursing home or assisted living facility can starkly illustrate the impact of women's longer lifespan. ",

But if Calpers can be forced to take a cut in Stockton, what's to stop another city from filing for bankruptcy and reducing its pension contribution by half?\"\n\nMr. Sweet and other public finance lawyers believe that the outcome in Stockton could serve as a guide for Detroit, which is not currently in bankruptcy but has been placed under emergency management by the state of Michigan. Calpers, a $252 billion pension fund, administers pensions for California state employees and many municipal workers. The fund calculates the annual contribution amounts, bills the cities, collects the payments, invests the funds, and distributes benefits to retirees. When Calpers' investments lose money, as they did during the stock market crash, the cities' bills increase. In 2011, Stockton paid Calpers $20 million, roughly double the amount it spent on public libraries. The city's payments to Calpers are expected to nearly double over the next decade, making Calpers Stockton's largest creditor. Stockton claims it has no choice but to continue making payments, even as it cuts costs elsewhere, including payments to bondholders. The city argues that reducing the rate at which its workers build up their pensions would lead to a mass exodus, particularly among police officers who were recruited with promises of large, early pensions. Last year, Stockton requested a \"hardship exemption\" from Calpers, allowing it to slow down its contributions. However, Calpers denied the request, fearing that if Stockton fell behind, it might never catch up. \"They're terrified,\" Mr. Sweet said. \"Calpers claims that if they give Stockton a haircut, the entire system will collapse.\" The phrase \"if it happens in Stockton, it's going to happen in San Bernardino, and if it happens in San Bernardino it's going to happen in Modesto, and if it happens in Modesto it's going to happen in Bakersfield, and if it happens in Bakersfield it's going to happen in Fresno\" suggests that financial troubles tend to spread throughout the region.\n\nSan Bernardino, however, did not follow the same path as Stockton. After Stockton filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, San Bernardino did the same, but instead of continuing to make contributions to Calpers, it stopped making them. Calpers was prepared to take legal action, but the judge handling San Bernardino's case, Meredith M. Jury, put the issue on hold, stating that she would address the matter of pension contributions later in the bankruptcy proceedings. In contrast, Stockton continued to make its pension contributions during its bankruptcy, a decision praised by Calpers' spokesperson, Amy Norris, who described it as a \"right business decision.\" ",

The agreement, which aims to eliminate most tariffs over the next few years, was signed in Beijing during a state visit by Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir. The two economies, with Iceland's GDP of $14 billion and China's GDP of $7.3 trillion, are vastly mismatched, with trade between the countries being relatively small, totaling $402 million in 2011. While Iceland cannot offer significant new market growth, it could help China gain more influence in the Arctic region, which is becoming increasingly accessible due to global warming and polar ice retreat. China is seeking to join the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body promoting cooperation in the region, as a permanent observer. Iceland, a member of the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area, will not grant China backdoor access to the European market through this trade deal. The country had been negotiating EU membership but suspended talks in January due to domestic opposition. If Iceland were to join the EU, it would have to terminate its bilateral trade deals, according to the EU trade commissioner's spokesman. The two governments also issued a joint statement calling for cooperation on human rights, gender equality, labor issues, Arctic affairs, geothermal development, culture, education, and tourism.

This development comes at a time when China's intentions towards its North Atlantic ally are under scrutiny, following the construction of a large Chinese Embassy in Reykjavik and the puzzling effort of a Chinese billionaire to build a luxury hotel and golf course in a vast Icelandic wilderness area.

While home loan rates are unlikely to return to traditional levels, they will likely remain modest, having encouraged millions of homeowners to refinance and contributed to the housing market's revival. As the yields on 10-year government bonds rise in response to signs of economic improvement and the Federal Reserve's plan to reduce bond purchases, mortgage rates have quickly followed. On Thursday, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages reached 4.25 percent, up from 4.12 percent the day before, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hinted that the central bank may begin to ease back on stimulus efforts later this year. Just a few months ago, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.5 percent, near a historic low. In contrast, credit card borrowing costs are already at relatively high levels, and rates on short-term loans, such as car loans and home equity loans, are tied to short-term interest rates, which the Fed has indicated will not rise before 2015. For example, the rate on a five-year car loan is currently around 4 percent, similar to its level in mid-May. Similarly, a fixed-rate home equity loan carries a rate of 6.1 percent, not far from where it was a month ago. However, the fact that the Fed is keeping the short-term bank lending rate at close to zero means that savers will not see any improvement in the low interest rates paid on savings accounts, money market accounts, and short-term certificates of deposit, which are also tied to short-term rates.

This concern comes as Greece received a 4 billion-euro ($5.3 billion) aid package from its creditors, comprising the IMF, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank, on Wednesday.

The Fund also cautioned that investment and growth in Greece are unlikely to recover unless investors are convinced that Greece's creditors have a credible plan to address the country's debt crisis. This warning has sparked alarm among some IMF officials, including Paulo Nogueira Batista, who represents Brazil and 10 other countries on the IMF board. Batista abstained from voting on additional aid to Greece earlier this week and said that the IMF's latest report shows an increasing awareness of the risks of the program going off track.

If you and your spouse reside in a state where same-sex marriage is recognized, and you meet specific requirements (see below), the application process should be straightforward. However, an unresolved question remains regarding couples who were legally married in one state but relocated to another state that does not recognize gay marriage, and whether they can receive the same benefits. This is because the Social Security Administration currently uses a \"place of residence\" standard to determine spousal benefits. According to Susan Sommer, senior counsel at Lambda Legal, the agency has instructed its staff to accept and hold such applications pending further legal clarification. \"We're awaiting guidance, and we're hopeful,\" she said. The agency is also holding other types of applications, such as those for survivor benefits, pending further clarification. Notably, Lambda Legal's Mary Bonauto expressed encouragement regarding the case of 83-year-old Herb Burtis, a musician and voice teacher from Western Massachusetts. Burtis had applied for survivor benefits after his husband's death in 2008, as they had married in 2004 when Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage. Although his initial claim was denied, he became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, and is now receiving the extra payment, as well as a lump-sum payment for the past five years. Bonauto stated that there is \"every reason to expect\" that the agency will eventually process and pay survivor benefits to other eligible same-sex applicants. If you're considering applying for benefits, here are some key questions to consider:\n\n# How do I know if I'm eligible for benefits? You must meet specific criteria.''' To qualify for spousal retirement benefits, you typically need to be at least 62 years old and have been married for at least 12 months. For the survivor's benefit, you must be at least 60 years old and have been married for at least nine months. If you meet the age and duration requirements, Ms. Bonauto recommends applying for benefits, despite any uncertainties. You can apply for spousal retirement benefits online at www.ssa.gov. However, you will need to visit a local Social Security office to apply for survivor's benefits; be sure to schedule an appointment in advance. GLAD suggests bringing a copy of your marriage license, civil union certificate, or domestic partnership certificate, as well as a copy of your spouse's death certificate, to your office visit.

The fortunes of new tech graduates and retiring lawyers fluctuate, but those with considerable capital, essentially the already wealthy, have fared well during the economic recovery. According to economists, the 1% tends to be resilient, and this is particularly true during bad times. A study by Treasury economists found that a quarter to a third of individuals in the 1% in a given year remained in that bracket for the following five years. As a result, the profile of wealth in the United States has remained relatively unchanged before and after the recession. The typical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white, and male, said Mr. Friedman. Warren E. Buffett, the investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, exemplifies this profile, with his net worth increasing by approximately $10 billion over the past year due to his cash reserves and appetite for acquisitions. The tech industry has created hundreds of new top earners, mostly men, although often younger. David Duffield of Workday and Elon Musk of Tesla, among others, have benefited from the tech boom. Meanwhile, fields like finance, medicine, and energy continue to generate significant wealth, with financiers and business owners dominating the ultra-high-net-worth category. Three interconnected economic phenomena - stocks, houses, and loans - have driven the boomerang effect among the country's top earners, economists said. The rich suffered significant losses when the markets plummeted in 2008 and 2009, but those who held on or invested after then have been rewarded, with every dollar invested in the Dow Jones in 2009 now worth approximately $1.40 after correcting for inflation. The recent market gains have boosted the earnings and net worth of Americans who own stocks, primarily through vehicles such as mutual funds. However, the wealthy have benefited significantly more. According to Edward Wolff, a New York University economist, the top 10% of households hold more than 80% of the value of stocks, either directly or through investments like mutual funds. In addition to capital gains from selling their shares, shareholders have also benefited from the surge in dividend payments. Many companies paid out large dividends, totaling around $260 billion, before taxes on unearned income increased in January. Another factor contributing to the wealth gap is housing. Wealthier Americans tend to have a smaller portion of their net worth tied up in their homes, so the nationwide decline in housing prices had a less significant impact on them. However, after prices dropped and credit markets relaxed, many of them were able to purchase homes as investments. ",

In response, businesses have scaled back their spending on capital investments, such as computers, delivery trucks, and equipment, likely due to concerns over higher tax rates and the potential consequences of government cutbacks. With capital expenditures already weak, some economists believe that businesses will increase spending if Congress can provide clarity on fiscal policy, reducing the risk of severe tightening. According to Nigel Gault, chief US economist at IHS Global Insight, \"Businesses must have a list of projects they'd like to pursue, but have been delaying due to uncertainty. Once they have a clearer understanding of the future, including tax rates, they'll be able to revive those plans and implement them.\" Improved access to credit can make capital expenditures more attractive and accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been increasing in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve, and the National Federation of Independent Business reports that the share of small business owners struggling to meet their credit needs has been declining. Additionally, corporate profits reached a record high in the third quarter, adjusted for inflation, and companies have accumulated significant cash reserves that can be used to invest in equipment or hire staff if they feel confident about the recovery. In contrast, consumers are still not financially flush, particularly since their disposable income has been stagnant or declining in recent months.

Unlike other academic libraries that are digitizing and moving their collections offsite, the Mansueto Library is one of the largest and latest to incorporate automated storage and retrieval systems. The library's volumes are stored in solid steel cases located about 50 feet below ground, and books can be retrieved through a complex system of cranes and elevators, reminiscent of the door-sorting machine from Pixar's \"Monsters Inc.\"\n\nThe $81 million Mansueto Library has a capacity for 3.5 million volumes, freeing up space in the main library's cramped stacks that students typically browse. Interestingly, the Mansueto Library also features a lab that serves two purposes: digitization and conservation. The lab not only mends paper and rebinds the university's books, including some ancient papyrus volumes, but also cleans and prepares materials for scanning, which are then shared with partner Google Books.

        "Text": "Despite budget cuts of over $30 million for the next two years, the Brownsville Independent School District is working to maintain funding for its chess program. This year, the district has allocated $400,000 for chess, a significant investment that sets it apart from other school districts nationwide. According to Jay Harris, who oversees the program, Brownsville's commitment to chess is unparalleled. As a border city struggling with poverty, the district sees chess as a valuable tool for student success and a source of community pride. This year, around 4,000 students have signed up for the district's chess programs, which include regular tournaments. Harris notes that it's common to see 500 to 800 students attending these events.

        "Text": "James Anthony, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, is often surprised to discover that many other iPhone and iPod Touch developers share his programming background. Like him, they learned the ins and outs of Apple's hit mobile devices through Stanford's popular iPhone applications course, which debuted in fall 2008 to a packed lecture hall. However, while Anthony took the class as a senior at Stanford, many other Apple developers have learned through free video recordings of lectures on iTunes U, which often ranks as one of the most downloaded courses. According to Anthony, Stanford's online class is currently the primary way to learn about iPhone development. However, online students miss out on the benefits of in-person learning, such as attending office hours or receiving email responses from instructors. Unfortunately, this term's classes are not available online, although past sessions have typically been uploaded to iTunes U within two to three days. Stanford is unable to discuss Apple's new iPad, which is part of the spring syllabus, due to rights issues. However, a lecture from last winter's term by Apple software engineer Evan Doll provided valuable tips for iPad programming. Despite the limitations, classes from past years offer iPhone developers a rare opportunity to gain insight from Apple itself, which is notoriously secretive about its communications.  ",

        "Text": "Ken Meyer and Carmine Fiore exchanged handshakes in the kitchen, while their daughters, Sabina Meyer and Stephanie Fiore, pondered logistical challenges at opposite ends of Room 227 on moving-in day at Queens College's sole dormitory. Stephanie Fiore, for instance, was struggling to find a place to store her extensive shoe collection, as her closet already seemed too small to accommodate all her clothing. Meanwhile, on the floor above, new roommates Letticia Camacho and Juliet Dolan giggled at the unusual coincidence of having brought items that shared a matching color scheme: turquoise-and-purple hangers, storage boxes, and sheets. On the fifth floor, Mohamed Sako left his dorm room door ajar and his stereo playing, with the lyrics to Nicki Minaj's \"Your Love\" drifting into the hallways: \"You got spark, you, you got spunk.\" Living on campus is a privilege reserved for 500 of the approximately 20,000 students at Queens College, which is primarily a commuter college located in a corner of Flushing that is easily accessible by car and bus, but not by subway. The Summit, as the dorm is officially known, offers rooms with full kitchens, cable TV, wireless internet access, and private bathrooms. The dorm has a hotel-like atmosphere, with carpeted hallways, a glass-encased gym, and a lobby featuring flat-screen TVs. For its residents, it is a convenient and enviable living arrangement. For the college, it serves as a valuable recruitment tool.  ",

        "Text": "As part of a project aimed at developing innovative methods for evaluating teachers, researchers have recruited 3,000 educators from seven school districts across the United States. These districts include Dallas, Denver, Charlotte, North Carolina, Hillsborough County, Florida, Memphis, New York, and Pittsburgh. To participate, the teachers agreed to be videotaped in their classrooms, with the understanding that only researchers would have access to the recordings, not school administrators. The participants are comprised of teachers from grades four to nine in regular public schools. To showcase the project for The New York Times, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation requested that teachers in Charlotte and Memphis volunteer to record additional classes, with the understanding that these recordings would not be bound by the confidentiality provisions. One teacher who volunteered was Rachael Maher, a seventh-grade math teacher at Alexander Graham Middle School in Charlotte. For an hour, Ms. Maher taught her students the Pythagorean theorem while digital video equipment captured a panoramic view of the classroom. A few days later, two scorers from the Educational Testing Service, a nonprofit organization based in Princeton, New Jersey, reviewed the video footage to critique Ms. Maher's performance. Edith Aurora Graf and Leslie Thornley, the scorers, watched the video multiple times, much like coaches reviewing game footage. They noted Ms. Maher's rapport with her students, her pacing, and the way she transitioned from direct instruction to group work.  ",
