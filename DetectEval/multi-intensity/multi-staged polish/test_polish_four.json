However, he lacks experience in television, except for watching Richard Branson sell Virgin Mobile to NTL and overseeing the sale of LoveFilm to Amazon. He's skilled at selling companies, not producing TV content. Ofcom and Downing Street have endorsed Gurassa's appointment, replacing a chairman who was a late convert to the Awkward Squad.

The recent stock market rally, triggered by the Bank of Japan's interest rate cut, has brought relief to many in the financial sector. Oil prices, which plummeted to $27 a barrel just two weeks ago, have risen to $34. Investors are concerned that governments and central banks have yet to grasp the true extent of global economic fragility. The situation is precarious, with China's private debt levels reaching alarming heights, Europe's banking system still reeling from bad debts, and consumers worldwide exhibiting nervous behavior. When central banks acknowledge the importance of cheap money, investors rejoice, but when they suggest the world is recovering, investors panic. The recent reaction to the US Federal Reserve's smallest possible interest rate hike sent American consumers scrambling to stash their savings. New car sales declined in December, and consumer sentiment dipped in January, following a weak fourth quarter. The Fed noted that even a small rate hike would likely be ignored by US consumers, who are resilient. The Bank of Japan's interest rate cut is another sign of global economic weakness. Tokyo aims to generate domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and has introduced a negative interest rate to deter foreign funds and encourage domestic spending. The move has had the desired effect, with the yen falling against the dollar. We'll need to wait and see how this affects domestic demand. Meanwhile, the Bank of England has put aside its hopes of following the Fed's lead. Governor Mark Carney's recent speeches suggest a more cautious tone. Given the Federal Reserve's potential struggles to increase interest rates, it's unlikely that the UK would consider a rate hike. A rate hike would cause the pound to surge, making exports uncompetitive and leaving domestic businesses vulnerable to cheap imports. Carney is aware that the recent closure of the Scunthorpe steel plant is just the beginning of potential consequences.",

The allergy is so severe that even being in the same room as someone consuming chocolate poses a significant risk to the child's health. The school's headteacher, Owain Hyett, informed parents in a letter that the school will be completely free of chocolate, including the staff room and office, to guarantee the pupil's safety. Parents have been asked to remove all evidence of chocolate from their children's bags and refrain from packing chocolate products in their lunches. The catering department is working to replace chocolate items on the school menu, and staff will be responsible for ensuring that all areas of the school remain free of chocolate. The decision has sparked debate among some parents, who feel they were not consulted and that the ban is too sweeping. One parent questioned the feasibility of the ban, asking how staff would enforce it and whether they would need to inspect lunchboxes for chocolate. The ban is part of a growing trend of schools accommodating children with severe allergies. Many primary schools and nurseries have already implemented bans on nuts due to the rising prevalence of nut intolerance among children. National regulations have prompted many schools to prohibit crisps and chocolate from being brought into lunchboxes due to health concerns.

EDF directors had been set to meet this week to approve a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset, but a final decision has been pending since October. China's state nuclear firm CGN agreed to take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by Chinese Premier Xi Jinping. EDF executives have delayed a final decision due to funding issues, according to French financial journal Les Echos. The company is reportedly seeking help from the French government to find new backers to join the project alongside CGN. Although directors are scheduled to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, no decision is expected until the next meeting, which will take place before the release of final results on February 15. EDF has declined to comment on the matter. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, and the UK government has faced criticism for agreeing to pay EDF £92.50 per unit of electricity, more than double the market rate. A group of EDF employee-shareholders has urged the company to abandon the Hinkley project, citing concerns that it could put the company's survival at risk. Green campaigners argue that any fresh delay highlights the flaws in a deal intended to kickstart a new generation of nuclear power in the UK. The EDF board is clearly rattled by this crucial investment decision, said John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace. This delay could signal the end of Hinkley. EDF managers and employee representatives on the board are concerned that the project is too risky and too expensive. He also criticized former Chancellor George Osborne for defending the Hinkley project. The UK government has faced criticism for its handling of the project, with some arguing that it is too costly and too risky.

The company claims that increased fees to enter the newly privatized Newcastle port will significantly impact coal producers' profit margins. Glencore's appeal comes amid declining share prices and job cuts in its zinc production operations worldwide. The company is challenging a 2015 decision by then-acting treasurer Mathias Cormann, who declined to declare the port's fees as excessive. If successful, the appeal would allow Glencore to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration, potentially leading to lower port fees. The tribunal battle will focus on technical issues related to competition laws and the impact of privatization and price increases. Glencore argues that the port's unconstrained pricing and monopoly over access create uncertainty for coal producers and acquirers in the Hunter Valley. The company claims that the port's monopoly power will significantly impact coal producers' profit margins. The Australian government has yet to respond to Glencore's application. The case will test the limited types of review available to the Australian Competition Tribunal in \"access\" cases. Glencore's financial struggles began shortly after its initial public offering in 2011, when the company listed on the stock market.

They contend that this would bring direct ownership and accountability to the broadcaster, rather than the current system, which is susceptible to excessive government interference. Thomas and Baker argue that the BBC is a \"public service\" broadcaster, but its ownership and accountability are unclear. They believe that the current proposals, which would grant the government more control over the BBC, fail to address the issues of ownership and accountability. Instead, they propose mutualizing the BBC, which would give licence fee payers a direct say in the organization's governance. By becoming members and owners of the BBC, TV licence holders would be empowered to address the ownership deficit. As members, they would elect representatives to hold the executive management accountable for their actions. Key issues like executive compensation and resource allocation would be decided at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) that would be open to all members, either in person or online. This would fill the accountability gap and provide a strong defense against political interference. Mutualising the BBC would not only lend credibility to the licence fee, but also foster a sense of unity between the BBC and its audience, which is essential for the BBC's success.",

The prevalence of racism in the media is often linked to the industry's lack of diversity, which has remained stagnant. In 1968, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders found that the media predominantly reported from a white perspective, with fewer than 5% of editorial staff members being African American.

Hispanic people comprised just 4% of employees in 2015, compared to 17.4% of the US population. The problem lies in three obstacles: inexperience, unpaid internships, and a lack of social capital. A new lawsuit against the New York Times cites a 2014 study, which found that reporters were 3.5 times more likely to cite men as sources than women. In 2015, the New York Times had the largest gender gap in bylines, with only 32% of articles written by women.

This unusual warmth is a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of climate change. The country has consistently shattered temperature records, with February setting a new record and March shattering that record shortly after. In fact, March 2016 was the warmest March on record in Australia. The Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook forecasts above-average temperatures to persist across the country at least until May.\n\nAccording to David Karoly, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, climate change has increased the likelihood of March breaking temperature records in Australia by at least seven times. \"The previous record had a one in 43-year chance of occurring naturally, but now it happens about once every six years due to human-induced climate change,\" Karoly said. \"This is evidence that climate change is already happening and escalating the risks of extreme heat.\"\n\nBlair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology notes that while April may not set a new record, it will still be significantly warmer than normal. Throughout May, there is an 80% chance that temperatures across most of the country will be warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. By June and July, coastal regions will continue to experience unusually warm weather, but temperatures will return to normal in central and southern Australia.\n\nThe current warm spell is partly due to the massive El Niño event that occurred in 2015, which spread warm water across the Pacific Ocean. However, this is happening on top of the backdrop of global warming, Trewin said. In an El Niño year, the world tends to experience extreme temperatures, while in other years, temperatures are merely above average. \"La Niña events were typically followed by normal or slightly cool global temperatures.\"",

Led by former National Highway Traffic Administration administrator David Strickland, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets aims to bring autonomous vehicles to US roads nationwide. The coalition claims that self-driving cars will reduce crashes by 94%, as human error causes most accidents. However, experts warn that tech companies may gain legal protection over car owners in the event of a crash. This could pose a challenge for personal injury lawyers, who are already concerned about the technology. Accident lawyer Daniel Vega fears that the lobbying group may unfairly protect tech companies and app makers over human car owners, leaving drivers responsible for accidents. Statistician Susan Paddock notes that testing self-driving cars is challenging, and consumers must become comfortable with uncertainty before adopting the technology. Paddock emphasizes that even if autonomous vehicle fleets travel 10 million miles, it's impossible to draw statistically significant conclusions about their safety and reliability. Strickland stresses that the coalition's goal is to establish a single, national policy for self-driving cars, rather than navigating state regulations. The widespread adoption of self-driving vehicle technology will undoubtedly lead to safer and less congested roadways in America.

The total lending figure of £17.1 billion marked a 64% increase from the same period last year, the highest figure since April 2008. In a hurry to beat the deadline, buyers hastily closed property deals, while existing homeowners also surged, driven by the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period.

However, the lending figures reveal an increasingly imbalanced financial landscape, with borrowing by manufacturers plummeting while buy-to-let speculation has soared. Lending to manufacturing companies, which had been growing at an annual rate of 12% in 2014, has come to a standstill, while construction lending is also declining.

Under the pseudonym Docubyte, Ball developed a fascination with retro computers, creating the project to celebrate their uniqueness. He notes that it's rare to find hands-on interaction today, as most computers have transitioned to touch screens. Ball believes pre-Apple era computers are often overlooked as design pieces, and his nostalgia for their aesthetic led him to photograph a range of machines from the latter half of the 20th century. He found the machines at the Science Museum in London, the Dresden Technical Collections, and the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, then meticulously enhanced the images with his colleagues at INK studio to make them appear modern. The retouching is essential to the piece. The series showcases striking machines like the Harwell Dekatron, the world's oldest functioning computer, and the Control Data 6600, often referred to as the first \"supercomputer.\" Ball says the machines look attractive, but he'd also like to create a comprehensive book about computing history. With a hint of poignancy, he notes each image, rendered as a jpeg, is approximately 5mb in size – larger than any file the individual computers could handle. They're lovely in their outdatedness.\n\nThose old things are charmingly outdated, he notes with a touch of understatement. In a restrained and unassuming manner, they possess a certain beauty in their obsolescence.",

The Commons work and pensions select committee will launch a comprehensive inquiry into the issue, likely to begin in the autumn. The spotlight has fallen on workers' occupational pensions due to BHS's collapse and Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result of the collapse. The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain's largest defined benefit plans, is facing cuts to facilitate a sale. The scheme has liabilities of almost £15 billion and a deficit of £700 million. The chair of the committee stated that the British Steel pension scheme's troubles are evidence of a broader threat to occupational pension schemes. The committee's case study on BHS is highlighting how such schemes are struggling due to rising life expectancy and record-low returns on capital. \"Pension law and regulation must adapt to the issues of the future, rather than the problems of the past,\" the chair said. \"We should not be under any illusions that British Steel is a special case. The entire savings edifice is at risk.\" The Labour MP noted that 11 million workers have private defined benefit pensions, but more than 5,000 of the associated pension schemes are in deficit, with a total shortfall of £805 billion. \"This will be a major inquiry that will consider radical solutions to one of the great problems of our time,\" he added. The committee will present a unique and free theatrical experience in London, featuring interviews with senior BHS executives and Dominic Chappell, and Sir Phillip Green will appear a week later.",

He expressed hope that any outcome would benefit the UK's membership, acknowledging that the outcome of Brexit talks with the EU is uncertain. London remains the financial hub for Europe, and English will continue to be the language of business, McFarlane said. HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint advised bankers to be cautious in making demands following the Brexit vote, which he described as a rejection of the \"expert class.\" Flint noted that the financial system's resilience was evident this week, as markets functioned smoothly despite a significant surge in trading volumes. Following the recent Brexit vote, Harriett Baldwin, a junior finance minister, sought to reassure the City of London by highlighting that banks maintain substantial reserves and the Bank of England is prepared to take action if needed. Baldwin stated that financial markets are capable of withstanding challenges, adapting quickly, and finding new opportunities.

Carpetright's CEO, Wilf Walsh, expressed caution over the referendum's impact on consumer confidence, citing challenging trading conditions. Despite reporting a 33% increase in underlying profits, the company's shares dropped to 216.88p before recovering to 225p. Carpetright's new financial year got off to a poor start, with UK like-for-like sales declining 7.6% in May before rebounding to a 6.3% increase in June. According to Walsh, the current atmosphere is unusual, with consumers not behaving predictably. It's too early to gauge the full impact of the referendum on the company. Walsh has been working to revamp the retailer, introducing a new store design and customer service improvements. Research shows only 50% of surveyed customers would consider shopping at Carpetright. This year, the company will invest £10 million in refurbishing 100 stores and introducing a new staff uniform. Carpetright has also expanded its product range to include hard flooring, which has proven popular. Carpetright still has a long way to go in its transformation, but we're clear on our direction and confident in our plans, said Walsh.

Asda's sales plummeted by 5.9%, its worst performance on record, while Tesco's sales dropped by 1.3%, the best performance among major chains. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to thrive, with sales increasing by 11.5% and 13.8%, respectively, and their combined market share reaching a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is poised to surpass the Co-op and become the UK's fifth-largest supermarket. The latest figures do not include the period following the referendum, but analysts believe the decision to leave the EU will likely bolster discounters further. The immediate economic uncertainty is unlikely to cause a significant drop in grocery volumes, but may lead to higher prices and increased demand for discounters. Major supermarkets may benefit from a rise in prices, which have dropped by 1.4% over the three-month period. Store closures contributed to the decline in sales at Tesco and Morrisons, as the companies adjust to changing shopper habits. Supermarket sales experienced a surge in the four weeks leading up to June 18, driven by a boost in sales of snacks, beverages, and gourmet items during the Euro 2016 tournament. Beer, wine, and spirits sales jumped 6.2% year-over-year during this period, while crisp and snack sales rose 4.2%, marking the industry's first monthly sales increase in nearly a year.

The Confederation of British Industry's report reveals that the balance of retailers reporting sales increases minus those reporting decreases dropped to 4% in June, down from 7% in May. While some retailers experienced a surge, others reported slower growth or declines. Retailers anticipate a sales boost in July, with the balance expected to shift to -10% from -5% in June. The CBI noted that retail sales reported weak growth in the year to June, exceeding expectations of a modest decline. Orders placed with suppliers decreased in June, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month. Internet sales growth slowed in the year to June, falling below the long-run average, but is expected to rebound strongly in July. The survey suggests that consumers were cautious in their spending before the EU referendum, but did not completely abstain. The question now is how well or poorly retail sales will perform in July following the UK's vote to leave the EU. After the Brexit vote, consumer spending will likely be heavily impacted due to increased uncertainty, potentially higher unemployment, and reduced purchasing power. A separate report from Lloyds Bank found that consumer spending on essential items decreased again in May, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months. Spending on essentials has been declining for 18 consecutive months, with a 0.4% year-over-year drop in May. Food and drink, which accounts for 40% of essential spending, saw a 0.1% increase in May, following a 0.7% drop in April. However, spending on fuel continued to decline, falling by 4.4% in May.",

The broadcaster's share price plummeted by over 20% on Friday and continued to fall by more than 5% in early trading on Monday. By midday on Monday, ITV's share price had dropped to 164p, a significant decline from its pre-Brexit price of 220p and its one-year high of 280p. Investors' concerns about the impact of Brexit on ITV's advertising revenue have driven the company's market capitalization from £9 billion to around £6.5 billion in the days following the EU referendum. City analysts are now speculating that ITV could become a takeover target due to its declining share price and the UK's currency crash. According to Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum, major US media companies have historically and currently shown interest in the UK market, making a takeover bid more likely. Whittaker believes not only established media giants but also new media and tech companies may be interested in making a bid for ITV. NBC Universal has been rumored to have had an interest in bidding for ITV in the past. John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, has a 9.9% stake in ITV, and Malone is also a major shareholder in Discovery. Whittaker recommends that investors \"buy\" ITV's stock, citing the company's undervalued price following Friday's share price fall. Despite the post-Brexit vote, ITV's business fundamentals remain unchanged. Even if we assume a significant decline in advertising revenue similar to the post-Lehman crisis, ITV would still appear undervalued with an attractive dividend yield. In fact, even in a worst-case scenario, ITV's stock price would still be considered cheap. Liberum's analysis compared the 8.3% decline in TV advertising in 2009 to the 8.7% fall in 2010, while media stocks continued to decline, with Sky falling by almost 3%, Trinity Mirror dropping 10%, the Daily Mail declining by almost 4%, and WPP decreasing by 2.3%.",

According to Olivetree Financial data, compiled for FT Money, FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 company directors made more than £18.5m in share purchases between June 23 and July, the largest amount in at least 10 years. The sectors most affected by the Brexit news - banks, housebuilders, retailers, and travel companies - saw the largest director purchases. Many boardroom directors benefited from these deals as the stock market rebounded following the initial dramatic falls. The majority of these transactions took place in late June and early July. The largest single transaction in the FTSE 100 was made by the Darwazah family, Hikma Pharmaceuticals' founding shareholders, who purchased £3.3m of shares the day after the Brexit vote. Tony Pidgley, chairman of Berkeley Group, bought nearly £800,000 of shares on June 27 and has seen their value increase by 15% since then. Lloyds Banking Group saw the most director purchases, with 21 directors buying shares worth over £750,000. Provident Financial was second, with seven directors buying nearly £1.5m of stock, followed by Vodafone, where five directors purchased £1.4m of shares. A total of 69 directors from 23 FTSE 100 companies bought their own company shares, totaling £10.5m. Eighteen top-level bosses, including chief executives, chairmen, and chief financial officers, accounted for 37% of the total amount. On the FTSE 250, 108 directors from 63 companies bought shares in their own businesses, with 39 top-level executives responsible for just over half of the total £8m spent. Four FTSE 100 companies have experienced significant share sales by their directors: Mondi, a paper supplier, National Grid, SABMiller, a brewer, and United Utilities. Meanwhile, two other firms, Coca-Cola Hellenic, a bottling company, and Vodafone, have seen both buying and selling activity by their directors.",

The company plans to achieve this by opening 25 new restaurants, extending operating hours, and introducing new services. Business Secretary Greg Clark hailed the announcement as \"great news for the UK economy.\"\n\nDespite uncertainty surrounding the UK's EU exit, McDonald's is forging ahead with its expansion plans. The company's CEO emphasized that all new jobs will be permanent, comprising a mix of full-time and part-time positions. McDonald's has faced criticism for its use of zero-hours contracts, but is now offering staff the option to switch to fixed-hours contracts.\n\nThe company's decision to revamp its employment policy was driven by feedback from workers, who reported difficulties in securing loans, mortgages, and mobile phone contracts due to employment status uncertainty. The CEO stated that the company considered delaying its expansion plans after the EU referendum, but has instead chosen to accelerate its growth.\n\nThe CEO drew parallels with the last recession, saying that he has learned a great deal from it and is now focused on positioning McDonald's as an \"employer of choice\" in the UK.

Italy's economy has been stagnant for over two decades, marked by slow growth, declining competitiveness, and high unemployment. As a result, non-performing loans have ballooned to €360 billion, equivalent to 18% of all outstanding loans, severely impacting Italian banks. While non-performing loans are a symptom of the problem, they do not cause it. Unlike Greece, Ireland, and Spain, Italy did not experience a significant economic boom before the 2008-09 financial crisis, and its performance has consistently been underwhelming. As a result, the economy is 10% smaller than it was before the crisis, and unemployment is high, particularly in southern Italy. Before joining the euro, Italy could have boosted its competitiveness by devaluing the lira, but this option is no longer available. This creates a significant risk: a European slowdown following Brexit, combined with Italy's already weak economy, could lead to bank failures and small investors being forced to absorb losses. If the Five Star Movement, which has pledged to hold a referendum on leaving the euro, were to come to power, the possibility of Quitaly cannot be ruled out. In the event of a Quitaly, the single currency would likely collapse.",

The report suggests that 12% of agents have reported a decline in asking rents over the past 10 days. While the rental market has responded calmly to Brexit so far, the organization warns that continued uncertainty could lead to turbulence in the coming months. David Cox, managing director of Arla, emphasized the need for the new government to prioritize housing and the rental market, citing concerns that a lack of certainty could lead to institutional investors pulling out of the market, ultimately impacting tenants by reducing supply and increasing rents.\n\nThe report found that almost 36% of Arla members have reported a reduction or no change in the number of prospective tenants looking for properties. Notably, overall supply and demand for rental accommodation increased in June, with prospective tenants seeing a 12% average increase and properties on agents' books rising by an average of 3%. Cox notes that supply and demand remain a significant issue in the rental market. If supply continues to dwindle against growing demand, renting will become more difficult and expensive for tenants, regardless of the eventual implications of Brexit.\n\nA report by the Taxpayer's Alliance recommends slashing stamp duty on homes by half and eventually eliminating it altogether. The report argues that the current tax is exacerbating supply shortages and driving up rents for tenants. Specifically, it suggests abolishing the 3% surcharge on buy-to-let and additional homes, warning that investors will likely pass on the costs to tenants, further increasing rents.",

In 2015, there were 6,700 applications for new retail developments, a drop from 7,360 the previous year. This represents a nearly 50% decline from the 11,900 applications in 2008, prior to the recession. The report emphasizes the ongoing challenges faced by shopkeepers as consumers increasingly opt for online shopping. Despite efforts to expand their online presence, many traditional retailers struggle to keep pace with online-only brands. The report suggests that Brexit uncertainty could exacerbate these challenges, with potential negative impacts on the UK economy. According to Aimee Barrable of EMW, the success of online retailers has led to a decreased appetite for new shop openings. Many retailers instead develop online services or repurpose existing space. Recent high-profile closures could lead to increased retail space, attracting retailers seeking high street presence. Some retailers may delay new shop developments until the Brexit vote's economic impact becomes clearer. Last week's retail sales statistics revealed a 0.9% decline between May and June, exceeding economists' 0.6% expectation. The decline was partly attributed to inclement weather, but also hints at Brexit's impact on consumer spending.",

The firm received a severe reprimand and must pay £750,000 towards the FRC's costs. The fine was reduced from £3.5 million after mitigation and a settlement discount. PwC admitted its conduct fell short of expected standards in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC stated PwC had insufficient audit evidence regarding the loan loss provision and failed to identify inadequate disclosure of the impairment policy. The watchdog said the disclosures were not in compliance with accountancy rules. PwC acknowledged certain aspects of its 2007 audit did not meet expected standards. Audit quality is a top priority for PwC, and the FRC's annual audit quality assessments have shown a trend of improvement. The substantial fines imposed reflect the seriousness of the audit failings and will send a strong signal to the audit community. PwC and its audit engagement partner, Simon Bradburn, were sued by Cattles, which alleged PwC acted negligently in their auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis. Cattles claimed the loan book of Welcome was weaker than stated in PwC's audit.

To share the drinks among three separate sound systems, they must divide the punch equally among themselves. Fortunately, they brought two large bottles to aid in the task.

Analysts are revising their growth forecasts for the third quarter, ranging from 0.4% to 0.5%. The upward revision to growth in the second quarter has boosted hopes of avoiding a recession. Prior to the Brexit vote, the economy had significant momentum, and while it will likely slow in the second half of 2016, it will not experience two consecutive quarters of declining output. The government received less welcome news, as the UK's balance of payments deficit widened to 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016. The deterioration in the UK's trade performance was the primary driver of this increase, highlighting the imbalance in the economy. In essence, domestic producers are struggling to meet consumer demand. The post-Brexit decline in the value of sterling will make exports more competitive, but it will also curb consumer spending by making imports more expensive. Turning around the balance of payments will be a significant challenge, regardless of the outcome of the referendum. The Bank of England may reconsider cutting interest rates again in November, given the economy's resilience in the face of Brexit. The current interest rate of 0.25% is already at a record low, and the bank may be hesitant to reduce it further. The Bank of England may choose to conserve its resources for future use, allowing Chancellor Philip Hammond to take the lead. Despite the recent positive growth news, stimulus measures in the autumn statement still seem likely. This is because the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote is likely to have a more significant impact on long-term business decisions rather than consumer spending. Hammond would be wise to temporarily pause deficit reduction during the two-year Brexit negotiation period, using the extra £30 billion to fund public investment. This approach would have a double benefit: it would help maintain economic growth and ensure that growth is more balanced.",

Why might Henry I be a fitting conclusion to this series?\n\n3. What comes next in the sequence: 2.1, 3.5, 3.3, 2.3, 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 1.8,...?\n\n4. What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 2, 9, 12, 70, 89, 97, 102,...?\n\nThe solutions to these puzzles are:\n\n1. The answer is 19, as the numbers correspond to the alphabet positions of the first letters of the words in the question.\n\n2. The code is indeed a clever one, as it spells out the word \"monarch\" when each term is taken to represent the first letter of a monarch's name.\n\n3. The sequence appears to be related to the layout of a QWERTY keyboard, where each term corresponds to the row and column position of a letter in alphabetical order.\n\n4. The answer is 112, as each number in the sequence is one less than the corresponding number when viewed upside down.\n\nBill, the creator of these puzzles, shares an interesting anecdote about how he came up with the fourth puzzle. He was approached by a Cambridge mathematician who was about to compete in a puzzle-solving competition against Oxford. The mathematician asked Bill to come up with an original puzzle for the informal portion of the contest, and Bill's creation was the result. Although no one was able to solve it, everyone agrees that the puzzle is fair and logical.\n\nI'd like to express my gratitude to Bill once again for allowing me to use these puzzles. Don't miss his latest book, \"Even More Things That Nobody Knows: 501 Further Mysteries of Life, the Universe and Everything\", which will be available in paperback in November. I typically post a new puzzle every two weeks on a Monday. If you have a puzzle you'd like to share, please feel free to email me - I'd love to hear it! As an author, I've written several books on mathematics, as well as the children's book \"Football School: Where Football Explains the World\", which is full of fascinating facts that parents often don't share, such as when footballers use the bathroom, why eagles are a common mascot for football teams, and even how to play football on Mars.

He believes the BBC and National Health Service should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups. Simpson's strongest criticism was reserved for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, whom he accused of being involved in the Hutton affair and colluding with Rupert Murdoch. \"It's astonishing to see the British prime minister cozying up to someone who has no interest in Britain, is deeply opposed to Britain, and is hostile to the country's main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. He believes most governments he has worked with over his 50-year career at the BBC have a \"disgraceful political obsession\" to cut down the BBC. \"I'm not saying that cuts can't be made, but it's the brutality and ideological fervor with which they're implemented that's disturbing,\" he said. Simpson also criticized the government's decision to keep the BBC underfunded since 2010, saying it's \"absolutely disgraceful.\" He expressed his disapproval of the draft BBC charter, which requires the corporation to reveal the salaries of staff earning over £150,000, saying it's just a way for the government to demonstrate its control. Simpson made these comments just three days after being released from the hospital, where he had been treated for kidney failure caused by a reaction to eating kedgeree. \"It's acceptable for individuals like myself, who receive favorable treatment. However, as you progress down the hierarchy, it becomes significantly more challenging. People are anxious about their job security... there's a harsh environment, particularly towards junior staff members.\" After a brief holiday to recharge, I'll begin filming the Panorama special. I plan to travel to Iraq, Russia, China, and possibly the US, and I'm eager to visit a particularly troubled region like the Congo. Initially, there was a plan for a short series, but BBC commissioners rejected it. \"They told me that we don't want current affairs journalists covering current events,\" I was informed. \"I believe what they meant was that nowadays they prefer to feature celebrities like Joanna Lumley.\" My latest book, We Chose to Speak of War and Strife, is a tribute to the foreign correspondents of yesteryear, who I believe are a dying breed.

May praised Carney's efforts to steer the UK economy after Brexit and stated she would support him if he delays his departure until 2021. May's spokesperson emphasized the Prime Minister's consistent admiration for Carney's work and her willingness to support him staying on beyond his initial term. The spokesperson also highlighted May's good working relationship with Carney, intending to continue it. Carney will make a decision on his future plans before the end of the year, emphasizing the need to resolve the matter beforehand. His next public appearance will be at a press conference on Thursday to discuss the Bank's quarterly inflation report. May's recent comments at the Conservative party conference sparked speculation about a rift between Downing Street and the Bank, but No 10 apologized to Carney, insisting the remarks weren't intended to convey a lack of confidence in his leadership. Despite this, senior Conservatives have launched strong attacks on the Bank's monetary policy. Carney has been the Bank's Governor since July 2013, initially stating he'd only serve five years. He has been deliberating on whether to stick to his original plan or stay until 2021. Chancellor Philip Hammond has already expressed support for Carney serving a full eight-year term, believing his departure would cause unnecessary turmoil, especially given the pound's recent struggles on the foreign exchange market.",

The British Infrastructure Group claims the time for excuses from mobile network providers is over, citing the unacceptable state of mobile connectivity in some areas. MPs argue it's unacceptable that some parts of the country still have poor mobile coverage, while visitors from abroad can expect better reception due to their networks' national roaming capabilities. The group proposed an amendment to the government's digital economy bill, which would allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that fail to meet targets set in a 2014 agreement. A report found little evidence to suggest the mobile sector will meet its targets to provide coverage to 90% of the UK's geographic area. Shapps said, \"It's astonishing that with a foreign SIM card, you'll get better coverage than with one of the UK's companies.\" MPs also urged customers to be able to terminate their mobile agreements without penalty if their operator fails to provide satisfactory coverage. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport stated that it understands the inconvenience of poor mobile coverage, which is why it has made it mandatory for each mobile network operator to provide coverage to at least 90% of the UK by the end of next year. Mobile phone operators claim they are working diligently to enhance coverage, with an EE spokesperson saying that while the report acknowledges the importance of increased mobile coverage, it neglects the significant advancements in mobile coverage since 2014.",

In contrast, Amazon fell short of predictions due to increased spending ahead of the holiday season, resulting in a 52-cent per share profit that missed analyst predictions of 85 cents per share. Alphabet's revenue reached $32.71 billion, but is expected to reach between $42 billion and $45.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company maintains its dominance in the mobile advertising market, alongside Facebook, driven by robust sales on mobile devices and YouTube. Alphabet plans to repurchase around $7 billion of its Class C stock and saw its shares rise 1.6% in after-hours trading. Google's ad revenue surged 18.1% to $19.82 billion, accounting for 89.1% of its total revenue, with paid clicks increasing 33%. However, the average cost-per-click fell 11%, down from a 7% drop in the previous quarter. Analysts had predicted a 7.9% decline. The decline in cost-per-click is attributed to the shift from desktop to mobile devices, where ad space is limited and cheaper. Google is expected to capture 56.9% of the global search ad revenue market in 2016, with $52.88 billion in revenue. Google's \"Other Revenue\" segment, which includes its cloud business, saw a 38.8% increase, while Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" generated revenue of $197 million but reported an operating loss of $865 million.

The RBoS Shareholder Action Group, representing 27,000 retail investors, is issuing a warning after reports that other shareholders may settle out of court. The group is eager to take on Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March, seeking to recover losses for thousands of investors who lost money by subscribing to shares during the 2008 RBS rights issue. The announcement comes ahead of RBS's third-quarter results, which will be closely scrutinized for any further provisions related to the case. The total claim by all investors involved totals £4 billion. The court action is just one of many factors that could feature in the bank's results on Friday, when it is expected to report further losses on top of the £52 billion it has already incurred since the bailout. The bank is also expected to provide an update on the potential spin-out of 300 branches and face questions about the alleged mistreatment of small-business customers.

The project received a significant boost with a US$300 million deal between Sirius Minerals and Hancock Prospecting.

Killin tweeted an open letter to Property Week, highlighting that students' maintenance loans barely cover the cheapest rooms at some institutions. The letter emphasized that students cannot celebrate or award a \"for-profit sector\" that is failing many of their peers.\n\nThis development follows a series of university rent strikes and demonstrations coordinated by student activists over the past year. A recent blog post in the Guardian features an anonymous student activist who argues that rent strikes are more than just a complaint about rising student housing costs.

Born in County Durham, Harry was the son of William Jones, a miner, and his wife, May Cowley, who instilled a love of reading in him. His parents' stories had a profound impact on his early life: his father began working in the mines at 12, while his mother received a pre-school education from the library where she worked as a housekeeper. The family relocated to Coventry in 1940 due to unemployment in Durham, where they faced the challenges of wartime. Harry secured a spot at King Edward VI school in Nuneaton, despite the disruptions caused by air raids and the school's lack of facilities. He excelled academically, was an accomplished rugby player, and won awards for public speaking. After national service, Harry attended Birmingham University, where we met and began his teaching career as a lecturer in English. He later became a senior lecturer in liberal studies and played a key role in the liberalization of technical colleges, leading to the establishment of new universities. Throughout his career, Harry supported the fusion of sixth-form college, technical college, and adult education, conceptualizing a student-focused approach as a department head, vice principal, and principal. In retirement, starting from 1993, Harry pursued his passions for literature, theatre, film, music, politics, and football. He remained open to new ideas, developed expertise in computer technology and the internet, and was a dedicated supporter of the Labour party. Above all, his family was his greatest love, and he is survived by his spouse, two sons, and five grandchildren.",

As part of the deal, Sumitomo will acquire the trademark rights to the Dunlop brand globally and its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Mike Ashley acquired Dunlop Slazenger in 2004 for an estimated £40 million. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is deeply rooted in sports such as tennis, squash, badminton, and golf. Sports Direct stated it no longer has the resources to manage international brands and needs to focus on its core UK operations. The Dunlop business generated a pre-tax profit of £4 million on sales of £41.8 million. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has a tyre business and a sports division that produces tennis and golf equipment, already owning the rights to the Dunlop brand in other markets. Sports Direct has faced challenges, including criticism of its working practices and weak trading. The company reported profits had more than halved to £71.6 million in the six months to October 23. The company's chairman attributed the decline to an \"extreme political, union and media campaign\" against the company. An undercover investigation revealed Sports Direct workers were being paid below the minimum wage. The company has been compelled to pay £1 million in back wages to employees and provide staff with guaranteed working hours. As a result, Sports Direct's stock price has plummeted by more than half over the past year. The retailer's profit margins have also been significantly impacted by the pound's sharp depreciation following the Brexit vote. Despite the challenges, Sports Direct still maintains a substantial portfolio of brands.",

Weidmann believes the Italian government should carefully weigh the pros and cons of rescuing the bank if it's facing financial difficulties. He emphasized that the bank's financial health is crucial for the planned measures to be effective, and that funds cannot be used to cover expected losses. Weidmann stressed that all aspects must be thoroughly examined. The ECB has taken a tough stance with Monte dei Paschi, refusing to grant the bank extra time to find private investors. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan after the bank failed to secure €5 billion in private investment. The plan involves dipping into a €20 billion fund to prop up the bank. Monte dei Paschi's poor performance in the ECB's \"stress tests\" prompted the government to take action. Weidmann stressed that the rules are intended to protect taxpayers and place responsibility on investors. He believes state funds should only be used as a last resort, which is why the bar is set high. Monte dei Paschi's troubles began to mount after the 2008 banking crisis, when it made a costly acquisition. The deal ultimately contributed to the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Monte dei Paschi's financial woes escalated three years ago, when it sought a €4 billion bailout amid a scandal over derivatives contracts and allegations of fraud. The bank has since returned to the government for funding after talks with private investors fell through.",

The website was still operational, but it appears to have stopped taking new bookings. Many customers may have used the booking agent website through TravelSupermarket, a popular travel comparison site. The company also partnered with several other major online travel businesses.

You should also reach out to your bank card provider. For credit card users, Section 75 rights will protect them, as the card provider is jointly liable for the booking cost if it exceeds £100. Debit card users may face more difficulty in getting a refund, but they may be eligible for a chargeback scheme. Unfortunately, Atlaschoice did not respond to the Guardian's requests for comment.",

In 2005, I led a Treasury committee inquiry into cash machine fees and discovered that hundreds of local areas faced unfairly high charges. In Speke, a low-income area in Liverpool, consumers were charged £1.50 per cash withdrawal. I established a working group comprising banks, consumer groups, and ATM operators, and the banks committed to maintaining a large network of free cash machines. As a result, a \"financial inclusion premium\" was introduced for operators of free cash machines in 1,500 under-served low-income areas. The importance of the free-to-use ATM network has grown significantly since banks have closed over 1,000 branches in the past two years.

At the company's annual meeting, CEO Ben Magara acknowledged that progress on building homes for its 33,000 employees had been hindered by low platinum prices. The 2012 Marikana massacre, which resulted in 34 deaths, was sparked by a strike by workers demanding a living wage from Lonmin.

The company, which owns Gauloises and John Player cigarettes, unexpectedly decided not to put its new pay policy to a vote at its annual meeting. The policy would have increased Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m per year by expanding bonus opportunities. Imperial Brands did not expect widespread support from investors, given ISS's recommendation to vote against the policy. The company's chairman, Mark Williamson, stated that investors had changed their minds about supporting the plan. Williamson added that revising the policy is necessary to attract and retain top talent and ensure the company's sustainable growth. David Haines argued that the pay rise was necessary not only for Cooper but also for other executives, as it is significantly below the average for companies of Imperial Brands' size. Critics of high pay saw the move as a warning to company executives against pushing through pay increases, but urged investors to maintain their pressure. This is the first sign that some institutions will be more resistant this year, so it looks like good news. The question remains whether asset managers will continue to actively engage in critical discussions.

Mark Carney cautioned that these untested lenders could trigger the next financial crisis if they fail to repay their loans, leaving customers with substantial losses. He also highlighted the risk of cyber-attacks stripping customers of their digital money, leaving them without traditional regulatory protection.\n\nCarney's warning comes after a similar warning from Adair Turner, who cautioned that losses on internet-based loans could make even the worst bankers appear like lending geniuses. Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney noted that digital money could potentially allow millions of people excluded from mainstream banking to access loans securely. However, he emphasized the need for authorities to focus on financial regulations, lending rules, and operational and cyber risks to ensure sustainable growth.\n\nIn the UK, fintech lenders have become increasingly popular, accounting for around 14% of new lending to small and medium-sized businesses last year. These lenders typically offer loans with funds provided directly by investors, similar to securitized loans used by banks before the 2008 financial crisis. Carney cautioned that the rapid growth of online lending could lead to emerging vulnerabilities that regulators would need to address.\n\nThe UK is expected to become a global leader in online lending, putting pressure on the Bank to adopt regulations that protect customers without stifling the industry. The growth of online lending has been hindered by the volatility of digital currencies like Bitcoin, which has limited its adoption due to concerns about its value and security. In recent months, Bitcoin's value has rebounded, and the popularity of blockchain electronic wallets has led some analysts to predict a surge in adoption this year.\n\nTraditionally, payment services relied on cash, debit and credit cards, and wire transfers. However, fintech companies are now offering domestic and cross-border payment services on a large scale through digital wallets or prepaid e-money. According to Carney, tech firms take a share of payment revenues and often gain access to the entirety of customer transaction data. In doing so, they are systematically accumulating the kind of customer insights he gained through his daily interactions with customers as a bank teller.",

Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on affordable arbitration created a major hurdle, as editors argued it would be a final blow to a struggling industry. This posed a litmus test for MPs and ministers, who were uncertain how to proceed. As a result, the culture, media, and sport committee has given Ipso, a non-Leveson-compliant regulator, a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. If Ipso fails, recognition will pass to its rival, Impress. The choice between the two schemes is clear: Impress charges £75 upfront for a three- to six-month process, while Ipso offers super-silky barristers for a downpayment of £300, with potentially much more to follow. A key difference is that Impress caps arbitrators' fees at £3,500, regardless of the outcome, and does not charge legal costs if the plaintiff wins. This has raised concerns among local newspapers, who fear financial losses. Ipso, on the other hand, has more flexible costings and obligations, but its fees are higher and less transparent. The question is, can we get hard data to help make a decision? The answer depends on whether the demand for arbitration is as high as its proponents claim. So far, no one has taken advantage of the arbitration option, despite its availability. It may be that ordinary complaints regulation is sufficient, or that no-win-no-fee solicitors have cornered the market. But can't we gather more information before making a decision?

After leaving school, he studied economics at Manchester University and began teaching liberal studies at Stockport College of Technology in 1962. That same year, he met his future wife, Helen Naughton, while working for the Labour party in a north Manchester constituency. In 1965, Peter joined the extramural program at Sheffield University, and he and Helen married the following year. He played a key role in the Sheffield Vietnam campaign and led a large contingent to the famous anti-war protest outside the US embassy in London's Grosvenor Square in 1968. In 1969, he became principal lecturer and head of liberal studies at Teesside Polytechnic, where he served on the governing body and helped the institution achieve university status in 1992. Peter and Helen settled in Stockton-on-Tees in 1970 and lived there for over 40 years. He joined the Open University in that year, teaching social sciences and politics part-time for 45 years until his retirement in 2015. Even in retirement, Peter remained a dedicated advocate for justice and peace. A skilled athlete, he continued to excel at squash well into his 70s. He leaves behind Helen, his children Kate, Tessa, and Adam, as well as his granddaughter Anna.",

This move would enable us to bequeath our respective shares of the property to our daughters, while allowing us to remain in the property if either of us passes away. I believe this would grant a \"life interest\" to the surviving spouse. Currently, as joint tenants, our joint will leaves the property to the surviving spouse and, upon our deaths, to our children. Additionally, our will stipulates that each of our six grandchildren will receive £10,000 upon our joint passing, provided there are sufficient assets in our estate. If we become tenants in common, do we need to update our existing wills to reflect the new arrangement, specifically to provide for a life interest to the surviving spouse and to leave our respective shares of the estate to our daughters and grandchildren, as outlined in our current will?\n\nYes, if we decide to own our home as tenants in common by severing our joint tenancy, we will need to draft new wills. We will also need to create individual wills that \"mirror\" each other, with identical provisions, since our current joint will is not recognized under UK law. If we own the property as tenants in common, we can specify in our will who inherits our share of the property upon our death. However, simply leaving our share to our daughters does not automatically create a \"life interest\" in the property for our spouse. To ensure that our spouse can remain in the house until their death, our will must explicitly state this intention. Currently, as joint tenants, when one of us passes away, the surviving spouse will automatically inherit the property and have the right to live in it until their own death, without the need for a will to specify this. Upon the surviving spouse's death, our daughters will inherit the property, assuming they don't change their will to leave the property to someone else. If we're concerned about this, converting to tenants in common can protect at least our share of our children's inheritance, provided we update our will accordingly.",

I chose a faded blue French Connection suit, which was promised for pickup at my local Ilford branch by early March. However, a month later, I received a call stating that only my measurements were on the order form. Upon reviewing the paperwork, I discovered that the suit ordered was bright blue, and shirts I hadn't requested had been added.

When I lodged a formal complaint via the website, I was told that since the order had been corrected, my complaint was closed. After chasing the issue, the press office finally took action, arranging for the suits to be ready three weeks earlier than agreed and offering to courier replacements if needed.\n\nIn the end, I received a £50 gift card and a bottle of champagne as a token of goodwill for the inconvenience and stress caused.

However, after facing criticism, Pret's CEO announced that participants will be paid the company's hourly starting rate, plus receive free food.

As I settled into the driver's seat, I questioned whether it was designed for speed or serenity. The spacious cabin is marred by frustrating quirks, including a loose gear housing that frequently slips into second gear when I intend to shift into neutral. This inconsistency eroded my confidence. The car's unusual frame design features large plastic panels at the rear, creating a blind spot when parking on a curve. The cluttered dashboard, with its bold red accents, instilled a sense of unease. The interior lacks luxury, with a small, hard-to-read screen and storage compartments that don't align with my natural hand reach. However, the Tipo has its redeeming qualities. It doesn't feel like a small car, and its emissions are remarkably low. The exterior styling is a nostalgic ode to the 1980s, with curved lines that evoke a sense of retro charm. The boot space is ample for my needs, but I wouldn't dare attempt to transport anything larger than a shopping bag. The front seats offer generous leg room, while the rear seats are somewhat cramped. The Fiat Tipo's design is so retro that it's reminiscent of the 80s, when it was common for not all family members to be equally comfortable. The turbo diesel engine is a different story. In the city, it's sluggish to respond, then suddenly delivers a burst of power. On the motorway, the acceleration is smoother, especially in the higher gears.

The towns themselves are idyllic, with charming cottages, porches dripping with roses, and wisteria galore. I even spotted a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Joan Hickson, the iconic actress who played Miss Marple, picking up a korma at Meghdoot's Indian restaurant.\n\nPetworth is often overshadowed by its famous stately home, boasting works by Titian and Turner. Pulborough, however, has a more worldly feel, with its railway station and connections to Horsham, Bognor Regis, and London. It's the kind of place where I imagine Agatha Christie's characters would have lived, surrounded by the sounds of jazz and the whispers of romantic scandals.\n\nPetworth, despite its charms, is also a bit too perfect, with coach parties and tourists flocking to the area. The looming walls of the stately home can make one feel like a peasant, and the town's exclusivity can be off-putting. Pulborough, on the other hand, has a more laid-back atmosphere.\n\nFor families, there are several excellent schools to choose from, including St Mary's CofE and Fittleworth CofE, both rated \"good\" by Ofsted, and the \"outstanding\" Weald and Midhurst Rother College.\n\nThe Angel pub in Petworth is a great spot to relax and soak up the atmosphere, with its cozy inglenooks, medieval floorboards, and friendly locals who could easily be suspects in a mystery novel.\n\nThe area offers a range of properties, from wisteria-ed stone cottages to Georgian town houses, 18th-century farmhouses, mills, and estates with land, as well as gabled old houses with a rich history. Prices range from £250,000 to £2.5m.\n\nFor a unique property, consider a former railway station in Petworth, available for £1.4m through Chesworths.\n\nWhen you're not house hunting, enjoy the local amenities, such as the RSPB's Pulborough Brooks nature reserve, featuring a well-stocked shop and a cafe with scenic views.

In England and Wales, personal insolvencies surged to 24,531 between January and March, representing a 6.7% increase from the previous quarter and a 15.7% jump from the same period a year earlier. This marks the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014. The sharp rise in insolvencies coincides with a challenging period for UK households, as rising inflation and stagnant pay growth continue to squeeze incomes. The annual inflation rate has reached 2.3% and is expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the effects of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote begin to manifest in higher prices. Meanwhile, regular pay growth has slowed to 1.9% compared to a year earlier. Joanna Elson, CEO of the Money Advice Trust, expressed concern over the insolvency figures, stating that growing household debt and increased pressure on budgets from inflation are cause for worry. Individual voluntary arrangements accounted for 59% of personal insolvencies, debt relief orders made up 25%, and bankruptcies accounted for 16%. Adrian Hyde, president of R3, noted that while borrowing rates remain at record lows, rising inflation and slowing real wage growth will restrict people's financial flexibility. Despite a few years of stability, personal insolvency rates are still relatively low, and the recent uptick in bankruptcies has been modest. However, the steady increase in personal insolvencies may signal that the post-recession surge in consumer borrowing and spending is beginning to plateau. Official statistics only tell part of the story, as hundreds of thousands of individuals on debt management plans are not included in the numbers. The Insolvency Service reported a 4.5% rise in corporate insolvencies in the first quarter of the year compared to the previous quarter, and a 5.3% increase compared to the same period last year.",

Waymo's head, John Krafcik, stated that the goal is to give participants unrestricted access to the fleet, allowing them to use the vehicles daily, at any time, to travel anywhere within a designated area roughly twice the size of San Francisco. Arizona has been actively courting self-driving car researchers, offering a more favorable regulatory environment and launching social media campaigns to attract companies from Silicon Valley. The state's governor, Doug Ducey, has been aggressively pursuing companies like Uber, which was banned from testing in California after regulatory breaches. Waymo has been testing 100 self-driving minivans on public roads since earlier this year and plans to add another 500 vehicles to its fleet. Krafcik emphasized the importance of the trial, stating that the early riders will play a crucial role in shaping the development of self-driving technology. The trial is currently more like a subsidized taxi service than a fully open self-driving car release, with a test driver in each vehicle to monitor the rides at all times. Households that apply don't need driving licenses or the physical ability to take control of the car. Waymo originated as a Google subsidiary called X Labs, which was spun off and rebranded as Waymo in 2016.

Would you rather be regarded as creative geniuses, like Paul McCartney and Michelangelo, who share this trait? Research on handedness has uncovered fascinating facts. For instance, men are more likely to be left-handed. Studies suggest that left-handed college graduates earn more, and that low birth weight, mental illness, autism, cerebral palsy, heart disease, and certain types of cancer are associated with left-handedness. On the other hand, the notion that left-handed people die younger is a myth. Left-handed individuals have an advantage in sports, as their opponents receive less practice against them. Additionally, they might be worse drivers, according to a survey conducted by a car insurance company. While this survey may be flawed, it's still worth discussing. The survey found that 28% of left-handed drivers had received a speeding ticket, compared to 19% of right-handed drivers. For parking tickets, the figures were 26% for lefties and 23% for righties. Over a 60-year driving lifetime, left-handed drivers caused an average of nine accidents, compared to eight for right-handed drivers. Interestingly, left-handed drivers were slightly less likely to have damaged their own car (35% vs 38%) and slightly more likely to have passed their driving test on the first attempt (53% vs 49%). It's crucial to note that this phenomenon may not be related to the skill level of left-handed individuals. It's possible that cars and roads were simply designed with right-handed people in mind. Some people might agree with this notion. If you're sympathetic to the cause, you could chant 'Rights for lefties!' and avoid making snide comments like 'Next, they'll be demanding equal marriage rights…'",

The value of British Airways' parent company, IAG, has taken a significant hit, with £500 million wiped off its value. Crisis-response expert Paul Charles is perplexed by BA's slow response, stating that a clear statement should be released within an hour of an incident. BA's CEO took seven hours to release a video message on Twitter, a delay Charles deems unacceptable. Charles believes BA's strong brand can recover from this crisis, but notes that it's being eroded by the airline's poor response. He warns that a lack of crisis planning can lead to a decline in an airline's brand. United Airlines faced a similar crisis when it initially blamed a passenger who was dragged off an overbooked plane, but later apologized and improved its response. The airline's stock price recovered as a result. Malaysia Airlines was nationalized after the loss of two planes in 2014, highlighting the severity of the consequences of a crisis in the airline industry. According to Charles, airlines and airports have a unique ability to captivate the public and media, which can amplify even minor crises. Effective crisis management plans typically involve clear command structures and a list of key stakeholders that the CEO personally contacts. Charles has handled his fair share of crises, including a single complaint about the food on a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London. The complaint, which went viral in 2009, was made by an anonymous passenger who sent an email to Richard Branson with photos of his meal and a humorous review.

The plan also includes investment in Rolls-Royce's large engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility, as well as its sites in Hucknall and Annesley, Nottinghamshire. Unite has hailed the plan as a success, saying it \"effectively secures the manufacturing base of Rolls-Royce in the UK for the next 20 years, along with 7,000 high-quality jobs.\" Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, said: \"This is great news for our world-beating workforce making world-class engines and a testament to the hard work of our shop stewards and members. It's a good day for British manufacturing, but we must not let it be undone by a botched Brexit.\" Business Secretary Greg Clark emphasized that the investment underscores the UK's vital role in the global aerospace industry. He also noted that the UK and Rolls-Royce are renowned worldwide for their innovative engineering expertise.",

        "Text": "Researchers have captured the first-ever footage of cockatoos performing drum solos with sticks and seedpods, believed to be a form of musical display to attract mates. After seven years of tracking the elusive Cape York palm cockatoos in northern Queensland's unspoiled wilderness, scientists have finally recorded the extraordinary behavior on camera. The footage shows 18 male cockatoos delivering over 130 unique drum solos, each with its own distinct pattern and flair. Most performances took place in front of females, with males adding embellishments such as calls, blushing, and raised feathers to impress them. Researchers observed the birds preparing their drumming tools and then executing sequences of 27 to 92 beats, showcasing their impressive rhythmic skills. The birds' drumming styles varied greatly, ranging from rapid-fire strikes to more laid-back, repetitive beats. According to a study published in Science Advances, the cockatoos' drumming behavior shares key elements with human instrumental music, including the manufacture of sound tools, consistent performance contexts, and individual styles. The researchers liken the birds to solo artists or drummers in rock bands, who have an internal sense of rhythm and generate the motor pattern to create the beat. This behavior is remarkable, as tool manufacture is rare in the animal kingdom and is usually linked to foraging for food.",

Standing by a tree laden with pods, a favorite snack of parrots, he waited patiently for the birds to arrive. His persistence paid off when six parrots flew in, their striking red fronts and blue wing tips unlike any species he had previously encountered. The parrots' distinctive calls, unlike any on record, left Gómez Garza in awe. \"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" he exclaimed. \"The different noise belonged to a different parrot.\" Gómez Garza, an ornithologist and veterinarian, was thrilled to have discovered a new species of parrot. An international team of scientists published research on the newly discovered blue-winged Amazon parrot, or Amazona gomezgarzai, in honor of its discoverer. The parrot measures 25cm in height and boasts a loud, short, and repetitive call reminiscent of the soundtrack to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of its calls eerily imitates that of a hawk, a natural predator of parrots. Scientists speculate that this mimicry may serve as a deterrent, scaring other birds away and leaving more seeds, fruit, and flowers for the parrots to feast on. After obtaining permission from the Mexican authorities, Gómez Garza captured a male and female parrot for further study, collaborating with Tony Silva at the University of Florida and Pawel Mackiewicz at the University of Wroclaw. DNA tests revealed that this new species evolved from the white-fronted parrots (Amazona albifrons) native to the region approximately 120,000 years ago. Due to the parrots' rarity, the tests were performed without causing them harm. \"In recent history, I believe this is the first time a scientific description has been completed without the species being threatened with extinction,\" said Gómez Garza. He noted that conservation plans are already underway to protect the species. Mackiewicz estimated that there are likely fewer than 100 blue-winged Amazon parrots remaining, making conservation efforts a top priority. According to Gómez Garza, parrots worldwide are vulnerable to habitat destruction. While the international illegal trade of parrots has decreased in recent years, it still persists locally for certain species. Gómez Garza emphasized that raising awareness will be crucial in saving wild parrots globally.",

The bank's total mortgage lending decreased by £1 billion to £11.6 billion in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Net lending fell by £200 million over the half year. Net consumer finance lending plummeted to £97 million from £266 million. Santander UK Chief Executive Nathan Bostock attributed the decline to intense competition driving down interest rates to historically low levels. He claimed that competitors are offering more attractive rates on car loans and credit cards than mortgage customers. Bostock emphasized that the risks associated with car loans should be considered in a broader context. Non-performing loans comprised only 0.48% of the unsecured book of lending, and mortgage arrears remained extremely low. Bostock ruled out further rate cuts for the popular 123 account. The account, which has 3.6 million customers in the UK, was paying 3% interest on balances up to £20,000 before the rate was reduced to 1.5%. Despite slashing interest payouts on the 123 account, Santander's loyal retail customer base continued to grow, reaching 3.9 million customers. The average mortgage lent by Santander remained steady at £198,000. The typical buyer was found to be taking out a loan equivalent to 3.18 times their income. Santander's total profit for the first half of the year decreased by 1% to £1,063 million. £69 million was set aside to cover potential Payment Protection Insurance payouts.",

Citizens Advice research reveals that nearly one in five people struggling with debt have had their credit card limit increased without their request. The charity is urging the Financial Conduct Authority to ban the practice, which has raised concerns about a surge in lending. Unsecured lending has reached levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, prompting warnings from the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn. The CEO of Citizens Advice emphasized that irresponsible lending practices are exacerbating debt problems, such as offering more credit to people who already have thousands of pounds in unpaid debt. The report found that individuals with long-term outstanding balances are more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users experiencing an increase in their limit over the past year without requesting it. Credit card debtors are also more likely to fall into long-term debt and struggle to pay off their debt compared to those with personal loans. A pensioner was repeatedly contacted by firms offering more credit cards despite being unable to afford minimum repayments on her existing debts. Citizens Advice has assisted 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems in the past year. According to the Bank of England, total consumer debt grew by 10% in the year to June, reaching almost £201 billion. The Financial Conduct Authority is developing new regulations to safeguard consumers from debt spirals, with a focus on curbing the high costs of overdrafts and scrutinizing the booming car loan market. The regulator is planning to compel companies to reach out to customers struggling with persistent debt issues after 18 months, asking if they can accelerate their repayment plans. Those who continue to struggle would then be placed on a repayment plan. The watchdog estimates that 3.3 million people have become trapped in a persistent credit card debt cycle.",

If you took out a consumer loan, store card, credit card, or mortgage between the 1990s and 2000s, you might have been mis-sold PPI. Review your old loan and mortgage statements for any mention of insurance that covers your payments if you become unemployed due to illness, accident, or redundancy. If you've lost your statements, check your credit report, which lists all your loans, mortgages, and debts from the past six years. Many lenders will inform you if you contact them and ask if you had PPI. PPI was often mis-sold because the insurance was not clearly explained to you, or you were not aware you had it, or the adviser did not explain significant exclusions under the policy. If you had to pay for the PPI upfront, the adviser did not make it clear that the insurance cost would be added to the loan and that you'd be paying interest on it. If you answered no to any of these questions, you may have a valid claim. To make a claim, use a free template letter from Which? or Moneysavingexpert, print it out, fill it in, and send it off. If your complaint is upheld, the company that sold you the policy should attempt to put you back in the position you would have been in if you hadn't taken out PPI. You may also be entitled to statutory compensation, which is usually set at an interest rate of 8% of the refunded amount. If your claim is rejected, carefully review the assumptions made by the bank and revisit your lender if you believe these assumptions are incorrect or that you've been unfairly treated. If you still feel the offered amount is unfair, you can seek assistance from the free Financial Ombudsman Service to dispute your bank's decision.

According to Michio Inamura, Nissei's executive adviser, Pepper could fill the gap when a human priest is unavailable, allowing funeral organizers to customize its appearance and live-stream the ceremony for those who cannot attend in person. Buddhist priest Tetsugi Matsuo expressed interest in seeing if Pepper could convey the \"heart\" aspect of religion, which he believes is the foundation of faith. While Pepper has not yet been hired for a funeral, it seems likely that robots will eventually play a role in the funeral industry, given their increasing presence in various aspects of life.",

The company will cease publication of its European edition on Friday and its Asian edition on October 7th, marking the end of a 40-year history. The decision comes after News Corp reported a significant loss of $643 million for the fiscal year ending June 30th, a stark contrast to the $235 million profit reported the previous year. The paper's Asian edition was launched in 1976 and its European edition in 1983. While the US edition will still be available in select cities, the paper plans to focus on encouraging digital edition readers in Asia and Europe. The decision was made due to the growth of digital subscriptions, which have increased by 322,000 in the most recent quarter, reaching 1.27 million. This move is part of a larger restructuring effort, which includes a previous round of buyouts and layoffs in 2016. The paper has also seen a significant number of reporters and editors leave in the past year, reportedly due to frustration with the paper's coverage of US President Donald Trump.",

The deal includes an extension of Tesco's distribution contract with Palmer & Harvey, which accounts for 40% of the wholesaler's revenues. The wholesale sector has been disrupted by Tesco's acquisition of Booker, a cash and carry group, currently under investigation by the competition watchdog.

The annual growth rate of personal bank deposits has slowed to its lowest level since the financial crisis, with a mere 2.2% increase in August, the weakest month since May 2009. This decline is partly attributed to £1 billion being withdrawn from cash ISA accounts, as tax changes allow individuals to earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free. According to UK Finance, households are saving less each month, rather than borrowing more, as the growth in personal deposits has slowed alongside a slowdown in consumer credit borrowing. Annual growth in credit card borrowing slowed to 5% in August, down from 5.3% the previous month, while personal loan and overdraft usage fell by 1.6% on an annual basis. Overall, the annual growth in consumer credit slowed from 1.9% in July to 1.5% in August. Despite a decline in consumer confidence due to rising prices and Brexit uncertainty, retail sales growth suggests that shoppers have not yet cut back on spending. Retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August, following a revised 0.6% increase in July. The falling rate of bank deposits also indicates that consumers are drawing on their savings. According to the latest ONS figures, the amount of household money available for saving has fallen to an all-time low in the first three months of this year. The amount being set aside as savings has slipped to 1.7% of disposable income, a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. The purchasing power of British consumers is expected to face further strain due to inflation, with the Bank of England predicting that the consumer price index (CPI) will reach a peak above 3% in October. As of August, the CPI inflation rate stood at 2.9%, driven by the increasing cost of importing fuel, clothing, and food. The Bank of England has kept interest rates unchanged this month, but warned that it may raise rates for the first time in a decade as early as November to combat rising inflation. According to Mohammad Jamei, senior economist at UK Finance, \"Some households in the UK have chosen to save less, while others have not increased their borrowing.\"",

A report from key UK banks, law firms, and fund managers proposes a free trade deal allowing British and EU-based financial companies to trade products and services tariff-free, tax-free, and quota-free. The agreement would establish a joint dispute resolution body to resolve breaches. Without \"passporting\" rights, British pensioners and EU consumers may face difficulties in paying out personal pension or insurance contracts. To address these concerns, the International Regulatory Strategy Group has developed a plan for a free trade agreement. The report suggests setting up a free trade area would be straightforward, given the similarity of EU and UK regulatory regimes. The plan is ambitious but would benefit the entire continent. If London loses its status, activity would likely shift to New York or Singapore, resulting in losses for businesses and families. The proposed agreement mirrors the Canada-EU free trade area agreement, aiming to grant financial institutions reciprocal access to each other's markets. The report's starting point is that both the EU and the UK have expressed a desire to secure future arrangements for free trade in financial services. An enhanced free trade agreement is technically and legally feasible and would form a dedicated financial services chapter within a broader EU-UK agreement. The proposal includes a forum of regulators collaborating on a joint response to new global standards, as well as involvement in supervision and enforcement, with regular meetings. The report is the first comprehensive piece of work produced by any sector and could be applied to other highly regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals and aviation.",

Mr. Justice Norris made his ruling after hearing the application from the media organizations on the fourth day of the case. The case, brought by approximately 6,000 Lloyds investors, seeks £600 million in compensation, claiming that they were not informed about loans made to HBOS when they voted to approve the takeover in November 2008.

The proportion of non-association independent schools judged good or outstanding decreased from 79% in 2014 to 60% over the past three years. Ofsted attributes the decline to the introduction of new standards focusing on leadership and fundamental British values.

Goldman Sachs reported profits of $7.4 billion last year, stating that the tax legislation will result in a reduction of around $5 billion in its earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending December 31, 2017. Two-thirds of this reduction is due to the repatriation tax, while the remaining third is attributed to the implementation of the territorial tax system and the revaluation of US deferred tax assets at lower corporate tax rates. The tax overhaul will lead to a decrease in its earnings, primarily due to the repatriation tax and the implementation of the territorial tax system.\n\nThe recent tax overhaul includes significant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals. The reduction in corporate tax rates, from 35% to 21%, is intended to encourage multinational corporations to repatriate their cash from overseas. US companies are estimated to hold around $2.5 trillion in capital overseas. Companies had previously maintained that they had a responsibility to their shareholders to keep this money abroad rather than bringing it back to the US and paying large tax bills.\n\nThe tax overhaul will allow Apple to repatriate its $252.3 billion foreign cash reserves without incurring a significant tax burden. Apple's large amount of untaxed profits held overseas has become a major political issue and a challenge for the company. Amgen, a drugmaker, expects to pay between $6 billion and $6.5 billion to repatriate its cash to the US. Goldman Sachs has also reported that the rest of the $5 billion reduction in its profits will come from the cost of implementing the territorial tax system and changes that will make it more difficult for companies to deduct past losses from future tax bills. Barclays estimates that the change to \"deferred tax assets\" will cost it around £1 billion. The tax changes were implemented under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who praised the bill as \"great for hardworking workers\". Prior to his government role, Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, until 2002.",

The Met Office predicts that global temperatures will surpass 1C above pre-industrial levels between 2018 and 2022, potentially breaching the 1.5C threshold set by the Paris climate agreement. Stephen Belcher, chief scientist at the Met Office, notes that continued warming from greenhouse gases and natural variability could cause a temporary spike above 1.5C in the next five years. Global temperatures have steadily risen over the past 20 years, with each of the last three years exceeding the 1C threshold. Last year was the second hottest on record, with no significant boost from the El Niño effect. The 1.5C threshold was set as an ambitious target at the Paris climate conference due to concerns about extreme and unpredictable climate events, including droughts, habitat loss, food insecurity, and mass migration. Previously, some predictions suggested the threshold would not be breached until the 2040s. However, Met Office scientists emphasize that a single year of temperatures above 1.5C does not necessarily indicate a sustained period of warmer temperatures. The majority of scientists agree that human activities are contributing to global warming and climate change.",

Edgar, who had previously worked as a shipwright during the war, felt a strong calling to primary school teaching and was drawn to the college's 50-week intensive course for mature students. Born in Portsmouth to a family of skilled dockyard workers, Edgar attended the Northern grammar school until the war disrupted his education. During his first teaching practice, he encountered children who had never seen the sea and others with no shoes, which deeply impacted him. He went on to teach at Horndean primary school for many years, often working late to prepare individual learning cards and extending lessons into the village. Edgar was an integral part of village life and actively participated in the local community association. In his free time, he studied for a diploma in education. However, his opposition to the 11-plus and union membership slowed his career development. He was eventually appointed deputy head at Wildground junior school in 1970 and retired in 1984.

A CVA involves creditors agreeing to forgo some of what they are owed by a business rather than risk it going out of business altogether. When a restaurant chain is facing financial difficulties, a common solution is for landlords to accept reduced rent payments. A Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) requires the agreement of creditors who collectively hold a claim of more than 75% of the company's outstanding debt, with the remaining 25% being bound by the same terms if the CVA is approved.",

Chancellor Philip Hammond is set to unveil the results of a consultation on updating the tax system to reflect digital businesses' nature in the spring statement. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride emphasized the need for digital companies to pay fair taxes, suggesting a system where tax is levied based on where companies earn their revenue. Stride noted that digital companies generate significant value in the UK, but the current tax regime is not taxing these activities fairly. He expressed the government's desire to move towards a fairer system. The government's first preference is to reform the international tax system through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, but if progress cannot be made at the global level, the UK will implement unilateral changes. Large digital companies have faced criticism for paying very little tax in the UK, often through complex avoidance schemes. Facebook paid just £5.1m in corporation tax in the UK last year, despite revenues nearly quadrupling to £842.4m. The OECD's efforts to reform its tax policies have been hindered by a disagreement between countries. Some nations, such as the United States, want to impose higher taxes on internet companies, while others, like Luxembourg and Ireland, prioritize attracting foreign investment.

The report reveals that emissions from the National Electricity Market decreased in January, reaching their lowest levels since 2004, largely due to the federal large-scale renewable energy target.\n\nEnergy expert Hugh Saddler analyzed the consumption and output of electricity from the Hornsdale Power Reserve, which includes the Tesla battery, and found that it follows a consistent pattern, charging overnight when wind generation is abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices are at their peak.\n\nWhile only 30% of the battery's 100MW capacity is devoted to trading, the rest is used to stabilize the energy system by maintaining the grid frequency at 50 Hz and 240 volts. The battery's contribution to demand smoothing may be relatively small, but it still provides a valuable service, demonstrating the important role energy storage can play in the system.\n\nThe battery effectively time-shifts wind generation, exploiting the difference in wholesale energy prices throughout the day, providing critical power at the critical moment. The world's biggest battery, in SA, is working in harmony with wind farms to provide a reliable and efficient source of energy.\n\nPeak wind production is the cheapest way to charge the battery, which stands ready to fill demand gaps if they emerge. The battery charges up overnight, when prices are low, and then hits the grid at the right time to keep price spikes lower than they would be otherwise.\n\nThe Australia Institute's report also found that emissions from the NEM decreased to 152.8 Mt of CO2-equivalent in January, the lowest level since 2004. Despite relatively flat demand, the decrease in coal-fired power generation was driven by the increased output of large-scale renewable energy projects and the decline of Australia's aging coal-fired power station fleet. Energy expert Hugh Saddler emphasized that with the renewable energy target nearing completion, Australia urgently needs a post-2021 energy policy to reduce its reliance on coal in the National Electricity Market.",

The Office for National Statistics revised its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, missing economists' forecasts. The revised figure was attributed to lower-than-expected production and decreased consumer spending, influenced by price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker performance in the final quarter of the year led to a downward revision in the UK's overall growth rate for 2017, revised down from 1.8% to 1.7%, the weakest rate in five years. As the global economy continues to recover, the UK is falling behind other major economies, including Germany, France, and the US. According to Darren Morgan, a small number of revisions to various industries contributed to the downward revision in quarterly growth. Services continued to drive growth at the end of 2017, but consumer-facing industries slowed due to price rises, which squeezed household budgets. The UK economy's reliance on consumer spending for growth has decreased, as households have become more reluctant to spend due to falling real pay and inflation outpacing wage growth. Household spending grew by just 0.3% in the fourth quarter and by 1.8% in 2017 overall, the slowest rate of annual growth since 2012. Businesses also appeared hesitant to invest, with business investment remaining flat in the final quarter of 2017. The downward revision in growth came a day after the ONS released figures showing a surprise increase in unemployment in the three months to December. The disappointing economic data presents a potential challenge for the Bank of England, which had previously hinted that it may raise interest rates as soon as May.

This announcement is a setback for Lloyds Banking Group, which acquired HBOS in 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employees, were sentenced to prison in 2017 for perpetrating the fraud, which centered on the Reading branch. A judge described the scheme as \"utterly corrupt\" and devastating for small business owners. The scam occurred between 2003 and 2008 and involved Lynden Scourfield, a former HBOS employee, and David Mills, a financial consultancy owner. Scourfield was bribed to load loans onto struggling companies and refer them to Mills's business. The NCA will conduct a six-month review into allegations of fraud related to the HBOS branch in Reading, at the request of Thames Valley Police. The review will examine allegations that fell outside the scope of the original investigation. Several companies have reported significant fraud allegations, including claims of asset stripping and fraud. The sums involved could be substantial, running into tens of millions of pounds. Lloyds initially denied wrongdoing, but following the conviction of two former employees, the police claimed HBOS must have known about the fraudulent activities in its Reading branch as early as February 2008. Lloyds has welcomed the investigation and pledged to fully cooperate with the NCA.",

The festival celebrates unusual cars, featuring mint-condition Austin Allegros and cherished Datsun Sunnys, and Ian's Invacar is sure to be a crowd-pleaser. Despite being effectively banned from the road in 2003, Ian secured insurance, tax, and testing for his vehicle, which has revealed an oil leak and carburettor fault. Ian has only driven 17 miles so far, leaving 153 miles to go. The AC Invacar Model 70 was designed as a standard invalid carriage, with an Austrian-built Fiat 500 engine. Between 1972 and 1977, around 18,000 Invacars were built, with AC and Invacar Ltd producing half each. The scheme was ended in 1977 due to safety concerns, and individuals who owned Invacars were allowed to keep them until the program ended in 2003. Within a week, the remaining Invacars were collected from their owners. Ian's experience with his Invacar has been terrifying and exhilarating, but also plagued by numerous issues. He will need a minor miracle to make it to the festival without major setbacks.

The sudden drop in demand for plants and garden furniture further exacerbated the company's situation. This poor trading led to a 15.4% decline in like-for-like sales for the first three months of 2018, outpacing the 15.1% decline in the previous quarter. Wesfarmers, Homebase's parent company, had planned to convert the chain into a Bunnings store, but only 23 of the 250 stores have been converted, leaving uncertainty over the future of the costly refurbishments. The company's managing director, Rob Scott, had previously considered withdrawing from the UK market, citing the disastrous takeover of Homebase. Wesfarmers wrote off A$1bn earlier this year due to the failed takeover and is now reportedly considering offering over £100m to find a buyer or pursuing a company voluntary arrangement to dump loss-making stores. The decline in sales has been partly attributed to the actions of the original Australian management team, who axed senior managers and key departments, including home furnishings, which had appealed to British shoppers. Damian McGloughlin, a former B&Q executive, has been brought in to run the chain. The Bunnings group managing director, Michael Schneider, stated that progress on several Homebase projects is \"satisfactory,\" focusing on improving store standards, ranges, and promotions.",

A US study discovered that even a slight temperature increase can lead to a decline in exam scores, with a 0.5°C rise in average temperature corresponding to a 1% drop in average exam scores. In the UK, the situation is more complicated, as air conditioning, which could mitigate the negative effects, is rarely found in British schools. June is the month when average high temperatures tend to exceed 21°C, when the negative effects on exam performance become apparent. This raises the question of why we schedule important exams during this time, when distractions like sports tournaments and heatwaves are common. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow students to take their exams online when it's most convenient for their learning and comfort? Changing the academic year is a complex issue, with schools, large firms, universities, and even the law courts following a similar September-to-July schedule. The UK government may find it challenging to argue for changing the system when they themselves benefit from it. The UK's exam marking system relies on students taking tests at the same time, but it has a significant benefit: scores required for a given grade change each year based on average scores.

The sale could involve around 10% of the bank, yet would still result in a significant loss for taxpayers. The Treasury's long-term objective is to sell its 70.5% stake and return RBS to the private sector, but the current share price may delay this decision. RBS's value has decreased by approximately 12% since the government last sold off shares in 2015, and the government is prepared to write off a substantial portion of the £45.5 billion it spent on the bailout. UK Government Investments declined to comment on the potential sale. According to a Sky News report, bankers and investors are expecting an announcement as early as this week, with one fund manager stating that the City is \"abuzz with speculation\" about an imminent sale. The government's decision to resume its share disposal plan was facilitated by a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. Chancellor Philip Hammond has stated that the agreement will allow the government to proceed with the sale, which has already led to a sharp increase in RBS's shares.

RBS is set to hold its annual general meeting in Edinburgh on Wednesday, which will be buoyed by the bank's first annual profit since the crisis and its promise to resume paying dividends.

Burnt Yates school in north Yorkshire, a small rural primary school with excellent facilities and a dedicated trust, will shut its doors at the end of the academic year. Despite its rich history dating back to 1760, the school was unable to find a suitable partner or merge with other schools, and its decline can be attributed to poor decisions by the local authority. The community rallied around the school, but ultimately, the lack of funding led to its closure. I blame Michael Gove's academies plan, which has undermined local accountability and led to the loss of schools like Burnt Yates, which would still thrive if not for his policies.\n\nThe department publishes data on sponsored academy primary schools, which have been forced out of local control, and these schools consistently underperform compared to average schools. This is not surprising, given the higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Despite having more time to improve, the results of these schools do not show significant improvement. As a former primary school governor, I can attest to the devastating consequences of the academies program, which included the dismissal of governors, the headteacher's departure, and the takeover by a neighboring institution.

Scientists discovered tiny fossilized skin flakes on a microraptor, a crow-sized, meat-eating dinosaur with wings on all four limbs. Similar flakes were also found on two other feathered dinosaurs, beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, as well as a primitive bird called confuciusornis. The fossilized skin flakes are the only evidence of how dinosaurs shed their skin. Unlike modern reptiles, which typically shed their skin in large sheets, the feathered dinosaurs shed their skin in tiny flakes. According to Maria McNamara, a paleontologist, \"This is the only fossil dandruff known. Until now, we had no evidence for how dinosaurs shed their skin.\" Images taken with an electron microscope reveal that the fossilized dandruff is extremely well-preserved and almost identical to that found on modern birds. The skin flakes are made up of tough cells called corneocytes rich in the protein keratin. The study suggests that dinosaurs with feathers evolved skin to cope with their plumage as far back as the Middle Jurassic period. \"Even in the early stages of feather evolution, they had already adapted their skin to this more modern structure,\" McNamara said. The fossilized remains of the animals were discovered in rock formations in northeastern China. Beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, which grew to over 2 meters in length, were significantly larger than the 1-meter-long microraptor. Unlike modern birds, the dinosaur dandruff cells lacked fat, suggesting that the animals did not generate as much heat, possibly because they were not capable of flying long distances or at all. Many dinosaurs with feathers were not skilled fliers. \"Rather, their feathers had multiple functions, including keeping them warm, blending in with their surroundings for camouflage, and potentially showcasing their vibrant colors to attract mates with dazzling displays.\"",

The vehicle's emergency braking system was intentionally disabled, according to the investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report revealed that the vehicle's guidance system detected the pedestrian six seconds before impact. However, the emergency braking system did not activate due to concerns about erratic vehicle behavior. The system relied on the human backup driver to intervene, but it did not alert the driver to the impending danger. The vehicle was traveling at 43 miles per hour when it struck the pedestrian, who was pushing a bicycle across a boulevard. The report showed that the sensors detected the need to brake 1.3 seconds before impact, but the brakes were not applied until after the fatal collision. The backup driver claimed she was monitoring the self-driving interface at the time of the accident. In response to the incident, Uber suspended testing in Arizona and focused on more limited testing in Pittsburgh and California. The company is conducting an internal review of its self-driving vehicle program and has brought in a former NTSB chairman to advise on its safety culture.

The trend of increasing longevity has come to a standstill, according to a recent analysis by the Office for National Statistics. The underlying causes of this sudden stagnation are unclear, but potential factors include austerity measures, reduced NHS spending, flu outbreaks, rising obesity and diabetes rates, and increasing multimorbidity.

The slowdown began in the second quarter of 2009 for men and soon after for women. Between 2011 and 2013, and again between 2014 and 2016, only a small number of local authorities in England showed statistically significant increases in life expectancy. This is a stark contrast to the equivalent period 10 years earlier, when many more local authorities reported significant increases in life expectancy. Other disquieting data from the weekly register of deaths in England and Wales this year adds to the worrying trend.

A 2016 Oxford University study found that most content about African countries on Wikipedia was written by editors from Europe and North America, with only 16% of content about sub-Saharan Africa being written by local contributors. The language of a Wikipedia entry influences the sources used, leading to different versions of the truth. For instance, an English-language article about Russia's annexation of Crimea cited 24% of sources as Ukrainian and 20% as Russian, whereas the German version cited only 10% of sources as Russian and 3% as Ukrainian. A 2011 study analyzed nearly 30,000 Wikipedia entries about US politics and found a slight bias towards the Democrats. The study discovered that entries were more likely to use Democratic phrases than Republican phrases. Although later entries were less biased, the study concluded that the average old political article on Wikipedia leans Democratic. A 2011 paper reviewed thousands of Wikipedia articles and found that, although most articles were accurate, recent events received the most coverage. The author analyzed US gubernatorial elections since 1978 and found that coverage before 2001 was scarce, reflecting the limited expertise and interests of contributors.",

The original story, published on December 15, incorrectly stated Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed was caught with a bomb and awarded £33,000 due to excessive detention. However, the judge's decision to award al-Waheed compensation was based on his unlawful imprisonment and mistreatment during the Iraq war. The newspaper ran the story despite the judge concluding the bomb claims were \"pure fiction\" and discredited shortly after detention. Ipso ordered the correction after finding the Daily Mail breached accuracy rules in its reporting. Ipso stated the newspaper's failure to clarify the bomb claims' disproof seriously misrepresented the judgment's basis. The judge found no evidence supported the claim al-Waheed was an insurgent, and he was detained without legal basis for 33 days in 2007. The compensation award was broken down into £3,300 for unlawful detention, £15,000 for beating after arrest, and £15,000 for ill treatment. The Daily Mail defended its reporting by citing a three-page summary of the 239-page judgment and previous reporting. Ipso rejected this explanation, arguing it was unreasonable to rely on previous press coverage without verifying accuracy. Following the decision, a major internal investigation was conducted, and seven senior staff members received strongly worded disciplinary notes. These notes made it clear that similar errors in the future would jeopardize employees' careers.",

The deal is transformational and will significantly enhance the company's US shale presence, according to CEO Bob Dudley. The acquisition will increase BP's US oil and gas production by nearly 20% and marks a new era of growth for the company. The deal covers 470,000 acres of assets, including fields in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford, and Haynesville. Analysts have praised the deal, with Eagle Ford being considered the most valuable due to its scale and economics. BHP purchased the fields in 2011 but struggled to make them profitable, leading to their sale last August. BP believes its approach will differ from BHP's, bringing $350 million in synergies from its other US operations. The acquisition gives the company access to some of the best acreage in the best basins, including the Permian Basin. Following the deal's completion, BP's US production is expected to increase to 885,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The acquisition will be entirely financed through cash and is being partially funded by the company's decision to divest its interests in the Greater Kuparuk Area. BP's deal significantly surpasses its recent investments in Europe's largest solar company and the UK's largest electric car charging network. BHP will return the proceeds from the sale to its investors, and its shares closed the day up 2.3%. In contrast, BP's share price declined by 1.5%.

The company's value has nearly matched that of Royal Mail and surpassed the combined stock market value of WH Smith, Debenhams, the AA, and Saga. Fever-Tree's rapid growth can be attributed to the soaring popularity of premium gin, which has doubled UK sales to £1.2 billion in the past six years. Gin is the most beloved spirit in the UK, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favorite. Riding the wave of gin's popularity has transformed Fever-Tree into one of the UK's fastest-growing major companies, making co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow multi-millionaires. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005 and since the company's stock market float in 2014, Rolls has sold shares worth over £150 million, while Warrilow has sold shares worth £41 million.

The trial will take place within the company's depots, where the bus will operate autonomously until necessary laws permit passenger transportation. The bus is being adapted with technology similar to that used in a recent trial of driverless pods in Greenwich, south-east London. According to Stagecoach, the bus will be able to park, refuel, and navigate to wash points without human intervention. The company believes that wider adoption of self-driving buses could lead to safer and more efficient operations, as well as increased space within its depots.\n\nEven when the bus is on public roads, the sensor system could provide earlier warnings to other road users, such as cyclists or pedestrians, who may be in blind spots or approaching unexpectedly. Stagecoach's UK bus engineering director, Sam Greer, described the project as exciting and potentially transformative, stating that it could improve safety and efficiency within depots and, in the long term, revolutionize bus travel.\n\nThis move by a traditional bus operator using a full-size vehicle could mark a significant step towards the wider adoption of autonomous vehicles in the UK. In contrast, passenger services using small driverless vehicles have been trialed in France, while China has tested larger driverless buses on major city roads in Shenzhen. The trials in Greenwich suggested that passengers may be more receptive to larger autonomous vehicles for public transportation than smaller pods. While driverless trains have been in operation for some time, researchers found that users had concerns about sharing vehicles with strangers, with 85% of participants expressing comfort with autonomous technology but only 46% willing to ride-share. Many respondents indicated that they were not willing to pay a substantial amount above the standard bus fare to use autonomous driverless pods.",

The company's name was inspired by their success at the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire. Aston Martin made its international racing debut in the 1922 French Grand Prix, but faced financial difficulties and was rescued in 1926. The company developed a reputation for engineering and design, competing in the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars increased in the 1930s, with a record 140 cars built in 1937. In 1947, English industrialist David Brown acquired the company, expanding operations and relocating production. The company relocated its production base again in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. The iconic Aston Martin DB5 was introduced in 1963, and its famous partnership with James Bond began a year later in the film Goldfinger. Bond has since driven an Aston Martin in several films. The company changed hands several times in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1987, Ford Motor Company acquired a 75% stake. The DB moniker was revived with the introduction of the DB7 in 1993. Aston Martin opened its first purpose-built factory in Gaydon, Warwickshire, in 2003. The company returned to racing in 2005 with the DBR9. In 2007, Aston Martin was sold to a consortium of two Kuwaiti investment houses for nearly £1 billion. Today, Aston Martin is one of the world's leading sports car manufacturers.

According to Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, students tend to relax after accepting unconditional offers. Buchanan believes that students will carry their academic achievements throughout their careers and should be motivated to work hard. He is calling on universities to only offer unconditional places to students who have been interviewed or whose schools have provided additional information. Historically, only a small number of students received unconditional offers, but the government's removal of the cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities to expand and compete aggressively for students and tuition fees. While there is limited evidence on the impact of unconditional offers on students' final grades, private school heads have long been concerned about the potential impact on their school's results and league table rankings. Some employers place significant weight on A-level grades when recruiting for graduate trainee programs, which means that students who underperform may struggle in the job market. The HMC's call follows that of Education Minister Sam Gyimah, who in July criticized the rise in unconditional offers as \"completely irresponsible to students\" and urged universities to limit their use. Typically, universities make conditional offers, specifying the A-level grades required to secure a place. However, in a more competitive market, unconditional offers have become more common, even among research-intensive institutions in the Russell Group. According to Ucas, 7% of the 950,000 offers made this year were unconditional, with roughly one-fifth of the 250,000 applicants to English universities receiving at least one such offer. Ucas noted that unconditional offers were more prevalent for older students who already held qualifications, as well as for those applying to creative arts courses who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties. University vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers, citing their benefits in allowing for earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation.",

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation warns that the public sector may experience a shortage of skilled workers for up to seven years. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of EU citizens arriving in the UK for work has reached a six-year low. Matthew Fell notes that the statistics demonstrate a decline in EU migration, exacerbating existing skills shortages. In 2018, 92% of businesses cited Brexit as a major obstacle to recruiting and training staff. The proposed ban on overseas workers earning less than £30,000 is expected to worsen the situation. Research by the REC reveals a decline in candidate availability, with 75% of employers struggling to expand their teams. The REC's report predicts a seven-year shortage of skilled workers, even before any post-Brexit migration crackdown. The report finds that 10,000 EU staff have left the NHS since the EU referendum, and 77% of recruitment specialists expect health and care role shortages within five years. Half of school recruiters expect teacher shortages within the same period. Net migration from the EU to the UK was 74,000 in 2018, the lowest level since 2012.",

Instead, the alliance will be led by the CEOs of the three companies, according to Osamu Masuko, CEO of Mitsubishi Motors. Speaking in Tokyo, Masuko stated that the alliance's capital structure was not discussed during a recent meeting in Amsterdam, but changes to the governance structure are seen as a possibility. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three companies, has been in detention for 10 days and may be charged with a crime after his detention is extended for another 10 days. The arrest has raised questions about the future of the alliance, which has been led by Ghosn since its inception. While Nissan and Mitsubishi quickly removed Ghosn as chair of their respective boards, Renault chose not to do so and has allowed him to remain as chairman and CEO. The alliance's leadership, excluding Ghosn, met in Amsterdam for an operational review, which was scheduled before the arrest. The meeting focused on operational issues, including research and development, basic components, and technology sharing. A separate meeting of the Renault-Nissan BV board would be required to remove Ghosn from his position. In a joint statement, the three companies reaffirmed their commitment to the alliance, stating that they have \"all – individually and collectively – emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance.\" The statement added that the alliance has achieved significant success over the past two decades and remains committed to its goals. Car industry analysts have questioned whether Renault can maintain its dominant position in the alliance. Renault has a significant stake of 43.4% in Nissan, which in turn owns 15% of Renault and 34% of Mitsubishi. The alliance's combined output in 2017 reached 10.6 million cars. In recent years, Nissan has been the primary contributor to the alliance's profits, leading some analysts to speculate that any restructuring could result in a more prominent role for the company. Furthermore, any changes could also lead to a greater involvement for Mitsubishi, which currently has no formal representation on the board of Renault-Nissan BV.",

The penalties arise from failures in systems designed to prevent money laundering and protect problem gamblers. Casumo must pay a penalty package of £5.85 million, while Videoslots will pay £1 million instead of a financial penalty. Daub Alderney was previously fined £7.1 million. CZ Holdings surrendered its license to operate in the UK after the regulator launched an investigation. Six other firms are still under investigation. Additionally, three individuals had their licenses to serve as directors of gambling companies revoked, four were issued warnings, and three are under investigation. The total payout surpasses the largest fine previously handed out by the Gambling Commission, which was £7.8 million to online casino firm 888. Secretary of State Jeremy Wright warned that online operators neglecting their duty to protect players will face consequences. He emphasized that protecting vulnerable consumers is the top priority and that gambling operators must adhere to robust requirements to safeguard players and prevent money laundering. The Gambling Commission has become more stringent in its enforcement over the past two years, issuing millions of pounds in fines to companies like William Hill, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, and SkyBet for failures related to money laundering and problem gambling. CEO Neil McArthur urged online casino operators to \"pay attention\" and take responsibility for properly applying their policies and procedures. He emphasized that operators must have a deep understanding of their customers and ask the necessary questions to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and social responsibility regulations. Anyone in a position of authority should be aware that the commission will take regulatory action against businesses that fail to comply and hold individuals accountable if they are responsible for an operator's shortcomings.",

These businesses refuse to accept paper currency, instead requiring customers to pay with debit or credit cards. Some business owners claim cashless transactions are quicker and easier, but City Councilman Ritchie Torres believes this practice disproportionately affects low-income individuals and people of color who may not have access to bank accounts or credit cards. Torres argues that a cashless business model has an exclusionary effect on the impoverished, the homeless, and the underbanked. According to Torres, nearly 12% of New Yorkers lack bank accounts, and many struggle to maintain an account due to minimum balance requirements, fees, or lack of proper ID. Unauthorized immigrants, in particular, may face significant barriers to opening a bank account. Torres believes the proposed ban is necessary to prevent a \"gentrification of the marketplace\" and ensure equal access to goods and services for all individuals. He views this as a new frontier of anti-discrimination law, addressing the unequal impact of cashless transactions on marginalized communities. However, Andrew Rigie, head of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, suggests finding a balance between the benefits of cashless transactions and ensuring all customers have access to goods and services. While cashless restaurants may offer operational and worker safety benefits, they should not discriminate against individuals without credit cards.",

Trump's comments make it highly improbable that he will heed Beijing's call to refrain from raising tariffs starting next year. The move would elevate the existing 10% US import tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from January 1. Economists caution that a US-China trade war escalation could severely impact the global economy over the next decade, potentially resulting in a 2% loss of GDP growth by 2030. The ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond their borders, with no clear winners in a globalized economy. Trump's comments also suggested that Apple products could be subject to tariffs, sparking a sell-off in Apple shares. Recent developments, including the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, have helped to ease tensions between the White House and other countries.

Meanwhile, he has dampened expectations of a trade agreement between the UK and the US if Theresa May secures parliamentary backing for her Brexit deal.

In November 2016, attackers exploited stolen credentials to access Uber's cloud servers and download 16 large files containing sensitive information. The compromised data included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and location information, as well as drivers' weekly pay, trip summaries, and in some cases, driver's license numbers. The breach was attributed to inadequate information security measures and was exacerbated by Uber US's decision not to disclose the attack. The Information Commissioner's Office deemed this a malicious attack, rather than a typical bug bounty scenario, as the hackers exploited the vulnerability to steal personal data. As a result, none of the affected individuals were notified of the breach, and the company only began monitoring accounts for fraud 12 months later. The potential fine was reduced due to the fact that Uber's European branches were not informed of the breach, and there was no evidence that the compromised data was misused. Uber US was ordered to pay $148 million for failing to notify drivers about the breach. To strengthen our systems, we have implemented numerous technical enhancements and made significant changes to our leadership structure to ensure transparency with regulatory bodies and customers. We have appointed a chief privacy officer, data protection officer, and chief trust and security officer. We view our mistakes as opportunities to learn and are committed to earning the trust of our users every day. The timing of the breach meant that we were subject to the Data Protection Act 1998, which capped the financial penalty at £500,000.

Unfortunately, the three closest options are a significant drive away, which seems unfair given the company's change of ownership wasn't my fault.\n\nIt was unfortunate timing, as the sale of this centre to Dobbies was only completed two and a half weeks prior. What's more, I wasn't aware that customers can redeem their gift cards online in addition to in-store, a fact that's not widely publicized.

The InSight probe is scheduled to touch down gently on Elysium Planitia, where it will analyze seismic activity on the red planet. Despite numerous Mars probes, more than half have failed due to the final stages of landing proving notoriously challenging. The Martian atmosphere's thinness, equivalent to just 1% of Earth's, poses a significant hurdle, as there is little friction to slow down a spacecraft. This has contributed to past failures, leaving NASA engineers on edge as they guide their $800 million InSight craft on a 300 million-mile journey to a 15-mile-by-6-mile target zone. If InSight navigates this precise keyhole, it should land squarely in the middle of Elysium Planitia. However, it will still require a heat-resistant capsule, parachute, and rockets to slow down from 12,000mph to 5mph and ensure a soft and safe landing after a seven-minute descent. The most recent attempt to land on Mars was made two years ago by a European probe, which unfortunately crashed on the planet's surface. Despite this, NASA remains optimistic about the mission's success. The InSight mission aims to help scientists understand the early evolution of Mars and other planets in the solar system, including Earth, by using instruments to probe deep beneath the planet's surface and measure temperatures and seismic activity.",

In a recent study, scientists removed heart parts from both river and cave-dwelling Astyanax mexicanus fish, discovering that while river fish successfully regenerated tissue, cave fish developed only scars. The salamander's remarkable capacity for regrowing a lost tail involves a complex process of cell migration and gradual regeneration over several weeks. The regenerated tail is fully functional and identical to the original, with the spinal cord and nerves fully restored. The axolotl, a salamander relative, boasts even more impressive regenerative abilities, capable of regrowing its tail, limbs, skin, and almost any other body part. Each time a limb is removed, it regrows almost perfectly, making the axolotl a valuable subject for studying human limb regeneration. Starfish can regrow arms that detach from their central disc, and some species have even been observed to regrow an entire body from a lost arm. To accomplish this, starfish store nutrients in the detached arm until they can regrow their mouth. The sea cucumber has a remarkable ability to rapidly mend its organs, regrowing damaged parts and healing deep wounds in as little as a week.

The hedge fund reported a 52% decline in profit to £8.8m, mainly due to Odey's bets against the pound and UK retailers not yielding immediate results. Odey Asset Management has taken a £149m short position against UK shops, banks, estate agents, and property companies.

Official statistics showed that the economy rebounded from a cold winter earlier in the year, as consumers splurged during the World Cup and a prolonged heatwave. However, more detailed data revealed that consumers, burdened by rising utility bills and transportation costs, had to rely on their savings to maintain their spending habits, as their disposable income remained stagnant. According to Rob Kent-Smith, statistician at the ONS, households have spent more than they earned for an unprecedented eighth consecutive quarter, raising concerns about their ability to sustain their spending and drive the economy. Recent surveys have fueled concerns that consumer spending is losing momentum, with several high street retailers reporting dismal sales in November. Asos's surprise profit warning has added to these concerns, as analysts had grown accustomed to web-based operators weathering the spending downturn. Business investment has declined for the third consecutive quarter, a trend not seen since the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. This cumulative effect is expected to reduce GDP growth in the final quarter of 2018 to nearly zero. The Bank of England attributed the decline in business investment to Brexit uncertainty, although the risk of border disruptions has led to increased spending on warehousing and port capacity. Companies are stockpiling goods at their highest level since 2016, suggesting they are under pressure to build large inventories in preparation for a potential no-deal Brexit.

These messages have come from others with epilepsy who feel less alone, from parents who want to show their children that they're not the only ones dealing with health issues, and from people who are looking for coping mechanisms and advice. By sharing my experiences, I hope to create a sense of community and connection with others, and to show that we're all in this together.

This mortgage option is not suitable for individuals without a willing family member. The deal offers a £500,000 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 2.99% for three years, with the family member's cash earning 1.5% above the base rate. After three years, the family member can withdraw their cash, and the borrower can switch to Lloyds' standard variable rate or seek a new mortgage. Over a 30-year term, if house prices remain stagnant, the borrower will have paid off 6.5% of their loan, leaving them with a 93.5% mortgage. However, if house prices decline, borrowers may face difficulties, potentially ending up in negative equity with a mortgage debt exceeding their home's value. In the worst-case scenario, this could leave borrowers locked into a mortgage with Lloyds, facing financial penalties if they try to move. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit's impact on the housing market may deter people from considering a 100% mortgage.",

This figure rises to a striking 40% for mothers of two children. Researchers from Manchester and Essex universities analyzed biological data from 6,025 UK participants to examine the impact of working hours and family conditions on stress levels. The study, published in Sociology, found that working from home or having flexible hours had no significant effect on women's chronic stress levels, but reducing working hours had a positive impact. Work-family conflict is a significant contributor to increased psychological strain, stress, and decreased wellbeing, particularly for parents of young children. The study's findings are based on 11 biomarkers that measure the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems. Chronic stress, resulting from repeated stressful events and combinations of social and environmental stressors, can have a significant impact on overall health. Women working full-time with two children had biomarkers indicating chronic stress, including hormone levels and blood pressure, that were 40% higher compared to those with no children. Women working full-time with one child had 18% higher levels of stress than those with no children. Flexible work practices aim to help employees achieve a better work-life balance, which should reduce work-family conflict. While reduced-hours flexible work arrangements did help moderate the relationship between family and work stressors, there was limited evidence that flexible work arrangements were associated with lower chronic stress responses. Notably, reduced work hours could lead to lower chronic stress markers for fathers.",

The report shows retailers anticipate a demand decline and are building inventory for a potential no-deal Brexit at the end of March.

January sales stabilized after a challenging festive period, but remained below average, marking one of the worst periods since 2011. Clothing, footwear, and leather goods sales, as well as hardware and DIY items, declined, while grocers and online sales reported increased volumes. The CBI predicts a more optimistic outlook for the coming month, with retailers expecting sales and orders to rise by February.

The retail industry has the highest rate of redundancies, with a sharp increase in shop closures nationwide. Major high street retailers have announced job cuts and store closures, exacerbating the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar stores. The decline in consumer spending, fueled by inflation following the Brexit vote, and changing shopping habits have contributed to the struggles of traditional stores. The study found that 31% of retail workers who lose their jobs end up unemployed, compared to 26% across all industries. Two in five former retail workers are unemployed for at least six months, with younger workers facing greater risks. The report found that three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30, despite this age group making up only a third of the retail workforce. Policymakers cannot reverse the shift towards online shopping, but they can and should focus on supporting those most affected. The study revealed a long-term decline in retail employment in the UK since 2003, with the number of jobs shrinking from 10.8% to 9.5% of the overall workforce. Britain now has a lower proportion of workers in wholesale and retail compared to Germany. Despite multiple rounds of job cuts, the job market has adapted by creating new opportunities in industries such as hospitality and social care. The retail sector remains a low-paying industry, with an average hourly wage of £8.80, approximately a third lower than the average pay across the entire economy.",

Alicante airport, which serves popular resorts, is expected to be severely impacted, with visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote, and Málaga likely to experience significant delays. The group estimates that an additional 90 seconds per UK passport could add five hours to processing time for a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers. Alicante airport's high volume of UK arrivals makes it particularly vulnerable. Portugal has announced plans to introduce special UK lanes at Faro airport and Funchal, but Spain has yet to confirm its position. Travel editor Rory Boland warns that airports can be chaotic, and a no-deal Brexit could lead to extremely long queues. Until a deal is reached or airports announce alternative arrangements, travelers should prepare for lengthy queues and pack accordingly. The analysis was based on data from the European Tourism Association. According to the UK government's official advice, British tourists would not be entitled to use designated lanes for EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals in a no-deal scenario. They may be required to present a return or onward ticket and face additional checks to ensure sufficient funds. Despite potential challenges, Aena, Spain's largest airport operator, does not anticipate chaos this summer, citing the high stakes involved.

Sharp losses on European and Wall Street stock exchanges followed weak economic growth data in the European single currency bloc, dispelling hopes of a rebound from a weak finish to last year. Economists attributed the poor industrial output figures to a slowdown in China and the global economy, raising the prospect of weaker growth for the rest of 2019. The New York stock market slumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped 2% and markets across Europe suffered steep losses. The IHS Markit flash purchasing managers' index showed that euro area factory output contracted the most since December 2012, with disruptions caused by Brexit and faltering demand for exports amid the US-China trade dispute having a significant impact. Germany's manufacturing sector recorded its steepest decline in output in seven years, with new factory orders deteriorating to the greatest extent since the financial crisis. Germany's industry woes are linked to China's slowing economy, triggered by US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese car sales fell for the first time in almost 30 years, a significant blow to German car manufacturers. Germany narrowly avoided recession last year, and the PMI index showed that Germany and France were the worst performers, while other parts of the eurozone recorded stronger growth. The survey suggests that the economy is expected to grow by around 0.2% in the first quarter, with the bigger picture being that the eurozone economy is still moving at a slow pace, with Germany's manufacturing recession and Italy's broader downturn holding the region back.",

Anxiety sets in - do you firmly grasp it to demonstrate enthusiasm, take it gently to show respect, or opt for something unique? According to Nilesh Dosa, a youth mentor at Ernst & Young, schools are failing to teach young people essential skills, including proper handshaking techniques. We're producing academically talented students who lack the fundamental skills for the workforce, he says. Etiquette consultant Jo Bryant agrees, emphasizing that a strong handshake is crucial in making a good impression. You can have all the qualifications in the world, but if you enter an interview with poor body language, eye contact, and a weak handshake, you won't get the job, she warns. Your interviewer needs to like you and want to be around you. To shake hands correctly, Bryant advises maintaining eye contact, being firm, and ensuring your palms are together. Avoid bone-crushing, but also don't be too limp - that's a sign of underconfidence. A handshake that's too limp can feel like an empty gesture, while one that's too firm can be seen as arrogant. When interacting with someone, you can discreetly wipe your hands before meeting them, not in their presence. Avoid using dominating body language, such as placing your hand on top of theirs or clasping their forearm. To improve your handshaking skills, Bryant recommends practicing with a friend and seeking feedback. This may seem unusual, but it's similar to how you would practice other social skills.",

The sale, expected to be completed by the end of June, encompasses the Newcastle Herald, the Land, and Queensland Country Life. Nine will maintain a commercial relationship with the new owners and continue to print select metropolitan mastheads in regional areas. CEO Hugh Marks stated that the sale aligns with the company's strategy to divest non-core businesses and focus on digital assets. Marks emphasized that Nine will collaborate with the new owners where mutual benefits arise.\n\nAntony Catalano, former Domain CEO, had previously attempted to block the sale of Fairfax to Nine by acquiring up to 19.9% of Fairfax shares. The deal includes $10 million worth of advertising for Nine in ACM properties over the next three years. The ACM group was previously owned by Rural Press and was sold to Fairfax Media in 2007 for $3 billion.\n\nMarks had flagged the potential sale of the community papers shortly after the merger with Fairfax last year. Nine is still seeking to sell its remaining former Fairfax properties, Stuff and Events. Marks told staff that Catalano and Thorney Investment Group saw the future potential of the newspapers, which no longer fit into Nine's national advertising strategy. He described the change in ownership as a positive development, setting the company up for success.\n\nMedia director Katelin McInerney urged Catalano and Thorney to prioritize job security, fair working conditions, and editorial independence. There are approximately 650 editorial staff employed across the country by the ACM group, and McInerney stressed the importance of respecting individual audiences and providing local news, information, and entertainment to communities.",

The US Navy is taking the phenomenon seriously, reportedly developing guidelines to encourage pilots to report unexplained aerial phenomena without fear of ridicule. From now on, we'll refer to these events as unexplained aerial phenomena rather than unidentified flying objects.\n\nThe concept of alien abductions gained popularity in the 1990s through TV shows like \"The X-Files,\" leading many to believe in extraterrestrial life. However, it was revealed that the characters Mulder and Scully were fictional, leaving some to wonder how people continue to claim alien abductions. The answer is straightforward: people are mistaken. Or is it?\n\nDr. Young-hae Chi, a lecturer at Oxford University, takes the alien abduction theory seriously, despite not being a psychologist or materials scientist. He teaches Korean at the faculty of oriental studies and has spoken at conferences about the topic. In a 2012 lecture, he disputed the notion that visiting aliens have sinister plans to take over the world, instead proposing that their secret breeding program to create alien-human hybrids is a noble effort to save humanity from environmental disaster.\n\nDr. Chi has written a book expanding on his theories, but critics may question whether he has any concrete evidence to support his claims. While the recent warming of the Earth is well-documented, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of an alien breeding program. Some alleged alien abductees claim to have experienced \"sexually oriented actions with aliens or other human abductees under mind control,\" but I remain skeptical. Apparently, some recall seeing jars containing hybrid toddlers and fetuses on the alleged alien spaceships. I acknowledge that these individuals may have undergone a traumatic experience, but is there any concrete evidence to support the existence of aliens? Unfortunately, the lack of detectable evidence may be due to the fact that aliens allegedly reside in a different dimension. This sounds similar to the concept of ghosts, which are also often associated with unexplained phenomena. While it's true that \"the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence,\" I believe it's also important to consider the quality of the evidence presented.",

Despite hopes to break even by 2017, London Live has never turned a profit, accumulating losses of £30 million to date. Lebedev is reportedly in discussions with That's Media, which owns licenses for 20 local TV stations, about selling London Live. The value of the loss-making London Live to an existing local TV operator is unclear. A spokesperson for London Live stated, \"We regularly receive approaches for the business, but we refrain from discussing private business matters in public.\" Lebedev began exploring potential sales or mergers with local TV rivals and larger broadcasters about a year ago.

This groundbreaking finding suggests that scents could be harnessed to influence food choices, such as subtly incorporating aromas to make food taste sweeter and reduce sugar consumption. When driving at night, many people experience motion-induced blindness, where red lights momentarily disappear when glancing at oncoming traffic. This phenomenon occurs when the brain disregards visual information presented against a moving backdrop. A striking correlation exists between hearing and vision in speech perception, known as the McGurk effect, where the auditory and visual components of a syllable can create the perception of a third sound. The visual presence of cutlery significantly impacts how we perceive the flavor of food, with research showing that yoghurt tastes sweeter when consumed with a white spoon compared to a black spoon. There is a surprising overlap between smell and sound in human perception, with experiments consistently revealing that individuals pair specific scents with particular instruments and pitches. For instance, a piano is often linked to a fruity aroma, while brass is associated with a musky odor. This phenomenon is thought to be triggered by the olfactory tubercle, an area of the brain that responds to both auditory and olfactory stimuli.",

The company initially sought damages of around $150,000 from each farmer, claiming they broke the law by sourcing and dealing the potatoes. However, when the case went to court in Ahmedabad, India, PepsiCo offered to settle the dispute amicably. The case has sparked outrage among farmers and others, who fear PepsiCo is using its influence to interfere with India's food supply. Several farmers' groups in India have come together to protest the court action. PepsiCo claimed that the farmers who grew its patented potatoes without permission were hurting the interests of many people who work with the company to produce potatoes for its Lay's crisps. The company supplies seeds to these farmers and subsequently buys back the potatoes. PepsiCo is India's largest process-grade potato buyer and one of the first companies to work with thousands of local farmers to grow a specific protected variety of potatoes for our Lay's crisps. The company was forced to take legal action as a last resort, and are deeply committed to resolving the issue. The recent controversy has stirred up memories of the drought, with some commentators expressing concerns that PepsiCo may be using the legal system to punish individuals who use the same groundwater used in their products. The role of foreign companies in producing and selling food in India is a contentious issue, particularly when it comes to genetically modified crops. The case is about \"India's seed sovereignty, food sovereignty, and country sovereignty,\" said Kapil Shah, an activist defending the farmers. He added that it's spreading panic among farmers.

Research reveals that the dominant commercial cultivar grown in Hawaii originated from a single tree in southern Queensland in the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was established using a single cultivar from Australia, repeatedly cloned, resulting in a lack of genetic diversity. This lack of diversity has led to concerns about crop productivity, disease resistance, and the ability to grow macadamia trees in new areas. Researchers hope that their findings will lead to the discovery of wild trees and novel genes that could improve the crop.\n\nBy analyzing genetic markers, researchers traced the origins of Hawaii's macadamia industry back to Queensland. They found that the Hawaiian cultivar had distinctive gene markers in common with a small crop of trees in the Mooloo area, near Gympie, which is 160km north of Brisbane. Historical records show that seeds from these trees were taken to Honolulu in 1896.\n\nDespite being found in a narrow band of subtropical rainforest, Australia's native macadamia trees have a rich genetic diversity compared to commercial crops. This means that there is hope for discovering diverse genes in Australian forests and even in backyards. The researchers found that there is a strong geographic pattern to the diversity of macadamia trees, with all the diversity coming from south-east Queensland and northern NSW. The Hawaiian germplasm is very narrow, meaning it has only come from one locality.\n\nThe researchers also found that some unique genetic markers in commercial trees could not be matched with known wild trees. This could be due to the loss of diverse genes in the wild through land clearing, or it could be that they continue to exist in domestic cultivated plants. Some of the lost diversity might be found in cultivated plants, parks, gardens, or backyards. The oldest known cultivated macadamia tree is located in Brisbane's city botanic gardens, which was planted in 1858.\n\nAustralia's macadamia industry is significant, with the crop accounting for 14% of the country's total horticultural exports in 2017.",

        "Text": "The notion of a matriarchal society spanning planets is captivating, promising a future of unprecedented possibility. The idea that women will assume leadership roles, not just on Earth but throughout the galaxy, is not entirely implausible. It's possible that men have had their time and it's now women's turn to take the helm. According to this theory, women will either quietly eliminate men in their sleep or leave them behind as they colonize space. However, this raises the question of how they plan to reproduce without men's involvement. The answer is that the matriarchy only requires a supply of frozen sperm to get started. While it's possible that men might resist this plan, new research suggests that frozen sperm can survive in space with no adverse effects. Scientists have found that by subjecting sperm samples to weightlessness, they can collect and store it for future use, raising the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth, allowing the matriarchy to impregnate themselves as needed.\n\nThe absence of gender-based biases and stereotypes could contribute to a more cohesive and efficient all-female space mission. In contrast, all-male missions in the past may have been plagued by similar issues. NASA reportedly conducted a secret study on long-term space travel, suggesting that to prevent conflicts, the crew should consist only of individuals of the same gender - either all men or all women. The study concluded that an all-female crew would be a better option, as men might argue over who should be in charge. This is a pattern observed throughout human history. While an all-female spacecraft would likely still see some romantic entanglements, at least the risk of pregnancy during a space flight would be eliminated. One could joke that the sperm would be safe, but it's unlikely that the men on board would declare themselves kings of the ship once the women departed.",

Frozen sperm samples in microgravity maintained similar properties to those on Earth, potentially enabling a sperm bank in space for future missions. This breakthrough has implications for female astronauts, as future Mars expeditions may feature all-female crews. According to Helen Sharman, NASA recommended all-male or all-female teams due to improved teamwork. A small study found no significant differences in sperm characteristics exposed to microgravity using a small aerobatic aircraft. The study's lead author stressed that further research is necessary to understand the effects of space conditions on sperm. Sperm would need to be exposed to space-like conditions for extended periods to understand its behavior. Conducting a real spaceflight experiment would be ideal, but limited access to space makes it a challenging task.",

The sale has raised concerns beyond worries about access to luxury foods, with residents in Bromley, Oadby, and Wollaton fretting that the change could negatively impact their property values. \"We're regulars at Waitrose and are very unhappy about this,\" said Kal Kandola, a 49-year-old resident and landlord in Wollaton, who is concerned about the potential impact on house prices. Research by Lloyds Bank found that homes near Waitrose enjoy a 12% premium, worth £43,571, due to the \"Waitrose effect\". However, local residents' worries may be unfounded, as Lloyds' research indicates that homes near budget supermarkets like Lidl have seen a 15% increase in value over the past four years, outpacing those near Waitrose. In fact, homes near Lidl are worth £5,411 more than similar properties in the area. Discount stores like Lidl and Aldi have gained popularity among affluent shoppers, with Lidl and Aldi now controlling nearly 14% of the UK market. This shift has seen them overtake Waitrose, which has traditionally been associated with middle-class shoppers. Housing market expert Neal Hudson believes the supermarket switch is unlikely to significantly impact house prices. \"The presence of a Waitrose is just one factor among many that affects property values,\" he said. \"Other factors, such as changes to a school's catchment area, are much more likely to impact prices. With a no-deal Brexit looming, there are greater concerns for homeowners.\"",

Over 1,000 workers lost their jobs when the company entered administration earlier this week. Wrightbus's failure marks the UK's second significant insolvency this week. The company had been seeking a buyer, but talks with Weichai and Jo Bamford's firm collapsed at the end of last week. Former director Jeff Wright is calling for an end to intimidation, citing sinister developments involving threats to the Wright family's lives. The closure of Wrightbus has been devastating for its loyal and skilled workforce, and the loss of the company has been shattering for the Wright family, who have nurtured it for over 70 years. The company is committed to providing its administrators with all necessary information to establish a future plan for the bus manufacturing operation. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson ordered iconic red Routemaster buses from Wrightbus during his time in office. Trade unionists have criticized Johnson for not doing enough to save the ailing firm. The company's collapse came after Johnson told parliament that his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus. A government source has denied giving any such assurances. A source with knowledge of the company's board has also disputed reports that the government has offered support. Ballymena has faced significant job losses in recent years. A Police Service of Northern Ireland spokesperson stated that they do not disclose information about individual security measures, but will notify individuals if they receive credible information that their life may be in danger.",

EY took over as auditor from PwC in 2017. Thomas Cook has had several finance chiefs in recent years, with Sten Daugaard becoming chief financial officer in December 2018. The FRC is contemplating an investigation and enforcement action due to recent developments at Thomas Cook. Daugaard altered the company's accounting practices, including recognizing £28m in charges, which EY disagreed with. Thomas Cook reported a £1.5bn first-half loss and issued its third profit warning in May. The company had £1.2bn in debt and wrote down the value of its MyTravel UK business by £1.1bn. In May, EY expressed \"significant doubt\" about Thomas Cook's ability to continue as a going concern. The company ceased operations, leaving 9,000 UK jobs at risk and stranding 150,000 British tourists abroad.

The retailer has partnered with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders over £30 in interest-free instalments. Clearpay, an Australian fintech company, has gained popularity among millennials on tight budgets, alongside its rival Klarna. Many of M&S's competitors, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services, and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shoppers. M&S says its customers are increasingly seeking ways to spread the cost of larger purchases, and the Clearpay service enables them to do so by spreading the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800, and customers can manage their payments through a phone app without needing to apply for credit. Unlike traditional credit products, fintech firms like Clearpay and Klarna make money by earning commission on the sales transaction. Shoppers who use these plans tend to spend more frequently, making it an attractive proposition for retailers like M&S. Over 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports, and Boohoo, work with Klarna, which has more than 3 million British customers. Clearpay, which launched in the UK just three months ago, has already gained over 200,000 active customers. However, not everyone is a fan of this form of credit. Simon Wolfson, CEO of Next, has expressed concerns that it might be dangerous, saying that there is a difference between spreading the cost and just deferring it. Stepchange, a debt charity, has also expressed concern that these payment plans may inadvertently encourage individuals to spend money they don't have. These services are marketed to consumers as a convenient option to \"try before you buy\", but the unintended consequence is that people may take on debt they wouldn't have otherwise considered.",

For years, scientists have been fascinated by these sudden, low-frequency radiation events, which release more energy than the sun in a day and disappear instantly. Known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), these enigmatic signals appear randomly and without warning, leaving astronomers uncertain about when or where they will occur next. Over 60 FRBs have been detected, with the only consensus being that they are unlikely to be extraterrestrial greetings. A year ago, scientists identified a repeating radio signal and traced it to a dwarf galaxy 3 billion light-years from Earth. Further observations suggested that the burst was generated by extremely powerful magnetic fields, effectively ruling out the possibility of alien laser signals. A team of astronomers from several Canadian universities has announced the discovery of a second repeating radio signal. The team's breakthrough came after activating the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope in British Columbia.

The study highlights that nearly 500,000 land species are at risk of extinction due to habitat destruction. The Sundarbans, a 4,000-square-mile region in Bangladesh and India, is home to the world's largest mangrove forest and a diverse ecosystem that supports hundreds of animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. However, 70% of the region is only a few feet above sea level, making it extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts. Researchers predict that the warming planet will decimate the few hundred Bengal tigers remaining in the region. By 2070, the study concludes that there will be no suitable tiger habitats remaining in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Climate change has already had a devastating impact on endangered mammals, with a recent study finding that it has harmed almost half of them. The new report's lead author and colleagues examined the risks to the tiger population beyond sea level rise, which accounted for only 5.4-11.3% of the projected habitat loss in 2050 and 2070. They found that other climate-related factors were more significant threats to the Sundarbans' tigers. Habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal trade of animal parts have contributed to the global tiger population decline since the early 1900s. The Bangladesh Sundarbans will likely experience a decline in its population due to an increase in extreme weather events and changes in vegetation. As the Sundarbans flood, the likelihood of conflicts between humans and tigers will rise. The situation could worsen significantly if a cyclone hits, a disease outbreak occurs, or a food shortage develops.

Of The Atlantic's 15 most recent cover stories, 11 were written by men, further highlighting the issue. Goldberg proposed identifying and mentoring new writers, but acknowledged that this approach may not always yield successful results, potentially reinforcing existing biases. His comments sparked widespread criticism, with many accusing him of undervaluing underrepresented writers. The article's length sparked a lively Twitter discussion, with journalists chiming in. Margaret Sullivan humorously shared her own writing limitations, saying she aspires to write 1,200 words but tops out at 850. Andi Zeisler quipped, \"Has anyone informed Jeffrey Goldberg about women who write books?\"",

Paul Oetken's ruling stated that the court acknowledged the SALT cap as a distinct provision, but the states failed to demonstrate that it exceeded Congress's authority to impose taxes. The lawsuit was joined by New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maryland. The 2017 tax law introduced a cap on state and local tax deductions to offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts. The cap and related provisions are expected to generate nearly $700 billion in revenue over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Independent analyses suggest that most residents in high-tax states received a modest tax cut under the 2017 law. Other provisions of the law, such as reduced marginal tax rates, offset the loss of the deduction for many families. The state and local tax issue poses a challenge for Democrats seeking to restore a tax break primarily benefiting high-income earners. Prior to the cap's implementation, households earning $200,000 or more accounted for roughly half of the nearly $600 billion in state and local tax payments deducted on federal tax returns. Democrats argue that the SALT cap unfairly penalizes states with progressive tax policies, making state and local taxes more expensive for residents. This could hinder states' ability to raise taxes, particularly on wealthy residents, and increase pressure to cut spending. The four states claimed that the SALT cap constitutes an impermissible attempt by the federal government to influence certain states' tax policies.",

In a joint statement, CBS and Viacom revealed that their boards have established independent committees to assess the feasibility of a combination, but stressed that a deal is not yet guaranteed. The companies' decision to re-examine a potential merger comes as they recognize the need to grow to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving media landscape, where scale is increasingly crucial. This shift in strategy likely stems from recent industry trends, including Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox and AT&T's pursuit of Time Warner for $85.4 billion.

With its instantly recognizable color scheme and slogan, Tower Records dominated the retail music landscape before the digital era. At its peak, the chain boasted over 200 stores across 15 countries, with annual sales exceeding $1 billion. Solomon's journey began at his father's Sacramento pharmacy, where he sold used jukebox records as a teenager. From there, he built a retail empire celebrated for its vast music selection and vibrant culture. Tower Records' employees were passionate music aficionados, and the stores became gathering places for fans. The Sunset Boulevard and Broadway locations became popular tourist attractions, drawing celebrity devotees like Bruce Springsteen and Bette Midler. Elton John, Tower Records' most ardent patron, often visited the Hollywood store early in the morning. A 2015 documentary features footage of John browsing the aisles and purchasing vinyl records in the 1970s. Solomon's reliance on debt to fuel Tower's expansion ultimately became a crushing burden on the company's finances. The decline of the music industry, exacerbated by online piracy, also took a devastating toll on Tower Records. The company suffered significant losses, including $10 million in 2000 and $90 million in 2001. In 2004, Tower Records' parent company filed for bankruptcy, and two years later, the company closed its 89 American stores after liquidation sales. Outside the first store in Sacramento, employees left a poignant message: \"All things must pass.\" A Tower Records store near Lincoln Center in New York was bustling with shoppers seeking out final deals in October 2006. Physical album sales in the United States plummeted from 785 million in 2000 to 103 million in the most recent year, as music consumption shifted towards digital formats.",

The underweight whale, still growing, was an unusual case, as adult sperm whales typically reach up to 120,000 pounds in weight. A post-mortem examination revealed that the whale's digestive system was severely clogged with 64 pounds of trash, including plastic bags, ropes, and a plastic drum, which it was unable to digest or pass through its system. This led to severe inflammation, ultimately causing the whale's decline and death. Sperm whales, which dive to great depths to hunt squid, often linger near the surface, making them vulnerable to ingesting floating debris that may be mistaken for food. Unfortunately, ocean pollution has devastating effects on wildlife, particularly in areas where buoyant debris accumulates in \"islands\" of trash that float above or just below the surface. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is estimated to contain at least 87,000 tons of plastic. Some scientists believe that plastic pollution may have a greater impact on animal populations than climate change. In 2008, two whales were found on a beach in Northern California with bags and netting in their stomachs, likely discarded by fishermen. One whale's stomach had ruptured, and the other, which had consumed over 160 pounds of trash, likely starved to death as the garbage obstructed its stomach. The authorities in Murcia have released the results of a post-mortem examination conducted by the El Valle Wildlife Recovery Center as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the impact of plastic and trash in the coastal region's waters. Volunteers are working to clean up local beaches and are urging the public to be more mindful of their plastic waste disposal.

The company aims to attract new users with innovative solutions, leveraging its vast user base. However, the ambitious project unexpectedly came to a halt on Wednesday. Facebook announced it would no longer build the drones, abandoning its original goal of expanding internet access. Instead, the company will rely on other companies to develop aircraft. A manufacturing plant in western England, where the drones were being produced, will be closed. Mark Zuckerberg envisioned solar-powered drones flying for months without landing, 60,000 feet above remote areas. The massive aircraft filled a warehouse but weighed as much as a grand piano. Following a successful test flight in 2016, Zuckerberg hailed the project as \"something that's never been done before.\" Unfortunately, the drone initiative, known as Project Aquila, faced several setbacks, including a crash landing and broken wing. Project Aquila was part of Facebook's Internet.org initiative to expand internet access in underdeveloped areas, a controversial effort criticized by some as a ploy to attract new users.",

This phenomenon, known as the Leidenfrost effect, has been observed by cooks and scientists alike. In 1756, German doctor Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost first described the effect in his book on water properties. French scientists have recently made a new discovery about the behavior of these skittering drops. When the droplets are small, the heat from the pan causes them to tilt and rotate, propelling them to roll. Previously unknown, this phenomenon was only discovered when scientists attempted to pin a water droplet to a precisely flat surface. The clear color of water makes it difficult to see the liquid's movement. Scientists had previously thought the droplets moved due to air currents or sliding down a slope, but new research shows they can move independently. \"It's surprisingly simple,\" said David Quere, a scientist at Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris. \"The drop is running away, and it has a little motor inside, which is surprising.\" Quere and his colleagues published their findings in Nature Physics this week. To observe the Leidenfrost effect, droplets of water were placed on a very flat, very hot, nonabsorbent surface held in place by a needle. The surface must be at least 400 degrees Fahrenheit for the effect to occur. Some recipes use this test to determine whether a pan is hot enough. Large drops have a flattened shape, resembling puddles. Within each drop, two convective cells rotate in opposite directions, canceling out each other's motion. The flow within the drop was visualized using tracers mixed with the water. As the water evaporates, the droplet shrinks and becomes nearly spherical, allowing for only one convective cell to exist. When the needle is lifted, the smaller droplet speeds away in the direction of its convective spin. The researchers' next step is to guide the droplets through channels or temperature gradients. There are still fundamental phenomena to be explored, such as why the surface temperature must be significantly higher than the boiling point for the drops to levitate. Interestingly, there is currently no clear answer to this question.",

Just three decades ago, we had no idea if there were planets beyond our own solar system. In 1995, astronomers made a groundbreaking discovery when they found a star in the constellation Pegasus wobbling due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive instruments that detect subtle changes in starlight caused by an orbiting planet. As a planet orbits its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again, a phenomenon that can be detected by these advanced instruments. The Kepler space telescope, launched in 2009, revolutionized the field of exoplanet hunting by discovering thousands of planets. Unlike earlier methods, Kepler searched for small dips in starlight caused by a planet passing in front of its star. Kepler's findings were astounding, revealing a diverse range of exoplanets. In recent years, astronomers have made significant progress in directly imaging exoplanets, capturing blurry but tantalizing glimpses of alien landscapes. We've also discovered a free-floating planet and signs of planets being born. The next generation of planet hunters is now on the horizon. On April 16, 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, will launch and spend two years scanning the entire sky for minute dips in brightness caused by nearby alien worlds. TESS is equipped with four cameras that can cover a 96-degree swath of the sky. As a planet hunter, TESS's discoveries can be further studied by the next generation of telescopes on Earth and in space. If fortunate, TESS may uncover planets with lakes, oceans, and atmospheres rich in chemicals, allowing us to detect signs of habitability or even life. The Milky Way is estimated to harbor more planets than stars, with a vast diversity that remains largely unexplored. Our own planet remains the ultimate benchmark for our quest for life and meaning in the universe.",

The lander's seismometers, designed to detect marsquakes, picked up vibrations in the air, which are essentially sound waves. The moderate 10-15 mile-per-hour winds caused the lander's solar panels to vibrate, and the seismometers recorded these vibrations. The process is analogous to human hearing, with the solar panels acting like the eardrum, the spacecraft structure like the inner ear, and the seismometers converting vibrations into nerve signals. The recorded vibrations have a frequency of up to 50 Hertz, audible to humans as a low rumble. NASA has amplified the recording by two octaves, evoking the feeling of wind or ocean waves with an otherworldly quality. A second instrument, an air pressure sensor, detected sound vibrations, although at a much lower frequency audible only to certain animals. The air pressure sensor's readings, sped up by a factor of 100, raise the pitch by over six octaves. The instruments are not sensitive to higher frequencies, so the sounds are lower in frequency. Mars' incredibly thin air makes it more conducive to low-frequency sounds. The Viking landers detected some wind noise, but the recordings were made at lower sampling rates and didn't pick up any sounds at audible frequencies. The Viking seismometer detected spacecraft movements, but it would be a stretch to describe them as sounds.

Heck, curator at the Field Museum of Natural History, \"That's what everybody would have expected,\" but planetary scientists were surprised to find that the most common types of meteorites on Earth are not common in space. A recent study published in Nature Astronomy revealed that mineralogical evidence in some meteorites suggests a massive collision in the asteroid belt around 466 million years ago. Dr. Heck estimates that during this time, skywatchers would have witnessed about 100 times more shooting stars than we see today. To investigate meteorites that landed on Earth before this collision, Dr. Heck and his colleagues turned to ancient limestone from Russia, which dates back around a million years. They extracted 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite from almost 600 pounds of rock. These crystals remain unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, allowing scientists to determine that 41 of them originated from space and were once part of specific types of asteroids. The mix of meteorites from this ancient period was strikingly different from what we see today, with more than a third belonging to a type called primitive achondrites, compared to less than half a percent today. The findings align with the growing understanding that the composition of meteorites is shaped by the history of asteroid collisions in the asteroid belt, rather than the proximity of asteroids to Earth's orbit. The new paper opens up new avenues of research, including the origins of achondrite meteorites, which may not all share the same origin.",

With only around 4,000 remaining in the wild, this endangered species is fighting for survival due to poaching, habitat destruction, and human conflicts. The primary concern is when a snow leopard enters a livestock enclosure, where it may devour a few goats and sheep or, in extreme cases, slaughter over 100 animals in a single enclosure, leading to devastating consequences. If the cat becomes trapped, a tragic outcome often ensues, as the herders typically kill it in retaliation. To address these conflicts, researchers have been studying the dynamics between humans and snow leopards in Nepal's Central Himalayas, tracking snow leopard scat over 150 days to uncover clues about the cat's diet and feeding habits. This research could eventually inform conservation strategies aimed at reducing contact between snow leopards and farm animals.

The study, published in The Journal of Experimental Biology, brought together a group of retired Navy dolphins and a retired killer whale, accompanied by a trainer, in a large tank for six months. The goal was to observe and quantify the energy expenditure of these marine mammals as they performed various behaviors, including navigating oversized hula hoops.\n\nThe researchers, led by Terrie M. Williams from the University of California, Santa Cruz, found that dolphins and whales expend more energy when swimming rapidly than when cruising at normal speeds. This discovery contradicts the prevailing assumption that marine mammals, celebrated for their remarkable diving abilities, have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve energy and oxygen.\n\nTo conduct the study, the team collaborated with trainers to prompt the marine mammals to engage in distinct behaviors, such as resting, swimming in a straight line, or diving to swim through hoops. The animals' breathing, oxygen intake, heart rate, and swimming patterns were measured across various settings. The results showed little disparity in energy expenditure between resting and swimming at average speeds. However, as the animals swam faster, they had to exert more energy due to water resistance, which nearly doubled their normal energy use when swimming at their fastest pace.",

Male elk, or bulls, typically don't live beyond five years due to hunting, whereas female elk, or cows, can live up to 20 years. Notably, cows over the age of 10 appear to be nearly invulnerable to hunters. A team of scientists aimed to understand why senior cows are so skilled at survival. Is it because these elk are naturally more cautious, thereby allowing them to evade hunters more effectively? Or can cows learn to avoid hunters over their lifetime, even if they initially exhibit more daring behavior? Research published in PLOS One suggests that both factors are involved. By tracking dozens of female elk over several years, the authors found that, overall, cautious cows were more likely to survive. However, they also discovered that individual cows could adapt their behavior and adopt stealthier strategies as they aged. As cows aged, they tended to move shorter distances and seek safer terrain if they sensed a higher risk of encountering hunters.",

The article was deemed unreliable and CNN was unable to fully stand by its reporting, causing a significant blow to its reputation. The resignations come amid intense criticism from Trump and his supporters, who label CNN's reporting as \"fake news\". Trump's advisors have also accused CNN of harboring a bias against the president. CNN's president, Jeffrey A. Zucker, was deeply disturbed by the reporting errors and led an internal investigation. The three resigning journalists played a crucial role in the story's publication. This is the latest in a series of embarrassing episodes for CNN, which has previously fired Kathy Griffin and severed ties with host Reza Aslan.

Despite human-defined boundaries, wolves roam freely across the region, unaffected by human efforts to restrict their movement. A recent study in Wildlife Monographs suggests that controlling wolf populations outside the preserve has had adverse effects on wolves within it. The study reveals that when Alaskan authorities culled wolf populations outside the preserve, survival rates within the preserve were lower than usual. This highlights the importance of communication and cooperation between wildlife managers within and outside preserve boundaries, with potential implications for global wildlife management programs. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has invested millions in an intensive predator management program since the 1990s, initially using sterilization and later shooting and killing hundreds of wolves from helicopters. Despite decades of effort, the program has failed to significantly increase the Fortymile caribou herd population, which remains at around 50,000 to 60,000. Research suggests that these efforts may not be effective in increasing caribou numbers. Over 22 years of monitoring wolves using radio collars, researchers found that wolf survival rates decreased during lethal management outside the preserve. Every single wolf pack left the preserve, as the state only targeted wolves outside the preserve, while many wolves that ventured out were shot and killed.",

These ticks, widespread on forest floors, suburban estates, and urban parks across North America and Europe, are attracted to white-footed mice and other small mammals that harbor pathogens. Typically, they feed on these mice, but a recent study suggests that the surge in tick-borne disease may be linked to a decline in traditional mouse predators. If mice were less abundant, larval ticks might feed on other mammals and birds that don't carry diseases, or they might struggle to find their first meal. Ticks require three meals to reproduce, and humans are only at risk of contracting diseases from ticks that have previously fed on infected hosts.\n\nTo test this theory, lead researcher Tim R. Hofmeester set up cameras in 20 plots across the Dutch countryside to monitor fox and stone marten activity. The plots were situated in both protected areas and areas where foxes are heavily hunted. Over two years, Hofmeester captured hundreds of mice and voles, counted the number of ticks on them, and tested the ticks for Lyme and other disease-causing bacteria.

Similarly, in humans, this type of behavior is linked to creativity and cognitive complexity. However, understanding the human mind's capacity for randomness is a complex task. A team of European researchers recently conducted a series of experiments to measure human random decision-making abilities. They found that, on average, individuals are most skilled at producing random results around the age of 25. The team designed five tasks to test randomness, including simulating random coin flips, guessing the next card in a shuffled deck, and arranging a grid of black and white boxes to appear random. Over 3,400 participants from 4 to 91 years old took part in the experiment. The researchers used software to analyze participants' responses and identified the sequences that were most challenging for the computer to predict as the most random. By analyzing participants' performance against various factors, including age, sex, and educational background, the researchers found a strong correlation with age. Performance improved from childhood to the mid-20s and remained relatively high until the 60s, after which it began to decline.

Sometimes we struggle to cry when we should, and other times we cry without apparent reason. Amidst this emotional complexity, it's refreshing to consider the straightforward explanation behind why onions make us tear up. Onions release a chemical called lachrymatory factor, which irritates our eyes when it reacts with other substances. Simply peeling an onion won't cause our eyes to water, but chopping, cutting, crushing, or smashing one will. This is because the onion's cells break open, allowing two previously separate substances to combine and form a potent chemical irritant. According to Josie Silvaroli, this chemical reaction is analogous to tear gas, as it releases a gas that hits the eyes and sensory nerves, causing them to tear up. The lachrymatory factor evolved as a defense mechanism to protect onions from microbes and animals, including humans. When an onion is damaged, it triggers this defense mechanism, releasing the chemical reaction as its cells break down.",

Initial evidence suggests that Yellowstone's most recent supereruption was triggered by new magma entering the system just decades before the eruption, contradicting previous estimates that assumed a geological process unfolding over thousands of years.",

Former chief spokesperson Nicole Quenqua announced she would no longer provide statements to the press. The Weinstein Company has been at the center of a growing scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein and his brother. Investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker uncovered decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct and rape against Harvey Weinstein. Harvey Weinstein, who has denied allegations of non-consensual sex, was fired by the Weinstein Company's board of directors, which includes his brother, on Sunday. Several other male board members have resigned, including billionaire investor Dirk Ziff, Milwaukee Bucks owner and Avenue Capital Group CEO Marc Lasry, Technicolor president and deputy CEO Tim Sarnoff, and accountant Richard Koenigsberg, who departed on Thursday. The Weinstein Company boasts significant assets, including a TV unit with popular shows and a theatrical division with seven completed films, potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Benedict Cumberbatch released a statement on Tuesday condemning Harvey Weinstein's actions. As the entertainment industry distances itself from the company, questions are mounting about whether the studio can continue to operate. Speculation about bankruptcy surfaced in Variety on Thursday, and on Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Weinstein Company is exploring a sale or shutdown.",

These remarkable 'trees' aren't plants, but rather intricate homes built by Christmas tree worms on coral reefs worldwide. Constructed from calcium carbonate secretions, these tubes serve as homes for the worms, who emerge to feed, reproduce, and breathe using their branchial crowns. As you snorkel through the waters, look out for these vibrant, spiral-shaped cones that resemble miniature decorated firs. According to marine biologist Orly Perry, these 'trees' are \"really pretty, very colorful, very festive, and Christmassy.\" Despite their small size, these worm 'trees' make up for it with dazzling displays that rival the work of a skilled candymaker. In the Gulf of Aqaba, near Eilat, Israel, Perry has observed many of these 'trees' displaying a kaleidoscope of colors, including purples, greens, and whites. Unlike other creatures, Christmas tree worms don't burrow into the coral; instead, they latch onto dead spots or wounds and construct their tubes. By synchronizing their tube growth with the coral's growth, the worms ensure their homes remain stable and accessible. Once settled, these worms stay put for up to 30 or 40 years, unable to relocate. The locations where these larvae settle are not arbitrary; they appear to have a specific preference for certain coral species, often opting for less aggressive ones. In optimal environments, the worms are able to grow to their full size. According to Mrs. Perry, this phenomenon is reminiscent of human behavior: \"If you're comfortable in a place, everything is happy, and that's true for these worms too. Their size is directly impacted by their habitat choice.\" Some species within the Spirobranchus genus have a fondness for artificial surfaces, while others thrive on specific types of coral. Mrs. Perry discovered a potentially new species in the Gulf of Eilat that has a peculiar affinity for plastic buoys and metal surfaces on piers and staircases. It's possible that the larvae are drawn to these preferred habitats by signals emitted by older worms that have successfully colonized similar locations in the past.\"",

Researchers had previously reported no instances of cancer in these long-lived rodents, either in the wild or in zoos, and had even injected their cells with viruses that trigger tumors in mice without observing any adverse effects. However, a recent study published in Veterinary Pathology has identified two cases of cancer in naked mole rats housed in zoos. According to Martha Delaney, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and lead author of the study, these cases do not preclude the possibility that naked mole rats may hold a clue to fighting cancer, but rather provide additional insights about what makes them less susceptible to cancer. The discovery of cancer in naked mole rats is significant, as researchers have been studying the rodents for over a decade to understand why they are less prone to cancer. The first case of cancer was identified in a 22-year-old male naked mole rat from the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, which was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that develops from the body's mucus-secreting glands. Now that we have two cases of cancer in naked mole rats, we can study the colonies from which they came to understand why they are more prone to cancer compared to other zoo and research colonies.",

Rescued as a 10-day-old orphan in Namibia, Chewbaaka became an ambassador for the Cheetah Conservation Fund, earning his name from a variation of the \"Star Wars\" character's moniker. Although he passed away five years ago at the remarkable age of 16, twice the average lifespan of a wild cheetah, his genetic legacy continues through his blood samples. Scientists combined his blood with samples from six other cheetahs from Namibia and East Africa to sequence the species' complete genome. Cheetahs, with their striking coats and distinctive \"teardrop\" markings, captivate tourists on photographic safaris with their remarkable speed, reaching nearly 60 miles per hour. Their unique physiology, featuring elongated legs, an aerodynamic skull, powerful adrenal glands and heart muscles, and claws that grip the earth like football cleats, enables them to achieve such remarkable speeds. Unfortunately, cheetahs are critically endangered, with only around 10,000 individuals remaining, mostly in southern and eastern Africa. A recent genomic analysis has revealed concerning findings: the cheetah has less than 5% of the genomic diversity of other wild cats, a level lower than even inbred domestic dogs and cats, and the lowest among the 30 mammals whose genomes have been sequenced. Genetic diversity in an animal is determined by variations in enzyme genes inherited from its parents and is crucial for its healthy reproduction and immunity to disease.",

The documents, published by the Center for International Environmental Law, suggest that the industry understood climate change as far back as 60 years ago. According to Carroll Muffett, the environmental law center's director, Exxon's predecessor, Humble Oil, was aware of rising CO2 levels and global warming potential as early as 1957. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies, and organizations formed the Smoke and Fumes Committee to monitor pollution research and use science to undermine environmental regulations. Muffett believes the committee's actions would be echoed in later efforts to discredit climate science. The Center for International Environmental Law's work was first reported by Inside Climate News, which has previously published stories suggesting Exxon Mobil understood climate change risks from its own research and used that knowledge to plan activities. Exxon Mobil's own research funded climate denial groups until the mid-2000s. The investigations have led to a surge in activism against the company and energy industry, with the hashtag #exxonknew. Attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, have demanded information from Exxon about its internal research and funding of climate denial. Inside Climate News announced its article is the first in a series based on the environmental law center's work and documents. Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers dismissed the new allegations as absurd. Exxon Mobil is pushing back against an investigation into its knowledge of climate change, claiming the inquiry is not credible. The company is being investigated by four attorneys general, including Claude Earl Walker, the attorney general of the US Virgin Islands, who is working with a private law firm. Exxon Mobil filed a response in Texas, accusing Walker and his team of misusing their power and violating the company's constitutional rights.

A patient's passing of kidney stones after each of three consecutive rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster inspired the study. Dr. Wartinger and Dr. Mitchell created a 3D-printed silicone cast of a patient's kidney, filled it with kidney stones and urine, and rode the roller coaster 20 times, observing the movement of the kidney stones. The back of a roller coaster is a more effective spot to dislodge a small kidney stone, with a success rate of 64% compared to 17% at the front. Each year, over 300,000 Americans seek emergency care for kidney stones, often due to severe pain caused by a large stone lodged in their ureter. However, it's unlikely that a roller coaster ride would provide relief for those with larger stones. Dr. Borin notes that this study is specifically designed for individuals with small kidney stones. If you're aware of having a small kidney stone and are interested in trying the roller coaster method, it's recommended that you consult with your urologist. You might be able to eliminate your kidney stone while also having a thrilling experience – a true case of \"killing two birds with one stone.\"",

The Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, a former chemical production facility, has contaminated the surrounding waterways, allowing toxic substances to seep into aquatic animals' bodies. Despite the toxic environment, some aquatic animals have miraculously survived, including the Atlantic killifish, a small, silver fish that has adapted to thrive in this polluted ecosystem. According to a recent study published in Science, the killifish's ability to survive in polluted waters is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation. Researchers first discovered the fish's tolerance to toxic waters in the late 1990s and have since found that distinct populations of killifish have independently developed similar genetic adaptations to survive in highly polluted areas along the Atlantic coastline. The new study reveals that evolution can occur independently in different populations and that similar genetic changes can emerge in response to extreme environments. According to biologist Diane Nacci at the Environmental Protection Agency, the study provides a valuable example of how animals can adapt to rapidly changing environments. Researchers led by evolutionary geneticist Noah Reid at the University of Connecticut analyzed the genomes of 384 killifish from polluted and less-polluted areas, finding that a single genetic pathway was responsible for the pollution tolerance in all regions, with slightly different patterns of genetic changes in each population.",

The sardines may not be permanent residents, but Dr. Oliver believes they've found a niche in the area.

As a result, women will now pay significantly more in long-term-care premiums compared to men. Women will pay an average of $1,225 per year for a policy providing $164,000 in current benefits without inflation protection, while men will pay $925. The difference is even greater with 3% annual inflation protection. The association found that a typical single woman will pay an average of 12% more than in 2013. Couples who buy a policy together may experience varying premium increases depending on the insurer. Genworth noted that its gender-specific pricing only applies to single policies. Insurers typically offer significant couples discounts, and the average premium for couples with inflation protection has risen by about 3% from last year. When considering long-term care insurance, it's crucial to explore ways to secure the lowest premium possible. Consumers should shop around as premiums for similar coverage can differ significantly among insurance providers. Insurance broker Rose Clayton advises women to keep the additional premium cost in perspective.

Calpers, a $252 billion pension fund, administers pensions for California state employees and many municipal workers, calculating annual contribution amounts, billing cities, collecting payments, investing funds, and distributing benefits to retirees. In 2011, Stockton paid Calpers $20 million, roughly double the amount it spent on public libraries, and the city's payments to Calpers are expected to nearly double over the next decade, making Calpers Stockton's largest creditor. Stockton claims it has no choice but to continue making payments, even as it cuts costs elsewhere, including payments to bondholders, and argues that reducing the rate at which its workers build up their pensions would lead to a mass exodus, particularly among police officers who were recruited with promises of large, early pensions. Last year, Stockton requested a \"hardship exemption\" from Calpers, allowing it to slow down its contributions, but Calpers denied the request, fearing that if Stockton fell behind, it might never catch up.

Just a few months ago, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 3.5 percent, near a historic low.

Greece received a 4 billion-euro aid package from its creditors on Wednesday, which may require debt relief and additional funding to meet the current 172 billion-euro bailout program requirements. The IMF warns that Greece's investment and growth are unlikely to recover unless investors are convinced of a credible plan to address the debt crisis. This warning has sparked concern among some IMF officials, including Paulo Nogueira Batista, who abstained from voting on additional aid to Greece, citing growing awareness of the program's risks. Batista also noted a sense of desperation among IMF staff, who urge Greek and euro-area authorities to uphold their commitments.",

The government will not need supplementary austerity measures in the 2014 budget, which will be presented this month. The budget will be based on a revised forecast for 2014, with projected growth and unemployment rates that are more optimistic than previously anticipated. Spain's economy has been in recession since the construction bubble burst in 2008, but 2014 is expected to mark the beginning of a turnaround. The European Commission granted Spain extra time to meet its budgetary targets in May, given the severity of the recession. Spain's deficit is expected to drop to 6.5% of gross domestic product in 2014, down from 7% in 2013 and the initial target of 4.5%.",

For same-sex couples residing in states that recognize same-sex marriage, the application process is likely straightforward. However, a lingering question remains for couples who were married in one state but relocated to another that does not recognize gay marriage. The Social Security Administration uses a \"place of residence\" standard to determine spousal benefits, instructing staff to accept and hold applications pending further legal clarification. Mary Bonauto expressed optimism regarding the case of 83-year-old Herb Burtis, who successfully challenged the Defense of Marriage Act and is now receiving survivor benefits. Bonauto believes there is every reason to expect the agency will eventually process and pay survivor benefits to other eligible same-sex applicants. To qualify for spousal retirement benefits, you typically need to be at least 62 years old and have been married for at least 12 months. For survivor's benefits, you must be at least 60 years old and have been married for at least nine months. Bonauto recommends applying for benefits despite any uncertainties. You can apply for spousal retirement benefits online at www.ssa.gov, but must visit a local Social Security office to apply for survivor's benefits, scheduling an appointment in advance. It's recommended to bring a copy of your marriage license, civil union certificate, or domestic partnership certificate, as well as a copy of your spouse's death certificate, to your office visit. If you have questions, contact your state's regional communications director, whose contact information is listed on the Social Security website.",

The fortunes of new tech graduates and retiring lawyers fluctuate, but those with considerable capital have fared well during the economic recovery. The 1% tends to be resilient, particularly during bad times, according to economists. A study found that a quarter to a third of individuals in the 1% in a given year remained in that bracket for the following five years. As a result, the profile of wealth in the United States has remained relatively unchanged before and after the recession. The typical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white, and male. Warren E. Buffett exemplifies this profile, with his net worth increasing by approximately $10 billion over the past year. The tech industry has created hundreds of new top earners, mostly men. David Duffield of Workday and Elon Musk of Tesla, among others, have benefited from the tech boom. Meanwhile, fields like finance, medicine, and energy continue to generate significant wealth. Three interconnected economic phenomena have driven the boomerang effect among the country's top earners. The rich suffered significant losses when the markets plummeted, but those who held on or invested after then have been rewarded. The recent market gains have boosted the earnings and net worth of Americans who own stocks. The wealthy have benefited significantly more. The top 10% of households hold more than 80% of the value of stocks. In addition to capital gains, shareholders have also benefited from the surge in dividend payments. Many companies paid out large dividends before taxes on unearned income increased. Wealthier Americans tend to have a smaller portion of their net worth tied up in their homes. After prices dropped and credit markets relaxed, many of them were able to purchase homes as investments.",

In response, businesses have drastically reduced capital expenditures, including computers, delivery trucks, and equipment, largely due to concerns over higher tax rates and government austerity measures. However, some economists believe that businesses will increase spending if Congress provides clarity on fiscal policy, significantly reducing the risk of severe contraction. Businesses need a list of projects they'd like to pursue, but have been delaying due to uncertainty. Once they have a clearer understanding of the future, including tax rates, they'll be able to revive those plans and implement them. Enhanced access to credit can make capital expenditures more appealing and accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been increasing in recent months, and the share of small business owners struggling to meet their credit needs has been declining. Corporate profits reached a record high in the third quarter, adjusted for inflation, and companies have accumulated significant cash reserves that can be used to invest in equipment or hire staff if they feel confident about the recovery. In contrast, consumers are still not financially stable, particularly since their disposable income has been stagnant or declining in recent months. However, consumers have made significant progress in reducing their debt, either by paying it down or having it written off through default, and they are also feeling more affluent due to the stabilization of the housing market. The country has finally cleared the excess housing inventory from the bubble years, and housing prices and construction are now on the rise. The pace of household formation is increasing, as young adults are finally moving into their own homes, as well as other Americans who had previously lived with family or friends. Eventually, young people can only live with their parents for so long.
