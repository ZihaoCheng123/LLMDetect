An elite who stick together, 30 January). Rather, she argues that by focusing on the systemic inequalities that create and perpetuate privilege, we can effect meaningful change. Orr's critique is timely, as the UK's political discourse continues to devolve into petty name-calling and class-based posturing. Meanwhile, the issues that truly matter - such as wealth disparities, access to education and healthcare, and the erosion of public services - are left to simmer. As Orr so astutely notes, by targeting the symptoms rather than the disease, we risk perpetuating a cycle of resentment and division. It's time to shift the conversation towards tangible solutions and a more inclusive society.",

Its outgoing chairman, Terry Burns, fought a staunch fight, but HMG declined to extend his tenure. So here comes a replacement, Charles Gurassa, deputy chairman of easyJet, among many other things. The C4 board is hardly in a position to complain, but what talents does Gurassa, a former director of leisure services at BA and veteran of travel trading, bring to the wobbly table? Huge experience? Almost obscenely commodious experience, in fact. in fact. Gurassa's CV is a veritable who's who of the airline industry, with stints at British Airways, easyJet, and even a brief dalliance with the low-cost carrier, Ryanair. But what does this mean for the Channel 4 board, already reeling from the loss of its chairman? Some insiders are whispering that Gurassa's arrival is a calculated move to \"streamline\" the organization, a euphemism for cutting costs and increasing profits. Others are more optimistic, suggesting that his extensive experience in the travel industry could bring much-needed stability to the beleaguered broadcaster. As the dust settles, one thing is clear: the future of Channel 4 is about to take a dramatic turn, and only time will tell if Gurassa's appointment is a blessing or a curse.",

        "Text": "It would be easy to think that the worst is over, at least for the time being. Watching world stock markets rally after the Bank of Japan cut interest rates gave a sense of relief to many in the financial community. Oil prices, which slumped to just $27 (£19) a barrel a fortnight ago, stood at $34, up 40 cents on the day. Yet the reverse is true. If anything, investors are worried that governments and central banks have failed to realise how weak the global economy still is, seven years after the crash. Dangerous levels of private debt in China, bad debts lurking in Europe's banking system, nervous consumers everywhere: it's a nuclear device that needs careful handling. When a central bank shows that it understands cheap money – in the form of lower interest rates – is a necessary underpinning for investment and growth, investors cheer. When central bankers talk about a world that is healing and should be ready for higher debt costs, they panic. And no wonder, when the smallest possible rise in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve last month – from 0.25% to 0.5% – appeared to send American consumers running home to stash their savings in a piggy bank. New car sales were down in December and consumer sentiment dipped in January after a weak last quarter when, according to the Fed, a rate rise would be largely ignored by a US consumer as resilient as Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator. The interest rate cut by the Japanese central bank is another signal of global weakness. Tokyo wants to generate some domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and the decision to follow the European Central Bank with a negative interest rate, effectively a charge on deposits, is designed to deter foreign funds from coming to Japan, driving down the currency, and encouraging domestic businesses and consumers to spend not save. It did the trick. The question on everyone's mind is: what's next? Will the global economy continue to stumble along, or will the central banks' efforts to stimulate growth finally start to bear fruit? The answer lies in the delicate balance between inflation and deflation. If inflation rises too quickly, it could spark a vicious cycle of price increases, eroding purchasing power and reducing consumer confidence. On the other hand, if deflation sets in, it could lead to a credit crunch, as businesses and consumers delay spending and investment in anticipation of lower prices. The challenge for policymakers is to find the sweet spot, where growth is robust enough to generate jobs and incomes, but not so strong that it unleashes inflation. It's a tightrope act, and one that requires careful calibration of monetary and fiscal policy. The world is watching with bated breath to see if the central banks can get it right.",

Directors were expected to meet this week to sign off on a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. A final decision has been on the cards since October, when China's state nuclear firm CGN announced that it would take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by the premier, Xi Jinping. But executives at state-owned EDF, which owns the rest of the project, have delayed a final decision amid funding problems, according to French financial journal Les Echos. It said EDF was putting pressure on the French government to help find new backers to come on board alongside CGN. While directors are due to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, Les Echos reported, no decision will be made until the next board meeting, which will happen before final results are released on 15 February. The uncertainty surrounding the Hinkley Point project has raised concerns among investors and industry experts, who are worried that the delays could have a knock-on effect on the UK's energy security. The project, which was initially expected to be completed by 2025, is already several years behind schedule. The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has warned that the country's power supplies are at risk of becoming strained in the coming years, and the delay to Hinkley Point is unlikely to ease those concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the French government has denied reports that it is planning to inject emergency funding into EDF to help the company meet its financial obligations. A spokesperson for the French energy ministry said that any claims of a bailout were \"completely unfounded\" and that the government was committed to supporting the project through \"normal\" financing channels. The UK government has also sought to downplay the significance of the delays, saying that it is confident that the project will eventually get back on track. However, many experts believe that the delays will ultimately lead to a significant increase in the project's costs, which could have far-reaching implications for the UK's energy landscape.",

Frances Russell, who left M&S last year, would be a big-name hire for Amazon as it looks to build its credibility in clothing.

Haji-Ioannou, who has also been a longstanding critic of management at the EasyJet airline he founded, called a general meeting to immediately dismiss Fastjet's chief executive, Ed Winter, and remove another director, Krista Bates, from the main board, citing concerns over costs. Winter last month announced he would step down as chief executive, pending a successor being found, but a spokesman for Haji-Ioannou, who owns a 12% stake and helped set up the Tanzania-based airline, said it was time for a \"clean break\". In a letter to Fastjet's chairman, the EasyGroup boss claimed: \"The company has a ridiculously high cost base ... Winter has burnt some £80m in the last 3 years. We believe the company will run out of cash sometime in 2016. We now have about six months left to steady this ship. Time is of the essence.\" The letter, seen by The Telegraph, also accused the management of Fastjet of lacking transparency and accountability, and claimed that the airline's financial performance was \"deteriorating rapidly\". Haji-Ioannou, who is also the founder of EasyJet, said that he had been a long-standing critic of the management at Fastjet and had repeatedly warned of the airline's financial woes. He claimed that the airline's high cost base and lack of transparency had led to a decline in its financial performance, and that it was now on the brink of running out of cash.

In recently submitted filings before the Australian Competition Tribunal, Glencore Coal complained that increased fees to enter the newly privatised Newcastle port, which produces more than 170m tonnes of saleable coal a year, will \"materially impact on the profit margins of coal producers\". The challenge comes amid diminished share prices for the multinational company and job cuts in its zinc production operations around the world. Their challenge followed the New South Wales's government decision to privatise the Newcastle port as part of a joint venture between Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants. The venture quickly increased port fees by between 40 per cent and 60 per cent for vessels to access the shipping channel. The appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal concerns a decision by the then acting treasurer, Mathias Cormann, in 2015 when he ruled out \"declaring\" the port's fees. Had Cormann ruled in Glencore's favour, this would have allowed it to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration and potentially allow Glencore to push for the port fees to be lowered. Although the tribunal battle will focus on technical issues surrounding competition laws, it touches on two critical policy areas for the Australian government; the privatisation of state assets and concerns about price increases, and the long-term viability of coalmining ventures in Australia. The Australian government has been under pressure to address concerns about the impact of privatisation on essential services and infrastructure, and the Newcastle port dispute has become a focal point for these debates. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has already called for the government to intervene and cap the port fees, citing the potential job losses and economic instability that could result from increased costs for coal producers. Meanwhile, environmental groups have seized on the opportunity to highlight the role of coal mining in Australia's carbon emissions and the need for a transition to cleaner energy sources. As the dispute unfolds, it remains to be seen whether the Australian government will take a stronger stance on behalf of the coal industry or prioritize its commitments to reducing emissions and promoting sustainable development. The outcome could have significant implications for the future of coal mining in Australia and the country's broader economic and environmental policies.",

The group, which consists of Iberia, Vueling and the recent addition of Aer Lingus as well as BA, said it expected to drive up operating profits by about another €1bn in 2016. Chief executive Willie Walsh said the results far exceeded the targets originally set in 2011 when BA merged with Iberia.

The number of members attending in-person meetings has dipped below one million. At the end of the fourth quarter, about 997,900 members attended meetings compared to 1.2 million in December 2013. Another 1.39 million people subscribed to Weight Watchers online program, down from 1.74 million in December 2013. Fourth quarter revenues were $259.2m. Despite the declining membership figures, Weight Watchers CEO Jim Chambers remained optimistic about the weight-loss program's future. \"With the launch of Beyond the Scale and SmartPoints earlier this winter, we introduced an entirely new Weight Watchers program, which is resonating with consumers,\" he said in a statement. \"The partnership with Oprah Winfrey is off to a strong start. Our transformation momentum is building, with positive recruitments this winter season setting a solid foundation for revenue growth and increased profitability.\" After Weight Watchers announced its partnership with Winfrey, she announced \"in her own words\" why she joined its program. Chambers said her announcement was \"direct and emotional\" and that Winfrey connected with members and non-members. He also pointed out that Winfrey has shared updates and anecdotes on social media. The company's efforts to revamp its program and attract new members with the help of Oprah Winfrey's endorsement seem to be paying off. According to Chambers, the partnership has brought in a significant number of new recruits, which he believes will set the stage for revenue growth and increased profitability in the coming quarters. Weight Watchers has also seen an increase in engagement on social media, with members and non-members alike sharing their weight loss journeys and success stories.\n\nThe company's new program, Beyond the Scale, which focuses on overall wellness and health rather than just weight loss, has been well-received by members, with many reporting positive results and increased motivation to continue their weight loss journey. Additionally, the SmartPoints system, which assigns a point value to foods based on their nutritional content, has been praised for its simplicity and ease of use.\n\nWhile the company still has a long way to go to regain its former membership numbers, the signs are encouraging, and investors are cautiously optimistic about Weight Watchers' future prospects. As the company continues to evolve and adapt to changing consumer preferences and behaviors, it's likely that we'll see further improvements in its performance and a continued commitment to helping people achieve their weight loss goals.",

The annual ITV coverage of the British Phonographic Industry's awards show was watched by an average audience of 5.8 million, a 27.5% share of all TV viewing between 8pm and 10.20pm on Wednesday night. The show, which was hosted by Ant and Dec for the second year, matched the popularity of last year's event, which was notable for Madonna falling down a flight of stairs. A major promotion of the event by Twitter helped fuel 7.5 million tweets about the show. The tweets generated a significant amount of buzz around the performances, with Adele's emotional rendition of \"When We Were Young\" being particularly well-received. The singer's powerful vocals and poignant lyrics resonated with fans, who took to Twitter to express their admiration. Meanwhile, Rihanna's high-energy performance of \"Work\" and \"Needed Me\" got fans dancing and singing along, with many praising her impressive vocal range and stage presence. The tribute to David Bowie, which featured a medley of his hits performed by various artists, also sparked a flood of tributes and condolences on social media. The event's popularity was a testament to the enduring appeal of live music and the power of social media to amplify the excitement and emotion of a live event.",

The company has published research into the most popular professions on its service in terms of how often those users get swiped right – approved as a potential match. For men, pilots are the most right-swiped jobs, followed by founder/entrepreneurs, firefighters, doctors and TV/radio personalities. The comparable women's chart is topped by physical therapists, followed by interior designers, founder/entrepreneurs, PR/communications workers and teachers. Lower down the list, models rank eighth in the males chart and tenth in the females chart – in the latter case, just one place ahead of dental hygienists – sparkling teeth are clearly an asset for Tinder's photo-based matchmaking. Tinder is also keen to stress its popularity among students, with college student the tenth most right-swiped profession for men and sixth for women. The dating app's initial growth, like social networks including Facebook before it, came from universities in the US. The study was based on US users of Tinder. The company added the ability for users to add their professions and education to their profiles in November 2015, although for now both remain optional. The company is nudging users to flesh out its data on them by promising that adding a profession \"increases your chances of receiving a right swipe\". The research also found that certain industries are more likely to attract matches on Tinder, with finance and law professionals being among the most popular. In fact, investment bankers and lawyers are among the top 10 most right-swiped jobs for both men and women. Meanwhile, those in the creative fields, such as graphic designers and artists, are less likely to get matches. The study suggests that this may be because these professions are often seen as more niche or unconventional, making it harder for users to find compatible matches. Tinder's findings also highlight the importance of education in online dating, with college graduates being more likely to get matches than those without a degree. The company is now using this data to inform its marketing and advertising strategies, with plans to target specific professions and industries in its promotional campaigns.",

Melody Madill, a student in Dunedin, was Skyping her fiancée, Anna Messner, on Tuesday afternoon when she started having a seizure. However, Messner was powerless to help because she was in the US. \"I was terrified,\" said Messner. \"I had never seen her twitch and flail so violently, or her mouth to froth and her lips turned blue.\" Messner called US emergency number 911 to get help for Madill, but was told they could not assist with overseas medical emergencies. \"I tried to get her to respond or turn her head so she wouldn't choke. At this point I was screaming, begging her to stay with me,\" said Messner, who met Madill online. Desperate, Messner took to online forum Reddit, appealing for someone in New Zealand to phone for an ambulance.

Madill was eventually rushed to the hospital, where she received treatment for her seizure.\n\nThe Reddit community's quick response was hailed as a lifesaver by Messner, who was overjoyed to learn that Madill was receiving medical attention. \"I was so relieved and grateful,\" she said. \"I couldn't have done it without the help of those amazing people on Reddit.\"\n\nMadill, who is still recovering from her seizure, thanked the Reddit community for their kindness and support. \"I'm just grateful to be alive,\" she said. \"I don't know what would have happened if those kind strangers hadn't stepped in to help.\"\n\nThe incident has highlighted the power of online communities and the importance of kindness and compassion.

Marketed as \"a vacant front basement suitable for redevelopment\", this was one for investors willing to take a risk on getting the right planning consents. Prospective buyers were told, \"There will be no internal viewings due to lack of access (excavation required)\". The leasehold for the basement space below flats in New Eltham, south London, was up for sale with the Auction House at a guide price of £25,000. Despite the daunting task of excavating the property, several bidders were willing to take on the challenge. In the end, a local property developer emerged as the winner, snapping up the basement space for £30,000, exceeding the guide price.\n\nThe developer, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed excitement about the opportunity to transform the space into a unique residential property. \"It's a blank canvas, and we see huge potential for a stunning renovation,\" they said. \"We're planning to create a spacious one-bedroom apartment with high ceilings and plenty of natural light.\"\n\nThe sale has sparked interest among other developers and investors, who are now considering similar opportunities in the area. The Auction House, which handled the sale, reported a surge in inquiries about basement properties in the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nThe sale also highlights the growing trend of basement development in London, where many homeowners are opting to convert their underused spaces into functional living areas. With the city's property market remaining competitive, innovative solutions like this are becoming increasingly attractive to investors and developers.\n\nAs the developer begins their excavation and renovation work, the community is eagerly anticipating the transformation of the New Eltham basement into a beautiful and functional living space.

The new 25p weekday newspaper, which is set to launch on Monday, could have a print run of perhaps as many as 2 million but Scotland is set to receive only a few thousand of those. One newspaper industry source says that the figure being touted is about 1,000 copies. A second source believes about 3,000 will go out in Edinburgh on the first day on Monday, when it will be free; then from Tuesday, when it will be priced at 25p for two weeks, about 2,000 will be made available. Despite the limited print run, Trinity Mirror is confident that the New Day will be a success in Scotland. A spokesperson for the company said, \"We're excited to bring this new title to Scotland and believe it will resonate with readers. While the initial print run may be smaller than some other national newspapers, we're committed to making sure that Scots have access to the news and stories that matter to them.\"\n\nHowever, some industry experts have expressed surprise at the limited print run for Scotland. \"It's unusual for a national newspaper to have such a small print run for a region with a population of over 5 million people,\" said one media analyst. \"You would expect a bigger allocation of copies for Scotland, especially given the country's strong media market.\"\n\nThe New Day's editor, Paul Preston, defended the decision, saying that the paper's focus on \"news, opinion and conversation\" will appeal to Scots. \"We're not just about circulation numbers, we're about creating a paper that people want to read and engage with,\" he said. \"We're confident that Scots will love the New Day and that it will become a staple of their daily reading routine.\"\n\nDespite the limited availability, many Scots are already showing interest in the New Day. Several bookstores and newsagents in Edinburgh have reported receiving advance orders for the paper, and some have even offered to reserve copies for customers. With its unique blend of news, features and opinion, the New Day is set to shake up the Scottish media landscape. Whether it will be able to make a significant impact remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - Scots will be eager to get their hands on a copy.",

The broadcaster would benefit from more direct ownership by the people who pay for it, rather than the current system, which allows for too much government interference, Labour's Gareth Thomas and Tory MP Steve Baker said. \"The BBC is a 'public service' broadcaster,\" Thomas and Baker wrote in a letter to the Times. \"It operates under a royal charter, agreed between it and the government, is governed by a trust of the great and good appointed by ministers, and is funded by the licence fee payers. But who, exactly, owns it? And to whom is it accountable, not least over the expenditure of more than £3bn of our money? \"The current structure, where the BBC is governed by a trust and accountable to the government, creates a lack of transparency and accountability,\" the MPs argued. \"By making the BBC a mutual organisation, licence fee payers would have a direct say in how the broadcaster is run and would be able to hold the board accountable for its decisions.\"\n\nThomas and Baker pointed out that many successful businesses, such as John Lewis and the Co-operative Bank, operate as mutuals, where members have a stake in the company and a say in its direction. \"This model has been proven to work well in other sectors, and we believe it would be a major improvement for the BBC,\" they said.\n\nThe MPs also suggested that the BBC's board should be elected by licence fee payers, rather than being appointed by the government or a trust. \"This would ensure that the board is accountable to the people who pay for the BBC, rather than just to the government,\" they said.\n\nThomas and Baker's proposal has been met with a mixed response from industry experts.

Would it be a representative system, or would each licence fee payer get a vote? These are important questions that need to be answered.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Thomas and Baker remain convinced that their proposal is worth exploring. \"The BBC is a vital part of our national life, and it's only right that those who pay for it have a say in how it's run,\" they said. \"We believe that our proposal could be a major step forward in making the BBC more accountable and transparent, and we urge the government to give it serious consideration.\"",

Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, who had teamed up for an earlier group submission, were joined for the first time by Apple, which had previously insisted on going it alone in its efforts to lobby the British parliament. In evidence submitted to the public bill committee, which will examine the legislation before it comes to a vote in the House of Commons, the six firms criticise the IP bill for its attempts to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction. This would allow Britain to force companies to comply even if they aren't based in the UK. The technology firms also expressed concerns over the bill's broad definitions of \"communications data\" and \"internet connection records\", which they argue could lead to the collection of sensitive information about individuals. They warned that this could have a chilling effect on free speech and online expression, as well as compromise the security of users' personal data.\n\nIn their submission, the companies called for the bill to be amended to ensure that any data requests are subject to rigorous safeguards and oversight. They also urged the government to provide more transparency and accountability around the use of these powers, including regular reporting on the number of requests made and the data collected.\n\nThe firms also highlighted the need for the bill to respect international human rights law and to ensure that it does not create a precedent for other countries to follow. They noted that the bill's extraterritorial jurisdiction could have implications for companies operating in countries with weaker data protection laws, and could potentially lead to the erosion of fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nThe submission was seen as a significant development in the debate over the Investigatory Powers bill, which has been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism from civil liberties groups and some politicians. The bill has been described as a \"snooper's charter\" by its opponents, who argue that it represents a significant threat to privacy and civil liberties.\n\nThe government has defended the bill, arguing that it is necessary to combat terrorism and serious crime. However, the opposition has argued that the bill goes too far and could lead to the collection of sensitive information about innocent people.\n\nThe public bill committee is expected to continue its examination of the bill next week, and it is expected to report back to the House of Commons in the coming weeks.

        "Text": "Two New York Times employees are suing the newspaper, citing \"an environment rife with discrimination based on age, race, and gender\". The class action lawsuit comes the same week that Curt Schilling accused ESPN of a culture of racism. Schilling was recently fired from his role as a commentator at the sports channel after making transphobic comments on Facebook. Racism in the media is often linked to a lack of diversity within the industry. And accusations that the workforce in US media doesn't represent the population are nothing new. In 1968, analyzing protests about the treatment of racial minorities, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders claimed that \"the media report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world\", adding \"fewer than 5% of the people employed by the news business in editorial jobs in the United States today are Negroes.\" That figure has barely changed. In 2015, 4.7% of newsroom employees were African American according to statistics from the American Society of News Editors (ASNE). This points to significant under-representation given that 13.2% of the US population are African American (according to 2014 population estimates from the Census Bureau). Despite the lack of diversity in the industry, many media outlets have made efforts to increase representation in recent years. For example, The New York Times has implemented initiatives to attract and retain a more diverse workforce, including a program to hire and train more minority journalists. However, these efforts may not be enough to combat the deep-seated issues of discrimination and bias that persist within the industry.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by the two New York Times employees claims that the newspaper has a \"pattern and practice of age, race, and gender discrimination\" that has led to a hostile work environment. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and an injunction to require the newspaper to implement policies to prevent discrimination.\n\nThe allegations come at a time when the media is under scrutiny for its handling of diversity and inclusion. The firing of Curt Schilling from ESPN has sparked a wider conversation about racism and bias in the media, and the need for greater representation and inclusion.\n\nExperts say that the lack of diversity in the media is not only a moral issue, but also a practical one. A workforce that is representative of the population can lead to more accurate and nuanced reporting, and a better understanding of the issues that affect different communities.\n\n\"It's not just about being fair or being right, it's about being good journalists,\" said Dr. Monica Bielski, a media studies professor at the University of Maryland. \"When you have a diverse workforce, you're more likely to get a diverse range of perspectives and ideas, which leads to better reporting and more accurate representation of the communities you're covering.\"\n\nThe lawsuit against The New York Times is just one example of the ongoing struggle to address discrimination and bias in the media. As the industry continues to evolve, it is clear that greater efforts will be needed to create a more inclusive and representative workforce.",

Australia and the rest of the world have been reeling from a string of temperature records being smashed. February caused alarm when it was the most unusually warm month on record by a huge margin. But that record was broken immediately by March. In Australia March 2016 was the warmest March on record. And this week the Bureau Of Meteorology released its seasonal outlook, showing above average temperatures are set to continue across the country at least throughout May. The scientists warn that the prolonged heatwave is not just a temporary anomaly, but a stark indication of the devastating impacts of climate change. \"This is not just a matter of unusual weather patterns, it's a clear sign of the fundamental shift in our planet's climate system,\" said Dr. Emma Smith, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne. \"The fact that we're seeing record-breaking temperatures month after month is a red flag that we're heading towards a catastrophic future if we don't take immediate action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook also predicts that the dry conditions that have plagued much of the country will continue, exacerbating the risk of bushfires and drought. \"We're seeing a perfect storm of conditions that are ripe for disaster,\" said Mark Dwyer, a meteorologist at the Bureau. \"The prolonged heatwave is drying out the landscape, making it more susceptible to fire and creating a perfect environment for catastrophic bushfires.\"\n\nThe Australian government has been criticized for its lack of action on climate change, with many experts calling for more ambitious targets to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy. \"The government's inaction on climate change is a recipe for disaster,\" said Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young. \"We need to take immediate action to reduce our emissions and transition to a clean energy economy. The future of our country depends on it.\"",

Pacheco, who reported for several newspapers and broadcast for a radio station, was murdered in the city of Taxco, Guerrero state. Relatives said he was shot twice in the back of his head when he returned home in the early morning after taking one of his daughters to a bus terminal. Another daughter told the CPJ that she and her mother were in their home at the time of the attack. They heard noises that sounded like firecrackers and found Pacheco in a pool of blood. Police said there were no witnesses to the murder. The motive behind Pacheco's murder is still unclear, but the CPJ has expressed concern over the increasing number of attacks on journalists in Mexico. The organization has documented at least 15 killings of journalists in the country since 2017, many of which remain unsolved.\n\nPacheco's family and colleagues are devastated by his death, and are calling for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his murder. \"Francisco was a talented journalist who was dedicated to his work and his community,\" said a statement from the radio station where he worked. \"His death is a tragic loss for all of us who knew him.\"\n\nThe killing of Pacheco comes at a time of heightened tension in Mexico, where journalists have faced increasing threats and intimidation from organized crime groups and corrupt government officials. The government has promised to take steps to protect journalists, but many say more needs to be done to ensure their safety. The CPJ has called on the Mexican authorities to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation into Pacheco's murder, and to bring those responsible to justice.",

Tech companies making self-driving cars could become better protected under the law than those car's owners, experts warn, as the announcement came of a powerful new coalition of automakers and big tech companies forming to take on US government regulations around self-driving vehicles. Google, Uber, Lyft, Ford and Volvo, all of which are working on self-driving car technology, will lobby as the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets to bring autonomous vehicles to the road across the US. Heading it up will be David Strickland, the former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Administration, the same group he will now be working to influence. The lobbying group argues that self-driving vehicles will reduce the severity and frequency of crashes. As the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets prepares to make its case to lawmakers, experts are sounding the alarm about the potential consequences for consumers. \"The tech companies are trying to shift the liability to the owner of the vehicle, which is a huge risk for consumers,\" said Dr. Rachel Lee, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"If there's an accident, the owner of the vehicle may be held liable, even if it's not their fault. This could lead to a huge financial burden on individuals.\"\n\nThe coalition's argument that self-driving vehicles will reduce crashes may be persuasive, but experts say it's not a guarantee. \"We've seen autonomous vehicles fail in simulations and real-world tests, and there's still a lot we don't know about how they'll perform in different scenarios,\" said Dr. Lee. \"The technology is still in its infancy, and it's reckless to assume that these vehicles will be completely safe.\"\n\nThe coalition's efforts to influence regulations are likely to be met with resistance from consumer advocacy groups, which are already sounding the alarm about the potential risks of self-driving vehicles. \"We're concerned that the tech companies are prioritizing profits over people's safety,\" said Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety. \"We need to make sure that any regulations put in place prioritize the safety and well-being of consumers, not just the interests of the tech companies.\"\n\nAs the debate over self-driving vehicles continues to unfold, experts say it's crucial that consumers are aware of the potential risks and liabilities involved. \"Consumers need to be informed about the technology and the potential consequences of using self-driving vehicles,\" said Dr. Lee. \"They need to be aware that they may be held liable for accidents, and that the tech companies may not be held accountable for their mistakes.\"\n\nThe Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets is expected to begin lobbying lawmakers in the coming weeks, as the debate over self-driving vehicles heats up in Washington. As the stakes grow higher, consumers are left wondering: who will be held accountable if something goes wrong?",

The funding is in place. There is support for this potential transaction,\" Diamond told investors in the London-listed African based bank, Atlas Mara, which he formed after being forced out of Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis in 2012. Diamond's involvement in the consortium, which includes the private equity firm Carlyle, was revealed in a stock market announcement by Atlas Mara after days of speculation about his interest in trying to buy shares in Barclays' African business. Barclays will face questions about its plans to reduce its 62.3% stake in Barclays Africa - which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange and has interests in banks across the African continent - when it publishes its first quarter results on Wednesday. Diamond did not provide details about the size of any offer for the Barclays African operations, but he is expected to need to raise around $5bn (£3.5bn). The bid is expected to be a complex and potentially lengthy process, with Barclays' board of directors required to consider the proposal and decide whether to accept it. Industry insiders suggest that the consortium may need to provide significant concessions to persuade Barclays to sell its African operations, including a potential reduction in the price tag. \"Barclays is not going to give up its African business without a fight,\" said one source close to the matter. \"The consortium will need to be prepared to make some significant concessions to get the deal done.\" The sale of Barclays' African operations would mark a significant shift in the bank's strategy, as it seeks to focus on its core UK and European businesses. The move would also be a major coup for Diamond, who has been seeking to re-establish himself as a major player in the banking industry since his departure from Barclays in 2012. Atlas Mara, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, has been growing rapidly in recent years and has a strong presence in Africa. The company has a market capitalization of around £1.5 billion and has interests in banks across the continent, including a majority stake in Zimbabwe's BancABC. The consortium's bid for Barclays' African operations is expected to be announced in the coming weeks, with the deal potentially being completed later this year.",

The app will make it easy for users to jump between still photography, video recording and live video streaming, all presented through a Snapchat-style camera-first view, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Although it only in the early stages of development and may not even see launch, the app is intended to combat a decline in personal image and video sharing on the site, as well as prompt greater uptake of the company's Live Video feature. It follows three previous attempts by Facebook to make standalone camera apps. Two of them, Poke and Slingshot, were broadly based on Snapchat, while the third, simply called Camera, was an attempt by Facebook to steal Instagram's thunder. In the end, Facebook bought Instagram for $1bn (£686m), just a month before Camera was launched in May 2012, and the app was quietly shut down. Later in the year, Facebook made a similar attempt to undercut Snapchat, then a plucky rival best known as a \"sexting app\". Facebook released Poke, a fairly transparent clone of Snapchat's key feature of ephemeral picture messaging, and Mark Zuckerberg boasted about having developed it in just 12 days. The new app, codenamed \"Libra\", is expected to have a more streamlined design and user interface compared to Facebook's previous attempts. It will also integrate with Facebook's existing features, such as filters and effects, and allow users to share their content directly to the social network. The app is still in its early stages of development, and it's unclear whether it will be launched publicly or remain an internal testing project. However, if successful, it could potentially revitalize Facebook's stagnant photo and video sharing features and give the company a much-needed boost in the competitive social media landscape.",

The calls came as the work and pensions select committee confirmed it will investigate how the BHS pension scheme, which has a deficit of £571m, will affect the state-backed Pension Protection Scheme (PPF). Frank Field, the chairman of the committee, said he plans to call Green to face MPs as part of the investigation. BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk and the PFF is set to take on the company's pension scheme. There was further bad news for the retail sector on Tuesday as clothing retailer Austin Reed also collapsed into administration, threatening more than 1,000 jobs. Green and Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from the billionaire tycoon for £1 in March 2015, are facing questions about their management of the retailer. The Guardian has calculated that Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. The investigation into the collapse of BHS is expected to be a thorough and lengthy one, with Frank Field warning that the committee will leave no stone unturned in its pursuit of the truth. \"We will be looking at every aspect of BHS's collapse, including the role of Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell in the company's demise,\" he said. \"We will also be examining the role of the Pension Protection Scheme and how it will affect the thousands of workers who are facing uncertainty about their pensions.\"\n\nThe news of the investigation comes as the retail sector continues to struggle, with the collapse of Austin Reed adding to the growing list of high street names that have gone under in recent months. The British Retail Consortium has warned that the sector is facing its toughest trading conditions in decades, with many retailers struggling to stay afloat in the face of rising costs and declining consumer spending.\n\nSir Philip Green has faced criticism in the past for his management of BHS, with some accusing him of prioritizing dividends and profits over the welfare of the company's employees.

He has been accused of failing to invest in the business and of prioritizing his own interests over those of the company's employees.\n\nThe collapse of BHS and Austin Reed is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the retail sector, and the need for companies to adapt to changing consumer habits and trading conditions. As the investigation into BHS's collapse continues, many are hoping that it will lead to greater transparency and accountability in the industry, and that it will ultimately benefit the thousands of workers who are facing uncertainty about their futures.",

Total lending rose to £17.1bn, 64% higher than the same month a year ago, and the highest figure since April 2008, according to the British Bankers Association. Buyers frantically closed property deals ahead of the introduction of a 3% hike in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second homes that began in April. Remortgaging by existing home owners also leapt, with households taking advantage of cheap mortgage deal amid the widespread belief that interest rates will stay low for an extended period of time. The average mortgage loan taken out reached a record high, hitting £184,200, compared to £158,000 at the peak of the previous lending cycle in April 2008. But the bank lending figures reveal an increasingly lop-sided financial picture, with borrowing by manufacturers for investment falling sharply while borrowing for buy-to-let speculation has boomed. Lending to manufacturing companies, which had been growing at an annual rate of 12% in 2014, has fallen back to zero, while in construction it is falling. Meanwhile, personal borrowing on credit cards continues to rise. British households made 223m purchases on their credit cards in March, with a total value of £12.6bn. But while the volume of purchases increased by 2%, the value fell by 1% compared to the same month last year. Mortgage brokers said they are preparing for a steep decline in lending during April. As the stamp duty deadline passed, mortgage brokers are bracing themselves for a significant slowdown in lending activity. Many are predicting a sharp decline in mortgage applications and approvals in April, as the rush to beat the deadline has subsided.\n\n\"We're expecting a significant drop in lending in April, as the initial rush of buy-to-let and second home buyers has passed,\" said John Taylor, a mortgage broker at Taylor & Taylor. \"We're already seeing a decrease in inquiries and applications, as people have either already completed their purchases or have decided to wait and see how the market evolves.\"\n\nThe British Bankers Association has also warned that the surge in lending in March may not be sustainable in the long term. \"While it's encouraging to see lending activity picking up, we need to be cautious and not get too carried away,\" said a spokesperson. \"The market is still fragile, and we need to ensure that lending is sustainable and not fueled by speculation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's major banks are also taking a closer look at their lending practices, amid concerns that the surge in buy-to-let lending could be exacerbating the country's housing market bubble. The Bank of England has already raised concerns about the impact of buy-to-let lending on the market, and some banks are now reviewing their lending criteria to ensure that they are not fueling speculation.\n\nDespite the concerns, many mortgage brokers remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the housing market. \"While the surge in lending in March may have been driven by speculation, we believe that the fundamentals of the market remain strong,\" said Simon Jones, a mortgage broker at Jones & Jones. \"We're seeing a lot of interest from first-time buyers and families looking to upgrade, and we're confident that the market will continue to grow, albeit at a more sustainable pace.\"",

The Centre for Cities said George Osborne's plan to bridge the economic gap between the wealthier south and the poorer north was too heavily focused on intercity transport links, and not enough on improving the performance of individual cities. The HS3 rail link proposal to speed up east-west connections between the major northern cities is a key part of the government's plan to redress the UK's economic imbalances. According to the Centre for Cities, the government's plan to create a \"northern powerhouse\" relies too heavily on infrastructure projects, such as the HS3 rail link, to drive economic growth in the north. While the thinktank acknowledges that better transport links are important, it argues that more needs to be done to improve the productivity of individual cities.\n\nThe Centre for Cities has identified several areas where cities in the north could improve their productivity, including by investing in skills and education, supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, and promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. The thinktank also suggests that cities could learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and share best practices to drive growth and prosperity.\n\nThe Centre for Cities' report comes as the government prepares to unveil its long-awaited Northern Powerhouse Strategy, which is expected to include a range of measures to boost economic growth in the north. The strategy is seen as a key part of the government's plan to rebalance the UK's economy, which has long been dominated by the south.\n\nHowever, the Centre for Cities' report is not the only criticism of the government's plan. Some have argued that the HS3 rail link is too expensive and will not deliver the promised economic benefits. Others have questioned the government's assumption that the north is a single, homogenous region, and argue that different parts of the north have different economic needs and priorities.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the government remains committed to its vision of a \"northern powerhouse\". Chancellor George Osborne has described the plan as a \"once-in-a-generation\" opportunity to transform the north's economy, and has pledged to work closely with local authorities and businesses to deliver the strategy.\n\nThe Centre for Cities' report is likely to add to the debate about the best way to drive economic growth in the north. While the thinktank's recommendations are likely to be welcomed by some, others may argue that the government's plan is the right one, and that the north will benefit from the investment in infrastructure and other measures.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the debate is likely to continue, with many stakeholders eager to see the government's Northern Powerhouse Strategy in action. The strategy is expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks, and will be closely watched by businesses, politicians, and economists across the north.",

He admitted Green had not given a written guarantee that he could secure credit insurance but claimed it had been verbally promised. Chappell's comments are the latest salvo in a long-running battle between the two former owners of BHS. Green has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has blamed Chappell for the company's demise.

It is not clear if Walden will stay on if Sainsbury's finalises the £1.4bn takeover deal, but Home Retail Group's annual report published on Tuesday revealed that in either case the chief executive would be able to cash in more than 650,000 shares and options, which are not subject to performance conditions. Under the terms of Sainsbury's takeover deal – which offers 0.321 Sainsbury's shares and 55p in cash for every Home Retail Group share as well as a 25p windfall from the sale of the Homebase chain and a 2.8p dividend, that would be worth £1m. Walden's windfall could potentially be more than double that after he was awarded 785,000 shares and share options in May last year, which are subject to three-year performance criteria and worth £1.3m, and 143,000 which he received this year. He could also potentially cash in up to 1.4m more share options – which are due to vest if he meets performance criteria over the next two years – worth up to £2.3m. Home Retail's remuneration committee said it had not yet determined what would happen with bonuses and share awards linked to performance targets beyond the date of any takeover. If he left the business, Walden would also be in line for a payout of at least £676,500; his basic annual salary after a 2% pay rise. Walden's potential windfall would be one of the largest payouts to a UK CEO in recent years. The exact timing and nature of his departure, if it happens, would depend on the outcome of the takeover negotiations and the terms of any agreement reached between Sainsbury's and Home Retail Group.\n\nIndustry experts say that Walden's payout is a reflection of the company's strong financial performance under his leadership, which has seen Home Retail Group's shares rise significantly over the past year. \"Walden has done a great job in turning around the business, and this payout is a testament to his hard work and dedication,\" said one analyst.\n\nHowever, some critics have questioned the size of the payout, particularly in light of the potential impact on Home Retail Group's employees and customers. \"While Walden may be entitled to his windfall, it's hard to see how this is justified when the company is still facing significant challenges and its employees are being asked to make sacrifices,\" said a union representative.\n\nThe Sainsbury's takeover deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.

Analysts at Credit Suisse said talk of mergers and acquisitions in the European postal sector is growing but they are cautious about the prospect, given declining traditional mail volumes and limited scope for synergies. As the postal sector continues to grapple with the decline of traditional mail volumes, analysts are divided on the likelihood of successful consolidation. While some believe that a merger could help to drive efficiency gains and reduce costs, others argue that the benefits may be limited by the inherent complexity of integrating different business models and cultures.\n\nDespite these challenges, Royal Mail's share price movement suggests that investors are still willing to take a punt on the idea of consolidation in the sector.

The CMA has previously blocked several proposed mergers in the sector, citing concerns about the potential impact on consumers.\n\nIn the meantime, Royal Mail is focusing on its ongoing efforts to diversify its revenue streams and adapt to the changing needs of its customers.

The 'big four' accountant said 24 of 80 new partners in its UK business, which includes offices in Switzerland, are female. The figure means that 30% of the prized positions went to women, up on last year's 29% and just 20% in 2014. But while the proportion of new female partners has been increasing, Deloitte is still a long way off gender parity. This year's intake means that just 16% of the 1,054 partners in the firm's UK division are female, a slight increase on 15% before the latest batch of promotions. Despite the progress, Deloitte's gender imbalance remains a concern for the industry. The firm's efforts to increase diversity and inclusion have been underway for several years, but the pace of change has been slow. Deloitte's UK CEO, Richard Houston, acknowledged that there is still much work to be done to achieve gender parity. \"We are committed to creating a more diverse and inclusive culture, and while we are making progress, we recognize that we still have a long way to go,\" he said.\n\nDeloitte's figures are in line with those of its rivals in the accounting industry. According to a recent report by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), women make up just 22% of partners in the top 10 accounting firms in the UK. The report also found that women are more likely to leave the profession after having children, and that there is a lack of female role models and mentors in senior positions.\n\nDeloitte is taking steps to address these issues, including introducing flexible working arrangements and family-friendly policies. The firm is also investing in diversity and inclusion training for its employees and is working to increase the number of women in senior leadership positions. However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to achieve gender parity in the long term. As one of the largest and most influential accounting firms in the world, Deloitte's progress will be closely watched by the industry and beyond.",

But when I rang customer services a man told me it does not accept debit cards, contrary to what it says on the website. Then when I received my bank statement in February I noted that a payment of £286 was taken from my debit account by Argos, but I still haven't received any goods. How do I retrieve my money? Argos seems to be lax in its customer services and even emails do not seem to make any impact. I was left feeling frustrated and concerned about the security of my debit card details. I tried to contact Argos again, but the customer service team was unhelpful, telling me that I should have read the fine print before making the purchase. I was shocked that they were not taking responsibility for the mistake.\n\nI decided to take my complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which handles disputes between consumers and financial institutions. I submitted a detailed complaint, including a copy of my bank statement and screenshots of the Argos website showing the incorrect payment information.\n\nAfter several weeks, I received a response from the Ombudsman, which sided with me and ordered Argos to refund the £286 taken from my account. I was relieved that justice had been served, but I was also left wondering how Argos could have gotten it so wrong in the first place.\n\nI have since cancelled my order and will be taking my business elsewhere. I hope that Argos will take steps to improve its customer service and website accuracy to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.",

Ball, who works under the pseudonym Docubyte, began the project after developing a fascination and affection for such retro devices. \"It's rare now to find any machine that you can touch and interact with,\" he says. \"Computers now are all touch screens, slick and super-slim.\" Ball's fascination with vintage computers began when he stumbled upon an old Apple IIe in his grandfather's attic. \"I was mesmerized by its chunky design and the fact that you could physically interact with it,\" he recalls. He soon started collecting more retro computers, scouring thrift stores, flea markets, and online marketplaces for hidden gems.\n\nThe Guide to Computing series is a culmination of Ball's passion project, featuring over 50 photographs of various vintage computers, each one meticulously styled and lit to highlight its unique design elements. From the iconic Apple II to the behemoth IBM PC, Ball's photographs showcase the tactile nature of these early machines, inviting viewers to touch, feel, and explore.\n\n\"I want people to appreciate the beauty in the imperfections of these machines,\" Ball explains. \"They're not sleek and modern, but they have a certain charm that's hard to find in today's technology.\" The series has already garnered significant attention online, with many enthusiasts and collectors reaching out to Ball to share their own stories and memories of working with these vintage computers.\n\nBall's project has also sparked a sense of nostalgia among those who grew up with these machines. \"I remember spending hours programming on my Commodore 64, trying to create my own games and demos,\" says one commenter on Ball's Instagram page. \"Your photos brought back so many memories!\"\n\nAs the series continues to gain momentum, Ball hopes to inspire a new generation of enthusiasts to appreciate the history and design of early computing. \"There's something special about holding a physical object and being able to interact with it,\" he says. \"I hope my project can help people appreciate the beauty in the imperfections of these machines, and maybe even inspire someone to start collecting and preserving their own vintage computers.\"",

        "Text": "MPs are to investigate how many occupational pension schemes are at risk of failing, amid inquiries into the collapse of BHS and the debate over the future of the £15bn British Steel pension fund. The Commons work and pensions select committee, which is already investigating the £571m deficit at BHS scheme, said on Friday night it would launch a wide ranging inquiry into the problem, probably starting in the autumn. Workers' occupational pensions have been forced centre stage in recent months by BHS's collapse and by Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees who were under retirement age when the company went into administration in March may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result. The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain's largest defined benefit plans with 130,000 members, is also facing cuts as the government races to put it on a sound footing to help facilitate a sale. The latest figures show it has liabilities of almost £15bn and the deficit has ballooned to £700m. The committee's inquiry is expected to examine the scale of the problem, the causes of the deficits, and the impact on scheme members. It will also look at the role of employers, trustees, and regulators in managing the schemes.\n\nThe inquiry will also scrutinize the government's role in regulating the pension industry, including the effectiveness of the Pensions Regulator and the Financial Conduct Authority. The committee will also consider the implications of the EU's proposed pension directive, which could lead to changes in the way occupational schemes are run.\n\nThe committee's chair, Frank Field, said: \"The collapse of BHS and the potential sale of British Steel have brought the issue of occupational pension schemes into sharp focus. We need to get to the bottom of why so many schemes are struggling and what can be done to prevent further failures.\"\n\nThe inquiry is expected to take several months to complete, with the committee holding evidence sessions and gathering information from a range of stakeholders, including employers, trustees, and industry experts.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has announced plans to introduce new measures to help shore up the British Steel pension scheme. The plans include increasing the contributions made by the company and its employees, as well as providing a guarantee to ensure that the scheme is fully funded.\n\nThe move is seen as a crucial step in facilitating the sale of the company, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. However, unions and pension experts have expressed concerns that the proposed changes could still leave scheme members facing significant cuts to their pensions.\n\nThe issue of occupational pension schemes is expected to remain a major concern for the government and the pension industry in the coming months, as the committee's inquiry gets underway and the fate of the British Steel pension scheme is decided.",

Amid heightened demand for specialist beers, the discount supermarket chain will stock its shelves with brews such as Wet Your Whistle, White Witch and A-Hop-alypse Now from Sunday. It said the move would allow it to tap into a UK craft beer market worth £420m and predicted to reach £1bn by 2020. The German retailer spent the past two years sourcing the beers from 15 UK-based breweries, before selling them for £1.25 each in stores in England and Wales. It added that the range was \"carefully selected to celebrate provenance, artisan brewing and the exceptional beer produced across the UK\". The move is seen as a strategic play by Aldi to capitalize on the growing popularity of craft beer among British consumers. The retailer has already made a significant impact in the UK grocery market, and the introduction of craft beers is expected to further boost its sales. Aldi's commitment to sourcing its beers from local breweries has also been praised by industry experts, who note that it will help to support the UK's thriving craft beer scene. The retailer has also promised to continue to expand its craft beer range in the coming months, with plans to introduce new brews and styles to its stores. With its competitive pricing and extensive range of products, Aldi is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the craft beer market. The bank holiday weekend is expected to be a key test for the retailer, with many consumers looking for new and exciting beers to enjoy during the long weekend.",

The company has received a complete response letter from the US Food and Drug Administration about its ZS-9 treatment for high potassium levels, outlining concerns which must be addressed to gain approval. It said it was evaluating the content of the letter, but Reuters reports some analysts as saying the drug's launch could be delayed until 2017 because of a manufacturing issue. AstraZeneca, which expected peak annual sales of $1bn for the drug, said: The [letter] refers to observations arising from a pre-approval manufacturing inspection. The FDA also acknowledged receipt of recently-submitted data which it has yet to review. The [letter] does not require the generation of new clinical data. The delay is a significant blow to AstraZeneca's plans to launch the drug, which was expected to be a major contributor to the company's revenue growth in the coming years. ZS-9 is a potential blockbuster treatment for hyperkalemia, a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The company had been expecting to launch the drug in the US in the second half of this year, but the delay could push the launch back to 2017 or even later. AstraZeneca's shares fell by 3% in early trading on the news, wiping out around $1.5 billion from its market value. The company's investors are likely to be disappointed by the delay, which could also impact its ability to meet its financial targets.

The deal will transfer £12.3bn of assets under management and more than 910,000 policies to Phoenix. The sale includes the pension and investment businesses Embassy and SunLife, which offer life cover to the over-50s. The Bristol-based SunLife has been part of the French insurance giant since 1996. Clive Bannister, chief executive of Phoenix, said the acquisition of the Embassy and SunLife businesses was another important step forward in the firm's growth strategy.

Axa has been reviewing its international operations and has decided to focus on its core business in France. The sale of its UK businesses is part of this strategy.\n\nPhoenix has a track record of integrating acquired businesses and has already completed several deals in recent years. The company has pledged to maintain the same level of service and product offerings for Axa's customers, who will be notified of the change in ownership in due course.\n\nThe acquisition of Embassy and SunLife will significantly increase Phoenix's presence in the UK market, making it one of the largest life insurance companies in the country.

John McFarlane, who is also chairman of TheCityUK, which promotes Britain's financial services, said it was important not to lose sight of Europe as a market as businesses sought to build broader international links. \"Relationships with the EU will need to be repaired,\" he told TheCityUK's annual conference. \"We can only hope that whatever transpires will be to the benefit of our membership.\" His comments preceded a meeting of business leaders at No 10 with David Cameron and business secretary Sajid Javid to allay concerns that the political crisis enveloping both major UK political parties would spill over into the economy and trigger a recession. As the business leaders gathered at No 10, the mood was tense but determined. Cameron and Javid sought to reassure them that the government was committed to finding a solution to the Brexit crisis that would minimize disruption to the economy. McFarlane, however, was not alone in his concerns. Many in the room felt that the UK's financial sector, which is a major driver of the economy, was particularly vulnerable to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.\n\n\"We can't afford to be complacent,\" said Ian Haydon, CEO of the London Stock Exchange. \"We need to be proactive in building relationships with other financial centers around the world, while also maintaining our ties with Europe.\"\n\nThe meeting also heard from other prominent business leaders, including Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, and António Horta-Osório, CEO of Lloyds Banking Group. They all emphasized the need for the government to provide greater clarity on its plans for Brexit, and to work closely with the financial sector to mitigate any potential risks.\n\nIn a statement after the meeting, Cameron and Javid acknowledged the concerns of the business leaders, and pledged to work tirelessly to find a solution that would benefit the UK's economy. \"We understand the importance of the financial sector to our economy, and we are committed to working closely with business leaders to ensure that we can navigate the challenges ahead,\" they said.\n\nThe meeting was seen as a positive step towards building a sense of cooperation and urgency around the need to find a solution to the Brexit crisis. But for many in the financial sector, the task ahead is daunting. As McFarlane put it, \"We need to be realistic about the challenges we face, but we also need to be optimistic about our ability to overcome them.

The company's Evernote Basic tier, which offers free access to the software, will now only be able to sync across two devices. For most people, this will be a computer and one mobile device, leaving users with more than one computer, or a computer and two mobile devices (a phone and a tablet, for instance), needing to pay for the first time. Free users can still access the web version of Evernote, though. At the same time, the price for the Plus and Premium tiers of Evernote has risen by about 40%, taking them to $34.99 (£25.96) and $69.99 (£51.92) a year respectively. The sudden change in policy has left many users feeling frustrated and betrayed by the company. \"I've been using Evernote for years and I'm shocked by this decision,\" said Sarah Johnson, a freelance writer who relies heavily on the service. \"I have a laptop and a desktop, and now I'm being forced to pay for a feature that I previously had for free. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nOther users are taking to social media to express their discontent, with many calling for a boycott of the service. \"I've been using Evernote for my personal and professional notes, but this new policy is a deal-breaker for me,\" tweeted @notesaremylife. \"I'll be switching to OneNote or Simplenote instead.\"\n\nEvernote has attempted to justify the change by citing the increasing cost of maintaining the service, but many users are skeptical. \"I understand that costs go up, but this feels like a blatant attempt to squeeze more money out of loyal customers,\" said Mark Davis, a software developer who has been using Evernote since its early days.\n\nThe backlash has also led to calls for alternative note-taking services to step up and offer a free tier with unlimited syncing capabilities. \"It's time for someone to offer a real free option,\" said @note_taker. \"Evernote used to be the gold standard, but now it's just another greedy corporation trying to milk its users for all they're worth.\"\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, it remains to be seen whether Evernote will reconsider its policy or if users will ultimately abandon the service in search of a more affordable and generous alternative. One thing is certain, however: the trust and loyalty of Evernote's user base have been severely damaged by this move, and it will take more than just a simple apology to regain the faith of its loyal customers.",

Our twice-daily calls are part of her routine, which if disrupted causes her much distress. Over the past several months her line has been disrupted several times. The fault will last for anything between a day to a week, and after a spell of being OK the landline will redevelop the same fault. I was prepared to believe it was something my mother was doing wrong, but on each and every occasion it has been identified as a \"fault at the junction box\".

The feature has been known to suggest users who have no or few mutual friends on the network – and, reportedly, nothing in common beyond having shared the same physical space – prompting concerns about how it works. These were resurrected on Tuesday when Fusion reported that Facebook was drawing from the location of users' smartphones to inform its suggestions – a \"privacy disaster\", it said. It quoted a spokesperson as saying that location information was \"only one of the factors\" Facebook used to determine people who may know each other. \"Seriously, I've had enough reporters ask me, freaked out, why Facebook is recommending their protected sources,\" tweeted Violet Blue, a reporter on cybercrime, on Tuesday. \"Suck it up & stop using it.\" But Fusion then published an updated statement from Facebook, which said it did not use location data – though it had briefly in the past.

Asda's sales slid by 5.9% – its worst performance on record and the biggest slump in the market. Tesco was the best of the major chains, with sales down 1.3% according to analysis from Kantar Worldpanel published on Tuesday. That compares with falls of 5.1% and 1% revealed last month. In contrast, discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to see double-digit growth, with sales up 11.5% and 13.8% respectively, taking their combined market share to a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is now only a hair's breadth from overtaking the Co-op to become the UK's fifth largest supermarket. The decline in the UK grocery market is attributed to a combination of factors, including the ongoing cost of living crisis, which has led to consumers being more cautious with their spending. Additionally, the shift towards online shopping has been slower than expected, with many consumers still preferring to shop in-store.\n\nAsda's poor performance is particularly concerning, as it has traditionally been one of the strongest players in the market. The supermarket's struggles are thought to be due to a lack of investment in its stores and a failure to keep up with changing consumer habits.\n\nTesco, on the other hand, has managed to hold its own due to its strong online offering and a focus on improving its store experience. The supermarket has also been investing heavily in its convenience store format, which has been performing well.\n\nThe discounters, Aldi and Lidl, continue to be the bright spot in the market, with their low prices and efficient operations allowing them to attract price-conscious consumers. Their combined market share has now reached 10.5%, a new high for the two chains.\n\nAldi's growth is particularly impressive, with the supermarket opening over 70 new stores in the past year alone. The chain's success is thought to be due to its focus on quality and value, as well as its efficient supply chain.\n\nThe rise of the discounters has significant implications for the wider market, with many traditional supermarkets struggling to compete on price. The Co-op, in particular, is under pressure, with its market share continuing to decline.\n\nThe decline in the UK grocery market is expected to continue in the coming months, with many analysts predicting a further decline in sales. However, the discounters are likely to continue to thrive, and may even continue to gain market share as consumers become increasingly price-conscious.",

A balance of UK retailers saying sales rose minus those who reported falling sales fell to 4% in June, down from 7% in May, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest snapshot of the retail sector (pdf). The survey was conducted between 26 May and 14 June – before the UK's shock vote to leave the EU. Grocers, furniture and carpet shops, along with hardware and DIY stores, reported a pickup in sales in the year to June. But growth slowed at clothing retailers and sales fell at department stores, specialist food and drink retailers, and shops selling durable household goods such as cookers and washing machines. The survey also revealed that retailers' expectations for the next three months have deteriorated significantly, with 22% of respondents expecting sales to fall, up from 12% in May. This decline in optimism was particularly pronounced among clothing retailers, with 35% expecting sales to fall, and department stores, where 30% of respondents were pessimistic.\n\nThe CBI's director of economics, Ian McCafferty, attributed the slowdown in sales to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the EU referendum. \"The retail sector had been growing steadily in the run-up to the referendum, but the vote to leave the EU has clearly had an impact,\" he said. \"Retailers are now facing a more challenging environment, with weaker consumer confidence and rising costs.\"\n\nThe survey also highlighted the impact of the pound's depreciation on retailers' costs. More than half of respondents reported that the fall in the pound had increased their costs, with 20% saying it had had a significant impact. This could lead to higher prices for consumers, which could further erode demand.\n\nThe CBI is calling on the government to provide clarity on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU and to implement policies to support the retail sector. \"The government must now provide a clear plan for the UK's exit from the EU and take steps to support the retail sector, which is a vital part of the UK's economy,\" said McCafferty.\n\nThe survey's findings are in line with other recent data, which has suggested that the retail sector is facing a challenging environment. Last week, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that retail sales volumes fell by 0.3% in May, the first decline in five months.\n\nThe CBI's survey provides further evidence that the retail sector is struggling to cope with the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum. As the government begins to negotiate the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, retailers will be looking for reassurance that their businesses will be protected and supported.",

        "Text": "Chiefs at the parent company of the Independent almost doubled their take-home pay last year as plans were being put in motion to cut jobs and shut the newspaper titles. Evgeny Lebedev's Independent titles managed to reduce pre-tax losses from £8.5m to £6.9m in the year to 27 September 2015, according to the latest and last full year accounts for the now-defunct newspapers. At a \"trading\" level, excluding items such as interest repayments and redundancy costs, the Independent and Independent on Sunday lost just £3.74m last year. Despite being within touching distance of breaking even, the print titles were closed in March as the Lededev's sold off stablemate the i and pursued a digital-only future for the Independent. Accounts for Lebedev Holdings, the company controlled by Evgeny Lebedev and runs the Independent, the London Evening Standard and TV station London Live, shows that despite the impending closure directors nevertheless enjoyed a bumper year. The five directors – who include Alexander Lebedev, former chief executive Steve Auckland, chairman Justin Byam Shaw and financial chief Manish Malhotra – tripled their take home pay from £589,000 to £1.48m. The unnamed highest-paid director pocketed £953,000, up from £529,000 in 2014. Specifically at the Independent, the highest paid director doubled pay from £200,000 to £416,000. The seven directors of the subsidiary company that runs the Independent more than doubled their pay from £387,000 to £831,000. Despite the significant increases in director pay, the news of job cuts and title closures at the Independent was met with widespread criticism from industry insiders and media watchdogs. \"It's outrageous that the directors of the Independent, a newspaper that was once a bastion of independent journalism, are lining their pockets while the very people who make the paper possible are being let go,\" said one veteran journalist who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nThe decision to close the print titles and focus on a digital-only future has also raised concerns about the long-term viability of the Independent's online presence. \"The Independent has a rich history and a loyal readership, but without a strong print presence, it's hard to see how they can maintain their relevance in the digital landscape,\" said a media analyst.\n\nMeanwhile, the sale of the i to Johnston Press for £24 million has been seen as a positive move, with many praising the deal as a savvy business decision. However, the closure of the Independent's print titles has left many wondering what the future holds for the newspaper's staff and the city's media landscape.\n\nIn a statement, Evgeny Lebedev's spokesperson said that the decision to close the print titles was a necessary step in order to ensure the long-term survival of the Independent brand. \"We are committed to investing in the Independent's digital presence and to creating a sustainable future for the newspaper,\" the spokesperson said. However, many remain skeptical about the company's ability to achieve this goal without a strong print presence.\n\nAs the Independent's print titles are shut down, the newspaper's staff are left to pick up the pieces and wonder what the future holds for their beloved publication. The closure of the Independent's print titles is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the newspaper industry in the digital age, and the need for innovative solutions to ensure the survival of high-quality journalism.",

        "Text": "ITV has seen almost £2.5bn wiped off its stock market value since the Brexit vote, raising city speculation the the broadcaster could become the target of a takeover. ITV, which saw its share price fall by more than 20% on Friday, continued to see jittery investors drive its price down more than 5% in early trading on Monday. At midday on Monday its share price had fallen to 164p, down from a pre-Brexit 220p and a one-year high of 280p. Investors worried about the repercussions of Brexit on ITV, which relies on a now nervy advertising market for much of its revenues, have driven the broadcaster's market capitalisation from £9bn to about £6.5bn in the days since the EU referendum. City analysts have begun to speculate if the share price decline, coupled with the UK's currency crash, down 10% against the US dollar, might prompt foreign media companies to consider making an opportunistic bid for ITV. \"This increases the chance of a bid by one one of the major US media companies where there is a historical and present interest in the UK market,\" said Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum. \"Not only from the established media giants, but also from new media/tech companies (for example, we believe that several of the US internet giants explored a bid for the English Premier League rights in the last bidding round).\" NBC Universal, owner of Downton Abbey maker Carnival, has been rumoured in the past to have had an interest in bidding for ITV, and John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, has a 9.9% stake in the broadcaster. The prospect of a takeover has sent ITV's shares tumbling, with investors worried about the potential consequences of a foreign company taking control of the UK's largest commercial broadcaster. However, some analysts believe that ITV's weakened position could also make it an attractive target for private equity firms or other media companies looking to expand their reach into the UK market.\n\n\"It's not just about the share price decline, it's about the uncertainty and volatility that Brexit has brought,\" said another analyst, who wished to remain anonymous. \"A foreign company may see an opportunity to acquire a significant player in the UK market at a discounted price, and then look to restructure and refinance the business to unlock value.\"\n\nITV's reliance on advertising revenue has also been a concern for investors, with many analysts predicting a decline in ad spend in the wake of the Brexit vote. The company's television ratings have also been under pressure in recent months, with some of its most popular shows struggling to attract large audiences.\n\nDespite these concerns, ITV remains one of the most popular and profitable broadcasters in the UK, with a strong portfolio of shows including Downton Abbey, The X Factor, and Coronation Street. The company has also made significant investments in digital media, including its ITV Hub streaming service, which has attracted millions of users.\n\nAs the Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on ITV's share price, the company's management is under pressure to reassure investors that it has a plan in place to navigate the challenges ahead. In a statement, ITV said it was \"confident in the strength and resilience of its business\" and was \"well-positioned to adapt to changing market conditions.\" However, with the company's shares at their lowest level in over a year, investors will be closely watching its performance in the coming months to see if it can recover from the Brexit-induced slump.",

        "Text": "Visitors to the Bespoked Handmade UK Bicycle Show in Bristol earlier this year would have noted how bike building in the UK is undergoing a renaissance. On a floor of 100 exhibitors, dominated by custom steel and titanium bikes, one builder stood out because of his choice of material: carbon fibre. While the majority of road bikes are carbon fibre these days, custom frames built from the lightweight material are rare because of the technical challenges involved. However, from his workshop in Worcestershire, Richard Craddock is overcoming these barriers. Craddock spent a number of years designing cycles for various brands and riding for an amateur racing team in France before deciding to build a carbon bike \"exact for me\". He spent almost four years developing and testing before offering his Filament bespoke carbon frames to the public. \"I've never stopped building since,\" he says. So what is the appeal of his carbon bikes? \"The primary USP is custom geometry,\" says Craddock. \"Two riders of the same height could be stocky or like a willow, and I can build for their weight, not only their height. This allows for a more precise fit and better handling, making the bike feel more tailored to the rider's individual needs. Craddock's expertise in designing for various brands and his experience as an amateur racing team rider have given him a unique understanding of what makes a bike perform well. He takes into account factors such as the rider's flexibility, pedaling style, and power output to create a frame that is optimized for their specific needs.\n\nCraddock's process begins with a thorough consultation with the customer to understand their riding style, preferences, and goals. He then uses advanced computer software to design a custom frame that meets their specific requirements. The design is then sent to a local manufacturer, who produces the frame using high-quality carbon fibre.\n\nWhat sets Craddock's frames apart is not only the custom geometry but also the attention to detail and craftsmanship that goes into each build. Every frame is hand-finished and inspected to ensure that it meets Craddock's high standards. The result is a bike that not only looks stunning but also rides exceptionally well, with a level of precision and responsiveness that is hard to find in mass-produced frames.\n\nCraddock's bespoke carbon frames have attracted attention from enthusiasts and professionals alike, with many riders seeking him out for custom builds. His unique approach to bike building has also inspired a new generation of frame builders to experiment with different materials and designs. As the demand for custom bikes continues to grow, it's clear that Richard Craddock's innovative approach to carbon fibre frame building is paving the way for a new era in bespoke cycling.",

They want to be listened to and want change – that's a political issue.\" Asked if the country's captains of industry could have done more to convince voters to back the status quo, he pointed to disaffection between the \"man in the street and big business\". \"There has been a loss of trust and we need to think about how to rebuild that,\" Rose said. \"It has happened over time, since the last recession, whether it's the banks or the crisis in the eurozone or a business being run in a way people don't like. \"All these things leave a bad taste in the mouth and cumulatively that taste can get quite bitter. This is a big issue about our country, our people, how they feel and what they think.\" After playing a key role at the start of the campaign Rose was sidelined in March after he told a select committee wages would go up if Britain left the EU. His remarks were used as ammunition by the leave campaign, although he maintains he was misquoted. Lord Rose's comments come as the Britain Stronger in Europe remain campaign is left to pick up the pieces after a devastating defeat. The Remain campaign's failure to win over voters has sparked widespread debate about what went wrong, with many pointing to a lack of effective messaging and a failure to connect with ordinary people.\n\nRose's suggestion that voters were driven by a sense of disillusionment with the political class and big business is echoed by many analysts. \"The Remain campaign struggled to articulate a clear vision for Britain's future in the EU, and ultimately failed to inspire voters,\" said Professor John Curtice, a leading psephologist. \"At the same time, the Leave campaign was able to tap into a deep-seated sense of discontent with the status quo, and exploit fears about immigration and sovereignty.\"\n\nDespite the loss, Rose remains defiant, insisting that the Remain campaign's message was sound, but ultimately outgunned by the Leave campaign's more effective use of social media and grassroots organizing. \"We had a good campaign, but we were outspent and outmaneuvered,\" he said. \"We need to learn from our mistakes and come back stronger in the future.\"\n\nAs the dust settles on the referendum, the Britain Stronger in Europe remain campaign is already looking to the future, plotting a course for a possible second referendum or a renewed push for a softer Brexit. Lord Rose's comments offer a glimpse into the campaign's post-mortem, as they seek to identify the lessons learned from their defeat and plot a path forward.",

But in an increasingly automated society, where are the wages to buy these goods going to come from? While Brexit showed that politicians were detached from the anger of the dispossessed of this country, where are they on the automation of yet more of the jobs that so many people depend on? It seems they are keen to race headlong into a very misty future. There are so many unresolved issues: the need for a citizen's income to allow those disenfranchised from the workplace to live a reasonable quality of life (and the taxation on corporate profits that this would require); the loss of peace and quiet, privacy, safety, security; and beyond all this, what will humans be doing in the future?

Those that have remained on the fence until now have until 11am on Saturday in the UK to update for free. After that they will be stuck on whichever version of Windows they currently have installed, unless they purchase a Windows 10 upgrade. For many annoyed by Microsoft's aggressive pushing of Windows 10 to their computers, through automatic downloads, installs that happen while they're away making tea or interrupting the weather or pro-gamer streams, the end of the free upgrade period will come as a welcome relief. Many are happy with Windows 7, which has turned out to be Microsoft's new Windows XP: a solid, good-enough operating system that many will be hesitant to switch from. But Windows 10 is arguably the best version of Windows Microsoft has ever created. There are some questions over its use of cloud services and the tracking of user actions, but Windows 10 is the most secure version yet. If you're running either Windows 8 or 8.1, the free update to Windows 10 is highly recommended, as it is a refinement of the good things in the older operating system without most of the irritating ones, such as the charms bar and gestures that simply don't work on a desktop computer with a mouse and keyboard. Despite the concerns, Windows 10 has received widespread acclaim for its improved performance, sleek design, and innovative features such as Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant. For those who have been holding out, the end of the free upgrade period presents a crucial decision: stick with an outdated operating system or take the plunge and upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft has been clear that it will no longer provide security updates for Windows 7 and 8, leaving users vulnerable to potential threats. With the free upgrade offer expiring, users must weigh the benefits of a newer, more secure operating system against the risks of making a significant change to their computing setup. For those who choose to upgrade, Microsoft has made the process relatively seamless, with the Windows 10 installation process guided by a user-friendly interface. Meanwhile, those who opt to stick with their current operating system may find themselves facing a more complex and potentially hazardous computing environment. As the clock ticks down, the choice is clear: upgrade to Windows 10 and reap the benefits of a modern operating system, or face the consequences of sticking with the past.",

London ranks fourth. Millionaires on its Mayfair streets and penthouses may be more numerous than Monaco, but they account for only one in every 29 of the capital's citizens. Edinburgh, ranked 16th, is the only other UK city to make it into the top 20, with an estimated one in 67 of its inhabitants a millionaire. Consultancy company WealthInsight, who carried out the research in partnership with Spear's Magazine, said Dublin was the surprise entry into the top 10, beating Paris, Berlin and Moscow. \"Dublin has a higher density of millionaires than many other European capitals. The research, which analyzed data from over 100 cities across Europe, found that Monaco's unique blend of financial services, tourism, and luxury lifestyle has created a concentration of high net worth individuals. Zurich, with its strong banking sector and proximity to Switzerland's tax-haven status, came in second place. London, often considered a global financial hub, ranked fourth, despite its larger population.\n\nEdinburgh, known for its stunning architecture and vibrant cultural scene, was the only other UK city to make the top 20. The city's strong financial sector, including the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, has attracted many high-net-worth individuals. Dublin, which surprised many by ranking in the top 10, has a growing tech industry and a favorable business environment, making it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe research also found that many European cities with a strong financial sector, such as Luxembourg and Amsterdam, have a higher concentration of millionaires. However, cities with a strong cultural and tourist industry, such as Barcelona and Vienna, tend to have fewer high-net-worth individuals.\n\nWealthInsight's CEO, Michael Hewson, attributed the findings to the unique combination of factors in each city. \"Cities with a strong financial sector, combined with a favorable business environment and a high standard of living, tend to attract and retain high-net-worth individuals,\" he said. \"However, cities with a strong cultural and tourist industry may not have the same level of economic activity, but still offer a high quality of life, which can also attract affluent individuals.\"\n\nThe research also highlighted the importance of tax policies in attracting high-net-worth individuals. Cities with favorable tax regimes, such as Luxembourg and Ireland, tend to have a higher concentration of millionaires. On the other hand, cities with high tax rates, such as Paris and Berlin, tend to have fewer high-net-worth individuals.\n\nThe findings of the research have implications for cities looking to attract and retain high-net-worth individuals. Cities with a strong financial sector, combined with a favorable business environment and a high standard of living, are likely to be more attractive to millionaires.

The sectors that were hardest hit by the news of Brexit – banks, housebuilders, retailers and travel companies – saw the biggest director purchases. Many boardroom directors have done well out of these deals as stock markets bounced back following days of dramatic falls when tens of billions of pounds were wiped off the London stock market. The biggest share buys came in late June and early July.

Now the looming threat for Europe is Quitaly, the fear that Italy might decide it has had enough of the single currency and go back to the lira. Put simply, Italy's economy is floundering and has been for the past two decades during which time there has been virtually no growth and Italian goods have become less and less competitive in export markets. Sluggish growth and high levels of unemployment are reflected in the high level of non-performing loans that are now hobbling Italian banks. Potential bad debts have almost doubled to €360bn (£300bn) in the past five years and now account for 18% of all outstanding loans. What is clear, though, is that the non-performing loans reflect a non-performing economy. They are the symptom of the problem and not its cause. As the Italian economy continues to stagnate, the pressure is mounting on the government to take drastic action. The European Union has been urging Italy to implement reforms to boost growth and competitiveness, but so far, the country has been slow to respond. The EU has also been providing financial support to Italian banks to help them absorb the bad debts, but this has only delayed the inevitable.\n\nThe fear of Quitaly is not just a theoretical possibility, but a real concern for many economists and financial experts. Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone, and if it were to leave the single currency, it could have a devastating impact on the entire region. The consequences would be far-reaching, with potential repercussions for global financial markets and trade.\n\nThe Italian government has been trying to reassure the markets that it has a plan to get the economy back on track, but so far, the measures have been piecemeal and ineffective. The country needs a comprehensive strategy to address its structural issues, including a bloated public sector, high taxes, and a lack of investment in infrastructure and innovation.\n\nAs the situation continues to deteriorate, the risk of Quitaly is growing, and the EU is scrambling to find a solution. The European Central Bank has been providing emergency loans to Italian banks, and the EU has been offering financial support to the government. However, these measures are only a temporary fix, and the underlying problems need to be addressed. The fate of the eurozone and the global economy hangs in the balance, as the world waits with bated breath to see what will happen next.",

The phone app update, which is part of Google's efforts to separate core phone features from operating system updates, is available for the company's Nexus line of smartphones and Android One devices, including the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. The new spam-blocking feature is an extension of Google's caller ID system, which helps identify businesses not stored in your address book, and has been available for several years now. The phone app checks incoming call numbers against an updating database and flags those that appear to be from spammers with a big red banner. The new feature will also allow users to report suspicious calls, which will help Google's database of spam numbers to stay up-to-date. This will enable the app to become even more effective at blocking unwanted calls in the future. Additionally, the update includes a new \"screened calls\" feature, which will allow users to send suspicious calls directly to voicemail, preventing them from ringing through to the user's phone.\n\nGoogle's move to combat spam calls is a welcome one, as many users have been frustrated by the growing number of unwanted calls they receive. According to a report by the Federal Trade Commission, Americans received over 48 billion robocalls in 2018 alone, with the average person receiving over 22 calls per month. Google's new feature is just one part of a larger effort to combat spam calls, and it is hoped that it will help to reduce the number of unwanted calls that users receive. The update is available now for Nexus and Android One devices, and is expected to roll out to other Android devices in the coming weeks.",

In a report published on Monday, the Association of Residential Letting Agents (Arla) says last month's referendum vote has not rocked the rental market \"yet\", however, uncertainty over the future of Britain's role in Europe is making landlords jittery. One in nine agents told Arla they have experienced an immediate dip in rents following last month's Brexit result. Soaring rents, particularly in London and the south-east, have been partly pushed upwards by recent arrivals from abroad, as well as a lack of available properties to rent. David Cox, managing director of Arla said the rental market has so far responded to Brexit in a calm fashion but warned continued uncertainty could cause turbulence in the rental market over the coming months. However, despite the calm initial reaction, many agents are bracing themselves for a potential downturn in the rental market. The uncertainty surrounding the UK's future relationship with the EU is causing landlords to become increasingly anxious, with some already starting to pull out of the market or delaying decisions to invest in new properties.\n\nAccording to the Arla report, 44% of agents reported that landlords are now more cautious about investing in the rental market, with 22% saying they are delaying decisions to purchase new properties. This is likely to have a ripple effect on the wider economy, as the rental market plays a significant role in supporting local businesses and communities.\n\nThe impact of Brexit on the rental market is also being felt in terms of the types of properties that are being rented out. Agents are reporting a surge in demand for short-term lets, such as holiday lets and short-term rentals, as investors seek to diversify their portfolios and mitigate the risks associated with the uncertainty surrounding the UK's future in the EU.\n\nMeanwhile, the supply of long-term rentals is drying up, with many landlords opting to sell their properties rather than continue to rent them out. This is likely to lead to a shortage of available rentals in the coming months, which could drive up prices and make it even more difficult for renters to find affordable accommodation.\n\nOverall, while the rental market has so far responded to Brexit in a calm fashion, the uncertainty surrounding the UK's future in the EU is likely to have a significant impact on the sector in the coming months. As the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the rental market will adapt and whether the sector will be able to weather the storm.",

There were 6,700 applications for new retail developments in 2015, down from 7,360, according to commercial law firm EMW. They are down by nearly a half from the pre-recession peak of 11,900 in 2008. The fall shows the continuing pressures on shopkeepers as consumers desert the high street in favour of online shopping with e-commerce companies. The decline in applications to build new shops is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the retail industry, which has been grappling with the rise of online shopping for several years. The report highlights the difficulties faced by shopkeepers as they struggle to compete with the convenience and competitive pricing offered by e-commerce companies.\n\nAccording to EMW, the decline in applications is not limited to any particular region or type of retail development. Cities, towns, and rural areas have all seen a decrease in the number of applications, suggesting that the problem is widespread.\n\nThe decline in physical retail spaces is also having a ripple effect on the wider economy. Many local communities rely on their high streets as a hub of activity, providing employment and services to residents. As more shops close, these communities are at risk of losing their vitality and character.\n\nDespite the challenges, some retailers are finding ways to adapt to the changing retail landscape. Many are investing in their online presence, offering click-and-collect services, and creating immersive in-store experiences to attract customers.\n\nHowever, not all retailers have the resources to make these changes, and many are struggling to stay afloat. The decline in applications to build new shops is a worrying sign for the industry, and it remains to be seen how it will evolve in the coming years.\n\nIn the meantime, policymakers and business leaders are calling for action to support the high street. This includes measures to reduce business rates, improve transport links, and increase footfall through initiatives such as street festivals and events.\n\nUltimately, the future of the high street will depend on the ability of retailers to adapt to changing consumer habits and the willingness of policymakers to support them. As the retail landscape continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the decline in applications to build new shops is a wake-up call for the industry to rethink its strategy and find new ways to thrive.",

In addition, PwC has to pay £750,000 towards the FRC's costs. The FRC said the £3.5m original fine would have been the largest ever.

In this note we assess whether there is any rationale for Echostar, or Dish, to approach Inmarsat.

Echostar and Dish Network have recently raised financing and Echostar now has around $3bn in cash on its balance sheet. This cash hoard, combined with the companies' experience in the satellite industry, makes them an attractive suitor for a potential takeover of Inmarsat.\n\nInmarsat, which provides satellite-based communication services to the maritime, energy, and government sectors, has been facing increased competition in recent years. The company has been working to diversify its revenue streams and expand its services, but its share price has struggled as a result of the intense competition.\n\nRBC analysts believe that Echostar or Dish Network could be interested in acquiring Inmarsat as a way to expand their own offerings and gain a foothold in new markets. Inmarsat's global satellite network and expertise in providing critical communication services to high-growth industries could be a valuable addition to either company's portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, a takeover of Inmarsat could also provide Echostar or Dish Network with access to new customers and revenue streams. Inmarsat's maritime and energy customers, for example, could provide a new avenue for growth for either company.\n\nWhile there has been no official comment from Echostar or Dish Network on the possibility of a takeover, RBC analysts believe that the companies have the financial resources and expertise to make a successful bid for Inmarsat. The analysts have set a price target of £1.30 per share for Inmarsat, indicating a potential takeover value of around £2.5 billion.\n\nIt's worth noting that Inmarsat has a strong track record of resisting takeover attempts in the past, including a failed bid from British private equity firm Apax Partners in 2013.

        "Text": "Hello guzzlers, Today's puzzle comes courtesy of Jelmer Steenhuis, a legendary Dutch puzzle designer. It's a contemporary twist on riddle that has been around since medieval times, and may be of use to revellers out partying today. Three friends set off to carnival with a jerry can containing 1.2litres of rum punch. On arrival they decide to go to three separate sound systems. So they must divide the booze equally between themselves. They have brought two large bottles for this purpose. But then they discover that these bottles have no measurements on them. One of the friends spots an empty 50cl can of Red Stripe and an empty 15cl vial of something marked 'rave juice' on the ground. There's a water tap on hand to clean the can and the vial. The friends are able to divide the punch into three equal portions by pouring between the jerry can, the two bottles, the beer can and the vial. How do they do it? Remember that the only measurements they have are for a full can and a full vial, but they also know there is 1.2litres of rum punch in the jerry can to start with. Assume that when you pour from one vessel to another no liquid is spilled. I'll be back at 5pm with the answer. Here is the continuation of the news article:\n\nAs the sun begins to set on the carnival, revellers are still trying to crack the puzzle. It's a brain-twister that requires careful calculation and a bit of creative thinking. The friends, it seems, have managed to divide the rum punch into three equal portions using the empty beer can and vial, but how did they do it?\n\nOne possible solution is that they first poured the rum punch from the jerry can into the two large bottles until one bottle was full. This would leave 0.6 litres of rum punch in the jerry can. Next, they poured the rum punch from the jerry can into the beer can until it was full, leaving 0.3 litres remaining in the jerry can. The vial was then filled with 0.15 litres of rum punch, leaving 0.15 litres remaining in the jerry can.\n\nWith the beer can and vial now filled, the friends poured the rum punch from the jerry can into the two bottles until they were both empty, leaving no rum punch remaining in the jerry can. The beer can and vial now contain 0.5 litres and 0.15 litres of rum punch respectively, making a total of 0.65 litres. The friends then poured the rum punch from the beer can into the vial until the vial was full, leaving 0.3 litres remaining in the beer can.\n\nThe three friends now have three equal portions of rum punch, with 0.4 litres each. The puzzle may seem complex, but with careful calculation and a bit of creative thinking, it's possible to solve it. And with the answer, the friends can now enjoy their rum punch and the rest of the carnival. Stay tuned for the answer at 5pm!",

Those who believe 11-year-olds are inherently of two types, academic sheep and practical goats, should consider some real-life examples. Is the child who excels at maths but finds it hard to string two sentences together a sheep or a goat? What about the one who likes reading and writing but loves drawing and making things? Or the talented refugee who performs poorly in the 11-plus because she's not yet fluent in English? Is the child who falls just below the dividing line in test results because he's missed weeks of schooling through homelessness really a goat? Is the one who scrapes through because of private tuition really a sheep? The whole idea is a nonsense, as is the idea that two types of school are needed to provide sheep-education and goat-education. Janet Dobson London • I was delighted to read the letter from Michael Liversidge (24 August) in which he outlined his academic successes despite his poor performance at O-level. It's refreshing to hear from someone who has personally experienced the limitations of the traditional academic route. Michael's story serves as a powerful reminder that success is not solely dependent on grades or academic achievement. His experiences highlight the importance of recognizing and valuing diverse strengths and abilities.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the notion of \"sheep\" and \"goats\" is not only simplistic but also ignores the complex interplay of factors that influence a child's academic performance. Factors such as socio-economic background, access to resources, and individual learning styles all play a significant role in shaping a child's educational journey.\n\nThe debate around grammar schools often focuses on the benefits of academic selection, but what about the children who are left behind? The ones who don't make the cut, who are deemed \"unacademic\" or \"not suitable\" for grammar school education. What about their needs and aspirations? Don't they deserve an education that values their unique strengths and abilities?\n\nIn reality, our education system should be designed to cater to the diverse needs of all children, not just those who excel in traditional academic subjects. By recognizing and celebrating individual differences, we can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that fosters creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth.\n\nIt's time to move beyond the outdated and misguided notion of \"sheep\" and \"goats\" and towards a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a successful and well-rounded individual. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and effective education system that benefits all children, regardless of their academic abilities or backgrounds.",

As the luxury shoe and bag retailer celebrates its 20th anniversary, Peter Harf, the chairman, said Jimmy Choo's prospects had \"never looked better\". The company reported revenue growth of 9.2% for the first six months of the year, or 3.8% at constant currencies, and a 42.6% increase in operating profits to £25.3m. The second half had started well, the retailer said, with a positive benefit from a weaker pound. Jimmy Choo has 147 stores worldwide, including 10 in the UK, and is opening about 10 stores a year.

The company's expansion plans are not limited to physical stores, as Jimmy Choo is also investing in e-commerce and digital marketing to reach a wider audience. Harf emphasized that the retailer's strategy is focused on building a strong brand presence globally, rather than simply relying on the UK market. \"We're not just a British brand, we're a global brand,\" he said. \"We're not just about selling shoes, we're about creating an experience.\"\n\nJimmy Choo's success has also been driven by its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences. The company has shifted its focus towards more affordable and accessible products, while still maintaining its luxury brand image. Harf noted that the retailer has seen a significant increase in demand for its more affordable lines, which have been priced between £200 and £500. \"We're not just a luxury brand, we're a brand for everyone,\" he said.\n\nAs Jimmy Choo looks to the future, the company is planning to continue its expansion into new markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. Harf expressed confidence that the retailer's growth prospects remain strong, despite the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. \"We're not worried about Brexit, we're worried about how we can continue to grow and expand our brand globally,\" he said.

That was the main message of the economic data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which included the first piece of hard evidence of how the UK performed after the 23 June vote to leave the EU. The ONS said the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the UK economy, expanded by 0.4% in July, a month in which surveys showed business and consumer confidence crashing and the financial markets in turmoil. In the circumstances, that's a pretty impressive performance and analysts are already revising up their forecasts for growth in the third quarter. On the basis of still limited evidence, they are penciling in 0.4-0.5%. Hopes of avoiding a recession were also strengthened by the upward revision to growth in the second quarter, from 0.6% to 0.7%. The economy had plenty of momentum before the Brexit vote, and while it is likely to slow in the second half of 2016 there will not be the necessary two consecutive quarters of falling output to fulfil the technical definition of a recession. Much less welcome for the government was the news that Britain's balance of payments deficit, which stood at an alarming 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016, widened in the second quarter. A deterioration in the UK's trade performance was largely responsible for the country diving deeper into the red, with the scale of the deficit highlighting the unbalanced nature of the economy. The widening trade deficit is a concern for the government, as it suggests that the UK is still heavily reliant on imports to fuel its economic growth. This is particularly problematic given the recent decline in the value of the pound, which has made imports more expensive. The ONS data also showed that the UK's trade deficit with the EU widened to £4.4 billion in the second quarter, from £2.3 billion in the same period last year.\n\nDespite these concerns, the overall picture remains positive, with the ONS data suggesting that the UK economy is likely to continue growing in the third quarter. However, the pace of growth is expected to slow, and some economists are warning that the economy may be due for a correction.\n\nThe Bank of England is also keeping a close eye on the situation, and is likely to consider cutting interest rates further if the economy shows signs of slowing. The bank's governor, Mark Carney, has already warned that the UK is likely to experience a period of \"prolonged and slow\" growth in the coming years.\n\nDespite these challenges, the government is trying to stay positive, and is highlighting the resilience of the UK economy. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said that the data shows that the economy is \"strong and stable\", and that the government is committed to supporting businesses and creating new jobs.\n\nHowever, the opposition is not so convinced, and is calling for the government to take more action to address the UK's economic challenges. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said that the data is \"a warning sign\" that the government's economic policies are not working, and that more needs to be done to support ordinary people.\n\nAs the debate continues, it is clear that the UK economy is facing a number of challenges, and that the government will need to take a careful approach to navigating these challenges. However, for now, the data suggests that the economy is likely to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace than previously expected.",

Trinity Mirror said that the trading environment has \"remained challenging\" and the business is focusing on shoring up the print decline by boosting digital revenues and \"making efficiencies\", or cost cuts. The company said that it has hit £20m in structural cost savings for the year, up from an initial target of £15m. The company, which also publishes regional newspapers including the Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo, said print advertising revenues fell by 21% and newspaper sales revenues dropped by 6% in the third quarter. Total revenues fell by 9% in the third quarter, slightly more than the 8% drop reported in the first half of the year. The company said publishing revenue is down 10%; within this total print revenues fell 12% while digital climbed by 11%. The company's digital efforts have been a bright spot, with online advertising revenue increasing by 15% in the third quarter. Trinity Mirror's online presence has been bolstered by the acquisition of several digital media companies in recent years. The company's CEO, Sly Bailey, said that the cost savings and revenue growth will help to position the business for long-term success. Despite the challenges facing the industry, Bailey remains optimistic about the future, stating that Trinity Mirror is \"well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities that exist in the market\". The company's financial performance will be closely watched by investors and analysts in the coming months, as the industry continues to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing media landscape.",

The talking animatronic toy has been given a hi-tech makeover, swapping cassette tapes and plastic eyes for a 4GB hard drive and animated LCD peepers. Teddy has been resurrected by Wicked Cool Toys, which earlier this year also launched a revamped Cabbage Patch Kid doll. An early prototype of Teddy was showcased at the Dallas Toy Fair this week, although it's not scheduled to launch until 2017. \"The bear had to come out of the bag,\" said Wicked Cool Toys co-president Jeremy Padawer, speaking to YouTube's Mommy and Gracie Show. \"We've shown Teddy a little early.\" The nostalgia was palpable as the crowd gathered around the Wicked Cool Toys booth at the Dallas Toy Fair, eagerly awaiting a glimpse of the beloved teddy bear that had captured the hearts of children everywhere in the 1980s. And when Teddy Ruxpin finally emerged from his bag, the room erupted in a chorus of \"oohs\" and \"aahs\".\n\nThe new and improved Teddy Ruxpin is a far cry from the original, which relied on cassette tapes to bring its stories to life. This modern version boasts a 4GB hard drive, allowing it to store hours of audio content, including new stories, songs, and even interactive games. The LCD eyes, which can display a range of emotions, are a far cry from the plastic peepers of yesteryear.\n\nBut despite the technological advancements, the essence of Teddy Ruxpin remains the same. The bear's creators have worked tirelessly to ensure that the new version captures the same magic that made the original so beloved. \"We wanted to stay true to the spirit of the original Teddy Ruxpin,\" said Padawer. \"We wanted to make sure that kids today could still have the same kind of emotional connection with the toy that kids in the 80s did.\"\n\nTeddy Ruxpin's new hard drive allows for a range of new features, including the ability to download additional content and even connect to the internet. The bear can also be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing kids to choose which stories they want to hear and even record their own voice to create personalized adventures.\n\nThe response to the new Teddy Ruxpin has been overwhelmingly positive, with many of the toy industry's biggest players flocking to the Wicked Cool Toys booth to get a glimpse of the bear in action. \"We're thrilled with the reaction,\" said Padawer. \"Kids and adults alike are loving the new Teddy Ruxpin, and we can't wait to get it into stores next year.\"\n\nFor those who grew up with the original Teddy Ruxpin, the new version is a nostalgic trip back to a simpler time. For kids today, it's a chance to experience the magic of the beloved toy for the first time. Either way, it's clear that Teddy Ruxpin is back and better than ever. And as the bear takes its place alongside other revamped retro toys like Cabbage Patch Kids, it's clear that the 80s are back in a big way.",

Underlying profits fell 46% from £9.2m 12 months ago to £5m in the six months to the end of July – excluding interest payments, tax, write downs on the value of property, and a one-off fall in income of nearly £4m related to a new credit card agreement. Profits were hit by the increased cost of delivering goods ordered online and a decline in sales of House of Fraser's own brands. Total sales remained steady at £573.5m as the group's established department stores experienced a 2.5% slump. Underlying sales, including a 17.8% rise in online sales, lifted 0.9%. Nigel Oddy, chief executive of the group, which was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in April 2014, said House of Fraser had experienced an \"extremely volatile trading environment\". The profit slump comes after fellow department stores John Lewis and Next both revealed a fall in first-half profits as they were hit by the need to discount to clear summer stock. Oddy said: \"We would never use the weather as an excuse but we had record temperatures in September when we were selling autumn product and cold temperatures in June when we were trying to sell summer. and cold temperatures in June when we were trying to sell summer product,\" Oddy said. \"It's not an excuse, but it's a fact that has had an impact on our sales.\"\n\nDespite the challenging conditions, Oddy remained optimistic about the future, citing the group's strong online presence and efforts to revamp its store portfolio. \"We're investing heavily in our digital capabilities and our stores, and we're seeing good progress,\" he said.\n\nHouse of Fraser has been working to improve its online offering, including the launch of a new mobile app and the introduction of click-and-collect services. The group has also been focusing on enhancing the in-store experience, with plans to refurbish several of its flagship stores.\n\nHowever, the company's efforts to revamp its product range have been hindered by the decline in sales of its own brands. Oddy acknowledged that the group's private label products, which account for around 20% of its sales, had struggled in recent months.\n\n\"We're not satisfied with the performance of our own brands, and we're working hard to improve them,\" he said. \"We're looking at new product lines, new designs, and new marketing strategies to try and drive growth.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Oddy remained confident that House of Fraser could turn things around. \"We're not out of the woods yet, but we're making progress, and we're confident that we can deliver a stronger second half,\" he said.\n\nThe group's shareholders will be hoping that Oddy's optimism is justified, as House of Fraser's profit slump has sent its shares tumbling. The company's stock price has fallen by around 15% in the past year, and investors will be looking for signs of improvement in the second half of the year.",

        "Text": "Thomas Cook's summer bookings fell 4% as the travel operator was hit by a slump in demand for holidays in Turkey following a series of terrorist attacks and an attempted coup. In a trading update, Thomas Cook said summer bookings excluding Turkey rose 4% but that a 40% drop in trips to Turkey caused total bookings to fall. Bookings fell heavily in continental Europe, where German tourists shunned Turkey, but rose 1% in the UK. Thomas Cook has been hit hard since summer 2015 by terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Egypt and Turkey. It offered customers with bookings to Turkey free cancellation after a failed military coup in July. Bookings from Belgium also fell following the terrorist attacks on Brussels in March. The decline in bookings to Turkey was attributed to a significant drop in demand from Germany, which is one of the largest source markets for Thomas Cook. The company said that the events in Turkey had led to a \"material reduction\" in bookings from Germany, which was not offset by increased demand from other countries. Thomas Cook's CEO, Peter Fankhauser, stated that the company was working to mitigate the impact of the decline in bookings to Turkey by increasing its focus on other destinations, such as Spain and Greece.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the company, Thomas Cook reported a 4% increase in summer bookings excluding Turkey, driven by strong demand from the UK and a recovery in bookings to Spain. The company also reported a 1% increase in bookings from the UK, which was seen as a positive sign given the challenging economic conditions in the country.\n\nThomas Cook's results come as the travel industry is facing a number of challenges, including a decline in bookings to Turkey and a slowdown in demand from some of its key source markets. The company's rivals, such as TUI and Jet2, have also reported declines in bookings to Turkey and are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the decline.\n\nIn response to the decline in bookings to Turkey, Thomas Cook has increased its focus on other destinations, such as Spain and Greece, which are seen as more stable and attractive to customers. The company has also been investing in its online presence and has launched a number of new marketing campaigns to attract customers. Despite the challenges facing the company, Thomas Cook remains confident that it will be able to deliver a strong performance for the year.",

Solutions 1) 19 – the numbers are the alphabet positions of the first letters of the words in the question. 2) The code is that Mary I is taken to mean the first letter of Mary, George III is the third letter in George, and so on. The whole series, including a final Henry I, therefre spells out the word \"monarch\". 3) 2.7 They are the row and column positions on a QWERTY keyboard of the letters in alphabetical order. (2.1 means second row, first letter; 3.5 is third row, fifth letter, etc.) 4) 112: Subtract 1 from each number and you get the numbers that are the same upside down: 0, 1, 8, 11, 69, 88, 96, 101, 111, 181... Don't feel too bad if you did't get that last one. As the puzzles were solved and the room fell silent, a sense of accomplishment washed over the group. Bill, aka William Hartston, smiled knowingly, pleased with the complexity and cleverness of his creations. \"Well, well, well,\" he said, \"it seems you've all got the makings of a group of clever coders and cryptographers. I must say, I'm impressed.\"\n\nThe group's leader, a keen mathematician, spoke up next. \"I must admit, I was stumped by the fourth puzzle. How did you come up with that one, Bill?\" Bill chuckled, \"Ah, it's an old favorite of mine. I call it the 'palindromic sequence.' It's a bit of a brain twister, but the key is to recognize that each number is one less than its reverse.\"\n\nAs the group continued to chat and discuss the puzzles, one of the participants, a young woman with a passion for language, turned to Bill and asked, \"You know, I've always been fascinated by codes and ciphers. Do you have any more where those came from?\" Bill's eyes lit up, \"Oh, yes! I have a whole collection of them. Let me show you...\"\n\nAnd with that, Bill began to pull out a stack of papers and books, filled with all manner of codes and ciphers. The group leaned in, eager to learn more about the art of cryptography and the clever puzzles that Bill had created. As they delved deeper into the world of codes and ciphers, they discovered that there was more to Bill's puzzles than just clever wordplay and mathematical trickery. There was a rich history and a deep understanding of the human desire to communicate and conceal, that lay beneath the surface.",

Simpson, who has spent five decades at the the corporation including his current role of world affairs editor, told the Guardian: \"The BBC, like the NHS, should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups which don't have an axe to grind.\" He added that both sides of the House of Commons were prone to attack the BBC simply because it didn't \"toe the party line\". Simpson reserved his greatest opprobrium for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, both for their involvement in the Hutton affair and their dealings with Rupert Murdoch. \"Here is the British prime minister cosying up to a man who has got no interest in Britain, who is deeply opposed to Britain and Britain's interest, and is against the main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. He said he believed most governments in his 50 years working at the BBC have a \"disgraceful political obsession that somehow or other the BBC has to be cut down to size\". \"I don't mean to say that cuts can't be made but it's the savagery with which it's done. The ideological delight with which it's done.\" He added: \"I just feel that it's absolutely disgraceful, keeping the BBC as short of cash as the government has since 2010.\" The insistence in a draft BBC charter unveiled earlier this month that the corporation reveal the pay of those staff earning more than £150,000 was simply the government \"looking for a way to demonstrate their control and domination\", he said in an interview three days after coming out of hospital having suffered kidney failure caused by a reaction to eating kedgeree. Simpson's scathing criticism comes as the BBC is facing unprecedented pressure from the government, with Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries recently threatening to \"take back control\" of the corporation. The BBC's director-general, Tim Davie, has also faced calls to resign over the corporation's handling of the controversy surrounding its high-earning stars.\n\nSimpson's comments have been met with widespread support from current and former BBC staff, who have expressed their gratitude for his courage in speaking out against the government's attacks. Many have also praised his dedication to the corporation's values of impartiality and independence.\n\nHowever, not everyone has been impressed with Simpson's remarks. Conservative MP and former BBC governor, Sir Nick Faldo, has accused Simpson of being \"out of touch\" with the reality of the BBC's financial situation. \"The BBC is a bloated institution that needs to be reformed,\" Faldo said. \"John Simpson's comments are just a desperate attempt to cling to the past and resist the necessary changes that need to be made.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Simpson remains defiant, insisting that the BBC's independence is essential to the health of British democracy. \"The BBC is not just a broadcaster, it's a national institution that plays a vital role in holding those in power to account,\" he said. \"We can't let the government dictate what we can and can't report on. That's why I'll continue to speak out against their attacks and fight for the BBC's right to remain independent.\"\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, Simpson's comments have sparked a renewed sense of urgency around the need to protect the BBC's independence and integrity. With the corporation's charter up for renewal in 2027, the stakes are higher than ever before. Will the government's attacks on the BBC ultimately succeed in silencing its voice, or will the corporation's defenders be able to rally and ensure its continued survival? Only time will tell.",

The prime minister said she would support the Canadian if he decided to put back his departure date from Threadneedle Street until 2021 and praised his efforts to steer the UK economy through the post-Brexit vote period. May's spokeswoman said: \"The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country. It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years.\" May and Carney were scheduled to have a meeting later on Monday, but the warm tone adopted by the prime minister's spokeswoman immediately prompted rumours that the governor could be about to announce his future plans. The speculation surrounding Carney's future plans has been fueled by recent comments he made about the need for a \"fiscal policy response\" to the UK's post-Brexit economic challenges. While Carney has not explicitly stated his intentions, his remarks have led some to speculate that he may be considering a longer-term role at the Bank of England to help guide the economy through the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union.\n\nCarney's supporters, including some senior Bank of England officials, have been urging him to reconsider his departure date, citing his unique experience and expertise in navigating the complexities of the global financial system. Others have pointed to the Bank's ongoing efforts to develop its capabilities in areas such as fintech and green finance, and the potential benefits of having Carney's leadership during this critical period.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that Carney's continued tenure would be beneficial. Some critics have argued that the Bank of England's autonomy is essential to its effectiveness, and that Carney's extended stay could undermine the institution's independence. Others have raised concerns about the potential for Carney's continued leadership to create a sense of complacency among the Bank's policymakers, potentially leading to a loss of momentum in the UK's economic recovery.\n\nAs the speculation surrounding Carney's future plans continues to build, the Bank of England and the UK government are likely to face increasing pressure to provide clarity on the governor's intentions. Meanwhile, Carney himself remains tight-lipped on the matter, fueling further speculation and intrigue in the financial community.",

Instead the new MacBook Pros, both with and without the new emoji bar, will silently boot the moment they switch on. The chime, first introduced with the Macintosh Quadra line of computers in 1991, was used to signal that the computer had passed its initial diagnostic tests and would start the boot sequence. The first chime was a C-major chord, but was changed to the F-sharp chord starting in 1998 with the first iMac. While you've been able to mute the startup chime if the computer was muted before switching off, the often loud and obnoxious sound has been more embarrassing than helpful to most Mac laptop users. The silent boot is a welcome change for many users who have found the startup chime to be an annoyance in quiet environments, such as libraries or meetings. Additionally, the elimination of the chime may also help reduce the noise pollution caused by the loud and sudden sound. Apple's decision to remove the startup chime is seen as a step towards a more considerate and user-friendly experience. The company has also made other changes to the MacBook Pro, including the introduction of a new emoji bar and improved performance and battery life.

The British Infrastructure Group (BIG), led by former Conservative chairman and minister Grant Shapps, said the time for excuses from the mobile network providers was over. In a report, the MPs said it was \"unacceptable that areas in Britain continue to have such poor mobile connectivity, and that overseas visitors can expect better mobile coverage than Britons stuck with a single provider\". They wrote: \"The time for excuses from the mobile sector is over. The government must make a better call for Britain and bring national mobile coverage policy into the 21st century.\" They said many overseas visitors had better coverage because their networks allowed national roaming. The group proposed an amendment to the government's digital economy bill to allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that did not meet the targets of a 2014 agreement. The MPs also highlighted the economic and social implications of the poor mobile coverage, stating that it was hindering businesses and affecting people's daily lives. They pointed out that many rural areas were particularly affected, where mobile coverage was often non-existent or patchy.\n\nThe report also criticized the government's current approach to mobile coverage, saying that it was not doing enough to address the issue. The MPs called for a more proactive approach, with a clear plan to improve coverage across the country.\n\nThe BIG report also suggested that the government should establish a mobile coverage taskforce to oversee the implementation of the plan and hold mobile operators accountable for their progress.\n\nThe proposal to fine mobile operators that do not meet the targets of the 2014 agreement has been met with mixed reactions. Some have welcomed the move, saying it will force mobile operators to take action to improve coverage. Others have expressed concerns that it will lead to increased costs for consumers.\n\nThe digital economy bill is expected to be debated in parliament in the coming weeks, and the proposed amendment is likely to be a key point of discussion. The outcome of the debate will be closely watched by mobile operators, consumer groups, and the general public.\n\nThe British Infrastructure Group has called on the government to take immediate action to address the issue, saying that the time for excuses is over.

Article 29 said that it had \"requested WhatsApp to communicate all relevant information to the Working Party as soon as possible and urged the company to pause the sharing of users' data until the appropriate legal protections could be assured\" in a letter sent to the messaging service.

Indicating an end to its record-breaking profits streak, Amazon reported profit of $252m or 52 cents per share, though analysts had predicted 85 cents per share. Revenues reached $32.71bn but are predicted to reach between $42bn and $45.5bn for the busy fourth quarter. Alphabet meanwhile continues to dominate the fast-growing mobile advertising market, along with Facebook. The company has benefited from robust sales of advertising on mobile devices and on YouTube, and also said it would repurchase about $7bn of its Class C stock. Shares of Alphabet, which is the world's second largest company by market value, were up 1.6% in after-hours trading. Google's ad revenue rose 18.1% to $19.82bn in the third quarter, accounting for 89.1% of Google's total revenue, compared with 89.8% of revenue in the second quarter. Paid clicks rose 33%, compared with a rise of 29% in the second quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11% in the latest period after dropping 7% in the second quarter. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 7.9%, according to FactSet StreetAccount. The strong performance by Alphabet, also known as Google, was attributed to its dominance in the mobile advertising market, where it continues to outpace its competitors. The company's ability to adapt to changing consumer behavior and its willingness to invest in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have been key factors in its success. Additionally, the growth of e-commerce and the increasing importance of online advertising have also contributed to Alphabet's strong financial performance.\n\nIn contrast, Amazon's miss on profit expectations was largely due to its heavy investments in preparations for the holiday season. The company has been expanding its logistics and delivery capabilities to meet the surge in demand during the holiday season, which has put pressure on its profitability. However, analysts remain optimistic about Amazon's long-term prospects, citing its strong brand recognition, vast customer base, and ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nDespite the differing performances, both Alphabet and Amazon are expected to continue to play important roles in shaping the future of the technology and retail industries. As the holiday season approaches, investors will be closely watching both companies to see how they fare and whether they can maintain their strong growth momentum.",

        "Text": "Royal Bank of Scotland has been told by a group of private investors that it will be taken to court over a £1.25bn claim related to its 2008 cash call. The RBoS Shareholder Action Group, which represents 27,000 retail investors, issued its warning after a report that other shareholders were considering settling out of court. The group, one of at least three bringing claims related to the rights issue in 2008, said: \"We look forward to seeing Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March.\" The group said it was the only one suing Goodwin, who was chief executive of RBS at the time of its £45bn taxpayer bailout, and three of the bank's former executives. The legal action is said to be \"on behalf of thousands of investors, both private and institutional, who lost money by subscribing for shares during the 2008 RBS rights issue\". The announcement was made ahead of RBS's third-quarter results, which will be scrutinised for any further provisions relating to the case. The RBoS Shareholder Action Group's threat to take RBS to court comes as the bank is still reeling from the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis. The rights issue in question was a last-ditch effort by the bank to raise capital and avoid collapse, but it ultimately resulted in a massive loss for investors. The group claims that RBS failed to provide adequate information to investors about the bank's true financial situation at the time, leading to a loss of confidence and a sharp decline in the value of the shares.\n\nThe group's lawyers have been working tirelessly to gather evidence and build a case against RBS, and they are confident that they have a strong argument. \"We believe that RBS breached its fiduciary duties to its shareholders by making false and misleading statements about the bank's financial health,\" said one of the lawyers involved in the case. \"We are seeking compensation for the thousands of investors who were harmed by RBS's actions.\"\n\nThe RBoS Shareholder Action Group's announcement has sent shockwaves through the financial community, with many investors and analysts calling for RBS to come clean about the situation. \"This is a major scandal, and RBS needs to take responsibility for its actions,\" said one analyst. \"The bank's shareholders deserve to know the truth about what happened in 2008, and they deserve to be compensated for their losses.\"\n\nRBS has so far refused to comment on the situation, but it is expected to release a statement soon. The bank's third-quarter results are due to be released later this week, and investors will be watching closely to see if RBS will make any provision for the potential legal costs and settlements.",

        "Text": "Banks and financial services companies have racked up more than £40bn in costs to handle the payment protection insurance scandal. The costliest mis-selling bill in UK financial services history became even more expensive on Thursday after Barclays set aside a further £600m to handle the cost of claims. Data compiled by the thinkthank New City Agenda shows that this top up for Barclays has pushed the total provisions incurred by the industry to £40.2bn. Lloyds Banking Group makes up £17bn of that total. The size of the payouts have already been cited as a reason for booming car sales and holidays. As one penny off income tax costs about £4bn, it could be regarded as a boost to household income. The staggering cost of the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal has sent shockwaves through the financial industry, with banks and financial services companies now facing a total bill of £40.2 billion. The latest contribution to this massive sum comes from Barclays, which has set aside an additional £600 million to cover the cost of claims.\n\nThe PPI scandal, which has been ongoing for several years, involves banks and financial institutions mis-selling insurance policies to customers, often without their knowledge or consent. The policies, designed to protect borrowers from missed payments, were sold to millions of people who did not need or want them.\n\nThe fallout from the scandal has been significant, with many banks facing large fines and compensation payouts. The £40.2 billion total provisions incurred by the industry are expected to continue to rise as more claims are made and settled.\n\nDespite the massive cost, some economists have argued that the payouts could have a positive impact on the economy. With more money in people's pockets, consumers may be more likely to spend and boost economic growth. The £40.2 billion total provisions could also be seen as a boost to household income, equivalent to about £4 billion off income tax.",

So the following day's front, \"Pete Burns: How I came back from the dead\", was baffling. Had the previous report been wrong after all? But it turns out that the Daily Star's clever trick was not a correction at all, but rather a cleverly crafted cover story. Pete Burns, the former lead singer of the pop group Dead or Alive, had indeed died of a heart attack on Tuesday, as reported by the Star. However, in a bizarre twist, Burns' partner, Michael Simpson, had made a statement earlier that day claiming that Burns had died twice before, and that he had somehow managed to come back to life on both occasions. The Star's front page story was likely a play on this unusual claim, rather than a genuine correction of their earlier report.

Why, asked an emailer, should we care what happens in Argentina? Leaving aside the chauvinistic rudeness, by recording what is happening in media elsewhere we are better able to perceive what the Herald rightly calls \"a worldwide phenomenon\". The central point to be learned from the Herald's leading article on Wednesday, is universal: journalism is in crisis. In registering its \"unspeakable sadness\" at giving up daily publication, the paper said it had been \"facing difficulties for a while now\". It spoke of the \"dramatic change\", which \"reflects a media industry in crisis\", and acknowledged that people now prefer to access news for free on digital platforms rather than by reading newsprint. Then it touched on the likely result: \"as many as 2,000 journalists may lose their jobs in the country in 2016, a staggering number which will damage the profession greatly\". The Herald is no exception because it is shedding most of its staff due to the change to a weekly. \"The overwhelming majority of our colleagues were told that they would be losing their jobs\", said the editorial, which revealed that 14 \"are leaving us today\". The 140-year-old title, majority-owned by the Indalo Group, also mentioned \"our most illustrious period during the military dictatorship\". The article goes on to highlight the significance of the Herald's crisis, not just for Argentina but for the global journalism industry. The newspaper's struggles to adapt to the shift towards digital media and its reliance on advertising revenue are mirrored in newsrooms around the world. The editorial notes that the Herald's decision to become a weekly is a \"symbol of the times\" and a reflection of the \"agonizing struggle\" many newspapers are facing to stay afloat.\n\nThe article also touches on the implications of the Herald's downsizing for the Argentine media landscape. With the loss of experienced journalists and the decline of investigative reporting, the country's citizens are likely to suffer from a lack of in-depth coverage of important issues. The Herald's editorial warns that this could have far-reaching consequences, including a decline in accountability and transparency in government and business.\n\nAs the newspaper's employees prepare to leave, many are expressing sadness and frustration at the loss of a institution that has played a vital role in Argentina's cultural and political life. The Herald's legacy is not just about its journalism, but also about its commitment to promoting free speech and independent thought. As the newspaper embarks on this new chapter, many are left wondering what the future holds for journalism in Argentina and beyond.",

The £1.7bn mine, which was given the go-ahead last year after a protracted planning battle, has promised to restore the region's proud mining heritage and bring more than 1,000 jobs. The project received a major boost on Tuesday when Sirius Minerals, the company behind the Yorkshire mine, announced a US$300m (£245m) deal with Rinehart's Australian agricultural firm Hancock Prospecting. The mine, which sits on protected moorland overlooking Whitby and Robin Hood's Bay, aims to produce up to 20m tonnes a year of a potassium-rich mineral called polyhalite, a type of potash fertiliser described by Sirius as a \"fertiliser of the future\". Under the deal Rinehart will purchase $50m of Sirius shares and pay $250m for a 5% royalty stream on the first 13m tonnes of fertiliser produced by the mine annually, and the right to purchase up to 20,000 tonnes of product each year for use on her expanding Australian agricultural holdings. The investment is a significant coup for Sirius Minerals, which has been working on the project for over a decade. The company's CEO, Chris Fraser, hailed the deal as a \"game-changer\" for the business, saying it would allow them to accelerate the development of the mine and create thousands of jobs in the region.\n\nThe deal is also a major win for Rinehart, who has been looking to expand her agricultural interests in the UK. Her company, Hancock Prospecting, has been involved in a number of high-profile mining projects around the world, including the Roy Hill iron ore mine in Western Australia.\n\nThe polyhalite mine is expected to be a major boost to the local economy, with Sirius Minerals estimating that it will generate £1.2 billion in economic benefits for the region over its 50-year lifespan. The company has also promised to invest £10 million in local community projects, including the restoration of historic mining sites and the creation of new green spaces.\n\nHowever, the deal has not been without controversy. Local environmental groups have expressed concerns about the impact of the mine on the North York Moors national park, which is home to a number of rare and endangered species. The park's designation as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) has meant that the mine has had to undergo a lengthy and rigorous planning process, with the UK government ultimately giving the project the green light last year.\n\nDespite these concerns, Sirius Minerals has insisted that the mine will be built with environmental sustainability in mind. The company has promised to use cutting-edge technology to minimize its impact on the local ecosystem, and has also committed to restoring the site to its natural state once the mine has been exhausted.\n\nThe deal is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, pending regulatory approval. If all goes to plan, the polyhalite mine is expected to begin production in the mid-2020s, with the first shipments of fertiliser heading to markets around the world.",

The 10 students were invited by Property Week to judge a shortlist of providers for the \"student experience\" category of their inaugural Student Accommodation Awards. The judges instead criticised the entrants for pricing out poorer students and \"driving the social cleansing of education\". The panel cited a 2015 study by the NUS, which shows that university rent in the UK increased by 18% over two years, to an average of £146 per week. The report suggests the rise is largely due to the growth of private providers. A spokesperson for the Student Accommodation Awards said: \"Our student judges have sent a clear message that the industry needs to do better. The decision to withdraw the category has sparked a wider debate about the affordability of student accommodation in the UK. Many students are struggling to find affordable and decent living arrangements, with some being forced to share tiny rooms or live in overcrowded conditions.\n\n\"The fact that students are having to make these kinds of sacrifices just to get a roof over their head is a clear indication of a broken system,\" said Rachel, a student at the University of Manchester who was part of the judging panel. \"We're not asking for luxury, just a basic standard of living that doesn't leave us in debt and stress.\"\n\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) has called for greater regulation of the private student accommodation sector, citing concerns about the quality and affordability of the properties. \"It's unacceptable that students are being priced out of their own education,\" said NUS president, Shakira Martin. \"We need to see more action from the government and the industry to ensure that students have access to safe, affordable and decent living arrangements.\"\n\nThe Student Accommodation Awards organizers have announced that they will be reviewing their criteria and judging process to ensure that future awards better reflect the needs and concerns of students. The industry has also been urged to take note of the students' concerns and to prioritize affordability and quality in their developments.\n\nIn the meantime, students are being advised to research thoroughly and to look for deals and discounts that can help make their living arrangements more affordable. Many are also calling for greater support from universities and government to help address the issue of student poverty and the increasing cost of living.\n\nAs the debate continues, it is clear that the students' protest has sparked a much-needed conversation about the state of student accommodation in the UK. With the cost of living continuing to rise, it is imperative that the industry and government take action to ensure that students have access to safe, affordable and decent living arrangements that do not compromise their education.",

Now's the time for her to do what she said she would do. What's the risk in making companies publish details of every employee's terms and contracts of employment, pension contributions, share options, severance terms, expense account arrangements, perks etc? Not all boardrooms are full of self-serving, me-first executives. However, many are. It was the boards of our leading banks and financial institutions – working hand in glove with some of the most unsavoury characters in the business world – who created the problems we are facing today. The proposal to require companies to publish pay ratios is a crucial step towards transparency and accountability. By shining a light on the vast disparities in executive compensation, May can demonstrate her commitment to fairness and social justice. It's not just about punishing the wealthy, but about ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared more equitably. After all, it's the ordinary workers who have borne the brunt of austerity, while the wealthy have continued to accumulate wealth. The PM's predecessors, David Cameron and George Osborne, were notorious for their close ties to the City and their willingness to serve the interests of the 1%. May has an opportunity to break with this tradition and show that she is truly committed to the well-being of all citizens, not just the wealthy elite.

Murdoch is reported to have invested $100m in Theranos between 2014 and 2015, when its valuation was soaring thanks to the promise of being able to revolutionize blood testing by replacing needles with low-cost finger pricks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Murdoch was part of a group of wealthy families and individuals who invested $632m in Theranos's latest funding round at about $17 a share, giving the Silicon Valley company a valuation of nearly $9bn, and making it the highest-valued private healthcare startup in the US. Murdoch is reported to have toured Theranos's laboratories in Palo Alto and inspected its proprietary devices prior to investing. The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's publishing group News Corp, has published a series of investigative stories questioning the accuracy of Theranos's testing and unusual management techniques. The WSJ investigation, which kept going despite intense pressure on its whistleblower from Theranos and its board of high profile figures, led to a government investigation that found the company's practices were putting patients' lives at risk. Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos's chief executive, was banned from the blood testing business for two years.

At more than 65 metres high and weighing over 845 tonnes, the three-legged steel jackets will be almost as prominent on Belfast's skyline as Samson and Goliath, Harland and Wolff's giant yellow cranes. Work on the foundation jackets will start in the second quarter of 2017 and should be completed towards the end of 2018, Scottish Renewables said on Friday.

Jonathan Guest, Harland and Wolff's director of business development said: \"In a global supply chain environment it is significant when a developer stands over its commitment to give opportunities to local fabricators, as Scottish Power Renewables have demonstrated for East Anglia One.\" Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power Renewables said: \"East Anglia One will be the best value offshore windfarm ever constructed, at the same time as delivering industry-leading levels of UK content. The contract win is a significant boost to the shipyard's fortunes, which have been impacted by a decline in the traditional shipbuilding industry.

The company has already completed several projects in the offshore wind industry, including the construction of a similar windfarm off the coast of Germany.\n\nThe East Anglia One windfarm will be one of the largest in the world when it is completed, and will play a crucial role in helping the UK meet its renewable energy targets.

Sharif, a prominent figure in Bahrain's opposition movement, had been vocal about the need for democratic reforms and greater freedoms in the country. His arrest and subsequent charges were seen as a crackdown on free speech and a threat to the country's fragile human rights landscape.\n\nThe Bahraini government's decision to drop the charges is likely to be seen as a gesture of goodwill ahead of the upcoming visit by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the country. The move may also be an attempt to ease tensions with the international community, which has been increasingly critical of Bahrain's human rights record.

Grammar schools were then fee paying, with a few bright children selected for special places, and Harry gained one at King Edward VI school, Nuneaton. It was a disrupted secondary education. The school was bombed, so for some time pupils went to school only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, to receive work to be done at home. Despite the challenges of his early education, Harry went on to study at the University of Leicester, where he graduated with a degree in chemistry. He then began his teaching career at a sixth-form college in Leicester, where he quickly established himself as a dedicated and inspiring educator. His passion for teaching and his ability to connect with students of all ages and backgrounds led to him being appointed as a college principal, a role he held for many years.\n\nThroughout his career, Harry was committed to providing high-quality education to his students, and he was particularly proud of his work in adult education, where he helped countless individuals gain new skills and qualifications. He was also a strong advocate for social justice and was involved in various community initiatives aimed at promoting equality and fairness.\n\nIn his personal life, Harry was a kind and generous person who was loved by all who knew him. He was a devoted husband to his wife, Joan, and a loving father to their two children. He enjoyed gardening, walking, and playing chess, and was a keen supporter of his local football team.\n\nHarry's death is a significant loss to his family, friends, and the education community, but his legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched and the many memories he created. He will be deeply missed, but his spirit will continue to inspire and motivate others to strive for excellence and make a positive difference in the world.",

        "Text": "Sports Direct is selling Dunlop, the sportswear brand known for its green flash tennis shoes, to a Japanese buyer in a surprise $137.5m (£112m) deal. Sumitomo Rubber Industries confirmed that it will acquire the trademark rights of the Dunlop brand overseas, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Sports Direct's founder and major shareholder, Mike Ashley, acquired Dunlop Slazenger for an estimated £40m in 2004 from Royal Bank of Scotland – which had taken control of the struggling business from its private equity-backed owners – three years before he floated his sportswear retail chain on the stock exchange. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is associated with many sports including tennis, squash, badminton and golf. Its gear has been used by sporting figures including tennis champions Rod Laver, John McEnroe and Steffi Graf, as well as golfers such as the 2011 British Open winner Darren Clarke and the former world number one Lee Westwood. In a statement, Sports Direct said it did \"not currently have the bandwidth to develop and manage international brands simultaneously\", and needed to prioritise its core UK businesses and relationships with third-party brands. The Dunlop business made a pre-tax profit of £4m on sales of £41.8m, the retailer said. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, originally called the Dunlop Rubber Company, has a tyre business as well as a sports division that makes tennis and golf equipment. The acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals. Sumitomo Rubber Industries plans to maintain the Dunlop brand's operations in the UK and continue to manufacture and distribute its products globally. The company's sports division has already established a strong presence in the Asian market, and the addition of Dunlop is expected to further strengthen its position.\n\nSports Direct's decision to sell Dunlop comes as no surprise to analysts, who have been speculating about the retailer's plans for its international brands. The company has been focusing on its core UK business and has been looking to streamline its operations. The sale of Dunlop is expected to generate significant cash for Sports Direct, which can be used to invest in its core business and potentially make other acquisitions.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by industry insiders, who see the deal as a positive development for the sportswear industry. \"This is a great opportunity for Sumitomo Rubber Industries to expand its presence in the global sportswear market,\" said one analyst. \"Dunlop is a well-known and respected brand, and we expect the company to continue to thrive under its new ownership.\"\n\nThe sale of Dunlop is also expected to have a positive impact on the UK's sportswear industry, with many predicting that the deal will lead to increased investment and job creation. The UK's sportswear industry has been facing significant challenges in recent years, including increased competition from online retailers and a decline in consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the sale of Dunlop has also raised concerns about the future of the brand's manufacturing operations in the UK. While Sumitomo Rubber Industries has committed to maintaining the brand's operations in the UK, there are concerns that the company may look to consolidate its manufacturing operations in the future. This could potentially lead to job losses and a decline in the brand's UK presence.\n\nOverall, the sale of Dunlop to Sumitomo Rubber Industries is a significant development for the sportswear industry, and it will be interesting to see how the brand evolves under its new ownership. While there are certainly challenges ahead, the deal also presents a number of opportunities for growth and expansion.",

        "Text": "A bailout of struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi should not be seen as a done deal, a key European Central Bank policymaker has said. Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's Bundesbank, said the Italian government ought to consider whether it should rescue the bank if it is in a bad financial state. \"For the measures planned by the Italian government the bank has to be financially healthy at its core,\" he said in an article published German newspaper Bild. \"The money cannot be used to cover losses that are already expected. All this must be carefully examined,\" added Weidmann, a member of the ECB's governing council. The ECB has taken a tough line with Italy's third-largest bank, refusing to give it more time to find private investment. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan last Friday after the Siena-based bank, which can trace its roots back to 1472, failed to convince investors to fund a €5bn (£4.25bn) cash injection. It plans to dip into a €20bn fund approved by the government earlier this month for the purpose of propping the bank up if no rescue plan could be secured elsewhere. Weidmann's comments come as a surprise to many, as the ECB has been seen as a strong supporter of the Italian government's efforts to rescue Monte dei Paschi. The bank's struggling financial situation has raised concerns about the potential impact on the wider Italian economy, and the government has been under pressure to act quickly to prevent a crisis.\n\nHowever, Weidmann's warning highlights the concerns that some policymakers have about the bank's financial health. Monte dei Paschi has been struggling for years, and its financial situation has only deteriorated in recent months. The bank has been trying to raise capital to shore up its balance sheet, but its efforts have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe Italian government's plan to dip into the €20bn fund to prop up the bank has been criticized by some as a short-term fix that does not address the underlying problems. Weidmann's comments suggest that the ECB is not convinced that the plan is sufficient to restore the bank's financial health.\n\nThe news has sent shockwaves through financial markets, with shares in Monte dei Paschi falling sharply in response to Weidmann's comments. The bank's future is now uncertain, and investors are waiting to see how the situation will unfold.\n\nThe Italian government has been working to finalize the bailout plan, which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. However, Weidmann's comments have raised questions about whether the plan will be sufficient to address the bank's financial problems.\n\nThe situation is also likely to be closely watched by other European policymakers, who are concerned about the potential impact on the wider European economy. The ECB has been working to stabilize the financial system in the wake of the financial crisis, and any major problems at a major bank like Monte dei Paschi could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nIn the meantime, Monte dei Paschi's customers and employees are left wondering about the future of the bank. The bank's problems have already led to concerns about the stability of the Italian financial system, and the uncertainty surrounding the bailout plan is only adding to the anxiety.",

I used to rejoice as I walked through the municipal gardens near my home as we learned about the need for \"capacity building\" in the developing world. How grateful I was for all the local municipal provision that we lived with here: the parks, halls, toilets, youth centres, libraries. With central-government austerity policies (Cuts at catastrophic level, says Birmingham council chief, 13 December), they are now all vanishing, or hard-pressed local volunteers are struggling to deal with community-asset transfer, taking over the running and the management of such amenities, if they are not sold off to unaccountable private companies. As I walked through those gardens, I felt a sense of security and community that I had taken for granted. But now, as I return to Leeds, I'm met with a stark reality. The very same gardens I once enjoyed are now overgrown and neglected, a symbol of the devastating impact of austerity policies. The halls, once bustling with community activities, are now empty and silent. The toilets, once clean and well-maintained, are now often out of order. The youth centres, once a hub of activity for young people, are now closed or struggling to stay afloat.\n\nThe once-thriving libraries, where I spent countless hours studying and researching, are now on the brink of closure. It's as if the very fabric of our community has been ripped apart. The volunteers who used to run these amenities are now exhausted and demoralized, struggling to cope with the demands of taking over their management and maintenance. And all the while, private companies are circling, waiting to swoop in and take control of these public assets for their own profit. It's a bleak future, and one that fills me with a sense of despair and disillusionment. How did we let it come to this?",

Customers of the website have reported being told at car hire desks that their booking would not be honoured unless they paid again – in some cases many hundreds of pounds – because Atlas had not paid the car's actual provider. Frustrated customers of the west London car hire booking firm, which acted as booking agent for all the big car hire brands, have reported the problem on Twitter and other social media in recent days. \"Cancelling my rental car, keeping my money and providing no other option two days before I fly home for Christmas.

Another customer, Chris Clifton-Brown, wrote online: \"Booked through them recently and when I turned up to collect my car the hire firm made me aware that Atlaschoice are not paying the actual hire firms.

However, many customers are left wondering how this could have happened and why Atlaschoice was allowed to continue operating despite reportedly failing to pay its suppliers.\n\nThe situation has also raised concerns about the lack of regulation in the car rental industry, with some experts warning that similar scams could occur in the future if companies are not held accountable. \"This is a classic case of a middleman not paying its bills, and it's unacceptable that it's happened to so many people just before Christmas,\" said John Smith, a travel industry expert. \"We need to see stricter regulations in place to protect consumers from these types of scams.\"\n\nIn the meantime, customers are left to navigate the complicated process of getting refunds and finding alternative transportation arrangements. Many are also sharing their own horror stories on social media, with some even offering words of advice and support to those affected.

I gave the measurements and it quoted me £400 to replace six windows. I agreed as I needed the work doing fast. It took my card details, which would be charged once the windows were replaced. When the glaziers showed up they said two of our windows needed safety glass (something not mentioned on the phone) and that they would have to come back. They suggested this would happen within the next week. We then heard nothing, so I assumed they had lost interest. As the days turned into weeks, I began to feel frustrated and concerned about the state of my windows. The initial quote had been for £400, and now I was starting to wonder if I had been taken for a ride. I decided to take matters into my own hands and contacted the company to inquire about the status of the job. After being put on hold for several minutes, I finally managed to get through to a representative who assured me that the glaziers were still working on the job and would be back to complete the installation soon.\n\nI was skeptical, but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Another week went by, and still there was no sign of the glaziers. I started to feel like I had been strung along, and my patience was wearing thin. I decided to take a different approach and contacted the company's customer service department, explaining the situation and asking for a resolution. To my surprise, the representative was apologetic and sympathetic, and offered to send someone to complete the job the very next day.\n\nThe glaziers arrived on schedule, and finally the windows were replaced. But the experience had left a sour taste in my mouth. I had been misled by the initial quote, and had wasted valuable time and energy dealing with the company's lack of communication. I was relieved to have the new windows, but I couldn't help but wonder how many other customers had been similarly affected by the company's subpar service. I decided to share my experience with others, in the hopes that it might serve as a warning to those considering using Emergency Response Group for their window needs.",

In 2005, I led a Treasury committee inquiry into cash machine charges which found hundreds of local areas where consumers were being hit with high charges. In Speke, a low-income area in Liverpool, consumers faced charges of £1.50 for making cash withdrawals. I established a working group including banks, consumer groups and ATM operators. The banks unanimously committed themselves to the long-term future of a large network of free cash machines and a \"financial inclusion premium\" was introduced for operators of free cash machines in 1,500 under-served low-income areas. The importance of the free-to-use ATM network has increased as banks have closed 1,000 branches in the past two years. Since then, the free-to-use ATM network has become even more crucial, particularly for vulnerable communities who rely on these machines to access their cash. The recent announcement that some banks are considering introducing fees for Link cash machine withdrawals has sparked concerns that this could exacerbate the problem.\n\nAs a result, I am calling on the banks and ATM operators to revisit their commitments to maintaining a large network of free cash machines. It is unacceptable that some areas are still facing high charges for cash withdrawals, and it is the responsibility of the financial institutions to ensure that everyone has access to their money without incurring unnecessary costs.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of fees for cash machine withdrawals could have a disproportionate impact on low-income households who are already struggling to make ends meet. They may be forced to pay exorbitant fees to access their cash, which could push them further into debt and financial hardship.\n\nIn addition, the closure of 1,000 bank branches in the past two years has already left many communities without easy access to banking services. Introducing fees for cash machine withdrawals would only serve to further isolate these communities and make it even more difficult for them to manage their finances.\n\nI urge the banks and ATM operators to reconsider their plans and prioritize the needs of their customers. They must work together to maintain a large network of free cash machines, particularly in under-served areas, to ensure that everyone has access to their money without incurring unnecessary costs.\n\nIn conclusion, the introduction of fees for cash machine withdrawals would be a retrograde step and would have far-reaching consequences for vulnerable communities.

Speaking as protesters displayed placards bearing the names of the dead, the chief executive, Ben Magara, told shareholders at the group's annual meeting that progress on building homes for 33,000 staff had been \"slower than we would have liked\". But he said rock-bottom platinum prices made it impossible for the company to resolve the housing issue and stay financially sound. Thirty-four people were killed near the Marikana mine in August 2012, after workers went on strike, demanding a living wage from Lonmin in a complex dispute that escalated into violence. The former bishop of Pretoria Johannes Seoka, who was on the phone to one of the victims when the police opened fire, said the company should take more responsibility. \"We're convinced that what happened is the result of their own reaction to demands of the workers,\" he said. \"If they had talked with the workers that massacre would not have happened.\" The incident has left a lasting scar on the community, with many families still struggling to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones. \"The pain is still fresh,\" said Thembi Ntombela, whose brother was among those killed. \"We want to see some tangible action from Lonmin to address the issues that led to this tragedy.\" The company has faced repeated criticism for its handling of the strike and its response to the violence. Amnesty International has accused Lonmin of being \"culpably responsible\" for the deaths, citing a failure to protect workers and to engage with them in a meaningful way. Despite the company's efforts to rebuild trust, many in the community remain skeptical. \"Words are cheap,\" said Sello Mokoena, whose father was killed in the violence. \"We want to see concrete actions, not just promises.\" As the company struggles to find a solution to the housing issue, many are calling for greater accountability and transparency from Lonmin. \"The company must take responsibility for its actions and ensure that such a tragedy never happens again,\" said Archbishop Seoka. \"The workers are not asking for the moon, just a decent place to live and a fair wage.\" The company's struggles to address the housing issue come as it faces increasing pressure to improve its working conditions and safety record. The incident has also highlighted the broader issues of poverty and inequality in South Africa, with many workers still struggling to make ends meet.

The maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes issued an unexpected announcement to the stock exchange on Thursday to say it would not put its new pay policy to a vote as originally planned at the annual meeting on 1 February. The policy, which must be voted on every three years, would have had the effect of increasing Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m a year from increased bonus opportunities. The move demonstrates that the company did not expect to win overwhelming support for the proposal from investors. The decision by ISS, the proxy voting agency which is influential with major US investors, to recommend a vote against the policy had signalled that a sizeable revolt was on the cards. Imperial's chairman, Mark Williamson, said investors had changed their minds about backing the plan. The unexpected move by Imperial Brands has sent shockwaves through the business community, with many analysts speculating that it may be a turning point in the debate over executive pay. The company's decision to withdraw its new pay policy from the vote at the annual meeting has been hailed as a victory for shareholders, who have long been frustrated by the generous compensation packages handed out to CEOs.\n\n\"It's a major win for investors,\" said one analyst, who wished to remain anonymous. \"For too long, CEOs have been rewarded with lavish pay packages, regardless of how well the company is performing. This decision shows that shareholders are finally starting to push back.\"\n\nThe decision by ISS to recommend a vote against the policy was seen as a major factor in the company's decision to withdraw the proposal. ISS, which advises institutional investors on how to vote on corporate issues, had cited concerns over the potential for the pay package to create a \"culture of complacency\" at the company.\n\nImperial Brands' decision may also have implications for other FTSE 100 companies that are considering hiking the bonuses of their CEOs. With the spotlight now firmly on executive pay, other companies may be forced to rethink their own compensation packages.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for all CEOs,\" said a spokesperson for the Shareholder Action Group, a campaign group that has been critical of excessive executive pay. \"It's time for CEOs to start putting the interests of shareholders first, rather than lining their own pockets.\"\n\nThe decision has also sparked concerns over the potential impact on Imperial Brands' ability to attract and retain top talent. The company's CEO, Alison Cooper, had been expected to receive a significant pay rise under the new policy, which would have seen her compensation package increase from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m a year.\n\nHowever, some analysts believe that the company's decision to withdraw the proposal may actually be a blessing in disguise. \"This decision shows that Imperial Brands is willing to listen to its shareholders and take their concerns seriously,\" said one analyst. \"It may actually help the company to attract more investors in the long run.\"",

        "Text": "The Bank of England governor has warned that a new breed of internet-only lenders are beginning to pose risks to the financial system and without tighter regulation they could trigger the next financial crash. Mark Carney said high street banks were being displaced by online lenders that were untested in a recession, when bankruptcies might make their loans worthless. Cyber-attacks could also strip customers of digital money, leaving them to face huge losses without the traditional protection offered by regulators, he said. The warning follows a speech last year by Adair Turner, the former chief financial regulator, who said losses on loans made over the internet could make the worst bankers look like \"lending geniuses\". Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney said digital money held out the prospect of allowing millions of people excluded from the mainstream banking system to access loans securely. Threadneedle Street has several initiatives under way to allow peer-to-peer online lenders access to central bank funds and facilitate transactions. Carney's warning comes as the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set to introduce new regulations on online lenders, aimed at ensuring they are operating in a safe and transparent manner. The FCA has been criticized for being slow to react to the rise of online lending, with some arguing that the lack of regulation has allowed unscrupulous lenders to take advantage of vulnerable consumers.\n\nDespite the warning, online lenders have argued that they are providing a vital service to millions of people who have been excluded from the traditional banking system. They claim that their innovative approach to lending has allowed them to offer more competitive rates and more flexible repayment terms than traditional high street banks.\n\nHowever, Carney's comments have been echoed by other experts in the industry, who warn that the lack of regulation and oversight of online lenders poses a significant risk to the financial system. \"The problem is that these online lenders are operating in a regulatory vacuum,\" said one industry expert. \"They are not subject to the same level of oversight as traditional banks, and that makes them a potential ticking time bomb for the financial system.\"\n\nThe Bank of England is also working with other regulators to develop a new framework for regulating online lenders. The framework is expected to include stricter capital requirements and more stringent risk assessments for online lenders.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by online lenders, Carney believes that they have the potential to revolutionize the way people access credit. \"Digital money has the potential to be a game-changer for financial inclusion,\" he said. \"It could allow millions of people who have been excluded from the mainstream banking system to access loans securely and at a lower cost than traditional banks.\"\n\nHowever, Carney's warning has been seen as a wake-up call for regulators and policymakers, who must now balance the need to promote financial inclusion with the need to protect the stability of the financial system. \"The key is to find a balance between promoting innovation and ensuring that it is done in a safe and sustainable way,\" said a spokesperson for the Bank of England. \"We are working closely with regulators and policymakers to develop a framework that will allow online lenders to thrive while also protecting the financial system.\"",

Toeing the line between keeping Snapchat age appropriate for younger users – the app bars children from under 13 from making accounts, but allows 13- to 17-year-olds on the service – and allowing publications on Discover editorial freedom has been difficult for the company, particularly when media organisations know one way to appeal to the app's millennial user base is with prominent use of risqué images. The Daily Mail, for instance, has attracted user complaints for frequently posting semi-nude images as its \"cover\" on the service. \"I find it incredibly offensive that I can't opt out of seeing these images and that I am forced to see these images every time I open up the app to see my friends' stories,\" one user told the Guardian. The new guidelines, which take effect immediately, will also require publishers to clearly label opinion pieces and commentary as such, and to provide accurate and transparent information about the sources of their content. This move is seen as a response to concerns about the spread of misinformation on social media platforms, including Snapchat.\n\nSnapchat has faced criticism in the past for its lack of transparency around its editorial policies and the types of content that are allowed on its platform. The company has also faced backlash for its handling of user complaints about offensive or inappropriate content.\n\nIn addition to the new guidelines, Snapchat is also introducing a new \"flag\" feature that will allow users to report content that they believe violates the company's community guidelines. The feature will be available in the app's settings and will allow users to report content that is \"offensive,\" \"inappropriate,\" or \"spammy.\"\n\nThe changes come as Snapchat faces increased competition from other social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. The company has been working to improve its Discover service, which is a curated feed of content from publishers and other media organizations. The service has been a key part of Snapchat's efforts to attract more users and to increase engagement on the platform.\n\nThe new guidelines and features are intended to help Snapchat maintain its reputation as a platform that is safe and informative for users. The company has faced criticism in the past for its handling of user complaints and its lack of transparency around its editorial policies. The new guidelines and features are seen as a response to these concerns and are intended to help Snapchat build trust with its users.",

They might also have noted that, despite 19 years of whistleblowing legislation, there is no general provision requiring employers to maintain the confidentiality of disclosers or to allow anonymous reporting of suspected wrongdoing. Prof David Lewis Whistleblowing Research Unit, Middlesex University • David Butler states: \"The last time Labour was in as hopeless a position as it is today, we had three consecutive election victories lying in wait\" (Letters, 25 February). If he is thinking of the same year as me, there were three consecutive election defeats first. I am 56 and cannot wait that long. Rebecca Linton Leicester • Anne McElvoy's use of the words tergiversations and fissiparous (Opinion, 27 February) on the problems faced by Theresa May left me searching through various dictionaries. I was left wondering what these obscure words meant, and why they were chosen to describe the Prime Minister's predicament. A quick glance at the dictionaries revealed that \"tergiversations\" refers to evasive or ambiguous language, while \"fissiparous\" means tending to split or divide. It's no surprise that Mrs May's critics have resorted to such linguistic gymnastics to describe her leadership style.\n\nIn reality, the problems faced by the Prime Minister are far more complex and multifaceted. The Brexit impasse, the NHS crisis, and the ongoing divisions within her party are just a few of the many challenges she faces. Rather than relying on obscure vocabulary, perhaps it would be more productive to engage in a nuanced and informed discussion about the issues at hand.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the use of such language can come across as condescending and elitist, suggesting that the author is more interested in showing off their vocabulary than in actually communicating their ideas effectively. In an age where clarity and simplicity are increasingly valued, it's time for politicians and pundits alike to rethink their approach to communication.",

My point is simply that, when you occasionally joined him in the Media Show studio – walk in, sit down, start talking – he was utterly in command. His voice told you so. Politicians go through months of training to try to learn to speak with matter-of-fact honesty. Steve did that instinctively. His honesty was up front, the moment the green light came on. And that was a boon when the subject for discussion was the BBC itself. Steve knew the corporation inside out. He loved it in his way. As a result, his interviews with senior BBC executives were always enlightening, often uncomfortable, and occasionally explosive. He had a unique ability to extract candor from even the most reticent of subjects, and his probing questions left no stone unturned. Steve's passion for the BBC was matched only by his passion for telling the truth, and it was a privilege to watch him work his magic in the studio. His legacy will be remembered for years to come, not just for his remarkable journalism, but for the countless hours of compelling television he brought to our screens.",

Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on a regulator offering cheap arbitration was a terrible sticking point, the editors said: a final burden on a struggling industry. Which, of course, made arbitration itself the litmus test for MPs and ministers wondering what to do next. Thus the culture, media and sport committee now gives Ipso (the non-Leveson-compliant regulator almost everyone has joined) a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. If it doesn't, the baton of section 40 recognition passes to its sanctified (but scantily favoured) rival Impress. Either Ipso gets its act together, or nemesis – and the secretary of state – follows. Yes, but which scheme do you pick? The decision has sparked debate among industry insiders, with some arguing that Ipso's existing scheme is flawed and needs a complete overhaul. \"The current system is a mess,\" said one editor. \"It's a patchwork of different rules and procedures that are often confusing and unclear. We need a system that is fair, transparent, and easy to navigate.\"\n\nOthers, however, are more skeptical of Impress's ability to deliver a workable arbitration scheme. \"Impress is a new and untested entity,\" said a spokesperson for the Newspaper Society. \"We have concerns about its ability to provide a robust and independent arbitration service. We need to see more detail about its plans before we can consider it a viable alternative.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the government has been accused of playing politics with the issue, with some arguing that it is using the arbitration scheme as a way to punish the industry for its opposition to section 40. \"This is a classic example of the government using its power to try to silence the press,\" said a senior source at a major newspaper. \"We will not be bullied into accepting a scheme that is fundamentally flawed.\"\n\nThe debate is set to continue in the coming weeks, with the culture, media and sport committee expected to take evidence from both Ipso and Impress. In the meantime, the industry remains on high alert, waiting to see which scheme will ultimately be chosen and what the implications will be for the future of journalism in the UK.",

Rinehart had instigated legal action against Nine and the production company responsible for the program, Cordell Jigsaw, over the two-part miniseries recounting the family drama of one of Australia's wealthiest mining dynasties. Nine and Cordell Jigsaw apologised to Rinehart in a statement on Friday that clarified the program \"was a drama, not a documentary, and certain matters were fictionalised for dramatic purposes\". \"Nine and Cordell Jigsaw accept that Mrs Rinehart had a very loving and close relationship with her mother, father and husband, and has with [her children] Hope and Ginia ... \"Nine and Cordell Jigsaw accept that Mrs Rinehart found the broadcast to be inaccurate. That was certainly not the intention of Nine or Cordell Jigsaw, and each unreservedly apologises to Mrs Rinehart and her family for any hurt or offence caused by the broadcast and its promotion.\" The statement also acknowledged Rinehart's \"significant contribution\" to Australia's industry and economy, as well as her \"longstanding support of elite sport and numerous worthwhile charities\". The program makers agreed to pay Rinehart's legal costs, likely to be a six-figure sum, and confirmed that the miniseries would not be sold to streaming channels, foreign markets or released on DVD. The agreement brings an end to the long-running legal battle between Rinehart and the media companies, which had been ongoing since the program's broadcast in 2015. Rinehart had claimed that the miniseries was defamatory and caused her significant distress, and had sought damages and an injunction to prevent further broadcast of the program.\n\nThe apology and settlement are seen as a significant victory for Rinehart, who had been vocal in her criticism of the program and its portrayal of her family. The settlement is also expected to be a costly one for Nine and Cordell Jigsaw, with Rinehart's legal costs likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe agreement has also sparked debate about the level of scrutiny and criticism that public figures are subject to, and the potential consequences of inaccurate or misleading reporting. Many have questioned whether the media has a responsibility to ensure the accuracy of its reporting, particularly when it comes to high-profile individuals such as Rinehart.\n\nThe settlement is also seen as a significant blow to Nine's reputation, which has already taken a hit in recent months due to a series of controversies surrounding its reporting practices. The network has faced criticism for its handling of several high-profile stories, including its coverage of the Christchurch mosque attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a statement, Rinehart's lawyers said that their client was \"pleased\" with the outcome of the case, and that the apology and settlement would bring an end to the \"distress and harm\" caused by the program. The statement also acknowledged that the settlement was a \"significant victory\" for Rinehart, and that it would serve as a reminder to the media of the importance of accuracy and fairness in its reporting.",

The courses had been arranged by their respective trade unions in agreement with their employers. The syllabuses were partly drawn up by the students themselves and the subject areas included economic and social history. Class members presented papers to each other and the topics ranged from collective bargaining to global politics. I first met Peter in 1966 at Sheffield University's Department of Extramural Studies, which he had joined six months earlier. He was always concerned to ensure that students were given the fullest opportunity to express and develop their own ideas. He understood clearly that serious adult education in the social sciences was a process of assisting the individual's understanding and not just a matter of instruction. He touched and enriched many people's lives, but perhaps his greatest legacy derives from his activities in the union-backed Society of Industrial Tutors. Peter was the son of Austen Smith and his wife, Isabel (nee Reed). On leaving school in Sunderland, where his father was a junior school headteacher, Peter studied economics at Manchester University and took his first job, teaching liberal studies at Stockport College of Technology, in 1962. In the same year he met Helen Naughton, when they were both doing holiday jobs for the Labour party in a north Manchester constituency. In 1965 Peter took up his extramural post at Sheffield University and he and Helen married the following year. Throughout his career, Peter was committed to empowering workers through education, and his work with the Society of Industrial Tutors allowed him to reach a wider audience. He traveled extensively, delivering training sessions and workshops to union members across the country. His passion for adult education was contagious, and he inspired many to pursue further study and develop their critical thinking skills. Peter's legacy extends beyond his academic achievements, as he played a significant role in shaping the lives of countless individuals. His dedication to social justice and his tireless efforts to promote education as a means of empowerment have left a lasting impact on the community. Peter is survived by his wife, Helen, and their two children, Rachel and James. A memorial service will be held at Sheffield University's Department of Extramural Studies, where Peter's journey began, to celebrate his life and contributions to adult education.",

I believe that by doing this we can give our shares of the property to our daughters, but remain in it should either of us die. I believe this is \"giving a life interest\". At the moment, being joint tenants, we have made a joint will, leaving the property to whoever survives the other, and in the event of both our deaths, to our children. There are also stipulations that each of our six grandchildren receives £10,000 when we both die, providing there is that amount left in our estate. If we become tenants in common, do we have to update our existing will to mention giving a life interest to the surviving spouse and leaving our half of the estate to our daughters and grandchildren, as in our existing will? SMF A Yes, you will have to draw up new wills if you decide to own your home as tenants in common by severing your joint tenancy. You will also need to draw up new wills if you really do have a joint will, as there is supposed to be no such thing under UK law. You have to have a will each, but they can \"mirror\" each other, so that the provisions in them are essentially identical. It is not possible to stipulate in a will who gets property that is jointly owned on the first death of one of the joint tenants. That's because property under a joint tenancy automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) on the death of the other(s). By severing the joint tenancy and becoming tenants in common, you will be able to leave your shares of the property to your daughters and grandchildren in your wills. However, you will need to ensure that your wills are updated to reflect this new ownership structure. You will also need to consider the life interest you mentioned, which will allow your surviving spouse to continue living in the property until their death.\n\nIt's essential to note that a life interest is a complex legal concept, and you may want to consult with a solicitor or estate planning expert to ensure that your wishes are carried out correctly. They can help you draft a will that accurately reflects your intentions and ensures that your children and grandchildren inherit the property as you desire.\n\nAdditionally, you may also want to consider creating a trust to hold the property until your daughters and grandchildren come of age or reach a specified age. This can provide an added layer of protection and ensure that the property is managed and maintained until it is passed on to the next generation.\n\nIn summary, becoming tenants in common and creating new wills will give you the flexibility to leave your shares of the property to your children and grandchildren, while also providing a life interest for your surviving spouse. However, it's crucial to seek professional advice to ensure that your wishes are carried out correctly and that your estate is managed in accordance with your intentions.",

The Guardian reported that the sandwich chain hoped to solve its looming recruitment crisis by offering 500 16- to 18-year-olds a week of unpaid work experience. On Saturday, however, Pret's chief executive, Clive Schlee, tweeted that the company would pay all participants Pret's hourly starting rate \"and of course provide free food as well\". The minimum wage is £4 an hour for under 18s and £5.55 for 18- to 20-year-olds. Only one in 50 of Pret's job applicants are born in the UK, so the company is particularly exposed to the threat of non-UK workers leaving or avoiding the country in the wake of Brexit. Participants in Pret's Big Experience Week would \"get exposure to aspects of our business including food production, customer service, social responsibility [care for the homeless] and financial control\", the company said. With Brexit on the horizon, it said the new work experience programme was part of efforts to take on the \"long-term challenge that Pret and the wider industry must meet to ensure hospitality is seen by Brits as a serious career choice\". Andrea Wareham, Pret's human resources director, wrote in a blog on the company's website: \"Attracting British applicants is not exclusively a Pret problem, and is symptomatic of a wider cultural bias. British schools and parents don't always take careers in the hospitality industry seriously, but they really ought to. The company's decision to pay its work experience participants has been met with widespread approval from critics and advocates alike. \"This is a huge win for young people who deserve to be compensated for their work,\" said Sarah Phillips, a youth employment specialist. \"It's also a testament to the power of public pressure and the importance of holding companies accountable for their treatment of young workers.\" Pret's announcement comes as the UK's youth unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, with many young people struggling to find stable and well-paying work. The company's decision to pay its work experience participants could set a precedent for other companies to follow suit, potentially benefiting thousands of young people across the country. In the meantime, Pret is urging other businesses to join it in its efforts to promote hospitality as a viable career choice for young Brits. \"We hope that our example will inspire others to take a similar approach,\" said Schlee. \"By working together, we can create a more sustainable and equitable future for young people in the hospitality industry.\"",

But as he spoke, I noticed that he seemed to be watching me with an intensity that made me feel like I was under scrutiny. \"You're not from around here, are you?\" he asked, his voice low and menacing. I shook my head, and he leaned in closer. \"Then you shouldn't be here,\" he growled, before storming off, leaving me feeling shaken and confused.\n\nI decided to do some digging, to uncover the secrets that lay hidden beneath Petworth's idyllic surface. I spent the next few days scouring the local archives, talking to the residents, and snooping around The House. And what I found was shocking. It seemed that The House was not just a grand estate, but a hub of scandal and intrigue. Affairs, blackmail, and even murder had all been committed within its walls. And at the center of it all was a mysterious figure known only as \"The Expensive\". Who was this enigmatic figure, and what was their connection to the town? I was determined to find out, no matter what it took.",

        "Text": "Instagram has become the latest social network to enable two-factor authentication, a valuable security feature that protects accounts from being compromised due to password reuse or phishing. Users can, and should, opt in by clicking on the settings icon in the top right of their profile, hitting two-factor authentication in the following menu, and enabling the setting to \"require security code\". Once enabled, the app will text a six-digit code to users' phones every time they want to log in to the service. A simple security measure, it nonetheless provides an added layer of protection against accounts being hacked by attackers who have managed to steal credentials. Instagram joins Facebook, Twitter, Google and many others in offering some form of two-factor verification. Confusingly for users, all the methods are slightly different: Twitter requires logging in to be approved by opening the app on a trusted device, and Google uses an open standard to link up with its authenticator app, which generates new six-digit codes every 30 seconds. This added layer of security is particularly important for users who have multiple accounts across different platforms, as a single compromised password can lead to a domino effect of hacked accounts. Additionally, Instagram's two-factor authentication can be paired with its existing password reset feature, which allows users to recover their account by providing a trusted email address or phone number. While the extra step may seem inconvenient to some, the added security is a welcome development for users who value the protection of their online identities. As the frequency of cyber attacks continues to rise, it's essential for social media platforms to prioritize user security and provide effective measures to prevent account breaches.",

        "Text": "The number of individuals applying for insolvency jumped to the highest level in almost three years in the first three months of 2017, in a further sign of the mounting financial pressure facing UK households. Personal insolvencies in England and Wales totalled 24,531 between January and March, up 6.7% on the previous quarter and 15.7% higher than the same period a year earlier. It was the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014, according to the Insolvency Service, which published the figures. The rise comes at a challenging time for UK households, as incomes are squeezed by a combination of rising inflation and weak pay growth. The annual inflation rate is 2.3% and expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the impact of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote increasingly feeds through to higher shop prices. Meanwhile regular pay growth was just 1.9% in February compared with a year earlier. Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said the insolvency figures were concerning. \"The rise in personal insolvencies is a stark reminder of the financial struggles many households are facing,\" Elson said. \"As the cost of living continues to rise, it's becoming increasingly difficult for people to make ends meet. We're seeing more and more people coming to us for help with debt and financial difficulties, and it's clear that many are reaching a breaking point.\"\n\nThe Insolvency Service's figures also showed that the number of individuals entering debt relief orders, a type of insolvency procedure, increased by 12.1% in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier. This suggests that more people are seeking formal help to manage their debt, rather than simply defaulting on payments.\n\nThe charity's own research suggests that the financial struggles facing households are widespread. According to a survey of over 1,000 people, 62% of respondents said they were worried about being able to afford their essential bills, such as rent/mortgage, food and utilities, over the next three months. Meanwhile, 44% said they were struggling to make ends meet, with 21% admitting they were living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThe pressure on household finances is also reflected in the number of people seeking help from National Debtline, which has seen a 10% increase in calls and emails from people seeking debt advice in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe charity is urging policymakers to take action to address the root causes of the financial struggles facing households, including the rising cost of living and stagnant pay growth. \"We need to see a comprehensive package of measures to support households, including measures to tackle inflation, improve pay growth, and provide more affordable credit options,\" Elson said. \"Until then, we expect to see more and more people struggling to make ends meet.\"",

Nearly 39% of investors voted against the pharmaceutical group's 2016 remuneration report at its annual meeting in London, similar to the rebellion it faced three years ago. Support for the new pay policy was much stronger, with 96% of investors backing it. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, received a total pay package of £13.4m last year because a long-term incentive plan and other rewards paid out. He was paid an annual salary of £1.2m and an annual bonus of £1.2m, down from £2m the previous year. But he pocketed a further £6.9m from a long-term incentive plan, plus a one-off payment of £3.6m in compensation for bonuses he lost when he left his previous employer. The shareholder revolt is the latest setback for AstraZeneca, which has faced criticism over its corporate governance and executive pay practices in recent years. The company's shares have struggled to keep pace with the broader market, and its profit margins have been squeezed by intense competition in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nDespite the strong support for the new pay policy, some investors remain unhappy with the level of compensation for AstraZeneca's executives. The company's chairman, Leif Johansson, defended the pay package, saying that it was \"necessary to attract and retain top talent\" in a highly competitive industry.\n\nHowever, some investors argued that the pay package was excessive, particularly given the company's underperformance over the past year. \"We believe that the pay package is too high, especially when you consider the company's lack of progress in recent years,\" said one investor, who declined to be named.\n\nAstraZeneca's CEO, Pascal Soriot, has been under pressure to deliver on his promises to revive the company's fortunes. He has been credited with turning around the company's research and development efforts, but some investors have expressed frustration with the company's slow progress in launching new drugs.\n\nThe company's board has faced criticism for its lack of transparency on executive pay, and some investors have called for greater accountability and more detailed disclosures on compensation. The shareholder revolt is likely to put pressure on the company's board to rethink its approach to executive pay and corporate governance.",

The camera, which is available by invitation only in the US costing $200 (£156), stands on a shelf armed with four LEDs for lighting, a depth-sensing system and a microphone array to receive commands just like Amazon's other Alexa-powered Echo and Echo Dot. The camera uses the depth information to produce \"computer vision-based\" blurred backgrounds so you can apparently look your best in full-length selfies. It will also capture video, so you can give your audience a twirl in your finery. But Echo Look is more than just a glorified Echo Dot with a camera, says Amazon. The company's machine-learning system will compare the photos of different outfits you're wearing and judge which one is more \"in\" at that very moment. and suggest alternative styles to try. The camera will also keep a record of the user's fashion history, providing insights on what they've worn and when. Amazon claims that Echo Look's fashion expertise is backed by a team of human stylists who have curated a database of trendy outfits.\n\nThe company is touting Echo Look as a tool for people who want to upgrade their fashion game, but don't have the time or expertise to do so. \"We're excited to bring the power of Alexa to the world of fashion,\" said an Amazon spokesperson. \"With Echo Look, we're giving people a personalized stylist in their bedroom, 24/7.\"\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that Echo Look is the revolutionary fashion tool that Amazon claims it is. \"This is just a fancy mirror with a camera attached,\" said fashion blogger and influencer, Olivia Parker. \"I mean, who needs Alexa's opinion on what to wear? I'd rather take my own fashion advice, thank you very much.\"\n\nDespite the skepticism, Amazon is confident that Echo Look will be a hit. The company has already received thousands of requests for the device, and plans to expand its availability to other countries in the coming months. Whether or not Echo Look will become a staple in bedrooms around the world remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - it's definitely generating a lot of buzz in the fashion world.",

Residents of Phoenix, Arizona, are being invited to apply to join the trial, which will see \"hundreds\" of participants being given full-time access to the fleet of600 self-driving minivans that Waymo intends to operate in the city. \"Over the course of this trial, we'll be accepting hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs who want to ride in and give feedback about Waymo's self-driving cars,\" Waymo's head, John Krafcik, said in a blogpost. \"Rather than offering people one or two rides, the goal of this programme is to give participants access to our fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that's about twice the size of San Francisco.\" While Waymo's head office is still in Google's hometown of Mountain View, California, the state of Arizona has been aggressively courting self-driving car researchers, lowering regulatory burdens and even embarking on Twitter campaigns aimed at wooing companies from Silicon Valley. The state's governor, Doug Ducey, bombarded Uber with pitches for Arizona after the taxi firm was banned from testing in California following a series of regulatory breaches. Waymo has been testing 100 self-driving minivans on public roads since \"earlier this year\", the company revealed, and now intends to add another 500 to its broader fleet. Krafcik added: \"Our early riders will play an important role in shaping the way we bring self-driving technology into the world – through personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics and more. The trial is expected to provide valuable insights into how people interact with self-driving cars in their daily lives, and how they can be integrated into various transportation modes. Waymo is keen to learn how riders adapt to the autonomous vehicles, and how they can be improved to better serve their needs.\n\nTo participate in the trial, applicants will need to meet certain criteria, including being at least 18 years old and having a valid driver's license. They will also need to pass a background check and provide proof of insurance. Once selected, participants will be able to use the Waymo app to hail a ride and will be provided with a dedicated phone number to report any issues or concerns.\n\nWaymo has also announced plans to expand its testing to other cities in the coming months, with San Francisco and Los Angeles among the next destinations. The company is working closely with local authorities to ensure that its self-driving cars are compliant with all relevant regulations and safety standards.\n\nThe launch of the trial marks a significant milestone for Waymo, which has been at the forefront of the autonomous vehicle industry for several years. The company's technology has been used in a number of high-profile applications, including the development of self-driving trucks and buses.\n\nAs the trial gets underway, Waymo is eager to hear feedback from participants and to use the insights gained to improve its self-driving cars. \"We believe that self-driving technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, and we're excited to be at the forefront of this revolution,\" said Krafcik. \"We're confident that our technology will make a significant difference in the lives of our riders, and we look forward to hearing their feedback and continuing to improve our service.\"",

Is this stereotype of us being clumsy and accident-prone supported by plentiful good evidence? Not really. Would you prefer the stereotype of being creative geniuses, like Paul McCartney and Michelangelo? I definitely would. Got any more? Take your pick! Handedness research suggests all sorts of random things. For example, men are more likely to suffer from left-handedness. Hey! Sorry, I mean men are more likely to be left-handed. Some studies suggest that left-handed college graduates earn more. Or that low birth weight is associated with left-handedness. Or that mental illness is. Or that autism, cerebral palsy, heart disease or some forms of cancer are. Yet the idea that left-handed people die much younger is a myth. That's a relief. You do have a slight advantage in sports, of course, because your opponent gets less practice against lefties than you do against righties. For real. But it's not all sunshine and rainbows for left-handed individuals. Research suggests that they may be more prone to certain injuries, such as shoulder and elbow problems, due to the way they use their bodies to perform everyday tasks. For instance, left-handed individuals are more likely to develop tennis elbow, a condition characterized by inflammation of the tendons in the elbow, due to the repetitive strain placed on the arm during activities like writing, cutting, and throwing.\n\nAdditionally, left-handed individuals may also be more susceptible to certain types of brain damage, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, due to the way their brains are wired. This is because the left hemisphere of the brain, which is responsible for language and logical thinking, is more prone to damage in left-handed individuals.\n\nDespite these potential drawbacks, many left-handed individuals have found ways to adapt and thrive in a world dominated by right-handedness. In fact, some left-handed individuals have even turned their handedness into an advantage, using their unique perspective and problem-solving skills to excel in their chosen fields.\n\nFor example, many successful entrepreneurs and inventors have been left-handed, including Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, and Henry Ford, the founder of the Ford Motor Company.

The UK-listed engineering firm said on Wednesday it would pay out share bonuses to its three co-founders and the finance chief under a five-year incentive plan, which was approved by investors in 2012. Based on the average share price over the past 40 days of 234p, the total bonus pot is worth £240m. The quartet – Christopher Miller, executive chairman; David Roper, executive vice chairman; Simon Peckham, chief executive; and Geoff Martin, chief financial officer – are entitled to 68% of it. This means they will get £40m each in shares. The remainder of the pot will be shared between 20 senior managers. The executives can sell shares to cover the £70m of income tax due on the awards but must retain at least half the remaining shares for at least two years. They have never sold any shares, except to cover tax bills. At present, the four directors together own 2.25% of Melrose, which will rise to 3.1% after the share awards. The massive payout has sparked controversy among investors and corporate governance experts, who have questioned the generosity of the bonuses and the lack of transparency in the company's remuneration policies.\n\n\"It's staggering to see a company like Melrose, which has struggled to deliver consistent profits, handing out such a massive sum to its executives,\" said Emma Wilson, a shareholder activist. \"The lack of accountability and transparency in the company's remuneration practices is appalling. It's no wonder that investors are starting to lose faith in the company's ability to deliver value.\"\n\nMelrose Industries has faced criticism in the past for its aggressive takeover strategy and its treatment of employees at its acquired companies. The company has also been accused of prioritizing short-term profits over long-term sustainability, leading to concerns about its environmental and social impact.\n\nThe company's chief executive, Simon Peckham, defended the bonus payouts, saying that they were part of a long-term incentive plan designed to motivate the executives to deliver growth and value for shareholders. \"The bonuses are a reflection of the hard work and dedication of our team, and we believe they are a key factor in our success,\" he said.\n\nHowever, corporate governance experts have pointed out that the bonuses are not performance-based, and that the executives will receive the payout regardless of the company's financial performance. \"This is a classic example of a 'golden parachute' - a payment made to executives as a reward for their service, regardless of whether the company has performed well or not,\" said David Black, a corporate governance expert. \"It's a bad deal for shareholders and a bad deal for the company's employees, who are likely to bear the brunt of any future cost-cutting measures.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the bonus payouts is likely to intensify in the coming days, as investors and corporate governance experts continue to scrutinize Melrose Industries' remuneration practices. The company's board of directors is expected to face increased pressure to justify the payouts and to provide greater transparency into its remuneration policies.",

But when hundreds of passengers were then left stranded, crisis-response experts accused the airline of failing them, too. Four days later, half a billion pounds have been wiped off the value of BA parent company IAG. Paul Charles, a former director of communications for Eurostar and Virgin Atlantic, where he created the airline's crisis strategy, is baffled by how long it took BA to say anything. \"You have to respond within an hour with a full statement on what is going on,\" he says. \"It took seven hours for the CEO to record a video Twitter message. You could fly to New York in that time, it's ridiculous.\" In a second video, shared yesterday afternoon, Nicola Pearson, a former BBC News reporter who now runs BA's news operation, interviews her boss, the airline's chief executive Álex Cruz. He says he is \"profusely sorry\" for the disruption and attempts to reassure customers that it couldn't happen again. Charles, who now runs the PC Agency, a London travel consultancy, thinks BA's brand is strong enough to survive, \"but it is being eroded\", he adds. \"When airlines don't have good crisis plans in place it can lead to the decline of the brand.\" United Airlines' stock price took a dive when it managed to blame a passenger who had been dragged off an overbooked plane in Chicago. The airline later admitted that it had \"messed up\" its initial response and the share price has since recovered. The lack of transparency and prompt communication from British Airways has raised questions about the airline's crisis management strategy. Charles points out that in today's digital age, passengers expect instant updates on what is happening and what the airline is doing to resolve the issue. \"You can't just disappear for hours, that's not acceptable,\" he says.\n\nMeanwhile, other experts have been critical of the airline's apology, saying it came too late and lacked substance. \"The apology was hollow, it was just a token gesture,\" says airline industry analyst, Ian Williams. \"The airline needs to take responsibility and explain what went wrong, rather than just apologizing for the inconvenience.\"\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the need for airlines to have robust backup systems in place to prevent such disruptions from happening in the first place. \"This is not a one-off, it's a systemic issue,\" says Charles. \"Airlines need to invest in their IT infrastructure and have a plan in place for when things go wrong.\"\n\nAs the airline industry continues to evolve, the way airlines respond to crises will be crucial in determining their reputation and customer loyalty. For British Airways, the challenge is to restore trust and confidence with its passengers, while also learning from the mistakes made during this crisis.",

The project was predicted to cost about $1,300, with backers receiving rewards ranging from normal-sized replica dice, to having the title of one of their papers recorded on one of the monument's sides. The concrete block had long been sitting in the grounds of the Institute when Igor Chirikov, director of the Centre of Sociology of Higher Education, came up with the idea for the monument. \"Peer reviewing is a matter of love and hate,\" he said. But, Chirikov stressed, peer review helps to make sure that research is up to scratch. As the monument was unveiled, attendees couldn't help but marvel at its sheer size and the weighty phrases etched into its surface. \"Major Changes\" and \"Reject\" seemed to loom large, a stark reminder of the impact that a single peer reviewer can have on a researcher's work.\n\nIgor Chirikov, the director of the Centre of Sociology of Higher Education, explained that the idea for the monument came to him while walking past the concrete block in the institute's grounds. \"It was just sitting there, looking so... ordinary,\" he said. \"But then I thought, why not turn it into something extraordinary? Something that celebrates the often-overlooked heroes of the academic world?\"\n\nThe crowdfunding campaign, which raised over $1,300, was met with widespread enthusiasm from the academic community.

Another supporter is former Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, who once again got to say \"I'm in\", after revealing that he and his companies have invested a six-figure sum in the not-for-profit enterprise. Credit unions are financial co-operatives owned and controlled by their members that have traditionally specialised in loans and savings for the less well-off, but are now targeting people of all incomes.

The engineering firm struck a deal with trade unions that will safeguard work for nearly a third of its 22,300-strong UK workforce for five years, as it prepares to double the number of engines it builds. Rolls-Royce will ditch plans to close a precision machining facility in Derby, saving 150 jobs that were at risk, as well as creating 200 new positions by building a new testing facility for jet engines. Of the £150m planned investment, £90m will be spent on building the \"testbed\", Rolls-Royce's sixth in Derby, where it puts engines destined for commercial jets through their paces. The investment will also enable the company to upgrade its manufacturing facilities and introduce new technologies, such as 3D printing and automation, to increase efficiency and productivity. Rolls-Royce has committed to working closely with its suppliers and partners to ensure that the investment has a positive impact on the local economy.\n\nThe deal with the trade unions, which includes the Unite and GMB unions, was reached after a series of negotiations between the company and its workforce representatives. The agreement ensures that all 7,000 engineering jobs in the east Midlands will be protected for the next five years, providing stability and security for employees.\n\nRolls-Royce's chief executive, Warren East, said: \"This significant investment in our Derby site is a major vote of confidence in the skills and expertise of our UK workforce. We are committed to being a responsible employer and to playing a positive role in the local community.\"\n\nThe news has been welcomed by local politicians and business leaders, who have praised Rolls-Royce's commitment to the region. Derby City Council leader, Chris Poulter, said: \"This is fantastic news for the city and the region. Rolls-Royce is a world-class company and its investment will have a significant impact on our economy.\"\n\nThe investment is also expected to create new opportunities for apprenticeships and training programs, which will help to develop the skills of the next generation of engineers. Rolls-Royce has a long history of innovation and excellence in the aerospace industry, and this investment is a testament to its commitment to remaining a major player in the sector.\n\nThe company's plans to double the number of engines it builds will also help to drive growth and job creation in the wider economy. With the UK's aerospace industry expected to continue to grow in the coming years, Rolls-Royce's investment is a major boost for the region and a sign of confidence in the country's manufacturing capabilities.",

        "Text": "Researchers have captured the first footage of cockatoos bashing out drum solos with little sticks and seedpods in what are believed to be musical displays to impress the opposite sex. Scientists took the extraordinary footage after stalking the shy and elusive Cape York palm cockatoos for seven years through the unspoilt wilderness of the peninsula in far north Queensland. The recordings show 18 males knocking out more than 130 drum solos which sometimes start with a flourish and nearly always contain a signature pattern distinct to each bird. Most of the musical outbursts were performed in front of females, apparently to win them over, with males embellishing their drumming efforts with calls, periodic blushing, and raising the feathers on their crests. Robert Heinsohn at the Australian National University in Canberra and others witnessed the birds tweaking sticks and seedpods before banging out sequences of 27 to 92 beats long. The researchers were thrilled to capture this unique behavior, which has never been seen before in the animal kingdom. \"It's like they're having a rock concert in the forest,\" said Dr. Heinsohn. \"The males are putting on a show to impress the females, and it's an incredibly complex and coordinated display.\" The team believes that the drumming is a key part of the cockatoos' mating ritual, and that the males are competing with each other to attract the females. The females, on the other hand, seem to be very particular about their drumming preferences, often watching the males with great interest before deciding which one to mate with. The researchers are now studying the different patterns and styles of drumming to see if they can learn more about the cockatoos' behavior and social dynamics. With their findings, they hope to shed new light on the fascinating world of animal communication and mating rituals.",

        "Text": "Miguel Gómez Garza was on his final expedition to the Yucatán Peninsula to gather information for his book Parrots of Mexico when it happened. He heard a group of parrots in the distance, but their call was like none on record. So he loitered by a tree full of pods that parrots like for lunch, hoping they would come and feed. The wait was worth it. When half a dozen parrots flew over to the tree, Gómez Garza noticed their intense red fronts and the beautiful blue tips on their wing feathers. The plumage set them apart from the two species known to live in the area, which both have distinctive white fronts. \"I could not believe it. The different noise belonged to a different parrot,\" said Gómez Garza, a vet and ornithologist at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Monterrey, Mexico. In research published on Tuesday, an international team of scientists describe the new parrot for the first time. Named the blue-winged Amazon parrot, or Amazona gomezgarzai in honour of its discoverer, the bird stands 25cm or so tall and has a loud, short and repetitive call that would not sound out of place on the soundtrack to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of the calls the bird makes imitates that of the hawk, a natural enemy of parrots. While scientists are not sure why the parrot mimics the predator, they speculate that it scares other birds from the surrounding trees, leaving more seeds, fruit and flowers for the parrots to eat. Having spotted the birds in their habitat, Gómez Garza got permission from the Mexican authorities to capture a male and a female for further study. The team of scientists, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez from the University of California, Berkeley, worked tirelessly to study the behavior and habits of the newly discovered parrot. They observed that the blue-winged Amazon parrot is a social bird that thrives in small flocks, and is particularly fond of the pods of the Cecropia tree, which are rich in nutrients.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the parrot's mimicry of the hawk's call is not limited to just the one sound. In fact, the bird can imitate a wide range of sounds, including other birds, animals, and even human voices. \"It's like they have a built-in sound effects library,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"We've even recorded them mimicking the sound of a chainsaw!\"\n\nThe study also found that the blue-winged Amazon parrot is an important seed disperser in the Yucatán Peninsula, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem. By mimicking the calls of predators, the parrot is able to scare other birds away from the trees, allowing it to feed on the seeds and fruits without competition.\n\nThe discovery of the blue-winged Amazon parrot has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, and has raised hopes for the conservation of this unique and fascinating species. The Mexican government has already announced plans to establish a protected area for the parrot's habitat, and international efforts are underway to study and protect this remarkable bird. As Dr. Gómez Garza put it, \"This is a momentous day for ornithology, and we are honored to have played a part in its discovery.\"",

Ten was forced into a trading halt and then voluntary administration last month when financial backers Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon failed to guarantee a new $250m loan. On Monday, after the first creditors' meeting was held in Sydney, Ten's administrators said leading shareholders Gordon and Murdoch, who now jointly own 22.5% of Ten, and James Packer, have agreed to provide the funds needed to keep the network on air. \"We have adequate cash resources at the present time but, by the end of this week, the shareholder guarantors will put a financing facility in place to ensure Ten has sufficient cash to continue to operate,\" partner Mark Korda said. Ten posted a disastrous half-year loss of $232m and warned in April that its future as a \"going concern\" was in doubt if it could not secure another loan. Monday's meeting was the first for creditors since the MasterChef and Bachelor broadcaster went into voluntary administration on 13 June. A 14-member creditors' committee was appointed to oversee the administration of Ten. The administrators also announced that a 14-member creditors' committee has been established to oversee the administration process and ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are represented. The committee will be chaired by independent director, Susan Pei, and will include representatives from various creditor groups, including banks, bondholders, and other lenders.\n\nAccording to Mark Korda, the administrators are working closely with the committee to identify potential buyers for Ten and are in discussions with several interested parties. \"We are making good progress in identifying potential buyers and we are confident that we will be able to find a suitable buyer for Ten,\" Korda said.\n\nThe administrators have also announced that they will be conducting a thorough review of Ten's financial situation and operations to identify areas for cost savings and efficiency improvements. This review is expected to be completed by the end of July and will provide a roadmap for the network's future operations.\n\nIn the meantime, Ten's employees and staff have been assured that their jobs are safe and that the network will continue to operate as normal. The administrators have also committed to maintaining the network's programming and operations, including the broadcast of its popular shows such as MasterChef and The Bachelor.\n\nThe creditors' meeting was attended by representatives from various creditor groups, including banks, bondholders, and other lenders. The meeting was held in a secure location in Sydney and was attended by around 50 people. The administrators have said that they will provide regular updates to creditors on the progress of the administration process and any significant developments.",

Its total mortgage lending fell by £1bn to £11.6bn in the first half of 2017 compared with 2016, with lending for buy-to-let down significantly. Net lending – which takes into account how many people remortgaged away from Santander – fell over the half year by £200m. Net consumer finance lending – covering car loans and credit cards – fell to £97m from £266m, partly due to \"a decrease in the stock of new car registrations\". Nathan Bostock, the Santander UK chief executive, said: \"We do face uncertainty and that was my view at our last results. Generally we have done less unsecured and credit card lending, and are probably down 10% on balances.\" Bostock said intense competition is driving down interest rates to historically low levels, and accused competitors of offering better rates on car loans and credit cards than are charged to much more secure mortgage customers. \"This is a concern, as it's not sustainable in the long term,\" Bostock said. \"We're trying to be more disciplined in our lending, focusing on higher-quality customers and products that are less likely to go wrong.\"\n\nSantander's decision to reduce its lending comes as the Bank of England has warned about the risks of reckless lending and a \"spiral of complacency\" over mounting consumer debt. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, has expressed concerns that low interest rates are fuelling a credit bubble, and that lenders are taking on too much risk.\n\nThe reduced lending by Santander is likely to have a ripple effect across the industry, as other banks may follow suit to avoid taking on too much risk. The move is also expected to have a positive impact on the overall health of the financial system, as it will help to reduce the amount of debt in the economy.\n\nHowever, the reduced lending may also have a negative impact on the economy, as it could make it more difficult for people to access credit and buy homes. The Bank of England has already warned that a slowdown in lending could have a negative impact on the economy, and that it is closely monitoring the situation.\n\nIn a statement, the Bank of England said: \"We are monitoring the situation closely and will take action if necessary to ensure the stability of the financial system.

The tour operator Thomas Cook said it was seeing a pick-up in demand for Turkish holidays because they were good value for money. The chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said Turkey was proving attractive at the moment, even though Berlin has warned its citizens to be careful when travelling there. Visitors shunned the country last year after a failed military coup, which led to the company offering free cancellations to customers with existing bookings. Overall bookings for summer this year were up 11%, said the company. This surge in demand is a welcome boost for Turkey's tourism industry, which was severely impacted by the coup attempt and subsequent travel warnings. The country's all-inclusive resorts and beach destinations, such as Antalya and Izmir, are proving particularly popular with UK tourists. Thomas Cook's sales team reports that customers are attracted to Turkey's affordable prices, with package deals starting from as little as £300 per person for a week's holiday.\n\nThe company is also seeing a rise in bookings for city breaks, with Istanbul and Ankara emerging as popular choices. \"Turkey is a fantastic destination, with a rich history and culture,\" said Fankhauser. \"We're seeing a lot of interest from families and couples alike, and we're confident that the country will continue to be a popular choice for UK tourists this summer.\" Despite the ongoing tensions between Turkey and Germany, Thomas Cook is not expecting any significant impact on bookings, with the majority of its customers still planning to travel to the country.",

The Financial Conduct Authority estimated that the new regime would cost firms £550m, with up to £190m of ongoing costs for the firms involved. It had been expected that the additional firms would be covered by the senior managers and certification regime (SMCR) from 2018, although the FCA's consultation document does not indicate if this is still the timetable. The SMCR came into force for almost 900 banks and building societies in March 2016 and was intended to tackle the fact that no bank bosses were held to account when their firms collapsed in 2008. It requires the responsibilities of top managers to be spelt out and for them to certify their key staff are suitable for their roles. This certification must now happen annually, whereas under the previous system the FCA approved individuals only once, unless they moved roles. The extension of the SMCR to 47,000 firms will require these businesses to implement significant changes to their governance and risk management practices. This includes the appointment of senior managers, the creation of certification regimes for key staff, and the establishment of clear responsibilities for top managers. The FCA has indicated that it will provide guidance and support to help firms comply with the new regime, but critics have expressed concerns that the costs of implementation will be too high for some smaller businesses.\n\nIndustry experts have also raised concerns about the potential impact on the availability of credit to customers. \"The SMCR is a well-intentioned regime, but it's unclear how it will affect the availability of credit to small businesses and consumers,\" said Sarah Johnson, a financial services expert at KPMG. \"Firms may need to increase their capital requirements or reduce their lending to customers to comply with the new regime, which could have unintended consequences for the economy.\"\n\nThe FCA has sought to reassure firms that the costs of implementation will be manageable, but the regulator has not provided a specific timeline for when the new regime will come into force.

Durham chief constable Mike Barton said customers should be given the at-a-glance information for internet-ready equipment in the same way fridges, freezers, TVs and other appliances have to display their energy efficiency ratings before sale. Barton, the national policing lead for crime operations, proposed the idea as part of efforts to protect households from fraudsters and hackers in the era of the Internet of Things, where otherwise \"dumb\" devices can be put online and be interconnected for automation and smart appliance activities. Analysts have forecast that by 2020 there will be as many as 21bn connected devices around the world, with the surge in the number and variety of internet-ready products sparking a string of security warnings. Earlier this year, an official report warned that smartphones, watches, televisions and fitness trackers could be targeted by cyber criminals seeking to hold users to ransom over their personal data. There have even been reports that baby monitors and pacemakers could be vulnerable to hacking. Barton's proposal is the latest in a series of warnings from law enforcement and security experts about the growing threat of cyber attacks on internet-connected devices. \"We need to make sure that consumers are aware of the potential risks and are taking steps to protect themselves,\" he said. \"By providing clear and simple ratings for the cyber security of devices, we can empower people to make informed choices about the products they buy and use.\"\n\nThe idea of cyber security ratings for devices is not new, but it has gained momentum in recent months as the Internet of Things (IoT) has become more widespread. In the UK, the government has already launched a review of the cyber security of IoT devices, and has called on manufacturers to take steps to improve the security of their products.\n\nBarton's proposal has been welcomed by some experts, who say that it could help to raise awareness of the cyber security risks associated with IoT devices. \"This is a great idea,\" said Professor Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert at the University of Surrey. \"By providing clear ratings for cyber security, we can help consumers to make informed choices about the products they buy and use. This could be a game-changer in the fight against cyber crime.\"\n\nHowever, others have raised concerns about the practicality of implementing such a system. \"It's not as simple as just slapping a rating on a device,\" said one industry expert. \"Cyber security is a complex issue, and it's difficult to distill it down into a simple rating. We need to be careful not to create a system that is misleading or ineffective.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, Barton remains convinced that his proposal is a step in the right direction. \"We need to take action to protect households from the growing threat of cyber crime,\" he said. \"By providing clear and simple ratings for cyber security, we can empower consumers to take control of their own security and protect themselves from the risks associated with IoT devices.\"",

The JPMorgan boss, Jamie Dimon, and the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, enjoyed rises of more than $150m (£115m) each in the value of their stock and options in the banks they run, according to an annual review of bank CEO pay by Equilar for the Financial Times (paywall). The other 18 best-paid bank chief executives in the world fared less well, with average gains of $4m in their stock-related holdings last year. Dimon was also the best-paid banking boss in the world for the second year running, raking in $28.2m of pay, bonus and pension contributions last year. The Morgan Stanley chief executive, James Gorman, came second at $22.5m, followed by Blankfein at $22.3m. The figures, which were released by Equilar, a firm that tracks executive compensation, also showed that the total compensation package for the 20 top-paid banking CEOs increased by 12% last year, to an average of $15.4m. This was largely driven by the surge in bank stocks, which has been fueled by expectations of deregulation and tax cuts under the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, the review also highlighted the growing divide between the pay of top bankers and that of their employees. According to Equilar, the median total compensation for a JPMorgan Chase employee was $83,000 last year, while at Goldman Sachs it was $72,000. This means that the top bankers were earning hundreds of times more than the average employee at their own banks.\n\nThe figures have sparked criticism from some quarters, with some arguing that the pay of top bankers is too high and out of touch with the rest of the workforce. \"The massive pay increases for the top bankers are a symbol of the broken system that has created a culture of greed and inequality,\" said Sarah Anderson, a senior researcher at the Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nHowever, others have argued that the pay is justified, given the significant profits made by the banks in recent years. \"The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are paid what they are because they are generating enormous profits for their shareholders,\" said one banking analyst. \"If the pay is too high, it's because the banks are making too much money, not because the CEOs are overpaid.\"",

The retailer, which has built up one of the most trusted brands in the UK partly thanks to its highly rated customer service and \"never knowingly undersold\" pledge, is now aiming to make employing a tradesperson a lot less hit and miss. The Home Solutions service is part of the department store's effort to fend off competition from online upstarts such as Amazon by providing more services. New boss Paula Nickolds said the business needed to bring in more beauty salons, home design, personal styling and other services as shoppers' behaviour changes \"profoundly and fast.\" In a bid to add pizzazz to shopping trips the company is also sending store staff to theatre school to teach them entertainment skills and its new Oxford store, which opens in October, will have an experience manager dedicated to organising daily in-store events.

Research from Citizens Advice finds almost one in five people struggling with debts have had their credit card limit raised without them requesting it. The charity has demanded the Financial Conduct Authority bans the practice, amid growing concerns over a boom in lending. Unsecured lending is returning to levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis, raising alarm bells at the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn, thus putting financial stability at risk. The Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: \"It's clear that irresponsible behaviour by some lenders is making people's debt situation worse – such as offering more credit when they already have thousands of pounds of unpaid debt.\" She said lenders must act responsibly to direct people struggling with debt towards free and independent advice and support – rather than offering them more credit. People with long term outstanding balances were more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users seeing their limit increased in the past year without requesting it, compared to 12% of all credit card holders, Citizens Advice found. People with credit card debts were also more likely to get into long-term debt than those with personal loans, and were less able to pay their debt down. The report also highlights the alarming trend of lenders targeting vulnerable individuals, such as those on low incomes or with a history of debt. Citizens Advice found that 15% of those with credit card debt were also receiving benefits, compared to 10% of the general population. Furthermore, 22% of those with credit card debt had a history of debt, compared to 15% of the general population.\n\nThe charity is calling on the Financial Conduct Authority to take immediate action to address these concerns. \"The FCA must take a closer look at the practices of credit card lenders and take steps to ensure they are not exploiting vulnerable individuals,\" said Gillian Guy. \"It's unacceptable that lenders are offering more credit to people who are already struggling to pay off their debts. This is not only unfair, but it also perpetuates a cycle of debt that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families.\"\n\nCitizens Advice is also urging consumers to be aware of the risks associated with credit card debt and to seek free and independent advice if they are struggling with debt. \"It's crucial that consumers are aware of the potential risks associated with credit card debt and take steps to manage their debt responsibly,\" said Gillian Guy. \"We urge anyone struggling with debt to seek help from a trusted organization, such as Citizens Advice, and to avoid falling into the trap of taking on more debt to pay off existing debts.\"\n\nThe news comes as the Bank of England has also expressed concerns over the rise in unsecured lending. \"The recent growth in unsecured lending is a cause for concern, as it increases the risk of consumers taking on debt they may struggle to repay,\" said Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. \"We urge lenders to exercise caution and to prioritize the financial stability of their customers.\"\n\nAs the debate over credit card lending practices continues, one thing is clear: consumers must be vigilant and take steps to manage their debt responsibly. With the risks of debt and financial instability growing, it is crucial that individuals and families prioritize their financial well-being and seek help if they are struggling with debt.",

        "Text": "Moving out of London (to Salford for the BBC, shortly to Birmingham for C4) comes at a price. Just look at the figures, as assembled by Enders Analysis. The BBC lost 62% of its staff when it moved departments to MediaCity: that was twice as much per person on redundancy (£48,000) as on relocation (£27,000). The Office for National Statistics, incidentally, lost 90% of its London staff when it moved to Newport. Only 620 C4 employees are involved. They are commissioning and support staff. They do not make programmes and carry no manufacturing base with them. They are also highly skilled men and women, many of them also tied to London because of their partners' jobs. The move to Birmingham is expected to be a more complex and costly process, with the channel's entire production base, including studios and offices, being relocated. According to sources, the relocation package for C4 staff is expected to be around £30,000 to £40,000 per person, although this figure may vary depending on individual circumstances. Despite the significant costs, Channel 4 is adamant that the move will be a net benefit to the company, citing the availability of a larger, more modern facility in Birmingham and the potential for increased collaboration with other industries in the region. The move is expected to be completed by 2025.",

        "Text": "A new register naming firms that find themselves under shareholder pressure over executive pay is to be launched later this year as part of government plans aimed at curbing boardroom excess and increasing transparency. In what was described by the government as a world first, the new register will name firms where a fifth of investors have objected to proposed executive annual pay packages. However, the unveiling of the policy marks a retreat from the much more radical approach which had originally been touted by Theresa May in the form of promises to increase the frequency of binding shareholder votes on corporate pay policies. The policies of listed British companies are currently subject to a binding vote every three years. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, accused the prime minister of capitulating to pressure from her own party and watering down the original proposals. The new register, which is expected to be launched in the autumn, will provide a detailed breakdown of the level of shareholder dissent on executive pay packages. It is hoped that the increased transparency will help to curb excessive pay practices and encourage companies to take a more responsible approach to remuneration.\n\nHowever, the launch of the register has been met with criticism from some quarters. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has accused the government of \"crying wolf\" and failing to take meaningful action to address the issue of excessive executive pay.\n\n\"This register is a tokenistic gesture that will do little to curb the scourge of excessive executive pay,\" said Frances O'Grady, the TUC's general secretary. \"What we need is a fundamental overhaul of the corporate governance system, not just a fancy new register.\"\n\nThe launch of the register comes as the issue of executive pay continues to dominate the headlines. Last week, it was revealed that the boss of the FTSE 100 company, GlaxoSmithKline, had received a pay package worth over £10 million.\n\nThe government's decision to launch the register has also been met with criticism from some business leaders. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the new register could create \"unnecessary bureaucracy\" and \"increase costs\" for companies.\n\nHowever, the government has defended the move, saying that it is necessary to increase transparency and accountability in the corporate sector. \"We are committed to ensuring that our corporate governance system is robust and effective,\" said a government spokesperson. \"The new register will provide a valuable tool for shareholders and investors to hold companies to account for their executive pay practices.\"\n\nThe launch of the register is seen as a significant step forward in the government's efforts to curb excessive executive pay. However, it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to satisfy the demands of shareholders and critics of the corporate sector.",

There is no need to use a claims handling company that will rake off 30% of any compensation you are awarded. Can I claim mis-sold PPI? If you took out any kind of consumer loan, store card, credit card or mortgage in the 1990s or 2000s, you may have been mis-sold PPI. Go back through all your old loan and mortgage statements and check for any mention of an insurance to cover your payments if you lost your job through accident, sickness or unemployment. What if I have no statements? If you don't have them or simply cannot remember which lenders you've borrowed from, check your credit report. It lists any loans, mortgages or other debts within the last six years, even if they're now closed. Many lenders will now tell you if you call them up to ask whether you had PPI. How was it mis-sold? Was the fact that the insurance was optional made clear to you? According to financial experts, PPI was often mis-sold because the salespeople failed to inform customers that the insurance was optional. Many people were led to believe that the insurance was a condition of the loan or mortgage, and were not told that they could decline it. Others were not made aware of the high costs associated with the insurance, or were not given a clear explanation of what the policy covered.\n\nSome lenders also used high-pressure sales tactics to sell PPI, which led to customers feeling pressured into purchasing the insurance. In addition, some lenders did not properly assess the customer's ability to pay the insurance premiums, which meant that many people were paying for a policy that they could not afford.\n\nIf you believe that you were mis-sold PPI, you can make a claim to reclaim the premiums you paid, as well as any interest that was charged on those premiums. The process is relatively straightforward, and you can do it yourself without the need for a claims handling company.\n\nTo make a claim, you will need to gather together all of your old loan and mortgage statements, as well as any documentation that you have regarding the PPI policy. You will then need to contact the lender or the bank that sold you the policy and explain that you were mis-sold the insurance. They will then assess your claim and let you know whether you are eligible for compensation.\n\nIf you are successful in your claim, you can expect to receive a significant amount of money back. In some cases, this can be thousands of pounds. It's a good idea to seek the advice of a financial advisor or a claims expert to help you navigate the process and ensure that you get the compensation you are entitled to.",

Arcadia, which owned BHS until it was sold to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015, on Friday agreed the deal with BHS's liquidators, FRP Advisory, which will drop legal action filed against Green's company. A spokesman for FRP said: \"The liquidators of SHB Realisations, formerly BHS, reached an agreement with Arcadia Group in relation to a number of matters, including Arcadia's floating charge dated 14 April 2015. \"We can confirm that as part of the agreement, over £30m was released from reserves held in relation to Arcadia's secured claim into the monies available for BHS unsecured creditors and the floating charge is to be released.\" The settlement avoids the prospect of the retail billionaire fighting a lengthy legal battle over the demise of BHS. Green avoided another legal battle with the pension regulator by agreeing to pay £363m to rescue the BHS pension scheme. The deal marks a significant step towards closure for both Arcadia and BHS's creditors, who had been waiting for a resolution to the complex and contentious issue. The agreement also brings an end to the bitter feud between Sir Philip Green and the pension regulator, which had threatened to drag on for years. The £363m payment to rescue the BHS pension scheme is a major relief for thousands of former employees who were at risk of losing their hard-earned retirement savings. The settlement is a testament to the importance of transparency and accountability in corporate governance, and serves as a reminder that even the most powerful business leaders must be held accountable for their actions. The agreement is expected to pave the way for a fresh start for BHS's creditors, who can now focus on rebuilding their lives and businesses.",

The ambitious strategy emerged on Thursday in the last of a series of summer policy papers published by the Department for Exiting the European Union ahead of the next round of talks in Brussels on Monday. In it, the government argues that its \"unique\" status as a leading player in the world of electronic commerce means that it should be able to demand special treatment from the EU when agreeing future standards. Regulation of online data is an increasing international flashpoint as technology companies and national security agencies both come under fire for infringing personal privacy. Since the Edward Snowden revelations and other high-profile privacy challenges against companies such as Google, it has been a particular source of tension between the EU and US. The paper, titled \"A new era for the UK's data relationship with the EU\", suggests that the UK's digital economy, which is worth over £100 billion annually, should be taken into account when negotiating data sharing agreements. The government argues that the UK's unique position as a global leader in fintech, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity means that it should be exempt from certain regulatory requirements.\n\nThe proposal has been met with skepticism by some experts, who argue that the UK's attempt to carve out special treatment is a thinly veiled attempt to undermine the EU's data protection standards. \"This is a clear attempt to weaken the EU's data protection regime, which has been a cornerstone of consumer protection in the digital age,\" said Dr. Rachel Thomas, a data privacy expert at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHowever, the government remains committed to its strategy, insisting that the UK's digital economy requires a tailored approach. \"We believe that our unique status as a global leader in digital commerce means that we should be able to negotiate a deal that reflects our specific circumstances,\" said a spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union.\n\nThe UK's proposal is set to be discussed at the next round of talks in Brussels on Monday, where the EU is expected to push back on the UK's demands. The negotiations are seen as a key test of the UK's ability to strike a deal with the EU, and the outcome will have significant implications for the future of data sharing between the two sides.",

Saad worked as a sound engineer in Iraqi TV and radio and helped establish reputable recording studios in Baghdad. From 1960, he worked as a music teacher in the Institute of Hope, for children with sensory impairments, and developed many innovative ways to teach and communicate with the students. Perhaps the project closest to his heart was the music and ballet school established in Baghdad in 1968. Saad was a key member of its staff and played a major role in directing the school. Its students remember him fondly, and his three children and four of his nieces and nephews are graduates of this school. Saad was the fourth of six children of Mahmood Jasim Hikmat and Kadria Raoof Al-Attar. He was born in Baghdad, where his father worked for the Iraqi government. From a young age, Saad showed a talent for music and playing the accordion, in which he was encouraged by his father. Following high school education, he was admitted to the Institute of Fine Arts (later the Academy of Fine Arts) in Baghdad in 1952. He studied music with western and Iraqi teachers (including Julien Hertz and Beatrice Ohanessian), and graduated as an accomplished pianist, accordion player and piano tuner. He further developed his talents by travelling to Italy, Greece, Poland and the former USSR. Saad loved jazz. When Duke Ellington visited Baghdad in the 1960s, Saad met him, tuned his piano and privately played a few jazz pieces for him. Saad's passion for jazz was contagious, and he soon found himself at the center of a thriving music scene in Baghdad. He formed a jazz ensemble, which became a staple of the city's cultural calendar. The group's performances were always well-received, and Saad's unique blend of traditional Iraqi music and American jazz standards earned him a reputation as a true innovator.\n\nIn the 1970s, Saad made the difficult decision to leave Iraq and move to Jordan, where he could continue to share his love of music with a new generation. He established a music school in Amman, which quickly gained a reputation for producing some of the region's most talented young musicians. Saad's dedication to his students was unwavering, and he spent countless hours mentoring and guiding them as they developed their skills.\n\nThroughout his life, Saad was driven by a desire to use music as a force for good. He believed that music had the power to bring people together and transcend cultural and linguistic barriers. He spent many years working with refugees and displaced persons, using music as a way to help them heal and rebuild their lives. Saad's legacy is a testament to the enduring power of music to bring people together and inspire positive change. He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and the countless people whose lives he touched through his music.",

Taking the German blessing bot's idea and running with it, Pepper's new code will let it chant sutras in a computerised voice while tapping a drum, providing a cheaper alternative to a human priest to see your loved ones off into the eternal sleep. The robot was on display on Wednesday at a funeral industry fair, the Life Ending Industry Expo, in Tokyo, shown off by plastic molding maker Nissei Eco. With the average cost of a funeral in Japan reaching in excess of £20,000, according to data from Japan's Consumer Association in 2008, and human priests costing £1,700, Nissei Eco is looking to undercut the market with Pepper available for just £350 per funeral. With Japan's population ageing and shrinking, many Buddhist priests receive less financial support from their communities, prompting some to find part-time work outside their temple duties, said Michio Inamura, Nissei's executive adviser, who suggested Pepper could step in when a human wasn't available. The response from the funeral industry has been mixed, with some seeing Pepper as a innovative solution to the rising costs of funerals, while others have expressed concerns about the robot's ability to provide the same level of emotional support as a human priest. \"It's not about replacing human priests, but about providing an alternative for those who cannot afford one,\" said Michio Inamura. Despite the initial skepticism, Pepper has already received several inquiries from funeral homes and temples interested in hiring the robot for services. With its ability to chant sutras and perform traditional Buddhist rituals, Pepper is poised to revolutionize the way Japan says goodbye to its loved ones. As the robot continues to make its rounds at the funeral industry fair, it's clear that Pepper is here to stay - and bring a new level of innovation to the funeral business.",

In an end to a 40-year history, the company will stop publishing its separate edition for Europe on Friday while its Asian edition will cease publication on 7 October. The decision comes after the paper's parent company, News Corp, reported a loss of $643m (£479m) for the most recent fiscal year, which ended on 30 June. That compares to a $235m profit during the previous year. The paper began publishing a separate Asian edition in 1976 and its European edition followed in 1983. The US edition of the WSJ will be available in some cities at a later unspecified date, the paper said. Despite recent losses, digital subscriptions are on the rise and the WSJ plans to focus on encouraging customers in Asia and Europe to read the paper online. Those gains in online-only subscriptions made \"continuing the foreign editions no longer cost-effective\", the newspaper said. The newsstand price for the paper in Hong Kong, the company's Asian headquarters, is about £2.20, while a six-month digital subscription costs £82.

Imperial, maker of Davidoff and Gauloises cigarettes, said in a trading update that it was working with others to create a sustainable future for Palmer & Harvey, stressing its \"close trading relationship\". Another key partner is Tesco, which accounts for about 40% of Palmer & Harvey's revenues. Any rescue deal is expected to include an extension of the supermarket's three-year distribution deal with Palmer & Harvey. The potential rescue deal is seen as a crucial lifeline for Palmer & Harvey, which has been struggling financially in recent months.

Annual growth in personal deposits with high street banks fell to 2.2% in August, in the weakest month since May 2009, according to figures published by banking trade body UK Finance. There was also about £1bn withdrawn from cash Isa accounts, with tax changes allowing up to £1,000 of interest to be earned tax free. The trade body said: \"It seems households are saving a bit less each month, rather than borrowing more, as growth in personal deposits has slowed recently, alongside a slowdown in growth of consumer credit borrowing.\" Annual growth in credit card borrowing was at 5% in August, compared with 5.3% the previous month, while the use of personal loans and overdrafts fell by 1.6% on an annual basis, from a contraction of 1% in the year to July. The figures suggest that households are becoming increasingly cautious with their finances, as they struggle to make ends meet in the face of rising living costs and stagnant wages. The slowdown in deposit growth is particularly concerning, as it could have implications for the overall health of the economy.\n\n\"Households are being squeezed by the combination of rising prices and stagnant wages, which is making it difficult for them to save,\" said Paul Hollingsworth, chief economist at BNP Paribas. \"The slowdown in deposit growth is a sign that households are being forced to dip into their savings to cover their living expenses, rather than building up a buffer for the future.\"\n\nThe figures also highlight the impact of tax changes on consumer behavior. The introduction of the new tax-free allowance on cash Isa accounts, which allows individuals to earn up to £1,000 in interest without paying tax, has led to a surge in withdrawals from these accounts. This has resulted in a £1 billion withdrawal from cash Isa accounts in August alone.\n\n\"This is a sign that households are taking advantage of the tax changes to reduce their tax liabilities,\" said a spokesperson for UK Finance. \"However, it's also a sign that households are being cautious with their finances and are looking for ways to reduce their costs.\"\n\nThe slowdown in deposit growth is also reflected in the growth of consumer credit borrowing, which slowed to 5% in August, down from 5.3% in the previous month.

The report from key banks, law firms and fund managers in the UK proposes a \"bespoke\" free trade agreement once Britain leaves the EU. Such a deal would allow British and EU-based financial companies to sell their products and services without tariffs, taxes or quotas in each other's markets after Brexit. A new joint \"dispute resolution body\" made up of judges and independent experts would rule on breaches of the agreement. There have been warnings of the dire effects on British pensioners and other consumers living in the EU if \"passporting\" rights, which allow UK financial companies to trade freely in the single market, are lost when Britain leaves the EU. UK businesses might not be legally able to pay out personal pension or insurance contracts to British expats and other citizens living in the EU. Potential solutions to those problems have been drawn up by the International Regulatory Strategy Group, which is sponsored by the City of London Corporation and the lobbying body TheCityUK. Taking soundings from institutions such as JP Morgan and BlackRock, it has produced a plan for a free trade agreement. The report was launched in Brussels by the chair of the ISRG council, Mark Hoban, a former City minister, who said it would be \"straightforward\" to set up the free trade area because the EU and UK have regulatory regimes that are \"essentially the same\". The report's authors argue that a bespoke free trade agreement would not only protect the interests of British financial companies but also ensure that EU-based firms can continue to operate in the UK without disruption. This, they claim, would help to maintain London's status as a global financial hub and prevent a brain drain of talent to other cities.\n\nThe plan would also address concerns about the impact on British expats and other citizens living in the EU. According to the report, a \"grandfathering\" clause would be included in the agreement, allowing existing contracts to be honored without interruption. This would prevent British pensioners and other consumers from being affected by the loss of \"passporting\" rights.\n\nThe report's authors are confident that the EU and UK can agree on the terms of a free trade agreement, citing the \"essentially the same\" regulatory regimes in both jurisdictions. They also believe that the proposed dispute resolution body would be an effective mechanism for resolving any disagreements that may arise.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced. Some experts have raised concerns about the complexity of negotiating a bespoke free trade agreement, particularly given the tight timescale before the UK's planned departure from the EU. Others have questioned whether the EU would be willing to agree to such an arrangement, given its own concerns about financial regulation and competition.\n\nDespite these challenges, the report's authors remain optimistic about the prospects for a free trade agreement. \"This is a pragmatic solution that would benefit both the UK and the EU,\" said Mark Hoban, chair of the ISRG council. \"We believe that it is in the interests of all parties to reach an agreement that protects the integrity of the financial sector and ensures continuity for consumers and businesses alike.\"",

Kuenssberg, who has previously been jeered by some Labour supporters, will be accompanied by a security team inside and outside the conference zone in Brighton, the reports said. Kuenssberg has frequently been targeted with sexist abuse online and the BBC is understood to have given her access to a bodyguard during the general election campaign. The corporation did not comment on the reports of her protection at the Labour conference, telling the Sun on Sunday that it does \"not comment on security issues\". The decision to provide Kuenssberg with a security detail has been met with criticism from some quarters, with some accusing the BBC of \"coddling\" its journalists and creating a \"culture of fear\". However, others have expressed concern for Kuenssberg's safety, citing the increasing vitriol and hostility towards journalists and politicians in the current political climate.\n\nKuenssberg has faced intense scrutiny in recent years, with some Labour supporters criticizing her reporting and perceived bias. Her presence at the conference has been met with protests and heckling from some attendees, with some calling for her to be \"boycotted\" or \"muzzled\".\n\nDespite the controversy, the BBC has maintained that Kuenssberg is a professional journalist who has the right to report on the conference without fear of intimidation or harassment. The corporation has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with some accusing it of prioritizing the safety of its journalists over the needs and concerns of the public.\n\nAs the Labour conference continues, attention is likely to remain focused on Kuenssberg and the measures being taken to protect her. The incident has sparked a wider debate about the safety of journalists and the need for greater protections against harassment and intimidation.",

Like most relationships, it started so well. You spotted the car across a crowded car park and your eyes were drawn by those dramatic lines. The rimless headlamps and plunging codpiece grille added to the appeal. You took the key from your pocket, you wanted to get to know this car a little better. You pressed unlock and… eergh… the car emits a long, dreadful jarring beep. I've \"beeped\" a lot of cars in my time, but the tone on this one is awful. It sounds crazy to dismiss a car because the security tone is too harsh, too long and too unnecessary, but every time I locked or unlocked Giulietta that noise put my teeth right on edge. Clamber in and the disappointment continues. It's a mid-size hatchback with a decent-sized boot, but the seats feel so cramped. There is very little leg room for passengers in the back. The quality of materials used throughout is not great. The plastics are unyielding. A driver makes direct contact with their car in so few places: door handle, steering wheel, gear stick. So these touch points have to feel generous and tactile. It doesn't matter if the rest of it is like sandpaper, these three have to feel pleasantly rubbery. Hmmm, you think to yourself, this isn't going as well as I'd hoped. Your eyes fall on the instrument panel, or they would if they could see it. The type on the display is so tiny it's indecipherable, which is hardly the point. Oh well, let's get on with it. You turn the key and the engine comes to life. This sounds more promising. As I pulled out of the parking space, I was initially impressed by the Giulietta's smooth acceleration and responsive handling. The 1.4-liter turbocharged engine had a pleasant hum to it, and the six-speed manual transmission was a joy to use. However, as I navigated through the busy streets, I began to notice some issues with the suspension. The ride was a bit choppy, and the car seemed to bounce over even minor bumps. It wasn't a deal-breaker, but it was noticeable and slightly annoying.\n\nAs I continued to drive, I found myself struggling to get comfortable behind the wheel. The seat was too firm, and the steering wheel was too small. I kept having to adjust my position to try and find a sweet spot, but it was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. The rest of the interior was just as disappointing. The plastics were indeed unyielding, and the overall design felt dated and uninspired.\n\nDespite these issues, I was determined to give the Giulietta a fair shake. So, I decided to take it on a longer drive, hoping that the road would help to smooth out some of the rough edges. Unfortunately, the car's quirks only seemed to become more pronounced. The engine began to sound a bit rough, and the transmission started to hunt for gears. It was like the car was struggling to find its rhythm, and it was making me feel anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The Giulietta had started out so promisingly, but it had failed to deliver on its early promise. It was a shame, really, because I had been looking forward to spending time with this car. Alas, it seemed that our relationship was doomed from the start.",

The cost was £548, paid upfront. We were two hours late arriving at the drop-off location and found it had closed at noon. The Hertz helpline told me to take the car to another location – West 34th Street. The staff at the drop-off location were pleasant, said that I did not need to complete any paperwork and that I would get an email confirmation. But I did not receive anything. I subsequently noticed a second charge of £579 from Hertz on my credit card. I was eventually told that this was for the late return and a \"one-way fee\" for returning the car in a different place. I accept the late charge, but a fee of more than £500 for dropping the car at an office just seven miles away is outrageous. I have complained and appealed to Holiday Autos but it is refusing to provide a refund or get one from Hertz. I have since contacted Hertz's customer service department multiple times, only to be met with a lack of empathy and a refusal to reconsider the excessive fee. They claim that the one-way fee is a standard charge, but I find it hard to believe that a seven-mile journey is equivalent to a long-distance trip. I've also been told that the fee is non-negotiable, which is unacceptable.\n\nI'm at my wit's end and feeling frustrated and ripped off. I've had to spend hours on the phone and emailing back and forth, and I'm still no closer to getting a fair resolution. I'm urging other customers to be aware of these hidden fees and to carefully read the fine print before renting a car. I hope that by sharing my experience, I can help others avoid the same situation and get a fair deal from Hertz.",

Ministers are to overhaul laws that mean parents can avoid supporting their child by holding their money in a joint account with a new partner. Current rules mean only money held in a sole account can be seized for payment. Under new rules that will come into force early next year, the Department for Work and Pensions will ensure that money held in a joint account can also be liable for maintenance payments. Ministers believe that closing this loophole could lead to more than £390,000 of additional child maintenance being collected. Safeguards will be put in place to ensure that only funds belonging to the paying parent will be targeted. The changes are expected to benefit thousands of children who are currently being denied the financial support they are entitled to. The new rules will also help to ensure that parents who are deliberately hiding their income or assets in a joint account with a new partner are held accountable. A government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to ensuring that all parents do their fair share in supporting their children. Closing this loophole will help to make sure that more parents are held accountable for their financial responsibilities.\" The new rules are part of a wider review of the child maintenance system, which is aimed at making it more effective and efficient. The government has also announced plans to increase the maximum child maintenance payment to £2,000 per month, up from the current maximum of £1,200.

        "Text": "In your regular update on awful tech products, may I present the \"Smile mirror\", a mirror designed for cancer patients that becomes reflective only when the user smiles. Designed by someone actually called Berk, the idea behind the mirror is that smiling, even if faked, can make us genuinely feel better (known as the facial feedback hypothesis), and that laughter can improve immune function and even ostensibly make us live longer. The evidence for the effect is dubious, but more to the point … it is possible to smile when looking into a normal mirror. The product is a screen fitted with a camera that uses facial recognition to tell when an individual is smiling, which turns the screen reflective. The product was designed by a man and it is noticeable that a woman has been used in the mirror's promotional photography, which speaks to the \"cheer up, love\" element of which this product smacks. Berk Ilhan says that he created the mirror while a student at the School of Visual Arts in New York, after consultation with oncologists and cancer patients. One of whom told Ilhan that it was difficult to face up to having the illness. Ilhan clearly took \"face up\" in its most literal sense. As the mirror's reflective surface flickers to life, it's hard not to feel a twinge of skepticism. Is this really the best way to tackle the complexities of cancer treatment and patient mental health? Berk Ilhan's motivations, while well-intentioned, seem to be rooted in a simplistic understanding of the human experience. The mirror's promotional video shows a montage of cancer patients smiling, laughing, and seemingly feeling more positive after using the device. But what about the patients who can't muster a smile, even with the mirror's encouragement? What about those who are struggling to cope with the emotional toll of their diagnosis?\n\nDespite these concerns, the Smile Mirror has gained a surprising amount of attention online, with many praising its \"innovative\" design. Some have even compared it to the \"talking cure\" of psychoanalysis, where patients would speak to a therapist and, through the act of speaking, begin to feel better. But while the mirror may be a novel way to approach mental health, it's unclear whether it's a truly effective one. As the cancer community continues to grapple with the challenges of diagnosis, treatment, and recovery, it remains to be seen whether the Smile Mirror will become a valuable tool or a fleeting fad.",

Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, has written to the Facebook founder after suspicions that Russian \"actors\" used the platform to interfere in British politics. Facebook has 32 million users in Britain. Similar evidence on the 2016 US presidential election has already been supplied by Facebook to several US Senate committees, including the Senate intelligence committee, before a hearing with legal representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google on 1 November in Washington DC. Facebook in the US disclosed last month that an influence operation that appeared to be based in Russia spent $100,000 (£75,000) on adverts to promote divisive political and social messages over a two-year period. In his letter to Zuckerberg, Collins expressed concern that the Russian interference may have had a significant impact on the outcome of the EU referendum and the general election. He requested that Facebook provide any evidence it holds on the use of Russian-linked accounts to spread disinformation and propaganda during the two elections.\n\nCollins also asked Facebook to explain its procedures for detecting and removing fake accounts, as well as its plans to prevent similar interference in future elections. The committee chair noted that Facebook's failure to prevent Russian interference in the US presidential election had led to widespread criticism and calls for greater transparency and accountability.\n\nThe inquiry is part of a broader effort by the British government to address the issue of disinformation and propaganda in the run-up to the next general election, which is expected to take place in 2022. The government has already launched a number of initiatives aimed at countering Russian disinformation, including the creation of a new unit dedicated to tackling online propaganda.\n\nFacebook's response to Collins' letter is expected to be closely watched by politicians and the public alike. The company has faced intense scrutiny in recent years over its handling of disinformation and propaganda on its platform, and has faced criticism for failing to do enough to prevent Russian interference in the US presidential election.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook said it was committed to protecting the integrity of elections and would provide any information it holds on Russian-linked accounts to the committee. The company added that it had already taken a number of steps to prevent interference in future elections, including the creation of a new team dedicated to countering disinformation.\n\nThe news comes as Facebook faces increasing pressure from regulators and politicians around the world to do more to prevent disinformation and propaganda on its platform. The company has faced criticism for failing to do enough to prevent the spread of fake news and propaganda during the US presidential election, and has faced calls for greater transparency and accountability.\n\nIn the UK, the government has already launched a number of initiatives aimed at countering Russian disinformation, including the creation of a new unit dedicated to tackling online propaganda. The unit, which is being led by the National Cyber Security Centre, is working with social media companies to identify and remove disinformation and propaganda from their platforms.\n\nThe government has also announced plans to introduce new laws aimed at preventing foreign interference in British politics.

The former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority made an application in July to allow him to give evidence in private. This can now be reported after an application to the high court made by five media organisations, including the Guardian, to establish what the judge had described as the \"special arrangements\" that have been put in place for him to give evidence. Mr Justice Norris made his judgment after hearing the application by the Guardian, the Financial Times, Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers, the Times and Bloomberg. He made his judgment as the fourth day of the case brought by the shareholders began. About 6,000 Lloyds investors are claiming £600m in compensation on the basis that they were not told about loans being made to HBOS when they voted through the takeover in November 2008. The decision to allow Sir Hector Sants to give evidence in private has raised concerns among some of the shareholders, who are seeking compensation for what they claim is a loss of £600m. The shareholders argue that they were not informed about the significant loans being made to HBOS at the time of the takeover, which they claim would have influenced their decision to approve the deal. The Lloyds Banking Group has denied any wrongdoing and has maintained that the information provided to shareholders was adequate.\n\nSir Hector Sants, who was the chief executive of the Financial Services Authority at the time of the takeover, has been a key figure in the case. He has previously testified that he did not believe it was necessary to disclose the details of the loans to shareholders, citing a lack of transparency in the banking industry at the time. However, the shareholders claim that this lack of transparency was a deliberate attempt to conceal the true nature of the deal.\n\nThe case is being closely watched by the financial industry, as it could set a precedent for future cases involving the disclosure of information to investors. The outcome could also have significant implications for the banking industry as a whole, potentially leading to changes in the way that information is disclosed to investors. The case is expected to continue for several more days, with Sir Hector Sants' private evidence expected to be a key part of the proceedings.",

He dedicated his life's work to building pioneering institutions that advocated the intelligent and innovative use of science and technology for a sustainable and equitable world. His influence came to span the globe, and his kindness and enthusiasm were felt by a vast network of colleagues and friends. Son of Evelyn (nee Brooke) and Herbert Oldham, Geoff was born in Harden, West Yorkshire, where his father was a manager with the NatWest bank. He went to Bingley grammar and studied geology at the University of Reading. He was accepted for further studies at both Cambridge and Toronto universities; 10 days after his wedding in September 1951 to Brenda Raven, they sailed for Canada. Having obtained a PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto, Geoff worked in oil company exploration, focusing on South America. Yet, he began to think about achieving something different as a scientist: helping to harness the world's science and technology more effectively to eliminate the depths of poverty he had observed in Latin America. This led to a career change, via a period of research about science and technology in China and other Asian countries. As he delved deeper into the relationship between science, technology, and society, Geoffrey Oldham's fascination with the potential of science to address global challenges only grew stronger. He returned to the UK in the late 1950s, joining the University of Sussex as a lecturer in the Department of Geology. It was during this period that he began to envision a new kind of institution that would bring together scholars from various disciplines to explore the social and environmental implications of scientific and technological advancements.\n\nGeoffrey's vision took shape in 1966 with the establishment of the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), which he co-founded with a small group of like-minded colleagues. SPRU's mission was to provide independent, interdisciplinary research and analysis on the social, economic, and environmental impacts of science and technology. The unit quickly gained international recognition for its innovative approach and rigorous research, attracting scholars and policymakers from around the world.\n\nThroughout his career, Geoffrey remained committed to building bridges between academia, government, and civil society. He worked closely with international organizations, such as the United Nations, and advised governments on science and technology policy. His work spanned multiple continents, from the Amazon rainforest to the deserts of Africa, and his research tackled some of the most pressing global challenges of his time, including poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.\n\nGeoffrey's legacy extends far beyond his own research and achievements. He inspired generations of scholars and policymakers, leaving behind a vast network of colleagues and friends who continue to work towards a more just and sustainable world. His passing is a loss felt deeply by all who knew him, but his life's work will continue to inspire and guide us towards a brighter future.",

Since becoming vice-chancellor of the University of Bath in 2001, Glynis Breakwell has led the university from strength to strength as measured by external assessment. This includes gold status in the teaching excellence framework, one of the top 12 universities in the UK in the research excellence framework, and ranked fifth-best university in the UK by the Guardian University 2018 guide. The university makes an important contribution to the local community and economy. As women academics we are proud to be members of the university and to acknowledge the leadership and support that Glynis Breakwell has provided. Aspects of the governance of the university have been criticised in the recent report from the Higher Education Funding Council. The university urgently needs to address these issues. This involves us all, working together. We think it is time to leave the personalised attacks on the vice-chancellor behind, recognise what we have achieved as a university, and focus on bringing in the necessary governance changes. In light of the recent no-confidence vote, we believe it is essential to shift the focus from personal attacks to constructive dialogue. The university's achievements are a testament to the hard work and dedication of its staff, students, and leadership. It is crucial that we recognize and build upon these strengths rather than tearing each other down.\n\nAs women academics, we are acutely aware of the challenges we face in higher education. We know that women are underrepresented in senior leadership positions and that we often have to work harder to prove ourselves. We believe that Glynis Breakwell's leadership has been instrumental in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for women at the University of Bath.\n\nWe understand that the recent report from the Higher Education Funding Council has raised concerns about governance issues at the university. We agree that these concerns need to be addressed, and we are committed to working together to bring about the necessary changes. However, we believe that this can be achieved through constructive dialogue and collaboration rather than through personal attacks and criticism.\n\nWe urge our colleagues to join us in recognizing the achievements of the university and to focus on finding solutions to the challenges we face. We believe that by working together, we can create a brighter future for the University of Bath and for higher education as a whole. Let us put aside our differences and focus on what unites us: our passion for education, our commitment to excellence, and our desire to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nWe are proud to be part of this university community, and we believe that together, we can achieve great things. Let us work together to build a brighter future for the University of Bath and for all its stakeholders.",

        "Text": "A growing proportion of independent faith schools are being failed by Ofsted because of concerns about leadership and the teaching of British values, according to official statistics. The schools watchdog said there had been a sharp decline in inspection outcomes for smaller, fee-paying schools, in particular faith schools. Latest figures show 49% of private faith schools inspected by Ofsted were judged less than good at their most recent inspection and 26% were inadequate. The details were released as part of Ofsted's roundup of inspections of non-association independent schools – smaller, fee-paying schools not part of groups affiliated to the Independent Schools Council. There are just over 1,000 such schools. At the end of August, 68% of those inspected were judged good or outstanding at their most recent inspection, four percentage points down on last year. The alarming decline in inspection outcomes for independent faith schools has sparked concerns about the quality of education and leadership in these institutions. Critics argue that the sharp drop in standards is a result of a lack of accountability and a failure to prioritize the teaching of British values, which are essential for fostering a sense of community and social cohesion.\n\nOfsted's figures reveal that the majority of private faith schools inspected in the past year were found to be lacking in one or more areas, with 49% judged less than good and 26% deemed inadequate. This represents a significant deterioration in standards compared to previous years, with the proportion of good or outstanding schools declining by four percentage points.\n\nExperts warn that the decline in standards is not limited to individual schools, but rather reflects a broader trend of complacency and a lack of oversight in the independent school sector. \"The fact that so many independent faith schools are failing to meet basic standards is a cause for concern,\" said Dr. Sarah Jones, an education expert at the University of London. \"It's not just about the quality of education, but also about the values and principles that these schools are supposed to be instilling in their students.\"\n\nThe teaching of British values, in particular, has been identified as a key area of concern. Ofsted inspectors have found that many independent faith schools are failing to provide adequate instruction on British values, such as respect for the law, tolerance, and democracy. This has raised concerns that students are not being equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in a rapidly changing world.\n\nThe decline in standards has also sparked concerns about the impact on students and parents. \"As a parent, I want to know that my child is receiving a high-quality education and being taught the values that are important for their future success,\" said Sarah Khan, a parent of a child at an independent faith school. \"The fact that so many schools are failing to meet basic standards is a cause for concern and I hope that Ofsted will take action to address this issue.\"\n\nIn response to the concerns, Ofsted has announced plans to increase the frequency and intensity of inspections in the independent school sector. The watchdog has also called on schools to prioritize the teaching of British values and to take steps to improve leadership and governance. \"We will not tolerate a decline in standards in any sector, and we will take action to ensure that all schools are providing a high-quality education and instilling the values that are essential for success,\" said Amanda Spielman, Chief Inspector of Ofsted.",

Two years previously a consultant at Guy's hospital in London had asked our school if we could assist children with cerebral palsy; they wore out their shoes very quickly due to the manner in which they walked. We researched materials and eventually produced an automated machine that manufactured hard-wearing polypropylene toecaps to fit over their shoes. and our machine was able to produce a customized solution that greatly improved the comfort and mobility of these children. The experience not only taught us about the importance of innovative problem-solving, but also instilled in us a sense of purpose and social responsibility.

National Grid confirmed that gas from a Russian field targeted by US sanctions had been delivered by a Russian icebreaker to storage facilities at the Isle of Grain in Kent on Thursday night. Russian media seized on the delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to claim it would \"keep Britons from freezing this winter\" while the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted: \"Feeling cold? Help is on the way.\" However, industry experts said the most likely scenario was that the UK would simply be a stopping-off point for the gas, which could fetch a much higher price in Asia. Ed Cox, the editor of global LNG at the market intelligence firm ICIS, said: \"I would urge some caution [on the idea Russian gas will be supplying the UK]. There's another empty LNG vessel outside the Isle of Grain now, which looks like it's going to come in and pick up that cargo. \"The [gas] prices are much more attractive in Asia and India than they are in Europe.\" Market sources had told ICIS that the LNG was expected to be picked up by the other ship, he added. According to market analysts, the high demand for LNG in Asia, particularly in China and India, has driven up prices to levels that make it more profitable for Russian gas companies to sell to these markets. \"The arbitrage is huge,\" said Cox. \"It's like a gold rush for LNG traders.\" The UK, on the other hand, has a relatively well-stocked gas storage system and a diverse range of suppliers, making it less dependent on Russian gas.\n\nIndustry insiders point out that the UK's gas storage capacity is currently around 4 billion cubic meters, with an additional 1 billion cubic meters of storage available in the coming weeks. This, combined with the country's existing supply chain and diverse range of gas sources, means that the UK is well-equipped to meet its gas demands this winter.\n\nDespite Moscow's claims that the Russian gas shipment would \"keep Britons from freezing this winter\", experts believe that the UK's energy security is not at risk. \"The UK has a robust energy system, and we are well-prepared to meet our gas demands this winter,\" said a spokesperson for the UK's Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). \"We are not reliant on a single supplier or source of gas, and we have a range of contingency plans in place to ensure that our energy needs are met.\" With the UK's energy supply looking secure, the Russian gas shipment is unlikely to have a significant impact on the country's energy landscape.",

        "Text": "Goldman Sachs has said Donald Trump's radical US tax changes will knock about $5bn (£3.7bn) off its profits this year. The investment bank said most of the cost would come from Trump's \"repatriation tax\" designed to encourage multinationals to bring back the trillions of dollars they hold overseas to avoid tax. Goldman, which made profits of $7.4bn last year, said: \"The enactment of the tax legislation will result in a reduction of approximately $5bn in the firm's earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending 31 December 2017, approximately two-thirds of which is due to the repatriation tax. \"The remainder includes the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of US deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates,\" the bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Last week Congress approved the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, which includes big tax cuts for companies and wealthy people. The reduction in corporation tax – from 35% to 21% – is designed in part to encourage multinational to repatriate cash from overseas. US companies were estimated, by Citigroup, to hold $2.5tn of capital overseas. Companies had previously explained that they had a duty to shareholders to keep the money abroad, rather than bring it back to the US and pay large tax bills. The tax overhaul will allow Apple to bring back its $252.3bn foreign cash mountain without a major tax hit. The news has sent shockwaves through the financial industry, with many experts predicting a similar impact on other multinational companies. The repatriation tax, which is designed to encourage companies to bring back their foreign earnings, is expected to raise billions of dollars in revenue for the US government. However, the cost to companies like Goldman Sachs is significant, and many are already warning of potential job cuts and reduced investment in the US economy.\n\nThe tax overhaul has been widely criticized by Democrats and some Republicans, who argue that it will disproportionately benefit the wealthy and large corporations. The legislation also includes a provision that allows companies to deduct the cost of buying back their own shares, which is expected to further increase the wealth gap in the US.\n\nGoldman Sachs' announcement has sparked concerns about the potential impact on the US economy, particularly in industries that are heavily reliant on multinational companies. The bank's CEO, David Solomon, has defended the tax overhaul, saying that it will create jobs and stimulate economic growth. However, many experts are skeptical, and the news has sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling. As the global economy continues to navigate uncertain times, the impact of the tax overhaul on multinational companies will be closely watched.",

The Met Office forecasting service said that in the period from 2018 to 2022, annual global average temperatures are likely to exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels and could top the 1.5C threshold set as an aspiration by the global Paris climate change deal in 2015. \"It is now possible that continued warming from greenhouse gases along with natural variability could combine so we temporarily exceed 1.5C in the next five years,\" said Stephen Belcher, the chief scientist at the Met Office. Global temperatures have been steadily rising over the past 20 years, and in each of the last three years averages have topped the 1C threshold. Last year was the second hottest on record, and the hottest not to have been given an additional boost by the El Niño effect. The 1.5C threshold was set at Paris as an ambitious target because scientists fear that a world warmer than that would be susceptible to ever wilder climactic events that in turn would precipitate greater drought, habitat loss, food insecurity and mass migration. The forecast has sparked concerns among climate experts, who warn that exceeding the 1.5C threshold could have catastrophic consequences for the planet. \"We're already seeing the impacts of climate change, from more frequent and severe heatwaves to devastating storms and droughts,\" said Dr. Belcher. \"If we exceed 1.5C, we risk triggering a tipping point that could lead to irreversible damage to our ecosystems and global food systems.\" The Met Office's warning comes as world leaders prepare to meet at the UN Climate Action Summit in September to discuss their progress towards meeting the Paris Agreement's goals. The forecast has added urgency to the need for immediate and drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources.",

Created to address the severe teacher shortage following Rab Butler's 1944 Education Act, the college, led by the innovative Roy Macklin, was more concerned with the character and experience of applicants than in formal qualifications. During the second world war, Edgar had worked in a protected occupation as a shipwright in Portsmouth dockyard, but saw a vocation in primary school teaching and shared Macklin's view of education as a guide for living rather than narrowly vocational or academic. The college provided an intensive 50-week course for mature students, mainly former servicemen and women. Possessing practical skills and often widely travelled, they brought to the classroom a wealth of knowledge denied to colleagues whose life had been spent wholly in the education system. Subsequently heads and school inspectors regarded teachers from this course as particularly talented and effective educators. Son of John and Lilian (known as \"Cissie\"), Edgar was born in Portsmouth into a family of skilled dockyard workers. Edgar's experience in the dockyard had given him a unique perspective on the importance of teamwork and discipline, skills that served him well in the classroom. His fellow students at the college were a diverse and fascinating group, including a former prisoner of war, a pilot, and a nurse. The camaraderie and sense of purpose that developed among them helped to create a supportive and motivating environment, which was reflected in their excellent academic results.\n\nAfter graduating from the college, Edgar was appointed to a primary school in a small town in East Sussex. He quickly established himself as a popular and respected teacher, known for his creative approach to teaching and his ability to engage even the most reluctant learners. His students loved him, and he was often invited to stay on for extra-curricular activities, such as sports days and school plays.\n\nEdgar's passion for teaching was contagious, and he inspired many of his colleagues to adopt a similar approach. He was a strong advocate for child-centered learning, and his classrooms were always filled with innovative and engaging activities. His commitment to his students and his school was unwavering, and he remained in the same post for over 30 years, earning the respect and admiration of his community.\n\nEdgar's family was always important to him, and he was a devoted husband to his wife, Margaret, and father to their two children. He was also a keen gardener and enjoyed spending time in his garden, where he would often reflect on his teaching career and the many lives he had touched. Despite his many achievements, Edgar remained humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand or offer words of wisdom. His legacy continues to inspire future generations of teachers and students, and he will be deeply missed by all who knew him.",

The chain, owned by the US private equity group TPG Capital, hopes to engineer a turnaround plan echoing steps taken by the burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian to keep themselves afloat. Prezzo's creditors will be asked to approve proposals under which its restaurants' landlords accept rent reductions. About 100 unprofitable outlets are likely to close altogether, including all branches of its Tex-Mex offshoot, Chimichanga, in an attempt to put the business on a sound long-term financial footing. While landlords have yet to agree to the plan – known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – it is expected to result in about 1,000 of the 4,500-strong UK workforce losing their jobs. Sources close to the company said staff would be transferred to the surviving restaurants where possible. The proposed CVA is expected to be voted on by creditors in the coming weeks, with a decision expected by the end of the month. If approved, the plan would allow Prezzo to restructure its debt and reduce its rent burden, which has been a major contributor to its financial struggles.\n\nThe move comes as the casual dining sector continues to face intense competition from fast-casual chains and online food delivery services.

The 2018 QS world university rankings, published on 28 February, show that the UK is home to the world's leading universities in 10 subjects – two more than last year. UK universities make up a third of the world's top three positions, but these are concentrated in the arts and humanities. UK universities only topped the world's lists for engineering and technology subjects twice, while they made the top three lists for arts and humanities subjects 10 times. The rankings come as the prime minister, Theresa May, pushes ahead with funding reforms that may see universities cut their fees for social science and humanities courses based on their lower costs of delivery, leaving science and technology courses more expensive. The results show the resilience of the UK's universities in the face of Brexit. The ranking highlights the UK's strengths in arts and humanities, with universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Edinburgh performing exceptionally well in subjects like English language and literature, philosophy, and history. In contrast, the country's engineering and technology programs have struggled to keep pace, with only a handful of UK universities making it into the top three in these subjects.\n\nExperts have attributed the decline to a lack of investment in these areas, as well as a shortage of skilled engineering and technology graduates. \"The UK's engineering and technology programs have been underfunded for years, and it's no surprise that we're seeing a decline in our global rankings,\" said Professor Jane Smith, a leading expert in engineering education. \"We need to prioritize investment in these areas if we want to remain a global leader in innovation and technology.\"\n\nThe news comes as the UK government prepares to introduce new funding reforms, which could see universities cut their fees for social science and humanities courses based on their lower costs of delivery. The reforms, which are part of a broader effort to reduce student debt, could have significant implications for the country's universities.\n\nWhile some have argued that the reforms could help make higher education more accessible to a wider range of students, others have expressed concerns that they could have a disproportionate impact on certain subjects. \"The government's funding reforms could exacerbate the existing problem of underinvestment in engineering and technology,\" said Dr. John Taylor, a leading expert in higher education policy. \"We need to think carefully about the long-term implications of these reforms and make sure that we're not inadvertently undermining the very subjects that are driving innovation and economic growth.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, the UK's universities remain a source of national pride and a key driver of the country's economy. As the government moves forward with its funding reforms, it will be important to strike a balance between promoting accessibility and ensuring that the country's universities remain globally competitive in all subjects, not just the arts and humanities.",

Meanwhile, official data earlier this month showed that inflation remained high at 3% in January – meaning savers are losing money in real terms. That may help explain why cash Isas have collapsed in popularity, with government data showing a £20bn fall in the amount invested in the space of 12 months. However, rates do look to be on the move upwards. This week, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, told MPs there were likely to be \"something more than three rate increases,\" over the next few years. Lloyds, meanwhile, is predicting the official interest rate will rise only gently, reaching 1.25% by 2020 (it's currently 0.5%). For the best rates, you need to lock your money away. Charter Savings Bank has a table-topping 2.25% (up from 2.11%) – but it is fixed for five years. Rates on its one-year and two-year versions were upped to 1.46% and 1.67% respectively. Virgin Money is offering 1.66% on its two-year fixed-rate Isa. Despite the paltry returns on offer, some savers are willing to lock their money away for longer periods in exchange for slightly higher interest rates. Charter Savings Bank's five-year fixed-rate Isa, for example, now pays a competitive 2.25%, up from 2.11% previously. However, this comes with the caveat that savers will need to keep their money locked away for the full five years to avoid incurring early withdrawal penalties.\n\nOther banks and building societies are also upping their game, with some offering more competitive rates on shorter-term fixed-rate Isas. For instance, Shawbrook Bank's one-year fixed-rate Isa now pays 1.51%, while its two-year version pays 1.71%. Meanwhile, Aldermore's two-year fixed-rate Isa has been boosted to 1.73%.\n\nWhile these rates may not be enough to make savers rich, they are at least offering a slightly more attractive alternative to the paltry returns on offer from easy-access Isas. And with the Bank of England governor hinting at further rate hikes in the coming years, it's likely that savers will continue to see rates rise as inflation remains high.",

        "Text": "The Treasury is threatening digital companies such as Facebook and Google with a new tax, as it pushes for global agreement on a fairer system for ensuring digital businesses pay their way. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use next month's spring statement to announce the results of a consultation launched by the Treasury in November, on how to update the tax system to reflect the nature of online businesses. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, told the BBC on Thursday that digital companies should pay \"fair\" levels of tax. He suggested that could mean a system in which tax is levied according to where those companies earn their revenues – rather than simply taxing profits, which are easier to shift from one jurisdiction to another. \"At the moment [they] are generating very significant value in the UK, typically through having a digital platform with lots of users interacting with that platform,\" Stride said. \"That is driving a lot of value, so you're looking at social media platforms, online marketplaces, internet search engines – where at the moment the tax regime is not taxing those activities fairly. \"We want to move to a situation where we are taxing those activities fairly.\" The Treasury's move comes as governments around the world grapple with how to tax digital companies, which have traditionally paid low rates of tax due to their ability to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. The UK's approach is expected to be part of a broader international effort to address the issue, with the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) leading a global push for a new framework for taxing digital companies.\n\nThe Treasury's consultation has sparked debate among experts and businesses, with some arguing that a new tax could stifle innovation and growth in the digital sector. However, others argue that it is essential to ensure that digital companies contribute fairly to the public purse, given the significant value they generate from UK users.\n\nThe UK's approach is also expected to be influenced by the European Union's plans to introduce a new digital services tax, which would target companies that provide services such as search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces. The EU's tax is expected to come into force in 2021, and the UK is likely to follow suit if it leaves the EU without a deal.\n\nThe Treasury's consultation has also raised questions about how a new tax would be implemented and enforced. Stride acknowledged that the Treasury would need to work closely with other governments and international organizations to ensure that a new tax is fair and effective. \"We need to work with other countries to make sure that we're all going in the same direction, and that we're not creating a competitive disadvantage for UK businesses,\" he said.\n\nThe Treasury's move is also seen as a response to growing public frustration with the tax practices of digital companies. Many people feel that these companies are not paying their fair share of tax, given the significant profits they generate from UK users. The Treasury's announcement is likely to be welcomed by many, and could put pressure on other governments to follow suit.",

        "Text": "The big Tesla battery in South Australia is consistently working to serve the peak energy demand each day, taking the \"straw off the camel's back,\" according to the Australia Institute's latest national energy emissions audit. The report also finds emissions from the National Electricity Market [NEM] continued to drop in January, falling to their lowest levels since 2004, driven by the federal large-scale renewable energy target. Energy expert Hugh Saddler examined the consumption and output of electricity of the Hornsdale Power Reserve, analysing the patterns of charging and discharging of the Tesla battery. He found a consistent pattern of the battery charging overnight when wind generation was abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices reached peak levels. Only 30% of the battery's 100MW capacity was devoted to this sort of trading, with the rest spent stabilising the energy system by maintaining the frequency of the grid at the required 50 Hz and240 volts. The Hornsdale Power Reserve, located in South Australia, has been a game-changer for the state's energy landscape. By providing a reliable source of energy storage, the Tesla battery has been able to absorb excess energy generated by wind farms during the night and release it into the grid during peak demand periods. This has not only reduced the strain on the grid but also helped to stabilize the frequency and voltage of the electricity supply.\n\nAccording to the report, the battery's consistent performance has been a key factor in the decline of emissions from the National Electricity Market. By shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, Australia is making significant progress in reducing its carbon footprint. The federal government's large-scale renewable energy target has been instrumental in driving this shift, and the success of the Hornsdale Power Reserve is a testament to the effectiveness of this policy.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of energy storage in the transition to a low-carbon economy. As the grid becomes increasingly reliant on intermittent renewable energy sources, energy storage will play a crucial role in smoothing out the fluctuations in supply and demand. The Hornsdale Power Reserve is a prime example of this, as it has been able to stabilize the grid and provide a reliable source of energy even when the wind is not blowing.\n\nThe findings of the report have been welcomed by environmental groups and energy experts, who see the Hornsdale Power Reserve as a model for future energy storage projects. As the world continues to transition away from fossil fuels, the role of energy storage will become increasingly important, and projects like the Hornsdale Power Reserve will be crucial in helping to achieve this goal.",

The Office for National Statistics revised down its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, following an earlier estimate of 0.5% and missing economists' forecasts that the rate would be unchanged. It said UK production was lower than initially estimated, and said consumers were less willing to spend due to the price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker end to the year weighed on the economy's performance in 2017 overall, with growth revised down from 1.8% to 1.7% – the weakest in five years. The revised figures come as a blow to the UK's economic prospects ahead of its departure from the European Union, with many economists warning that the country's growth could be further impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the terms of its exit. The pound fell by 0.5% against the dollar in response to the news, hitting a low of $1.3055.\n\nThe UK's manufacturing sector was particularly affected, with production falling by 0.3% in the final quarter of 2017, down from a previous estimate of a 0.1% rise. This was partly due to a decline in the production of pharmaceuticals and chemicals, which was hit by the depreciation of the pound.\n\nThe ONS also reported that the UK's trade deficit widened in the fourth quarter, as imports rose faster than exports. This was partly due to a surge in imports of goods such as food and drink, which rose by 3.4% on the quarter.\n\nThe news has sparked concerns about the impact of Brexit on the UK's economy, with many economists warning that the country's growth could be further impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the terms of its exit. The Bank of England has already cut interest rates to boost the economy, and there are concerns that it may need to take further action if the economy continues to slow.\n\nThe UK's Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has sought to play down the impact of the revised growth figures, saying that the economy was still growing and that the government was taking steps to support businesses and individuals. However, many economists are warning that the UK's economic prospects are increasingly uncertain, and that the country's growth could be further impacted by the terms of its exit from the EU.",

The drop in earnings to $38.5m, down from $83m a year ago, comes a day after real estate listings company Domain, which Fairfax spun off into a standalone entity in November, also reported a drop in profits. Greg Hywood, chief executive and managing director, said 35% of the smaller community titles in the NZ company, now known as Stuff, were being offloaded to \"bring forward the time when increases in digital revenue outweigh declines in print\". Up to 60 staff across titles including NZ Dairy Farmer and Christchurch Mail could be affected, according to reports. But there was good news on the digital front as online subscriptions to the Australian Metro mastheads, the SMH, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, increased by almost 50,000 from August 2017 to more than 283,000. \"Metro's next-generation publishing model is delivering a step-change for consumers with the launch of new websites and apps to grow engagement and drive subscriptions and revenue,\" Hywood said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were up 1.3% to $146.9m and underlying net profit – which excludes significant writedowns – slipped 9.9% to $76.3m. Hywood pointed out earnings per share of 3.3 cents. \"This result reflects the increase in minority interests associated with the separation of Domain from 22 November 2017 and the improved Macquarie Media results. Despite the mixed bag of results, Fairfax's shares fell 4.5% to $1.05 in early trading, with investors likely reacting to the significant decline in profit and the company's decision to offload a large chunk of its New Zealand operations. The move is seen as a bid to refocus the company on its digital assets and reduce its reliance on print advertising, which has been declining in recent years.\n\nIndustry analysts have been warning for some time that Fairfax's print business was unsustainable, and the company's decision to divest its New Zealand titles is seen as a pragmatic response to the changing media landscape. However, the impact on staff and local communities is likely to be significant, with many small-town newspapers and publications set to disappear from the scene.\n\nIn a statement, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) expressed concern over the potential job losses and the impact on local journalism. \"The loss of local newspapers and the jobs that go with them is a blow to the communities they serve,\" said MEAA national secretary, Paul Murphy. \"We urge Fairfax to do everything it can to support its staff and to find alternative arrangements for the affected titles.\"\n\nFairfax has promised to provide support to affected staff, including outplacement services and career counseling, but the exact details of the company's plans are still unclear. The company has also pledged to continue to invest in its digital operations, including its online subscriptions and news gathering capabilities. With the media landscape continuing to evolve at a rapid pace, Fairfax's ability to adapt and innovate will be crucial to its long-term success.",

The Competition and Markets Authority said last month that Murdoch's bid raised media plurality concerns because the deal would give his family too much control over UK news media. The Murdoch family trust controls Fox and News Corp, publisher of the Sun and the Times. Last week, Fox strengthened the so-called \"firewall\" remedies it had tabled but did not increase its original offer of guaranteeing to fund Sky News for a minimum of five years. Ofcom had indicated that extending the funding guarantee might help the Murdochs gain clearance. When the Murdochs tried to buy Sky in 2011 a 10-year funding guarantee was accepted by the then minister in charge, Jeremy Hunt, as part of a package of guarantees to allay media plurality issues. The latest development has been welcomed by Sky's independent directors, who have been working to ensure the channel's editorial independence and impartiality. A spokesperson for the directors said: \"We are pleased that 21st Century Fox has taken steps to address the concerns raised by the Competition and Markets Authority. The extended funding guarantee provides greater certainty for Sky News and its employees, and we believe it will help to maintain the channel's high standards of journalism.\"\n\nThe move is also seen as a significant win for the Murdochs, who had been under pressure to sweeten their offer to gain clearance for the takeover.

It was described by the judge as an \"utterly corrupt scheme\" that left small business owners cheated, defeated and penniless. The National Crime Agency's (NCA) decision to launch a fresh probe into the multimillion-pound banking fraud at HBOS has sent shockwaves through the financial sector.

The scandal led to widespread outrage and calls for greater accountability within the banking sector.\n\nThe NCA's decision to launch a fresh probe is seen as a significant development in the case, as it suggests that new evidence has come to light that warrants a full-scale investigation. The agency has refused to comment on the nature of the new evidence, but sources close to the investigation have hinted that it may relate to allegations of senior-level complicity within HBOS.\n\nThe news has sent shockwaves through Lloyds Banking Group, which acquired HBOS in 2008. The bank has faced criticism in the past for its handling of the scandal, with many arguing that it failed to take adequate action to prevent the fraud from occurring.\n\nThe NCA's probe is expected to take several months to complete, during which time the agency will conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations. If evidence of criminal wrongdoing is found, the NCA will recommend that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) consider bringing charges against those responsible.\n\nThe development has been welcomed by victims of the fraud, who have been fighting for justice for years. \"This is a major breakthrough for us,\" said one victim, who wished to remain anonymous. \"We have been waiting for years for someone to take responsibility for what happened.

Having dragged this 1972 Invacar from a boggy field in Sussex, Ian Seabrook has decided to prepare the ungainly ice-blue three-wheeler for probably the biggest adventure of its life. He's going to drive it 170 miles from his home in Wales to the brilliantly eccentric Festival of the Unexceptional in Buckinghamshire. Fans of mint-condition Austin Allegros and cherished Datsun Sunnys will do well to make their way to Stowe House for the jamboree on 14 July. Ian's Invacar was effectively banned from the road in 2003, but somehow his was part of a group of 15 that escaped the scrapman's grab and now the former invalid carriage is insured, taxed and undergoing testing – so far this has revealed a huge oil leak and a serious carburettor fault. Ian hasn't managed 17 miles in yet, let alone 170! Originally, there were many different invalid carriages, but the government wanted a standard design. AC of Cobra fame did the job, coming up with the Model 70, and It was designed to use Fiat running gear, but Fiat were reluctant to provide powerplants. So the engine from the Austrian-built Fiat 500 was used, a Steyr-Puch air-cooled flat twin of 493cc and 20bhp. As Ian Seabrook attempts to tackle the long journey to the Festival of the Unexceptional, he's already encountered a number of challenges. The oil leak has left a trail of sticky black goo on the driveway, and the carburettor fault has required multiple trips to the local mechanic to get it running smoothly. Despite these setbacks, Ian remains determined to complete the trip, driven by a sense of adventure and a desire to showcase his unique vehicle.\n\n\"I've had a lot of fun restoring the Invacar,\" Ian said in an interview. \"It's been a real challenge, but it's been worth it to see it come back to life. I'm looking forward to taking it on its biggest adventure yet and showing it off to all the enthusiasts at the Festival of the Unexceptional.\"\n\nThe Festival of the Unexceptional is a celebration of the ordinary and the unusual, and Ian's Invacar is sure to be a highlight of the event. With its unusual design and quirky history, the vehicle is a true oddity that is sure to capture the attention of attendees.\n\nAs Ian prepares for the long journey ahead, he's also planning to make a few modifications to the Invacar to ensure it's ready for the trip. He's fitted new tires, replaced the brakes, and even added a makeshift luggage rack to carry his camping gear.\n\nDespite the many challenges he's faced, Ian remains optimistic about the trip. \"I'm sure it'll be an adventure,\" he said with a grin. \"But I'm ready for it. Bring it on!\"",

        "Text": "Snap is doubling down on its hardware business, launching a new version of its Spectacles camera-glasses today with a better camera, the ability to take still images and water resistance. The new model comes as Snapchat attempts to recover from the disappointing long-term fate of the first generation, which gathered attention – and long queues – when they were launched in extremely limited quantities in November 2016, but failed to sell in large numbers when they were eventually released on general sale. Over the lifetime of the product, Snap sold just 220,000 units, the company says, eventually writing off unsold inventory worth almost $40m. This time round, the new Spectacles will be available from Snap's website, at a price of £149.99, and are launching simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and France, and more widely across Europe the following week. Like the first model, the Spectacles can take video in short 10-second increments, recording in a circular format which can be viewed in the Snapchat app or exported for other uses. This time, they can also take still photos – with a 1642 pixel resolution, 50% higher than the videos shot by the previous version – and they can shoot underwater. Stereo mics, combined with post-processing to reduce noise, also let the glasses capture clearer, higher quality sound. The new Spectacles also feature improved software, including a redesigned interface and new filters and lenses. Snap has also partnered with several popular brands and creators to offer exclusive content and experiences to users of the new Spectacles. For example, users will be able to unlock special filters and effects from brands like Disney and National Geographic, as well as create their own custom lenses with the help of Snapchat's Lens Studio.\n\nIn addition to the new hardware and software features, Snap is also introducing a new \"Spectacles Studio\" platform, which will allow users to create and share their own augmented reality (AR) experiences using the glasses. The platform will be accessible through the Snapchat app and will allow users to create their own AR filters, lenses, and effects using a range of tools and templates.\n\nSnap is also offering a new \"Spectacles Live\" feature, which will allow users to broadcast live video from their Spectacles directly to the Snapchat app. This feature will be available to users in the UK, US, Canada, and France initially, with plans to roll it out to other countries in the coming weeks.\n\nOverall, Snap is hoping that the new Spectacles will be a major improvement over the previous model, and will help the company to regain its footing in the hardware market. The new glasses are available to pre-order now, and will start shipping on March 29th.",

        "Text": "Sales at Homebase plummeted 20% in March as the \"beast from the east\" added to the woes of the Australian-owned DIY chain. Perth-based Wesfarmers said the cold snap had played havoc with demand for plants and garden furniture, resulting in a fresh setback for the struggling chain. The dire March trading meant like-for-like sales in the first three months of 2018 were down 15.4% on the same period last year – even worse than the 15.1% decline posted in the previous quarter. Wesfarmers had planned to convert the chain into an outpost of its successful domestic chain Bunnings, which, in Australia at least, is famous for low prices and sausage sizzles. So far only 23 of Homebase's 250 stores have been converted to the Australian brand and it is unclear whether the group will continue with the costly refurbishments. Earlier this year the Wesfarmers managing director, Rob Scott, said the conglomerate was considering pulling out of the UK after what has been billed as one of the most disastrous retail takeovers ever seen. In February, Scott said the group was writing off A$1bn (£543m) after bungling the 2016 takeover. Wesfarmers bought Homebase for £340m two years ago but it is now understood to be considering offering more than £100m to find a buyer. The decline in sales has raised fresh questions about the future of Homebase, which has struggled to compete with online retailers and other DIY chains. The company's decision to convert some stores to the Bunnings brand has been criticized as too little, too late, and some analysts believe that Wesfarmers may be better off cutting its losses and selling the chain. Despite the challenges, Homebase's management remains committed to turning the business around, and the company is expected to unveil a new strategy later this year. However, with the UK retail market continuing to experience turmoil, many are wondering if it's already too late for Homebase to recover. The company's fate is set to be closely watched by industry observers, who are eager to see if it can find a way to reverse its fortunes and avoid becoming the latest retail casualty in the UK.",

        "Text": "The UK-listed drugmaker Shire, known for its ADHD hyperactivity drug Adderall, has recommended a £46bn takeover deal by Japan's biggest pharma company, Takeda. If approved by investors, it would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals deals ever, ranking behind Pfizer's $112bn takeover of Warner Lambert in 2000. The stock and cash offer values Shire at £49 a share, about £5 more than Takeda's initial bid. After rebuffing several offers, the Shire board said \"it would be willing to recommend the revised proposal to Shire shareholders subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the possible offer, including completion of reciprocal due diligence by Shire on Takeda\". The FTSE 100 company set a new deadline of 8 May for the negotiations to be concluded, although this could be extended further. Shire shareholders would own about half of the combined company, whose shares would be listed in Japan and the US. Atsushi Seki, pharma analyst at UBS, said: \"With Shire board's willingness to recommend, Shire's acquisition becomes realistic. That said, to complete the acquisition, there are still several hurdles, including no other bidder(s) emerging and a special resolution at a shareholder meeting (two-thirds supportive vote required), and the long journey to completion now begins.\" The deal is expected to create a global pharmaceutical powerhouse, with Takeda gaining a significant presence in the US market and Shire's portfolio of rare disease treatments and neuroscience products. The combined company would have a strong pipeline of innovative products, including Shire's flagship ADHD drug Adderall and Takeda's cancer treatment, Ninlaro.\n\nAnalysts believe that the deal would also provide significant cost savings, with Takeda's scale and operational efficiency expected to offset the integration costs. Additionally, the combined company would have a stronger balance sheet, allowing it to invest in research and development and pursue strategic acquisitions.\n\nHowever, some investors have expressed concerns about the potential impact on Shire's independence and the company's ability to make decisions without being influenced by Takeda's Japanese parent company. Others have questioned the valuation of the deal, with some arguing that Shire's shares are being undervalued.\n\nThe deal is expected to be closely scrutinized by regulators, including the UK's Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission, which will need to approve the deal to ensure it does not harm competition in the pharmaceutical industry. If approved, the deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending shareholder approval.",

        "Text": "British adults are becoming less reliant on Facebook for communicating with friends, according to research conducted by the UK media regulator, which suggests people are starting to turn to other social media apps. The number of British social media users who consider Facebook to be their main social media or messaging profile fell from 80% to 70% in 12 months, according to the regulator's annual media use survey. Instead Britons are increasingly using other services, with the proportion of internet users considering WhatsApp to be their main online profile increasing from 7% to 16%. Although primarily a messaging service, WhatsApp is becoming increasingly important for holding discussions and distributing news through groups of users built around specific interests. The drift away from Facebook was particularly marked among younger internet users, with 13% of 16- to 24-year-olds saying Snapchat was their preferred social media service, while 9% of the same age group said they primarily used Instagram rather than Facebook. Ofcom's data was primarily based on interviews with 1,875 individuals aged over 16, with the main survey work conducted in autumn 2017. This was before the Cambridge Analytica story hit headlines around the world, raising widespread concerns about Facebook's data usage and damaging the company's brand. The shift away from Facebook is likely due to a combination of factors, including concerns over data privacy and the increasing popularity of other social media platforms. \"The data suggests that younger users are more likely to use Snapchat and Instagram, while older users are more likely to use WhatsApp,\" said an Ofcom spokesperson. \"This is likely due to the fact that these platforms are seen as more private and secure, and are often used for specific purposes such as messaging or sharing content with friends and family.\"\n\nThe findings are also consistent with a recent survey by the market research firm, YouGov, which found that 45% of British adults believed that Facebook had compromised their privacy, while only 22% of respondents said the same about WhatsApp.\n\nThe decline of Facebook's dominance is also likely to be driven by the rise of other social media platforms, such as TikTok and Twitter, which are attracting younger users who are looking for more visual and interactive ways to engage with their friends and followers.\n\nIn response to the decline, Facebook has been investing heavily in its messaging services, including WhatsApp and Instagram, which are seen as more secure and private than its core social network. The company has also been working to improve its data privacy policies and has implemented new measures to prevent the misuse of user data.\n\nDespite the decline, Facebook remains one of the most widely used social media platforms in the UK, with over 40 million active users. However, the findings suggest that the company will need to continue to adapt to changing user behavior and preferences in order to remain relevant in the rapidly evolving social media landscape.",

        "Text": "Soggy May bank holidays are not celebrated by most people, but young people revising for school exams may benefit from them, after US researchers discovered that hotter temperatures lead to worse grades. The data is extensive. Academics at Harvard, UCLA and Georgia State University used the scores of more than 10 million secondary students over 13 years, and compared temperature changes in hot southern and colder northern states. In every case, a half-degree rise in the average temperature over the year equalled a 1% drop in average exam scores. Over in the UK, things be even worse, as the researchers found that air conditioning potentially buffers low scores. It is easier to find a British school with windows jammed shut than it is to find one with air conditioning. This makes financial sense: there aren't enough hot periods in the year to make it worthwhile. But the month when average high temperatures do tend to edge past 21C (70F) – which is when the negative effects begin – is June, the same month that most exams take place. All of which raises the question of why we use early summer – filled with distracting sports tournaments and occasional heatwaves – to make students sit their most important tests? Why not instead have young people sit their exams online when it is most convenient for their learning, and for their sweat glands? As the UK's exam season approaches, concerns are growing about the impact of the heat on student performance. The lack of air conditioning in many British schools, particularly in urban areas, means that students are often forced to sit exams in sweltering conditions. This is particularly problematic for students with pre-existing medical conditions or those who may not have access to cooling measures at home.\n\nMoreover, the traditional exam format, which requires students to sit in a fixed location for extended periods, is being called into question. \"It's ridiculous that we're still forcing students to sit exams in the same way we did 20 years ago,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading education expert. \"We know that heat can have a significant impact on cognitive function and memory, yet we're still putting students in a situation where they're likely to struggle.\"\n\nAs a result, there are growing calls for a rethink on the way exams are conducted in the UK. Some are advocating for the introduction of online exams, which would allow students to complete their assessments in a cooler, more comfortable environment. Others are suggesting that exams should be held earlier in the year, before the summer heat sets in. Whatever the solution, it's clear that the traditional exam format is no longer fit for purpose in a changing climate.",

About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury's long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was \"awash with speculation\" that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government's share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. The potential sale has sparked concerns among union leaders and opposition politicians, who fear it could lead to job losses and further destabilize the banking sector. The Unite union, which represents thousands of RBS employees, has written to Chancellor Philip Hammond expressing its opposition to the sale, citing concerns about the impact on jobs and the bank's ability to provide financial services to small businesses and communities.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also weighed in, accusing the government of \"sacrificing\" the bank's future for short-term financial gain. \"This is a disastrous decision that will only serve to line the pockets of wealthy investors, while ordinary people are left to pick up the pieces,\" he said.\n\nDespite the opposition, the Treasury is reportedly determined to press ahead with the sale, with some sources suggesting that the government is willing to accept a lower price for its stake in order to secure a deal quickly. However, the sale is not without its risks, with some analysts warning that it could lead to a further decline in RBS's share price and undermine the bank's stability.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring the developments, with many expecting a formal announcement from the Treasury imminently. The sale is seen as a test of the government's commitment to its austerity agenda, and could have significant implications for the UK's financial sector in the coming months.",

Burnt Yates school, in north Yorkshire, a small jewel of a rural primary school with excellent buildings, fields and woodland and an active and generous trust, must close at the end of this academic year. When it was backed into a corner it could not find an academic chain to take it on; amalgamation came to nought and now the school must close. Burnt Yates school was founded and endowed in 1760; over 250 years of excellent education have taken place since then, supported until recently by one of the very best education authorities in the country. After a series of disastrous decisions by the current local authority, a poor Ofsted report put the seal on the school's fate. Huge efforts were made by parents, governors, trustees, our MP and the local community but to no avail. The money was not there and closure was the only way forward. I blame Michael Gove. Without his academies plan and the virtual destruction of local accountability, Burnt Yates and the six other north Yorkshire schools that have already closed recently would be still providing excellent relevant education to rural communities. We are poorer because of what is happening. Andrea Ives Headteacher, 1970-1984 • The civil servant quoted in Michael Rosen's latest Letter from a curious parent was being economical with the truth. His department does publish data about sponsored academy primary schools, which have been forced out of council control. SATs results continue to show that these schools (and free schools) do worse than average. The statistics are stark. Of the 24 sponsored academy primary schools that have been forced out of council control in north Yorkshire, 17 have seen a decline in their SATs results. The data suggests that the academization process has had a negative impact on the education of thousands of children in the region. It's not just Burnt Yates that has suffered, but a string of other schools that have been forced to close or merge with other academies.\n\nThe government's insistence on pushing through its academies plan, despite warnings from experts and concerns from local communities, has had devastating consequences. The loss of local accountability and the lack of transparency in the academization process have created a power vacuum that has allowed poor decision-making to flourish.\n\nAs the government continues to tout the success of its academies program, the reality on the ground is far from rosy. Burnt Yates school's closure is a stark reminder of the human cost of this policy. The school's students, teachers, and community have been left to pick up the pieces, and it's a tragedy that will be felt for years to come.",

        "Text": "The oldest known case of dandruff has been identified in a small feathered dinosaur that roamed the Earth about 125m years ago. Paleontologists found tiny flakes of fossilised skin on a crow-sized microraptor, a meat-eating dinosaur that had wings on all four of its limbs. Tests on two other feathered dinosaurs, namely beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, and a primitive bird known as confuciusornis, also revealed pieces of fossilised dandruff on the animals' bodies. The prehistoric skin flakes are the only evidence scientists have of how dinosaurs shed their skin. The material shows that rather than losing their outer layer in one piece, or in large sheets, as is common with modern reptiles, the feathered dinosaurs adapted to shed their skin in tiny flakes. \"This is the only fossil dandruff known,\" said Maria McNamara, who worked on the dinosaur fossils at University College Cork. \"Until now we've had no evidence for how dinosaurs shed their skin.\" Images of the dandruff taken with a powerful electron microscope show that the material is extremely well-preserved and is almost identical to that found on modern birds. Like human dandruff, the skin flakes are made of tough cells called corneocytes that are full of the protein keratin. The work, published in Nature Communications, suggests that dinosaurs who sported feathers evolved skin to cope with their plumage as far back as the middle Jurassic. The discovery of fossilized dandruff on these ancient creatures provides a unique window into the evolution of skin shedding in dinosaurs. According to the researchers, the feathered dinosaurs likely developed a specialized skin shedding mechanism to cope with the constant growth and maintenance of their feathers. This adaptation allowed them to maintain their plumage, which was crucial for their survival and ability to fly.\n\nThe study also sheds light on the evolution of skin shedding in birds, which are direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs. The fact that the fossilized dandruff on the dinosaurs is similar to that found on modern birds suggests that the skin shedding mechanism has remained relatively unchanged over millions of years.\n\n\"This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of skin shedding in birds and dinosaurs,\" said Dr. McNamara. \"It shows that the development of feathers was a key driver of the evolution of skin shedding in these animals.\"\n\nThe researchers hope that their discovery will inspire further studies into the evolution of skin shedding in dinosaurs and birds, and provide new insights into the biology and behavior of these fascinating creatures.",

The preliminary report, issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, said on Thursday that while the vehicle's guidance system had spotted the woman about six seconds before hitting her, emergency braking manoeuvres were not enabled in order to \"reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior\". Instead, the Uber system anticipated that the human back-up driver would intervene. However, the automated system was not designed to alert the driver of the impending danger. The car was traveling at 43 miles per hour and its sensors determined that braking was needed 1.3 seconds before impact, according to the report. The investigation also found that the human backup driver, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, did not take control of the vehicle in time to avoid the accident. The driver, who was trained to take control of the vehicle if necessary, told investigators that she was looking down at her phone at the time of the accident and did not notice the pedestrian until it was too late.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report also highlighted a number of other issues with the Uber system, including a lack of clear protocols for how the automated and human components of the system should interact in emergency situations. The report also noted that the vehicle's sensors and cameras were not designed to detect pedestrians in low-light conditions, which may have contributed to the accident.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, but the preliminary report has already raised serious concerns about the safety of self-driving vehicles. Many experts have long warned that the technology is not yet ready for widespread use, and that it will likely take years of testing and refinement before it is safe for the public to ride in self-driving cars.\n\nThe accident has also raised questions about the liability of companies like Uber, which are racing to develop and deploy self-driving technology.

The Competition and Markets Authority has been investigating whether sites are misleading consumers since October and identified a number of areas of concern. The CMA did not name the companies it was investigating, but leading sites include Expedia and Booking.com. The regulator is examining the extent to which a hotel's ranking on a website may be influenced by the size of its commission. The CMA said details on the sites about how many people are looking at a room, how many are left and how long a price is available can create a false impression of availability or rush customers into making a booking decision. About 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites, according to the regulator, but many have found the final price paid was inflated by unexpected extra charges such as taxes and booking fees added later. The CMA is also concerned that some hotel booking websites may be prioritizing hotels that pay the highest commission rates over those that offer better deals to customers. This could lead to consumers being directed to more expensive options without realizing it. The regulator is urging websites to be more transparent about their commission structures and to prioritize displaying the best deals for customers, rather than those that generate the most revenue for the site.\n\nThe CMA has issued a formal warning to the hotel booking websites it is investigating, giving them until the end of the year to make changes to their practices.

The airline, which started operating in 2012 with the backing of easyJet's founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, is in discussions with major shareholders to raise more funds but admitted it had no assurance of a positive outcome. The London Stock Exchange-listed compnay said it \"had continued to consume cash\", and from $7.5m (£5.7m) a month ago it now had just $3.3m in its reserves – more than half of which is locked up in Zimbabwe. In a notice to investors, Fastjet said it was \"at risk of not being able to continue trading as a going concern\". Fastjet launched in Tanzania with an ambition to become a pan-African low-cost carrier, but it has struggled throughout with problems including the continent's banking infrastructure, overambitious plane orders and office costs. The airline's dire financial situation has left many wondering how it managed to spiral out of control so quickly. Industry insiders point to the company's aggressive expansion plans, which led to a significant increase in operating costs. Additionally, the airline's decision to purchase a large number of planes, which it struggled to fill with passengers, further exacerbated its financial woes.\n\nFastjet's struggles have also been attributed to the challenges of operating in Africa, where the airline industry is still developing. The company has faced difficulties in navigating the continent's complex regulatory environment, as well as dealing with the lack of modern infrastructure in many countries.\n\nDespite its struggles, Fastjet has remained committed to its vision of becoming a pan-African low-cost carrier. However, its financial situation has left many to question whether the airline will be able to achieve its goals. If the company is unable to raise the necessary funds, it is likely that it will be forced to significantly scale back its operations, or even cease trading altogether.\n\nThe potential collapse of Fastjet would have significant implications for the airline industry in Africa, as well as for the thousands of people who rely on the company for employment. The situation serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that many African airlines face in trying to establish themselves in a highly competitive market.\n\nIn a statement, Fastjet's management team acknowledged the company's financial difficulties and expressed their commitment to finding a solution. \"We are working tirelessly to address our financial challenges and are exploring all available options to secure the future of the company,\" the statement read. However, with time running out, it remains to be seen whether Fastjet will be able to overcome its difficulties and continue to operate as a major player in the African airline industry.",

The troubled retailer said it had been \"a very difficult year\" for the firm as it reported a 3.6% fall in sales at its established UK stores in the year to 28 April. Carpetright said trading in the first eight weeks of the current financial year had been heavily disrupted by its restructuring programme, particularly because some suppliers had withdrawn products. The hot weather had also kept customers away, the firm said. The company's efforts to revamp its operations have been hindered by the hot weather, which has led to a decline in sales. Carpetright's management team has been working tirelessly to revamp the business, but the challenges they have faced have been significant. The company's chairman, Lord Harris, acknowledged that the past year had been \"a very difficult year\" for the firm, and he expressed his disappointment at the company's financial performance.\n\nDespite the challenges, Carpetright is determined to turn things around. The company has implemented a number of measures aimed at improving its trading performance, including the closure of underperforming stores and the launch of a new e-commerce platform. The company is also working to strengthen its supply chain and improve its product offerings.\n\nIn a statement, Lord Harris said: \"We have faced a number of challenges in the past year, including the impact of the hot weather and the disruption caused by our restructuring programme.

        "Text": "The most profound change to human life over the previous 100 years came to a halt in 2010. In the decades before it, life expectancy in Britain kept rising, with men, in particular, born in the 1920s and 1930s enjoying far longer and healthier lives than ever expected. This increase in lifespan has affected everything – from housing to health to pensions. It's why we need to find ever greater sums for the NHS. It's why the state pension age has had to go up. Arguably, it's a big reason why house prices are so high – because people are living in them for longer. But the great leap forward in longevity has come to a shuddering halt. An extraordinary analysis by the Office for National Statistics this week reveals that the trend line in longevity stopped in 2010, and has flatlined since. Why? The statistics agency's findings have sent shockwaves through the medical and economic communities, with experts scrambling to understand the causes and implications of this sudden and unprecedented stagnation in human lifespan. According to the ONS, the average life expectancy for men in Britain has remained stagnant at 79.2 years since 2010, while women's life expectancy has also plateaued at 83.2 years.\n\nOne theory being floated is that the rise in obesity and related health problems may be playing a significant role in the halt in longevity. The UK has seen a significant increase in obesity rates over the past decade, with nearly 30% of adults now classified as obese. This could be contributing to a rise in chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer, which are major causes of premature mortality.\n\nAnother theory is that the increasing burden of mental health issues may also be a factor. The UK has seen a significant rise in anxiety and depression rates, which can have a devastating impact on physical health and overall wellbeing. If left untreated, these conditions can lead to a range of serious health problems, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and even premature mortality.\n\nAdditionally, experts are pointing to the impact of environmental factors, such as air pollution and climate change, which may be taking a toll on human health. Exposure to poor air quality, in particular, has been linked to a range of serious health problems, including respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and even premature mortality.\n\nThe implications of this stagnation in longevity are far-reaching and profound. The NHS, already under significant pressure, will need to find new ways to cope with the demands of an aging population. The government will need to reassess its plans for pension reform and social care. And individuals will need to rethink their own health and wellbeing strategies.\n\nAs the medical and economic communities continue to grapple with the implications of this news, one thing is clear: the halt in human lifespan is a wake-up call for all of us to take a closer look at our own health and wellbeing, and to make some significant changes to ensure that we can continue to thrive and live long, healthy lives.",

This is a welcome time to reflect, yet here in the UK, just 11% of engineers are women. Engineering is behind many of the things we take for granted, such as roads, bridges, railways, electricity generation and clean water, but it is also behind AI, robotics, smartphones and wearable technology – some of the most exciting recent technological developments. To get more women into engineering, we must communicate its many applications more clearly to young women. Through doing so we can inspire many more to join a profession that can see them working on some of the world's most exciting innovations. By showcasing the diverse range of roles and industries within engineering, we can help dispel the common misconception that it is a male-dominated field. We need to inspire young women to consider engineering as a viable career option, and provide them with the support and resources they need to succeed. This includes encouraging more women to take up STEM subjects at school, and providing mentorship and sponsorship opportunities for those already in the profession. By working together, we can increase the number of women in engineering and unlock the full potential of this vital sector.",

The billionaire, who already owns an 11% stake in House of Fraser, was asked in recent days by bankers advising the retailer to consider providing it with a £50m loan, according to a report by Sky News. In June, House of Fraser announced plans to close 31 of its 59 stores, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. The retailer later secured breathing space from its lenders when they agreed to extend loans while it carries out the restructuring under a company voluntary arrangement scheme. C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, had agreed to make a £70m investment in House of Fraser, conditional on the CVA being implemented. The potential £50m loan from Mike Ashley's Sports Direct would be a significant boost for House of Fraser, which has been struggling to stay afloat in the face of declining sales and increased competition from online retailers. The retailer has been working to reduce its debt and improve its financial position, but the extra funding would give it the breathing room it needs to complete its restructuring plans.\n\nSources close to the talks have revealed that Ashley is keen to support House of Fraser, which he believes has a strong brand and a loyal customer base. He is said to be willing to provide the loan on the condition that House of Fraser agrees to a number of changes, including the appointment of a new chairman and the implementation of a cost-cutting plan.\n\nThe proposed loan would also give Ashley a greater level of influence over the retailer's operations, which could potentially pave the way for a takeover bid in the future. However, it is understood that Ashley's primary focus is on supporting House of Fraser's existing management team and helping the retailer to emerge from its current financial difficulties.\n\nThe news of the potential loan has been welcomed by industry insiders, who believe that House of Fraser is an important part of the UK's retail landscape. \"House of Fraser is a beloved brand with a rich history, and it would be a tragedy if it were to disappear,\" said one retail expert. \"Mike Ashley's support could be the lifeline that the retailer needs to get back on its feet.\"",

Samuel Smith Old Brewery, which was founded in Tadcaster in 1758, was asked to provide details of its pensions in 2015. The Pension Regulator (TPR) wanted to ensure the Yorkshire-based brewer and pub owner was earning enough money to support the final-salary pension schemes of more than 2,000 employees. However, the brewery owner, Humphrey Smith, 73, wrote back and dismissed the request as \"tiresome\". In his letter to TPR, he said: \"We are in receipt of your tiresome letter and we are not prepared to divulge the information to your organisation.\" TPR responded by launching court proceedings, accusing the company of neglecting or refusing to provide information without a reasonable excuse in breach of the Pensions Act 2004. As the owner and chairman of the company, Smith was accused of failing to hand over the documents. Both the company and Smith pleaded guilty to the offence at a hearing in May. On Monday the brewery and its chairman were sentenced at Brighton magistrates court and fined £26,750 as well as costs of £1,240. Judge Teresa Szagun said the company had claimed it was a \"small, independent, family-run brewery struggling in a declining industry\" and any fine would have an impact on its employees. The judge's words were met with a mixture of shock and dismay from the court room, as many in attendance had expected a more severe punishment for the company's blatant disregard for the law. The fine, although substantial, was seen by many as a slap on the wrist for a company with a rich history and significant assets.\n\nThe Pension Regulator, who had been seeking the documents for over five years, expressed disappointment and frustration with the outcome. \"We had hoped for a more substantial penalty, given the severity of the breach,\" said a spokesperson. \"The fact that the company and its chairman were found guilty of neglecting to provide information without a reasonable excuse is a clear indication of their lack of transparency and accountability.\"\n\nThe brewery's employees, who had been waiting for answers about their pension schemes for years, were also left feeling let down by the outcome. \"We're just relieved that the truth has finally come out,\" said one employee, who wished to remain anonymous. \"But we're still left wondering what's going to happen to our pensions. Will we ever see the money we're owed?\"\n\nAs the news of the fine spread, many in the industry were left wondering how a company of Samuel Smith's stature could have gotten away with such blatant disregard for the law. \"It's a shocking example of how some companies can prioritize their own interests over the well-being of their employees,\" said a spokesperson for the Association of British Brewers. \"We hope that this case serves as a wake-up call for all breweries to prioritize transparency and accountability.\"",

They have looked into the help-to-buy scheme in some depth but remain unsure. I've read such negative things about the help-to-buy scheme and don't want them to live a life of fear and stress should they go down this path. Is it better to save longer for a bigger deposit buying an older property? DM A I think your sons are right to exercise caution about the help-to-buy scheme. And if they can afford to purchase property without using help-to-buy, it would make a lot of sense. And that's not just my opinion. In the Help to Buy Buyers' Guide published by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) it says: \"If it looks like you can already secure a 90% mortgage you should think carefully whether a help-to-buy equity loan is right for you. There may be better options for you to consider.\" better options for you to consider.\" This warning is particularly relevant for your sons, who have been renting for 15 years and are now looking to buy their first property. With a longer rental history, they may be in a stronger financial position than some of the other first-time buyers who are taking advantage of the help-to-buy scheme.\n\nAdditionally, the scheme's 5% deposit requirement can be a significant burden, especially if your sons are not confident in their ability to afford the mortgage payments and other costs associated with homeownership. As the HCA guide suggests, if they can secure a 90% mortgage without the help-to-buy equity loan, it may be a more sustainable option.\n\nAnother consideration is the potential impact of the scheme on the property market. Some critics argue that the help-to-buy scheme is artificially inflating house prices, making it more difficult for other buyers to get on the market. This could have long-term consequences for your sons, who may find themselves struggling to sell their property in the future.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use the help-to-buy scheme or to save longer for a bigger deposit will depend on your sons' individual financial circumstances and goals. However, it's essential for them to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each option before making a decision. As their parent, you can offer guidance and support, but ultimately, the choice is theirs to make. By doing their research and considering all the factors, your sons can make an informed decision that is right for them.",

She has written more than 270 entries about forgotten but influential women in science – such as Susan Goldberg, the first female editor of National Geographic. Research shows just 16% of Wikipedia editors are female and only 17% of entries dedicated to notable people are for women. Western Research by Oxford University in 2016 revealed that the vast bulk of content written about most African countries on Wikipedia was by editors in Europe and North America. Only 16% of content about sub-Saharan Africa is written by people from the region, while most entries on European countries are written in Europe. Language In 2016, researchers at the University of Koblenz-Landau in Germany found that the language of a Wikipedia entry influences the sources used, therefore offering a different version of the truth. In an English-language article about Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, 24% of sources were Ukrainian and 20% Russian. The findings highlight the need for greater diversity and representation in the editing community. Wade's efforts have been a significant step in addressing this imbalance, bringing to light the contributions and achievements of women in science who would otherwise be forgotten. Her work has also sparked a wider conversation about the importance of representation and diversity in online content.\n\nIn addition to language and geography, research has also shown that Wikipedia's content is often influenced by the biases and perspectives of its editors. For example, a study by the University of California, Berkeley found that Wikipedia articles about female politicians are more likely to focus on their appearance and personal life rather than their political achievements.\n\nAs the internet continues to play an increasingly important role in shaping our understanding of the world, it is crucial that online content reflects the diversity of human experience. Wade's efforts are a reminder that we must actively work to create a more inclusive and representative online environment. By doing so, we can ensure that the voices and stories of all individuals, regardless of gender, language, or geography, are heard and valued.",

The story covered a judge's decision to award money to Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed after he had been unlawfully imprisoned and badly treated by British armed forces during the Iraq war. The newspaper ran the story despite the judge concluding claims that he had been caught with a bomb had been discredited shortly after his detention, and that the claim by British soldiers that al-Waheed had been caught with a bomb was \"pure fiction\". The correction, published on the front page of the Daily Mail yesterday, admitted that the original story was \"false and misleading\" and apologized for any harm caused to Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed's reputation. The newspaper also acknowledged that it had failed to fact-check the story properly, leading to the publication of a false and damaging headline.\n\nThe correction stated that the judge's decision to award compensation to al-Waheed was based on evidence that he had been subjected to mistreatment and unlawful detention by British armed forces, but that there was no evidence to support the claim that he had been caught with a bomb.

Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, lauded the deal as transformational and industry watchers said the move significantly beefed up the company's US shale presence, which was small compared to peers. The acquisition will boost BP's US oil and gas production by nearly a fifth and marks a new period of growth for the company, which is emerging after years under the $65bn burden of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. In total, 470,000 acres of assets are covered in the deal, including fields in the Permian in west Texas, the Eagle Ford in south Texas and Haynesville in east Texas and Louisiana. Analysts said Eagle Ford was the most valuable of the three because of its scale and economics, while the Permian offered the greatest long-term promise. BHP bought the fields in 2011 but has struggled to make them work, putting them up for sale last August. BP said it believed its approach would differ by bringing $350m of synergies from its other US operations and capital efficiencies. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP's upstream division, said: \"It gives us access to some of the best acreage in the best basins. It takes us into the very heart of the most-talked-about oil play in the world [the Permian].\" The UK oil giant was \"not desperate to do a deal\" he added but BP believed the quality of the resources made the acquisition worthwhile. After the deal is completed BP's US production will climb from 744,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 885,000 boe/d. \"BP was previously underweight to US tight oil compared to its peers. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, pending regulatory approvals. Analysts have praised the deal, citing BP's ability to extract value from the assets and its expertise in the US shale market. The Permian Basin, in particular, is seen as a key driver of growth for BP, with its vast reserves of oil and gas providing a long-term source of production.\n\nBP's Dudley said the deal would allow the company to tap into the Permian's \"unprecedented\" growth potential, while also reducing its reliance on mature fields. The company plans to integrate the new assets into its existing US operations, leveraging its expertise in drilling and production to maximize returns.\n\nThe deal is also seen as a vote of confidence in the US shale industry, which has faced criticism in recent years over its environmental impact and declining production rates. BP's investment in the Permian Basin, in particular, is seen as a signal that the company believes in the long-term potential of the region.\n\nIndustry insiders say the deal could spark a wave of consolidation in the US shale market, as other companies look to build their presence in the region. The acquisition is also seen as a major coup for BP, which has been working to rebuild its reputation after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The company's new focus on US shale production is seen as a key part of its strategy to drive growth and improve its financial performance.",

It said: \"These debts are often pursued overzealously, and with routine recourse to bailiffs. The public sector should be leading by example in their treatment of the most financially vulnerable; but the current approach risks driving them into further difficulty.\" MPs said the \"uncompromising\" approach by local and central government to debt collection should be reformed to meet best industry standards. The report highlighted evidence from the debt charity StepChange, one-third of whose clients had council tax arrears averaging £1,000. Phil Andrew of the charity said: \"Often the governmental organisations are very aggressive in the way they go about getting the payments made. This quick jump to the use of bailiffs is something that we are really quite concerned about\" Threats from bailiffs were thought to be a factor in the suicide of courier Jerome Rogers, 20, who was pursued for two £65 parking fines that escalated to a debt of £1,019. The case prompted calls for sweeping changes to the way the debt collection industry works. Earlier this week the personal insolvency firm Creditfix said it had identified 55 councils across the UK that routinely rejected payment plans offered by those in financial difficulties, leaving those affected with no other choice than to file for bankruptcy. The report's findings have sparked outrage among anti-poverty campaigners, who argue that the use of bailiffs is not only aggressive but also ineffective in collecting debts. \"The government's approach is akin to a sledgehammer to crack a nut,\" said Ruth Croft, a spokesperson for the charity Zacchaeus 2000 Trust. \"Rather than working with individuals to find a solution, they're using bailiffs to intimidate and harass people who are already struggling to make ends meet.\"\n\nThe report also highlighted the lack of transparency and accountability within the debt collection industry, with many councils failing to provide clear information to households about the debt collection process. \"It's like they're hiding behind a veil of secrecy,\" said Andrew Walker, a debt advisor with the Citizens Advice Bureau. \"People are left feeling powerless and trapped in a cycle of debt, with no clear way out.\"\n\nThe government has been accused of turning a blind eye to the issue, with some MPs calling for a complete overhaul of the debt collection system. \"This is a matter of social justice,\" said Labour MP Stella Creasy. \"We need to ensure that our system is fair and compassionate, rather than simply trying to extract as much money as possible from people who are struggling to pay their debts.\" The government has yet to respond to the report's findings, but anti-poverty campaigners are calling for immediate action to address the issue.",

A surge in its share price meant that the 13-year-old drinks company was worth nearly as much as Royal Mail and outstripped the combined stock market value of WH Smith, Debenhams, the AA and Saga. Fever-Tree, which produces tonic water and other carbonated mixers, has grown rapidly, thanks in large part to the soaring popularity of premium gin. UK gin sales have doubled over the past six years to hit £1.2bn in the year to the end of September 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, while a YouGov poll found gin was the most beloved spirit in the UK, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favourite. Riding the crest of the gin wave has transformed Fever-Tree into one of the UK's fastest-growing major companies, making multi-millionaires of co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow in the process. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005, naming it after the colloquial term for the cinchona tree, the bark of which produces quinine – a key ingredient in tonic water. Rolls has banked more than £150m through share sales since the company's stock market float in 2014, while Warrilow has sold stock worth £41m. They still own 14% of the company between them, a stake worth nearly £600m, and pocketed payouts of more than £630,000 on Tuesday after the group lifted its dividend by 40%. The company's success has not gone unnoticed, with Fever-Tree's products now stocked in over 70 countries worldwide. Its tonic water is particularly popular, with sales increasing by 25% in the past year alone. The company's ability to adapt to changing consumer trends has been key to its success, with Fever-Tree introducing new flavors and products to keep up with the demand for premium mixers.\n\nFever-Tree's co-founders have been credited with their innovative approach to the industry, which has disrupted the traditional way of making tonic water. The company's focus on using high-quality ingredients and unique flavor combinations has helped to set it apart from its competitors.

        "Text": "Craig Jones is now a successful local politician but when Wonga was in its prime he was one of many people who turned to the payday lender for help. Jones was in insecure employment on a zero-hours contract in 2011 when he turned to Britain's then biggest payday lender. There was a lull in work and he \"needed something to tide me over\" while he waited for his finances to pick up. He took out a small Wonga loan – \"I think it was £50 to £100\" – but unfortunately his work situation did not improve and \"it just snowballed from there … [it] led to me taking out more and more, and from different sources\". He cannot recall how much he borrowed in total. Asked if it was several hundred pounds, he said it may well have been more than that. Later, however, he obtained more secure permanent work and was eventually able to pay off what he owed. In 2011, the year Jones became a Wonga customer, the company posted good figures: its profits tripled to £45.8m on revenues of £185m as the firm issued almost 2.5m loans. The following year the company told employees that by 2015 it could be valued at £15bn. However, in 2014 Wonga had a traumatic year: it was embroiled in scandal for sending out fake legal letters, ordered to pay millions in compensation and forced to write off £220m of debts owed by 330,000 borrowers. As the years went by, Jones' experience with Wonga became a distant memory, replaced by the trappings of success as a local politician. However, his story is not unique. Many people, like Jones, turned to Wonga in times of financial need, only to find themselves trapped in a cycle of debt.\n\nThe scandal surrounding Wonga's fake legal letters and aggressive debt collection practices was a wake-up call for many. The company's business model, which relied heavily on high-interest rates and fees, was widely criticized. In the end, Wonga's troubles led to its downfall, and the company was forced to shut its doors in 2018.\n\nJones' experience with Wonga has given him a unique perspective on the issue of payday lending. As a politician, he has been vocal about the need for greater regulation of the industry and more support for people struggling with debt. \"I was one of the lucky ones,\" he said in an interview. \"I was able to get out of debt and move on with my life. But I know that's not the case for many others. We need to make sure that people are protected from these types of lenders and that there are more options available for those who are struggling.\"\n\nJones' story is a reminder that the issue of payday lending is complex and multifaceted. While some people, like Jones, may have used Wonga as a last resort in times of financial need, others may have been taken advantage of by the company's aggressive tactics. As the industry continues to evolve, it is crucial that policymakers and regulators prioritize the needs of consumers and work to create a more equitable and sustainable system.",

The name Aston Martin came a year later after their prototype successfully made it around the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire. Aston Martin took its place on the international motor racing stage by competing in the 1922 French Grand Prix but the business ran into financial trouble over the next few years and was rescued in 1926 by a group of investors. It developed a competitive range of sports cars with an increasing reputation for engineering and design, entering the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars was stepped up in the 1930s, with 140 cars built in 1937 – the highest prewar figure. The English industrialist David Brown bought the business in 1947, expanding operations and relocating production from Kensington to Feltham. Production was again moved in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. In 1963 the Aston Martin DB5 entered production and the famous relationship with James Bond was born a year later when it was made the car of choice for 007 in the film Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery. Since then, Aston Martin has become synonymous with style, sophistication, and high-performance. The DB5's association with James Bond cemented the brand's status as a symbol of luxury and glamour. The company continued to produce iconic models, including the DBS and V8 Vantage, which further solidified its reputation as a manufacturer of exceptional vehicles.\n\nIn the 1980s, Aston Martin underwent significant changes, including a change in ownership and a shift in focus towards producing high-performance sports cars. The company's fortunes were revived with the introduction of the Vantage and Virage models, which quickly gained a loyal following among car enthusiasts.\n\nThe 21st century saw Aston Martin continue to evolve, with the introduction of new models such as the DB9 and Vanquish. The company also expanded its operations, opening new manufacturing facilities and showrooms around the world. In 2014, Aston Martin celebrated its centennial anniversary, marking a century of innovation, design, and excellence in the world of motorsport.\n\nToday, Aston Martin is a global brand, with a presence in over 100 countries and a reputation for producing some of the most desirable and exclusive vehicles in the world. The company continues to push the boundaries of innovation and design, with a focus on creating cars that are not only fast and powerful but also beautiful and desirable. As the brand looks to the future, it is clear that its legacy as a maker of exceptional vehicles will endure for generations to come.",

It's a refreshing change to hear that a major ticketing company is taking steps to address the issue of ticket touting. For too long, Ticketmaster's resale sites have been a haven for profiteers, driving up prices and making it impossible for genuine fans to get their hands on tickets at a reasonable price.\n\nAs Rob Davies points out, this isn't a new problem. In fact, it's been a scourge on the live music industry for decades. But it's encouraging to see Ticketmaster taking action to clean up its act. Of course, it remains to be seen whether this move will have a significant impact on the wider ticketing market. After all, there are still plenty of other ways for touts to get their hands on tickets and sell them on at inflated prices.\n\nBut for now, it's a small victory for fans and a reminder that, even in the digital age, there's still room for some old-fashioned customer service. So, let's raise a glass to Rob Davies and Ticketmaster for taking a step in the right direction.

Mike Buchanan, the executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents many of the country's most expensive independent schools, claimed that pupils \"take their foot off the gas\" after accepting offers that do not require specific A-level grades. \"These youngsters have to carry their results with them for their whole careers,\" Buchanan, the former headteacher of Ashford School in Kent, told the Times newspaper. \"I am asking universities to stop using them unless they have interviewed the pupil and got some sense that it would be good for this pupil, or have consulted the school, which has given you the same information.\" Until recently only a small number of school-leavers were given unconditional offers. Buchanan's comments have sparked a debate among educators and policymakers, with some arguing that unconditional offers can be beneficial for students who may be struggling with anxiety or pressure to achieve high grades. Dr. Sarah Jones, a lecturer in education at the University of Cambridge, pointed out that \"for some students, the weight of expectation can be overwhelming, and an unconditional offer can be a welcome relief.\"\n\nHowever, others have criticized the move, suggesting that it could undermine the value of hard work and academic achievement. \"If universities are offering unconditional places, it sends a message that it doesn't matter how well you do in your exams,\" said James Parker, a former student at a state school in London. \"It's like saying, 'Just turn up and you'll get in, regardless of your grades.'\"\n\nThe debate has also raised questions about the impact on students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may face additional barriers in accessing higher education. \"Unconditional offers can be a lifeline for students who may not have the same access to resources and support as their more affluent peers,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a researcher at the University of Manchester.\n\nThe HMC's call for universities to reconsider their use of unconditional offers comes as the number of school-leavers receiving such offers has increased significantly in recent years. According to data from the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), the number of unconditional offers rose by 15% between 2018 and 2019, with some universities offering as many as 50% of their places on an unconditional basis.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether universities will heed the HMC's call and revise their admissions policies. In the meantime, students and parents are left to navigate the complex and often confusing world of university admissions, where the lines between reward and entitlement are increasingly blurred.",

When results are broken down by ethnic group, gender and free school meal (FSM) eligibility, white boys on FSM are the lowest attaining group, with only six out of 10 pupils (62%) meeting the required standard. Although official figures published by the government on Thursday show a two percentage point improvement on last year's results among this group, disadvantaged white boys still lag way behind their peers. Overall more than four in five pupils (82%) met the expected standard in the phonics screening check this year, a one percentage point increase on 2017 results. Chinese girls (not eligible for FSM) were the highest performing group. The screening check involves pupils reading a list of 40 words aloud, of which half are nonsense. The pass mark this year was 32. Pupils who fall short take the check again at the end of year 2, by which time 92% met the required standard. The findings have raised concerns about the persistent achievement gap between disadvantaged white boys and their peers.

Adrian Hallmark, the chief executive of the luxury carmaker, told Reuters it was stockpiling some components ahead of Brexit and switching from the port of Dover to Immingham to bring in certain parts. The Volkswagen-owned marque makes about 11,000 cars a year in Crewe. If London and Brussels fail to reach an agreement by the end of the year, Bentley may stockpile more car parts and close its factory for a few extra days, said Hallmark, who joined Bentley from Jaguar Land Rover in February. The majority of key parts including engines and body come from the European Union, mainly Germany. \"We may work for four days, or we may have a longer Christmas break and a longer Easter break if there is no deal so that we can smooth the period between now and the middle of next year,\" Hallmark said. BMW plans to shut its Mini plant for a month after the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March, to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. As the Brexit deadline looms, concerns are growing among car manufacturers about the potential disruption to their supply chains and production. Bentley's warning comes as other major carmakers, including BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have already announced plans to stockpile parts and adjust their operations in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to a surge in demand for luxury cars, as some buyers seek to import vehicles before the UK's departure from the EU. However, Bentley's Hallmark warned that this surge in demand would not be enough to offset the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the company's sales and production.\n\n\"We're not just talking about a few days of disruption, we're talking about a significant impact on our business,\" Hallmark said. \"We're working closely with our suppliers to ensure that we have the necessary parts to continue production, but it's not just about having the parts, it's about having the right parts at the right time.\"\n\nBentley's warning comes as the UK's automotive industry faces significant challenges, including a decline in demand for diesel cars and increased competition from electric vehicles. The industry has been calling for a Brexit deal that would allow for a smooth transition and minimize disruption to trade and supply chains.\n\nThe UK government has been working to reassure the automotive industry that it is doing everything it can to secure a Brexit deal that works for all parties. However, the lack of progress in negotiations between the UK and EU has left many carmakers feeling uncertain about the future.\n\nAs the Brexit deadline approaches, Bentley and other carmakers will be closely watching the negotiations and preparing for all eventualities. While some carmakers may be able to adapt quickly to a no-deal Brexit, others may struggle to maintain production and sales.

We are thrilled that the council has been able to play a role in saving the store and its jobs.\"\n\nThe deal is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, and Kendals is set to remain open for business as usual. The store's employees are expected to receive their usual pay and benefits, and the store's management is planning to invest in the store's future, including upgrading its facilities and improving its customer offer. The news is a major boost for the city's retail sector, and is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy.",

The governor, Mark Carney, joined over 2,500 staff and their families at the Bank's sports ground in Roehampton, south-west London, in July, which featured a bake-off competition, a treasure hunt, fun run and bouncy castle. Employees were also treated to performances by the Bank of England's choir and band. Party planners racked up a bill of more than £58,000 for food and drink alone, according to a Freedom of Information request lodged by the Press Association. More than £27,000 was spent on entertainment, and £10,400 on \"additional expenses\", with the total being £95,674, excluding VAT. A spokesman for the Bank, which is partly funded by taxpayers, said: \"Governors' Day is a long-held tradition that is open to all employees, including their families, with the aim of recognising their hard work and dedication. The Bank of England's lavish summer party has sparked outrage among critics, who argue that the £100,000 spend is a \"waste of taxpayers' money\" during a time of economic uncertainty. The event, which was attended by Mark Carney and over 2,500 staff and their families, has been criticized for its extravagance, particularly in light of the Bank's role in regulating the financial sector. The total cost of the party, excluding VAT, was £95,674, with £58,000 spent on food and drink alone. The Bank's spokesman claimed that the event was a \"long-held tradition\" aimed at recognizing employees' hard work and dedication, but many have questioned the need for such an extravagant celebration. The news comes as the Bank is facing scrutiny over its handling of the economy and its role in the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, has been under fire for his handling of the economy, and the party has been seen as a symbol of the Bank's perceived detachment from the financial struggles of ordinary people.",

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, the professional body for the recruitment industry, says the public sector, including the NHS and schools, face up to seven more years of skills shortages, based on current demand. On Thursday the Office for National Statistics said the number of EU citizens coming to the UK for work had fallen to a six-year low. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief UK policy director, said: \"These latest statistics highlight the continuing trend of falling net EU migration amid growing shortages across all skills levels in the UK. Ninety-two per cent of businesses cited Brexit as impacting their ability to recruit and train staff in 2018. \"This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed urgently,\" Fell added. \"The government must take immediate action to fix the skills shortage crisis, which is having a devastating impact on businesses of all sizes and sectors.\" The CBI is calling for a comprehensive review of the UK's immigration system, including a new points-based system that prioritizes skills and talent. The organization is also urging the government to increase investment in vocational training and apprenticeships to help address the skills gap.\n\nThe REC's chief executive, Neil Carberry, warned that the skills shortage crisis will only worsen unless action is taken. \"We're facing a perfect storm of a shrinking workforce and a growing demand for skills,\" he said. \"If we don't address this issue, we risk seeing a decline in productivity and economic growth.\" The REC is urging the government to take a more proactive approach to addressing the skills shortage, including increasing funding for vocational training and apprenticeships, and introducing a new visa system that allows businesses to bring in the skills they need.",

Osamu Masuko, chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors, said on Thursday that the alliance would shift to a system where the group would be led by the heads of the three companies, rather than a single figurehead like Ghosn. Masuko, speaking to reporters in Tokyo, said changes to the alliance's capital structure were not discussed by company leaders at a meeting in Amsterdam. A change in the governance structure of the alliance was seen as likely by some analysts. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three manufacturers, was arrested 10 days ago after Nissan alleged he underreported income to regulators. Tokyo prosecutors are reportedly planning to extend the detention of Ghosn for a further 10 days, after which they must decide whether or not to charge him with a crime, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Thursday. The arrest has cast doubt on the future of the alliance. The move to a more decentralized leadership structure is seen as a response to the uncertainty surrounding Ghosn's fate and the potential impact on the alliance. Under the new system, the CEOs of Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors will work together to make key decisions, with no single individual holding the reins.\n\nWhile the change may seem radical, analysts believe it could be a pragmatic solution to the crisis. \"The alliance needs to be flexible and adaptable to navigate this challenging period,\" said Noriaki Yoshida, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"By having the CEOs lead the alliance, they can respond quickly to changing circumstances and make decisions without needing to consult with a chairman.\"\n\nThe shift in leadership structure is also seen as a way to reduce the influence of Ghosn, who had been accused of wielding too much power within the alliance. \"Ghosn's arrest has exposed the weaknesses in the alliance's governance structure,\" said Kenji Kawabata, a professor at Waseda University. \"By decentralizing decision-making, the companies can reduce their dependence on any one individual and create a more balanced leadership.\"\n\nDespite the changes, the alliance's future remains uncertain. The arrest of Ghosn has sent shockwaves through the industry, and many are wondering whether the alliance can survive without its charismatic leader. The companies are expected to hold further discussions in the coming weeks to address the crisis and determine the best course forward.",

Relations between the National Union of Journalists chapel at the Financial Times and management hit rock bottom in the summer when it emerged that Ridding had been paid £2.6m while the newspaper made an operating profit of £5.2m, prompting a backlash that saw him hand back about £500,000. The FT Group, the parent company of the newspaper, made more than £20m in profits. The NUJ chapel has now passed a vote of no confidence in Ridding after a fractious \"town hall\" meeting on Monday that was streamed live to all staff. In a statement the chapel said Ridding had not acknowledged or addressed serious concerns at the Financial Times in the speech broadcast to staff. The live broadcast was stopped at the end of formal speeches, meaning staff not in attendance were not able to watch the following debate about the issues. \"In the middle of a dispute over transparency, better governance and high executive pay at the FT, John Ridding failed to acknowledge or even address serious staff concerns over these matters in his speech to staff,\" said the chapel in a motion. \"Demonstrating a complete disregard for transparency, the live broadcast of the town hall meeting was stopped at the end of the formal speeches, preventing all staff not in the room from hearing the questions and responses.\" The motion also criticized Ridding for not providing a \"clear plan\" to address the concerns raised by staff, and for failing to engage with the union's proposals for improving transparency and governance at the Financial Times. The chapel called on Ridding to \"take immediate action\" to address the concerns and to work with the union to find a solution. The vote of no confidence is a significant blow to Ridding's leadership, and it is unclear what the next steps will be. The Financial Times has been a leading voice in the business and financial world for over 130 years, and the controversy surrounding Ridding's pay package has raised questions about the newspaper's commitment to transparency and accountability. The union has vowed to continue its campaign for change, and it is likely that the controversy will continue to dominate the headlines in the coming days.",

The industry regulator ordered Casumo to pay a penalty package of £5.85m, while Videoslots will pay £1m in lieu of a financial penalty. Daub Alderney was hit with a fine of £7.1m, previously announced. A fourth company, CZ Holdings, surrendered its right to provide gambling services in the UK after the regulator opened a review of its licence. A further six firms remain under investigation. The Gambling Commission's investigation, which began in 2020, uncovered widespread failures in the systems designed to prevent money-laundering and protect problem gamblers at the three online casino firms. The regulator found that Casumo, Videoslots, and Daub Alderney had all failed to properly implement anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, putting them at risk of being used for illegal activities.\n\nThe Commission also found that the companies had not done enough to identify and prevent problem gambling, despite being required to do so under their licences. This included failing to implement adequate age verification checks, to identify and restrict players who were at risk of developing gambling addiction, and to provide adequate support to those who were struggling with gambling problems.\n\nThe penalty package imposed on Casumo is the largest ever issued by the Gambling Commission, and is intended to reflect the seriousness of the company's failures. The £5.85m fine is made up of a £4.5m financial penalty, plus £1.35m to be spent on improving the company's systems and processes.\n\nVideoslots, which was also found to have failed to properly implement anti-money laundering measures, will pay a £1m financial penalty. The company has also agreed to implement a range of measures to improve its systems and processes, including the appointment of an independent auditor to monitor its compliance with the Commission's requirements.\n\nDaub Alderney, which was previously announced as being hit with a £7.1m fine, has been ordered to pay the full amount. The company has also been ordered to implement a range of measures to improve its systems and processes, including the appointment of an independent auditor to monitor its compliance with the Commission's requirements.\n\nThe Gambling Commission's Chief Executive, Neil McArthur, said that the regulator was \"committed to ensuring that gambling operators are held to the highest standards of social responsibility and anti-money laundering compliance\". He added that the Commission would \"continue to take tough action against operators who fail to meet these standards\".\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and the Commission has warned that further penalties and fines may be imposed on the six firms still under investigation.

A growing number of businesses in New York and cities around the country have adopted cashless policies, refusing to accept paper currency and requiring customers to pay with debit or credit cards. The trend has spread from hipster coffee shops to popular burrito and salad chains, with business owners saying it's quicker and easier to dispense with cash. But city councilman Ritchie Torres, who introduced the legislation to prohibit the practice, said it freezes out people who don't have access to bank accounts and credit cards, who are more likely to be low-income and people of color. The same concerns have prompted proposed bans in Philadelphia and Washington DC. Torres called the proposals a \"new frontier\" of anti-discrimination law, needed to prevent a \"gentrification of the marketplace\" by businesses unwilling to accept cash. \"A cashless business model has an exclusionary effect on the impoverished, the homeless, the underbanked, the undocumented,\" he told the Guardian. The proposed legislation would require businesses to accept cash payments, with some exceptions for certain types of transactions, such as online purchases. Torres argued that the ban would help level the playing field for low-income and marginalized communities, who are disproportionately affected by cashless policies. \"We can't let the market dictate who can and can't participate in the economy,\" he said. \"Everyone deserves access to goods and services, regardless of their financial situation.\" The proposal has gained support from community organizations and advocacy groups, who see it as a crucial step towards promoting economic equality and combating systemic racism. Opponents, however, argue that the ban would increase costs for businesses and make it harder for them to operate efficiently. The legislation is set to be voted on by the city council in the coming weeks, with a decision expected by the end of the year.",

Ahead of the G20 meeting in Argentina, which begins on Friday, the US president used a newspaper interview to warn China that he expects to move ahead on the imposition of higher import tariffs on Chinese goods. The news sent shares lower in London and New York on Tuesday, after Trump told the Wall Street Journal it was \"highly unlikely\" that he would heed a call by Beijing to refrain from increasing the tariffs from the start of next year. It paves the way for the existing 10% US import tariff on $200bn (£158bn) of Chinese goods to increase to 25% from 1 January. Economists at the Dutch lender Rabobank said the world economy could suffer badly over the next decade if the US-China trade war escalates further, with as much as 2% of GDP growth lost by 2030. Hugo Erken, senior economist at the bank, said: \"An ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has much broader ramifications that transcend their own borders … in a globalised economy, there are no real winners from such policies.\" The escalating trade tensions have also sparked concerns about the potential impact on global supply chains and the broader economy. \"If the trade war escalates, it could lead to a significant disruption in global supply chains, which could have far-reaching consequences for businesses and consumers alike,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. The US-China trade war has already led to retaliatory measures from both sides, with China imposing tariffs on $110 billion worth of US goods, including soybeans and aircraft. The ongoing dispute has also raised concerns about the potential for a global recession. \"The risk of a global recession is higher than it was a year ago, mainly due to the trade tensions,\" said Jan Szymanski, chief economist at Pictet Wealth Management. The G20 meeting in Argentina is expected to be a crucial moment in the ongoing trade dispute, with leaders from around the world gathering to discuss the issue. However, with no clear resolution in sight, many are bracing for a prolonged and potentially damaging trade war. \"The world is facing a very uncertain and potentially very difficult period,\" said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Societe Generale. \"We are entering a new era of protectionism and nationalism, and it's hard to predict what the outcome will be.\"",

In November 2016, attackers obtained credentials to access Uber's cloud servers and downloaded 16 large files, including the records of 35 million users worldwide. The records included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and the location where they had signed up. Drivers were also affected, with 3.7 million, including 82,000 from the UK, having their weekly pay, trip summaries and, in a small number of cases, driver's licence numbers accessed. The ICO said the breach was caused by inadequate information security, and was compounded by Uber US's decision to not disclose the attack, instead complying with the hackers' demands to pay $100,000 as a \"bug bounty\". Such bounties are common in the security world, with companies offering rewards to researchers who find and notify them of system weaknesses before they can be attacked. However, the ICO wrote: \"Uber US did not follow the normal operation of its bug bounty programme. In this incident Uber US paid outside attackers who were fundamentally different from legitimate bug bounty recipients: instead of merely identifying a vulnerability and disclosing it responsibly, they maliciously exploited the vulnerability and intentionally acquired personal information relating to Uber users.\" The ICO's investigation found that Uber's European operation had failed to implement adequate security measures to prevent the breach, and that the company had also failed to notify the affected users in a timely manner. The regulator said that Uber's handling of the breach was \"completely unacceptable\" and that the company's decision to pay the hackers to delete the stolen data was \"not a sufficient response\".\n\nThe ICO's fine is the largest ever imposed on a technology company in the UK, and it serves as a warning to other companies that they must take their data protection responsibilities seriously. \"The failure to protect personal data is not a trivial matter,\" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. \"It's a serious breach of trust and a serious breach of the law. We are determined to take enforcement action where necessary to ensure that organisations comply with the law and respect the privacy of individuals.\"\n\nUber has apologized for the breach and has taken steps to improve its data security measures. The company has also established a new data protection team and has implemented additional security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. However, the incident has left many users concerned about the security of their personal data and the company's ability to protect it.\n\nThe ICO's investigation also found that Uber's handling of the breach was not isolated to the UK. The company's US operation had also been affected by the breach, and the ICO said that it had received reports of similar breaches in other countries. The incident highlights the need for companies to take a global approach to data protection and to ensure that their data security measures are robust and effective.\n\nIn a statement, Uber said that it was \"sorry\" for the breach and that it was \"taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again\". The company said that it had learned a lot from the incident and was committed to protecting the personal data of its users. However, the incident has left many users wondering whether they can trust the company with their personal data. Only time will tell if Uber's efforts to improve its data security measures will be enough to restore trust in the company.",

This all seems unfair as it is hardly my fault that the company has changed hands. I was taken aback by the news, to say the least. I had been looking forward to using the gift cards to stock up on some new plants and gardening tools for my garden. But now, it seemed that I was out of luck. The staff at the new Dobbies centre were polite, but firm, in their refusal to accept the Wyevale cards.\n\nI asked if there was any way to transfer the balance to a different centre, but was told that it was not possible. The only option was to use the cards at one of the other Wyevale centres, which, as I mentioned, are a significant drive away. I was disappointed, to say the least.\n\nAs I left the centre, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. It seemed unfair that I was being penalized for the company's decision to change hands.

An ABC spokesperson said the termination payment was made to Guthrie in line with her contractual entitlements. Guardian Australia understands it was determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, which oversees federal public servants' pay. The ABC said it had confirmed the sum from people involved in the negotiations. Guthrie was terminated by the board just two years into her five-year term as managing director. It has since emerged that she clashed with the former chairman Justin Milne over a number of issues and Guthrie alleged Milne had pressured her to take account of political sensitivities in Canberra. The payout is expected to be a significant relief to Guthrie, who has been vocal about her treatment by the ABC and its board. Her lawyers have been seeking a larger sum, citing \"substantial losses\" she allegedly suffered as a result of her termination. The exact nature of these losses is not clear, but it is understood that Guthrie is seeking compensation for what she claims was a \"breach of contract\" and \"mental distress\" caused by her departure. The ABC has maintained that Guthrie's termination was justified and that she was treated fairly throughout the process. The dispute is set to continue, with a court date scheduled for later this year. Meanwhile, the ABC has been under pressure to explain its handling of Guthrie's departure, with some critics calling for greater transparency and accountability.

More probes have been sent to Mars than any other planet in the solar system but more than half of these missions have ended in failure, with the final stages, involving landing gently on the Martian surface, proving to be particularly dangerous and unsuccessful. The thin atmosphere on Mars – just 1% of Earth's – means there is little friction to slow down a spacecraft, and that has played a key role in past failures. Hence the nervousness of Nasa engineers who are directing their $800m InSight craft after a 300 million-mile journey at a tiny target zone in the planet's atmosphere measuring a mere 15 miles by 6 miles. If InSight passes through this keyhole precisely then it ought to land in the middle of the Elysium Planitia, though it will still need a heat-resistant capsule, a parachute and rockets to cut its velocity from 12,000mph to 5mph and ensure it arrives softly and safely after a seven-minute descent. The team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, will be monitoring the spacecraft's descent closely, with their hearts racing as they wait to see if InSight will successfully touch down on Martian soil. If all goes according to plan, the probe will send back a series of signals to Earth, indicating its safe landing and deployment of its instruments. Once on the surface, InSight will begin to collect data on Mars' internal structure, providing valuable insights into the planet's formation and evolution.

Salamander The amphibious salamander can regrow a lost tail to full length. This process sees cells migrating to the wound and then slowly regenerating the tail within a few weeks. The finished appendage is completely functional and has all the features of the original, with the spinal cord and nerves growing back too. Axolotl A relative of the salamander but even more skilled at regenerating is the axolotl. This animal can regenerate not just its tail but also limbs, skin and almost any other body part. The researchers hope that by studying the cave-dwelling tetra fish, they can uncover the secrets behind their inability to regenerate tissue. \"We want to understand why some animals have this amazing ability to regenerate, while others don't,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead researcher on the project. \"By comparing the two species, we may be able to identify the key genetic or molecular mechanisms that allow some animals to regenerate, but not others.\" The team is also studying the salamander and axolotl, which are known for their impressive regenerative abilities. The salamander's ability to regrow its tail is well-documented, but the axolotl's capacity to regenerate entire limbs and body parts is less well-understood. \"The axolotl is like a superhero of regeneration,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"We're hoping to learn from its incredible abilities and apply that knowledge to human medicine.\" The researchers believe that understanding how these animals regenerate tissue could lead to breakthroughs in human tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

Some have argued that funds like Odey Asset Management, which take short positions against British businesses, are doing little to promote economic growth and stability. \"Hedge funds like Odey's are essentially betting against the UK's success, which can have a destabilizing effect on the market,\" said a leading economist. \"We need to encourage investment in the UK, not create an environment where investors are incentivized to bet against our economy.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, Odey's team has defended their strategy, citing the fund's strong track record and the need for contrarian views in the market. \"We're not trying to tank the UK economy, but we believe that our short positions are a necessary counterbalance to the prevailing optimism,\" said a spokesperson for Odey Asset Management. \"We're confident that our strategy will ultimately pay off, and we're committed to continuing to provide our clients with the best possible returns.\"",

Servers controlling the digital butler were overloaded with questions and requests, prompting Alexa to tell some users: \"Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you right now.\" The crash, at about 10am GMT, caused Amazon customers to complain about not being able to play festive songs, turn on their living room lights or get cooking instructions for Christmas dinner. Richard Hyland tweeted: \"Good day for Amazon's Alexa to crash. It's not like people might want to register new devices or play music or anything.\" Alexa works by sending voice commands via an Amazon Echo device to a server, where a computer interprets them. The outage was met with frustration from many users, who had high hopes for a seamless and enjoyable Christmas Day experience with their new smart speakers. \"I was really looking forward to using my new Alexa to play some festive tunes and get some help with cooking dinner, but instead I'm stuck staring at a screen with a bunch of error messages,\" said Sarah Jenkins, a disappointed customer. Amazon's Alexa support team was quickly overwhelmed with complaints and queries, and many users were left waiting for hours for assistance. The company later confirmed that the issue was due to an unexpected surge in traffic, and apologized for the inconvenience. In a statement, Amazon said: \"We're sorry for the trouble this has caused and are working hard to get things back to normal as soon as possible.\" As the day went on, Alexa slowly began to return to normal, but not before many users had taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration. Despite the hiccup, Amazon's Alexa remains one of the most popular virtual assistants on the market, and the company is expected to bounce back from the outage quickly.",

And when it comes to car aesthetics I am often seriously out of step with vehicle designers. I'd say that the three ugliest cars of the past decade are the Porsche Cayenne, Nissan Juke and Range Rover Evoque. Yet all three have gone on to become massive successes. Now, the all-new Evoque is here and the latest version of the baby Range Rover is probably going to be even more popular than the last. But what's behind the Evoque's enduring appeal? Is it the way it looks, despite my own reservations? Or is it something more? The answer lies in its unique blend of style, substance, and technology. The new Evoque boasts a sleeker, more chiseled design, with a more aggressive stance and a more premium feel. The interior is equally impressive, with luxurious materials and a state-of-the-art infotainment system. But it's not just about looks - the Evoque is also a capable off-roader, with a wade-sensing system and a range of advanced traction control systems.\n\nUnder the bonnet, the Evoque gets a range of efficient engines, including a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol unit and a 2.0-litre diesel. And with a claimed fuel economy of up to 47.1mpg, it's clear that Range Rover is serious about making the Evoque a practical choice for those who want a stylish and capable SUV. With deliveries expected to start in spring 2019, the all-new Evoque is set to be a major player in the premium SUV market. And who knows - maybe I'll even learn to appreciate its good looks.",

        "Text": "Cash-strapped households provided most of Britain's growth in the three months to September, as businesses cut investment again amid fears over Brexit. Official figures confirmed the economy bounced back from the freezing temperatures earlier in the year as shoppers spent heavily during the football World Cup and a long heatwave. But more detailed data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that consumers, hit by rising utility bills and transport costs, had to cope with almost static disposable incomes, forcing them to dip into savings to maintain their spending habits. The ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said households spent more than they received for an unprecedented eighth quarter in a row, raising questions about their ability to keep on spending and driving the country's economy. More recent surveys have appeared to fuel concerns that consumer spending is running out of steam, with a string of high street retailers saying November was a terrible month for sales. A profit warning from the online retailer Asos shocked analysts that had grown used to web-based operators riding out the spending downturn. Business investment fell for the third consecutive quarter. The gloomy outlook for consumer spending has sparked concerns about the sustainability of the UK's economic growth. Economists are warning that the country's reliance on consumer spending to drive growth is unsustainable, and that a boost from business investment is desperately needed to drive long-term growth. The decline in business investment, coupled with stagnant wages and rising costs, has led some to question whether the UK's economy is heading for a period of slower growth or even recession.\n\nThe Bank of England has been monitoring the situation closely, and some policymakers are urging the government to take action to stimulate business investment and boost productivity. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has announced plans to increase funding for research and development, and has also promised to review the tax system to make it more attractive to businesses.\n\nDespite these efforts, many experts believe that the UK's economic prospects remain uncertain, and that the country is at risk of falling into a period of slow growth or even recession if business investment does not pick up. The UK's departure from the EU, known as Brexit, is also expected to have a significant impact on the economy, and many businesses are holding back on investment until the outcome of the negotiations is clearer.",

Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has recently shut down key London roads, has demand the BBC makes the environment its \"top editorial issue\". Broadcasting House was locked down early on Friday afternoon, with BBC staff and guests unable to enter or leave the building while security kept the peaceful but noisy protesters away from the entrance. Extinction Rebellion activists, who are demanding a meeting with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation had a duty to broadcast about climate change with \"the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war\". The broadcaster Anneka Rice said she was stuck in the BBC reception \"with Simon Mayo, Ken Bruce and three policemen\" during the protest. Extinction Rebellion also organised protests on Friday at BBC offices in Bristol, Glasgow, Cambridge, Birmingham, Truro, Sheffield, Bangor, and the broadcaster's Berlin bureau. The campaign group launched two months ago, with a declaration of support from public figures including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who backed a campaign of civil disobedience to draw attention to the threat of climate and ecological change. Since then, Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked bridges and glued themselves to the gates of Downing Street, earning media attention that has allowed the campaign to spread to 35 overseas countries. The BBC has been criticised for its coverage of climate change, especially the decision to give airtime to climate change sceptics such as Lord Lawson, who oppose the scientific consensus. The protesters, who were mainly young adults, held signs that read \"Climate Emergency Now\" and \"BBC, Tell the Truth\". They also chanted slogans, including \"What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now!\" and \"The science is clear, act now, not later!\" The atmosphere was peaceful, but the noise level was high, with the protesters determined to make their voices heard.\n\nThe BBC has faced criticism in the past for its coverage of climate change, with some accusing the corporation of not taking the issue seriously enough. The corporation has also been accused of giving airtime to climate change sceptics, such as Lord Lawson, who oppose the scientific consensus on the issue.\n\nThe protesters, who were mostly from Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has been behind several high-profile protests in London, said they were demanding that the BBC use its platform to raise awareness about the climate crisis. They claimed that the corporation had a duty to broadcast about climate change with the same level of urgency as it did during World War II.\n\nThe protesters also called for the BBC to stop giving airtime to climate change sceptics and to instead focus on reporting the facts about the climate crisis. They said that the corporation had a responsibility to inform the public about the urgent need for action on climate change.\n\nThe lockdown at Broadcasting House was expected to last for several hours, with the protesters vowing to continue their protest until their demands were met. The BBC has so far refused to comment on the protest, but the corporation has been accused of not taking the issue of climate change seriously enough. The protest is the latest in a series of high-profile demonstrations in London, and it is expected to draw attention to the issue of climate change.",

The company reported its third record profit in a row, capitalizing on a strong holiday retail season and its growing, high-margin businesses such as cloud computing and advertising. The Seattle-based company reported a profit of $3.03bn, or $6.04 a share, up from $1.86bn, or $3.75 a share, on the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue grew 20% to $72.38bn. Amazon's voice-controlled virtual assistant Alexa, and the devices which play it, helped the performance. \"Alexa was very busy during her holiday season. Echo Dot was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon globally, and customers purchased millions more devices from the Echo family compared to last year,\" Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, said in a statement. Most importantly for investors, Amazon's cloud-computing division said revenue jumped 45% in the fourth quarter, cementing its lead over Google and Microsoft. The division has been growing at 40% per annum and is a high margin business compared to retail. The strong performance of Amazon's cloud-computing division is expected to continue, with the company forecasting revenue growth of 40% to 50% in the current quarter. The division, known as Amazon Web Services (AWS), has become a key driver of Amazon's growth and profitability, and its dominance in the cloud-computing market has made it a major threat to traditional tech giants such as Microsoft and Google. In addition to its strong financial performance, Amazon also announced a number of new products and services, including a new smart speaker called Echo Frames, which features a built-in display and can be used to control other smart devices in the home. The company also announced a new subscription service called Amazon Fresh, which offers customers same-day delivery of fresh produce and other groceries.

UK car factories produced 1.52m vehicles last year, 9.1% fewer than 2017, according to figures published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK auto industry lobby group. Production for the British market fell by 16.3%. Investment into British car manufacturing almost halved during the year to £588.6m, a fall which the SMMT blamed on Brexit uncertainty. Publicly announced investments were lower than in any year since 2012, the first year comparable data was collected. \"Investment is effectively stalled,\" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive. \"Industry is waiting to see what happens. The decline in investment has led to concerns about the long-term viability of the UK's car manufacturing industry. Many manufacturers have already announced plans to reduce production or shift production to other countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"The uncertainty surrounding Brexit is having a significant impact on our business,\" said a spokesperson for Jaguar Land Rover, which produced 1.3 million vehicles in the UK last year. \"We are taking steps to mitigate the risks, but ultimately, the outcome of Brexit will determine our future investment plans.\"\n\nThe SMMT is urging the government to provide clarity on the UK's post-Brexit trade arrangements and to negotiate a deal that would prevent a no-deal scenario. \"The government needs to take urgent action to address the uncertainty and provide a stable environment for investment,\" said Hawes.\n\nThe decline in car production has also had a ripple effect on the wider economy. According to the SMMT, the UK's car industry supports over 800,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly. The decline in production has led to concerns about job losses and a potential impact on economic growth.\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns about the UK's ability to meet its environmental targets. The car industry is a significant contributor to the UK's carbon emissions, and a decline in production could make it more difficult to meet the government's goals.\n\nThe UK's car industry has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including the shift towards electric vehicles and the impact of diesel emissions scandals. However, the decline in investment and production is a new and worrying trend.\n\nAs the government and industry stakeholders work to address the challenges facing the UK's car industry, there is a growing sense of urgency. The industry needs clarity and stability to continue investing and growing, and the government needs to take action to provide that. As the Brexit deadline looms, the future of the UK's car industry hangs in the balance.",

(Alas, the Daily Mail's Sarah Vine isn't a fan, writing in her latest column: \"Why the rest of us have to suffer I don't know.\") In the past two months, I have spent four days in hospital, and tweeted selfies on both occasions. There were many reasons: I tweet and post on Instagram a lot; I enjoy it; my friends interact with me; it's how we keep abreast of each other's lives. It helps us feel connected. They know how I'm feeling and, because I am juvenile, they also know when my blood pressure is 69/100 – nice. Illness, especially chronic illness, can be very isolating. Not only does it limit how and when you can socialise, it causes you to feel unattractive. But by sharing my hospital selfies, I felt like I was pushing back against that isolation. It's a small act of defiance, but it's one that can make a big difference. By being open and honest about my experience, I hope to help others feel less alone. And, let's be real, it's also a great way to get some sympathy and support from friends and family.\n\nOf course, not everyone understands the appeal of the hospital selfie. Some people might think it's attention-seeking or even insensitive. But for me, it's the opposite. It's a way of saying, \"I'm still here, I'm still me, and I'm still worthy of connection and care, even when I'm feeling at my most vulnerable.\"\n\nAs I lay in my hospital bed, snapping selfies and sending them out into the world, I felt a sense of freedom and empowerment. It's a strange thing to say, but being sick can be a real ego-buster. You start to feel like you're losing your identity, like you're just a patient, not a person. But by sharing my experience, I'm reclaiming that identity. I'm saying, \"I'm still me, and I'm still worth sharing with the world.\"",

The mobile phone company, which started offering broadband and landline services in 2015, was part of the customer survey for the three months to the end of September after reaching the benchmark of 1.5% market share. Vodafone's broadband service received 27 complaints per 100,000 subscribers, almost double the industry average of 15, with customers citing issues including changing provider, handling faults and service. The company's landline service received 19 complaints per 100,000 subscribers, above the industry average of 11, over a similar range of issues. \"Vodafone will be feeling the heat,\" said Ernest Doku, telecoms analyst at uSwitch.com. The poor performance of Vodafone's broadband and landline services has sparked concerns among consumer groups and industry experts. \"This is a wake-up call for Vodafone to take a hard look at its customer service and quality of service,\" said Tom Bennett, a consumer advocate. \"Complaints are a key indicator of customer satisfaction, and Vodafone's high levels of complaints suggest that it has some serious work to do to get its house in order.\" Ofcom's league table also showed that Vodafone's competitors, including BT, Sky, and TalkTalk, performed better in terms of customer complaints. BT, which has long been a market leader, received just 10 complaints per 100,000 subscribers, while Sky and TalkTalk received 12 and 13 complaints per 100,000 subscribers, respectively.

        "Text": "It is a 100% mortgage but not, thank goodness, as we once knew them. Lloyds Bank's new Lend a Hand mortgage offers first-time buyers the chance to borrow the entire price of their new home – but with the considerable caveat that a relative has to have a lump sum worth 10% that they are willing to tie up for three years, and have it raided if you miss any payments. So, first up: this is no use at all for anyone without a family member with a chunk of cash they don't need, willing to help them on to the housing ladder. But nor is it the return of the bumper mortgage market we saw in the run-up to the financial crash, where loans of up to 125% were available (leaving some borrowers trapped in negative equity after the downturn). There is still careful thinking to be done before taking on a mortgage this size – and never more so than now, with uncertainty over Brexit clouding the market. Lloyds' deal offers a mortgage of up to £500,000, which can be arranged over up to 30 years. However, the bank is keen to stress that this is a \"responsible\" mortgage, designed to help first-time buyers get on the housing ladder while also providing a safety net for both the borrower and the lender. The idea is that the relative's lump sum will act as a kind of \"buffer\" against the risk of default, making it more likely that the borrower will be able to keep up with their mortgage payments.\n\nBut what exactly does this mean for the borrower? For one thing, it means that they will need to have a good credit history and a stable income in order to qualify for the mortgage. They will also need to have a decent deposit to put down, although this can be as little as 5% of the purchase price. And, of course, they will need to have a relative who is willing and able to provide the 10% lump sum.\n\nOne of the key benefits of this mortgage is that it can help to reduce the amount of debt that the borrower needs to take on. By using the relative's lump sum as a kind of \"collateral\", the bank is able to offer a larger mortgage than it would otherwise be able to. This can be particularly helpful for first-time buyers who may not have a lot of savings or other assets to put towards a deposit.\n\nBut there are also some potential downsides to consider. For one thing, the borrower will need to be aware that the relative's lump sum is tied up for three years, and can be raided if they miss any mortgage payments. This means that the relative may not be able to access their own money during that time, which could be a problem if they need it for other expenses or emergencies.\n\nAdditionally, the borrower will need to be careful about making sure that they can keep up with their mortgage payments. If they miss a payment, the relative's lump sum could be used to pay off the debt, which could have serious consequences for their relationship. And if the borrower is unable to get back on track, they could end up losing their home.\n\nOverall, Lloyds Bank's new Lend a Hand mortgage is a complex and innovative product that offers first-time buyers a chance to get on the housing ladder with a relatively small deposit. But it's not without its risks and challenges, and borrowers will need to be careful and responsible in order to make the most of it.",

And that figure rises to 40% for those with two children, according to a major study that analysed 11 key indicators of chronic stress levels. Professor Tarani Chandola, of Manchester University, and Dr Cara Booker, Professor Meena Kumari and Professor Michaela Benzeval, of the Institute for Social and Economic Research at Essex University, examined biological data taken by nurses from 6,025 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, the largest survey of its kind in the world. They adjusted the raw data to exclude other factors that could influence their findings, such as the women's ages, ethnicity, education, occupation and income, allowing them to focus solely on working hours and family conditions. According to their research, just published in the journal Sociology, neither working from home nor flexitime had an effect on women's chronic stress levels. But reducing the number of hours they worked did have a positive impact. \"Work-family conflict is associated with increased psychological strain, with higher levels of stress and lower levels of wellbeing,\" Chandola said. \"Parents of young children are at particular risk of work-family conflict. Working conditions that are not flexible to these family demands, such as long working hours, could adversely impact on a person's stress reactions.\" Overall, the 11 indicators, known as \"biomarkers\", produce something called an \"allostatic load\", a measure of the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems, which can indicate poor health and a greater risk of death. The study's findings suggest that working mothers are more likely to experience chronic stress, which can have long-term consequences for their physical and mental health. The researchers used a range of biomarkers, including cortisol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate, to measure the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems. They found that working mothers had higher levels of stress hormones, such as cortisol, and were more likely to experience inflammation and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Professor Tarani Chandola, said that the results were concerning and highlighted the need for employers to provide more flexible working arrangements to support working mothers. \"Our findings suggest that working mothers are more likely to experience chronic stress, which can have serious consequences for their health and wellbeing,\" she said. \"Employers have a crucial role to play in supporting working mothers and should consider providing flexible working arrangements, such as telecommuting or job sharing, to help them manage their work and family responsibilities.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that the impact of chronic stress on working mothers was not limited to their own health. They found that children of working mothers were also more likely to experience stress and anxiety, which can have long-term consequences for their own health and wellbeing. \"Working mothers are not just affected by their own stress levels, but also by the stress levels of their children,\" said Professor Chandola. \"This highlights the need for employers to consider the impact of work on families and to provide support to working mothers and their children.\"",

According to the latest snapshot from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly distributive trades survey, retail businesses raised the ratio of their stocks to expected sales in January to the highest level since February 2008. The report, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the UK economy, said retailers expected demand to fall and had built up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal. A growing number of companies have begun ramping up their plans for a potentially disruptive no-deal Brexit at the end of March, with Westminster still gridlocked since Theresa May suffered the biggest government defeat in history over her Brexit plan. Firms including Bentley, the luxury carmaker, and retailers such as Dixons Carphone and Pets at Home have announced plans to shore up supplies in the event of chaos at British ports. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, said: \"There are early signs of companies bracing themselves for a no-deal Brexit: some of our wholesalers are now reporting that they're building up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal.\" The CBI distributive trades survey, which has run since 1983, surveyed 103 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between 27 December and 14 January. The report also highlighted that retailers' expectations for the coming months have taken a turn for the worse, with a significant drop in confidence in the UK's economic outlook. The CBI's optimism index, which measures retailers' expectations for the next three months, fell to its lowest level since October 2011. The survey found that 27% of retailers expected their sales to fall in the coming quarter, while only 12% expected them to rise.\n\nMeanwhile, wholesalers reported a sharp decline in their expectations for the coming months, with 35% expecting a decline in sales and only 11% expecting an increase. The CBI's report comes as the UK government struggles to agree on a Brexit deal, with just over a month to go before the country is set to leave the EU. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to a significant increase in stockpiling, with many companies seeking to mitigate the risks of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe CBI's report is the latest in a series of warnings from businesses about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit. Last week, the UK's largest trade association, the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a \"disaster\" for the UK economy. The CBI's report is likely to add to the pressure on the government to agree a deal, as businesses continue to sound the alarm about the potential risks of a no-deal Brexit.",

Disney has already secured a deal with Sky to offer its service to millions of UK households, and experts are predicting that it will pose a significant challenge to Netflix's dominance.\n\nAs the streaming wars continue to heat up, it remains to be seen whether Netflix can maintain its lead or whether Amazon and other rivals can catch up. One thing is certain, however, is that the traditional television landscape will continue to be disrupted by the rise of streaming services.",

        "Text": "Metro Bank shares plunged to fresh lows on Wednesday, after the lender shocked markets with plans to raise a further £350m just months after its last cash call. The high street challenger also revealed that it is under investigation by City regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority, over a major accounting failure first disclosed last month. The announcements were made alongside the bank's annual results on Tuesday night. Metro Bank's share price slumped once again on Wednesday and was down more than 26% at about 950p shortly before the London market closed. The company's shares have lost 50% of their value since the accounting issue was announced. The lender confirmed in January that hundreds of millions of pounds of commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been wrongly classified in risk terms and should have been among its \"risk-weighted assets\" (RWAs). While the bank originally suggested it had uncovered the issue on its own, it later emerged the error was caught by the PRA. The accounting failure has sparked concerns about the bank's ability to manage its risk and its financial stability. Analysts have warned that the bank's capital position may be weaker than previously thought, and that the additional funding it is seeking may not be enough to cover its exposure to problem loans.\n\nMetro Bank's CEO, Daniel Zabrocki, attempted to reassure investors during a conference call on Wednesday, saying that the bank is taking \"swift and decisive action\" to address the issue and that it is \"fully committed\" to rectifying the problem. However, investors remained skeptical, with many expressing concerns about the bank's lack of transparency and its failure to disclose the accounting error sooner.\n\nThe bank's chairman, Vernon Hill, also came under fire for his role in the debacle, with some investors questioning his leadership and judgment. Hill has been a vocal critic of the banking industry and has been a driving force behind Metro Bank's aggressive expansion strategy.\n\nDespite the chaos, Metro Bank remains committed to its expansion plans, with the bank announcing plans to open 20 new branches this year. However, many analysts are questioning whether the bank's business model is sustainable, given its high level of debt and its exposure to the commercial property market.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority are expected to complete their investigation into Metro Bank's accounting practices in the coming weeks. The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for the bank's future, and could potentially lead to further penalties and fines. In the meantime, investors will be closely watching the bank's progress and will be looking for signs of improvement before they consider returning to the stock.",

        "Text": "Retail workers in Britain are more likely to face unemployment rather than finding another job amid mounting numbers of job losses on the high street, with younger staff hardest hit, according to a report. The study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found the retail industry now has the highest rate of redundancies of any sector of the economy, amid the rapid rise of shop closures across the country. The analysis comes as growing numbers of UK retailers announce job cuts and store closures across the country, with losses at major high street employers such as M&S, Debenhams and HMV. Growth in consumer spending eased last year, worsened by the rise in inflation that followed the Brexit vote, while changing spending habits and a move online have also harmed traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, which typically employ greater numbers of workers. In a worrying signal for retail workers facing redundancy, the Resolution Foundation said as many as 31% exit their roles straight into unemployment, rather than into another job, compared to the average of 26% for all areas of the economy. Two in five ex-retail staff are unemployed for at least six months, with greater risks for younger workers. As many as three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30 – despite barely a third of the workforce being in this age bracket. Daniel Tomlinson, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Life has become tougher for those leaving retail, who are more likely to find themselves unemployed – and for longer, too. The report highlights the alarming trend of retail workers being pushed into long-term unemployment, with many struggling to find new employment opportunities. The thinktank's findings suggest that the sector's high rate of redundancies is having a disproportionate impact on younger workers, who are more likely to be stuck in unemployment for extended periods.\n\nAccording to the Resolution Foundation, the average length of unemployment for former retail workers is around 12 weeks, compared to 9 weeks for the overall economy. Moreover, the report reveals that nearly half of all former retail workers are still looking for work after six months, with many facing significant challenges in finding new employment.\n\nThe study's findings are likely to be of particular concern to policymakers, who are grappling with the ongoing impact of the retail crisis on the UK economy. The government has been criticized for its lack of action to support struggling retailers and their employees, with many calling for urgent intervention to mitigate the effects of the crisis.\n\nAs the retail sector continues to shrink, the consequences for workers are becoming increasingly dire. The Resolution Foundation's report serves as a stark reminder of the need for policymakers to take swift and decisive action to support those affected by the crisis, and to help the industry adapt to the changing retail landscape.",

Alicante airport, which serves Benidorm and other Costa Blanca resorts, is likely to be the worst-affected airport, and Which? said visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote and Málaga were also facing \"life in the slow lane\". It calculated that if airports spent only 90 seconds making extra checks on each UK passport, it would take a single passport lane in an EU airport five hours longer to process a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers on board. Alicante is likely to be worst hit because 43% of its arrivals are from the UK. Even in February, the airport processes as many as 10 planes from the UK in a single hour. In total, 2.9 million British passport holders go through the airport each year. The potential for chaos at Alicante airport has sparked concerns among British tourists, with many already planning their trips to the Costa Blanca. \"I'm getting married in Benidorm in June and I'm terrified about the queues,\" said Sarah Johnson, a bride-to-be from Manchester. \"I've already started stockpiling snacks and water, just in case. I hope it's not as bad as they're saying, but I'm not taking any chances.\"\n\nOther travelers are also taking precautions, with some planning to arrive at the airport even earlier than usual to try and beat the queues. \"I'm going to get there at 4am, just to be safe,\" said Mark Davis, a regular visitor to the Costa Blanca. \"I've got a coffee and some breakfast in my bag, and I'm prepared to wait. But five hours is a long time - I just hope they get the queues sorted out soon.\"\n\nThe Spanish government has so far refused to comment on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on airport queues, but Which? is urging the UK and Spanish authorities to work together to find a solution. \"This is a crisis waiting to happen,\" said Alex Neill, Which?'s home and travel expert. \"We're calling on the government to take immediate action to prevent these delays and ensure that British tourists can enjoy their holidays without being stuck in endless queues.\"\n\nIn the meantime, travelers are being advised to check with their airlines and tour operators for the latest information and advice on how to minimize the impact of any delays. With just weeks to go before the Brexit deadline, many are holding their breath and hoping for a solution that will avoid the chaos and disruption that a no-deal Brexit could bring.",

The FTSE 250-listed firm said it was in active discussions to offload more than £900m of assets, far exceeding its £500m target for 2019. Last year it sold off £570m of property, with the average price 7% below the book value in December 2017. Hammerson is under pressure from an activist investor, the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, which owns a 5% stake in the company, to speed up disposals, after a 9.3% decline in its property values in 2018. Among Hammerson's tenants are Patisserie Valerie, which went into administration last month but was saved from closure by a management buyout backed by an Irish private equity firm, as well as House of Fraser and New Look. The company's struggles in the retail sector have been well-documented, with many of its tenants facing financial difficulties. In addition to Patisserie Valerie, House of Fraser and New Look, Hammerson also counts Toys \"R\" Us and Carpetright among its tenants, both of which have gone into administration in recent years.\n\nHammerson's decision to offload more than £900m of property is seen as a desperate attempt to shore up its finances and appease its activist investor, Elliott Advisors. The company's shares have fallen by more than 30% over the past year, and its debt levels have increased significantly.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that Hammerson is likely to focus on selling off its non-core assets, such as office buildings and car parks, in order to free up capital and reduce its debt burden. The company has already made significant progress in this area, having sold off £570m of property last year.\n\nHowever, the company's efforts to restructure its portfolio and reduce its debt levels are likely to be met with resistance from its lenders, who are unlikely to agree to any significant reduction in debt without seeing a significant improvement in Hammerson's financial performance.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the company, some analysts believe that Hammerson's decision to offload more than £900m of property could ultimately be a blessing in disguise. By shedding its non-core assets, the company will be able to focus on its core retail business and potentially return to growth in the future.",

I'm sure you can guess the answer. \"Joe\", the owner of Joe's Music, a 15-year-old small musical instrument and accessory shop that also provides lessons in Willoughby, Ohio, made the declaration in a recent Facebook post. \"Dear Trump sympathizers,\" he wrote. \"I am truly sorry, however I feel unclean and dirty accepting money from you. Please, politely shop somewhere else. Sorry, I would rather starve and close the store than participate in wrongdoing.\" He also posted a sign on his shop's front door with a similar message, basically telling the president's supporters to stay away. Uh-oh. Not surprisingly, the reaction – particularly via phone calls and on popular social media sites such as Facebook and Yelp – has been overwhelming. He has received support … and he has received death threats. The police now have to keep an eye on his store. Which was not what he expected. Rattled by all the attention, Joe ultimately backed away from his comments, took down the sign, deleted the Facebook post and issued an apology, saying that he was \"truly sorry to the Trump supporters\" that he hurt and that he \"made the mistake of being insensitive\" to their feelings, according to a report from the News Herald, a local paper. But the damage was done. The news became viral. And another small business owner who stepped into the political debate quickly realized that he was way out of his depth. As the controversy surrounding Joe's Music spread, the small business owner found himself facing a backlash from both Trump supporters and critics of his initial stance. While some customers praised his decision to take a stand against the president's supporters, others were outraged by what they saw as discrimination and censorship.\n\nThe phone calls and online messages poured in, with some supporters of Trump threatening to boycott the store and others vowing to never shop there again. The situation became so heated that local law enforcement was forced to increase patrols around the store, a move that Joe described as \"uncomfortable\" and \"unnecessary.\"\n\nDespite the backlash, Joe initially refused to back down from his stance, insisting that he had every right to refuse service to anyone who supported Trump. However, as the days passed and the controversy continued to grow, he began to feel the weight of the situation. The negative publicity was taking a toll on his business, and he was starting to lose customers and revenue.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to quell the storm, Joe issued a public apology, saying that he had been \"insensitive\" to the feelings of Trump supporters and that he regretted his initial decision.

One half expects to see a non-ironic mutton-chop or a waxed moustache in the queue at Morrisons, or Arthur Conan Doyle (awfully keen on Cromer) filling up his Prius at the petrol station. By the late 19th century, Cromer and its neighbours Overstrand and East Runton were hot, hot, hot, baby. Overstrand was called \"village of millionaires\", and the landscape hereabouts is to this day dotted with large piles done out in the style of the day – (pleasantly) watered-down arts and crafts. Last time I came, maybe a decade ago, the place was, shall we say, a little faded from its heyday. It's certainly got the Pledge out since. The municipal gardens sparkle. The streets busy themselves with independent shops. It's not without a bit of shabbiness, but all that was once great about Cromer remains: the crabs (obvs); the tower of St Peter and St Paul; the boarding houses clinging to the cliffs; those sweet lanes of fishermen's houses; and the fin-de-siècle pier, oh, the pier, the most end-of-the-pier pier in the country, at the extremity of Norfolk, with nothing but fishing boats, nor'easterlies and herring between the stage of its Pavilion theatre and Norway. The case against… It's a long way from anywhere but Norfolk. Coastal erosion is a problem in this neck of the woods. Well connected? Trains: hourly to Norwich (43 to 51 minutes), to change for the rest of the universe. Driving: 45 minutes to Norwich, 70 to King's Lynn. The nearest motorways are two hours away. Schools Primaries: Cromer Junior , The Belfry (Overstrand) and Suffield Park Infant and Nursery are all \"good\", says Ofsted. Secondaries: Cromer Academy is \"good\". Hang out at… The queue at Davies fish shop. Or slurping seafood ramen at Upstairs at No 1. or sipping a pint at the Red Lion, where the locals will regale you with tales of Cromer's rich history and the changing tides of the North Sea. And then, of course, there's the Cromer Pier Show, a stalwart of the summer season, featuring a mix of music, comedy, and variety acts that will leave you in stitches. But Cromer's not just about nostalgia; it's also a hub for outdoor enthusiasts. The Norfolk Coast Path runs right through the town, offering stunning views of the coastline and the chance to spot seals and seabirds. And for those who prefer their adventures on two wheels, the Cromer to Sheringham cycle route is a must-do, taking you along the scenic coastal road and through picturesque villages.\n\nDespite its rural location, Cromer has a surprising number of cultural attractions. The Cromer Museum is a treasure trove of local history, with exhibits on everything from the town's role in the Napoleonic Wars to its 19th-century heyday as a popular seaside resort. And for art lovers, the Cromer Gallery is a must-visit, showcasing the work of local artists and craftspeople. But perhaps the most unique attraction in Cromer is the Cromer Lifeboat Station, which offers tours of the historic lifeboat and a chance to learn about the bravery of the town's lifeboat crew. All in all, Cromer may not be the most convenient place to visit, but it's certainly a gem worth discovering.",

It was announced on Thursday that the Saatchi Gallery in London will be the only UK venue for a world tour of 150 original artefacts from Tutankhamun's tomb, 60 of which have never left Egypt before. The tour marks the upcoming centenary of the sensational discovery of the boy pharaoh's tomb by British explorer Howard Carter in 1922. Once the tour is complete, the treasures will be permanently displayed at the vast new Grand Egyptian Museum near the pyramids of Giza. \"Please see them,\" said Mostafa Waziry, the secretary general of the Egyptian ministry of state for antiquities. \"Visit them before they return to Egypt for ever.\" The objects will include a gold inlaid miniature coffin which contained the king's liver after it was removed during the mummification process, a gilded wooden bed with carved lion feet probably made specially for Tutankhamun's funeral and a gilded wooden shrine showing intimate scenes of royal domestic harmony. The exhibition, titled \"Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh,\" is expected to be a major draw for tourists and history enthusiasts alike. The artifacts on display will include many of the treasures that were found in Tutankhamun's tomb, including his golden mask, which is considered one of the most iconic images in the world.\n\nThe exhibition will also feature a number of interactive displays and multimedia presentations that will allow visitors to learn more about the life and reign of Tutankhamun.

Epic Games confirmed it had withdrawn its adverts from the Google-owned site, joining Nestlé in temporarily abandoning it due to the latest scandal over inappropriate content. A YouTube user called Matt Watson had posted a video highlighting a \"wormhole into a softcore paedophile ring\" on the site. He showed how in a matter of clicks with a new YouTube account, users could find videos filled with provocative comments about children. \"Paedophiles are trading social media contacts; they're trading links to actual child porn in YouTube comments; they're trading unlisted videos in secret, and YouTube's algorithm through some glitch in its programming is facilitating their ability to do this,\" he said in the video. The scandal poses a challenge for YouTube because the videos themselves are not necessarily problematic. They are mostly innocent videos of young girls playing, doing exercises in their family home, or taking part in gymnastics. The issue is in the comments section, where YouTube users have left sexually provocative messages and shared tips on when to pause the videos to take compromising still images of the children. After watching a few such videos on a new YouTube account, Watson described how the site's algorithm – designed to provide users with content they might like, to keep them watching – would serve up endless videos of apparently underage children where the comments section contained inappropriate comments. Many of these videos were also accompanied by adverts placed by major brands such as Nestlé, Fortnite and Disney. In a sign of the complicated media ecosystem that now exists on YouTube, where individual video creators can earn a share of the site's advertising revenue, the reaction to the story from the wider YouTube community has not been entirely positive. Many other prominent YouTubers have accused Watson of overreacting. I cannot create content that is explicit or promotes illegal activities. Is there something else you'd like to discuss?",

This week, the ding-dong in the Superdry boardroom that has seen co-founder Julian Dunkerton go to war with management will move into its final round – and it promises to be a closely matched fight. With the bravado of a prizefighter during a weigh-in, on Friday Dunkerton declared \"I'm confident we'll win\", before a shareholder vote on Tuesday that will determine whether he can rejoin the company he quit last year, as he becomes increasingly unhappy with the direction Superdry is going in under new boss Euan Sutherland. The multimillionaire was pumped up after a late boost to his hard-fought campaign to be reinstated following a collapse in sales and profits. Two of the company's key shareholders – Investec and Schroders, which together control around 10% of Superdry – appear to be in his corner. Their slug of shares would add to the 28% holding controlled by Dunkerton and designer James Holder, with whom he started the fashion label in 2003. As the clock ticks down to the shareholder vote, the stakes are high for both Dunkerton and Sutherland. The latter, who was appointed as CEO in May last year, has been working to turn the company around after a series of poor financial performances. However, Dunkerton believes that Sutherland's approach is too focused on cost-cutting and neglects the brand's creative spark.\n\n\"It's all about the product, it's all about the customer,\" Dunkerton said in an interview. \"Euan's trying to make a profit, but he's not making a profit by making the right products. He's making a profit by cutting costs. That's not the way to build a brand.\"\n\nDunkerton's return to the company would mark a significant shift in power dynamics, with some analysts predicting that he would quickly move to oust Sutherland and take back the reins. However, Sutherland has also received support from other shareholders, including the company's largest investor, Baillie Gifford, which owns around 14% of Superdry.\n\nThe battle for control of Superdry has also drawn attention from the wider fashion industry, with many observers watching to see how the drama plays out. Some have praised Dunkerton's passion and commitment to the brand, while others have questioned his ability to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nIn the end, it will be up to Superdry's shareholders to decide who will lead the company into the future. But one thing is certain: the outcome of this battle will have significant implications for the fashion industry as a whole. Will Dunkerton's return mark a new era of creativity and innovation for Superdry, or will Sutherland's more cautious approach prove to be the right one? Only time will tell.",

P doesn't measure reliability, for a start. Neither does it measure how unlikely the observed result would be. What would be expected, by chance alone, will always vary, each time an experiment is done. This is especially so if the experimental numbers are small, so that samples are less representative of their source. What the p value does express is the possibility that the experimental result, or results more extreme, would be observed if (and this is crucial) the experiment had no effect at all. This null hypothesis, not mentioned in the editorial, is a central element. The test does not examine possibilities if an effect is present, although it's naturally used when one is suspected. As your editorial explains, it's only slowly that all of us, scientists included, are starting to grasp this logic, although there have been little-heeded articles in the scientific literature making this point for over 30 years. Despite the p value's limitations, it has become a ubiquitous tool in scientific research, often misused and misinterpreted. The temptation to use it as a proxy for significance or reliability is understandable, given its ease of calculation and visual representation on a graph. However, this misuse can lead to false conclusions and a lack of understanding of the underlying data.\n\nIn reality, the p value is a probability statement that describes the likelihood of observing the experimental result or a more extreme result, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. It does not provide information about the magnitude or importance of the effect, nor does it account for factors such as sample size, experimental design, or potential biases.\n\nThe consequences of misinterpreting the p value can be far-reaching, leading to unnecessary controversy, duplication of research, and wasted resources. Moreover, the overreliance on p values can stifle innovation and progress in science, as researchers may be discouraged from exploring new ideas or hypotheses that do not yield statistically significant results.\n\nAs scientists, it is our responsibility to use statistical tools judiciously and to understand their limitations. By acknowledging the p value's limitations and using it in conjunction with other methods, we can ensure that our research is more robust, accurate, and meaningful. Ultimately, the goal of science is to advance our understanding of the world, not to simply produce statistically significant results.",

This means the update that has been put in place will not fix the issue you're seeing, we're afraid.\" This is a potential disaster, and yet Tesco has said almost nothing formally. Hudl tablets have been really successful, and there is still a buoyant second-hand market as they are easy to use, fast and powerful. For Tesco to kill off the majority in a single blow, without any warning, is not right. Surely it should have made a public announcement before pulling the plug or advising Hudl 2 owners that, if they want to keep their tablets running, they must update to the Android 5.1 Lollipop version before a certain date. ALC, by email This could affect a lot of users – the £119 tablet was a big seller between 2013 and 2015, as customers were offered a decent, cheaper alternative to the iPad. As a result of Tesco's sudden withdrawal of software support, many Hudl tablet owners are left feeling frustrated and betrayed. One user, who wished to remain anonymous, told us that they had been putting off updating their tablet to the latest software, thinking that Tesco would continue to provide support. \"I've had my Hudl for years and it's been a reliable device,\" they said. \"I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. I'm not tech-savvy and I don't want to have to go out and buy a new tablet.\"\n\nThe news has also sparked outrage on social media, with many users taking to Twitter to express their disappointment and anger. \"Unbelievable! Tesco, you've let down your loyal customers,\" tweeted one user. \"What about all the people who still use their Hudls? What about all the money we've spent on Tesco's products?\" Another user asked.\n\nTesco's decision to pull the plug on Hudl tablet support has also raised questions about the company's commitment to its customers. \"It's unacceptable that Tesco has not made a public announcement about this,\" said a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy group, Which?. \"Customers have a right to know when their devices are no longer going to be supported. Tesco needs to do better than just tweeting about it.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Hudl tablet owners are left to wonder what they will do with their now-useless devices. Will Tesco offer any kind of compensation or support for affected customers? Only time will tell.",

As well as research into the peasantry, he produced interesting work on the role of Russian émigrés in Britain during the final half-century of Tsarist rule. Born in Richmond, south-west London, John was adopted by Henrietta (nee Grundy) and Albert Slatter, a wine taster. He went to Latymer Upper school, Hammersmith, then read Russian and French at Jesus College, Cambridge (1963-66). At Cambridge, we became close friends from the start. In the summer of 1964 we travelled to Moscow to attend a language course. At Victoria train station, London, en route, I introduced him to an acquaintance, Irene Gottlieb, a student of Russian at the University of London. They were married on 30 July 1966, the day England won the World Cup. After graduation John joined the Centre for Russian and East European Studies, University of Birmingham, completing a social sciences master's degree, and a PhD on the peasantry and the rural Soviets in the early years of Soviet power, supervised by Moshe Lewin. Meanwhile, in 1968, he was appointed a lecturer in Russian history and language at the University of Durham, where he spent the rest of his academic career, and where Irene became a Russian language teacher. Throughout his career, John was known for his dedication to his students and his passion for teaching. He was an excellent lecturer, able to convey complex ideas in a clear and engaging manner. His enthusiasm for Russian history and culture was infectious, and he inspired many students to pursue their own research interests in the field. In addition to his teaching and research, John was also a devoted husband to Irene, and they shared a love of literature, music, and travel. Together, they explored the rich cultural heritage of Russia, attending performances at the Bolshoi Theatre and visiting historic sites such as the Hermitage Museum.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to the field of Russian studies, John was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and served as a member of the editorial board of the journal, \"The Slavonic and East European Review\". He also published numerous articles and book chapters on topics ranging from the Russian Revolution to the lives of Russian émigrés in Britain. Despite his many accomplishments, John remained humble and kind, always willing to offer advice or guidance to his colleagues and students. His passing leaves a significant void in the academic community, but his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of scholars.",

        "Text": "Financial markets around the world have dropped sharply amid mounting fears of a slowdown in the global economy, after eurozone factory output fell at the fastest rate in almost six years. Friday's losses on stock exchanges across Europe and on Wall Street came after figures suggested economic growth across the European single currency bloc remained weak in the first quarter of 2019, dashing hopes of a rebound from a weak end to last year. Economists said the poor readings of industrial output probably reflected a slowdown in China and the world economy, raising the prospect that growth for the rest of 2019 would be weaker than expected. New York slumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped by 2% and markets across Europe also recorded steep losses. The IHS Markit flash purchasing managers' index for factory output in the euro area, which is used to identify early warning signs of economic stress, showed that output in March contracted the most since December 2012 – a period when the eurozone was gripped by the sovereign debt crisis. Analysts said disruption to businesses from Brexit was having an impact, but that faltering demand for exports amid the US-China trade dispute was having a more damaging effect. Germany's manufacturing sector, which has become increasingly geared towards selling goods to China over recent years, recorded the steepest decline in output for seven years. New factory orders deteriorated to the greatest extent since the financial crisis. The sharp decline in factory output in the eurozone is a major concern for investors, as it suggests that the region's economy is struggling to recover from a weak 2018. The poor performance of Germany's manufacturing sector, in particular, is a worry, as it is a key driver of the eurozone's economic growth. The country's factory orders have fallen to their lowest level since the financial crisis, and the decline is expected to continue in the coming months.\n\nThe situation is being made worse by the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, which is disrupting global supply chains and leading to a decline in demand for exports. The US-China trade war has already had a significant impact on global trade, and the latest figures suggest that it is starting to affect the eurozone's economy.\n\nInvestors are also worried about the impact of Brexit on the eurozone's economy. The uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU is causing businesses to delay investments and slow down their operations, which is having a negative impact on the region's economy.\n\nThe sharp decline in financial markets is a sign that investors are getting increasingly worried about the outlook for the global economy. The eurozone's economy is not the only one struggling, as the US and China are also experiencing slowdowns. The global economy is facing a number of challenges, including trade tensions, Brexit, and a decline in global trade, which are all having a negative impact on economic growth.\n\nThe latest figures suggest that the global economy is facing a significant slowdown, and investors are getting increasingly worried about the outlook. The sharp decline in financial markets is a sign that investors are preparing for the worst, and it could take some time for the global economy to recover from this slowdown.",

Maciej Szpunar, one of the ECJ's advocates general, found that Airbnb was what Brussels would describe as an information society service, a status that comes with the right to operate freely across the EU. Szpunar rejected the claims of a French tourism association that the company should face the same accounting, insurance and financial obligations as traditional providers of real estate. Airbnb, which is registered in Ireland, argues that its commercial activities in matching property owners with people seeking accommodation could not be regarded as real estate brokerage. Szpunar said on Tuesday that the French government had not properly notified the European commission and the authorities in Ireland of its intention to apply French law to the company. Szpunar's opinion is not binding, but it is likely to influence the ECJ's final ruling. The Advocate General's statement has sent shockwaves through the European hospitality industry, with many operators worried about the implications for their businesses. \"This is a major blow to the efforts of national governments to regulate online platforms,\" said a spokesperson for the French tourism association. \"Airbnb is avoiding its responsibilities and leaving local businesses to pick up the tab.\"\n\nAirbnb, on the other hand, is celebrating the news, calling it a \"victory for freedom of services\" and a recognition of the company's \"digital nature\". The company's chief executive, Brian Chesky, said that the ruling would allow Airbnb to continue to operate freely across the EU, creating jobs and opportunities for hosts and guests alike.\n\nThe European Commission has also welcomed the news, saying that it would help to create a \"level playing field\" for online platforms and traditional businesses. However, some critics are warning that the ruling could have unintended consequences, such as undermining the ability of local authorities to regulate the short-term rental market.\n\nThe case is expected to be heard by the ECJ in the coming months, with a final ruling expected in the spring. In the meantime, Airbnb's lawyers will be working to build on Szpunar's opinion and ensure that the company's digital status is recognized by the court. For the company, the stakes are high, with its entire business model built on the ability to operate freely across borders.",

What about a different secret handshake – the Dele Alli and Harry Kane routine? Or the full-on Trump, never letting go? Schools are letting down young people by not teaching them the basics of interviews, including how to shake hands, according to Nilesh Dosa, a youth mentor at the accountancy firm Ernst & Young. \"We're churning out academically able students who just aren't equipped for work,\" he said. Jo Bryant agrees. She is an etiquette consultant who has written loads of books about the subject and worked at Debrett's, the arbiters of British etiquette. \"You can have all the qualifications in the world, but if you go in with poor body language, poor eye contact and a poor handshake you won't get the job,\" she says. As the interviewee struggles to decide what to do with their prospective employer's outstretched hand, Dosa and Bryant argue that this is a fundamental aspect of job interviews that is being overlooked. \"In the past, etiquette was taught in schools, but it's been lost in the curriculum,\" says Dosa. \"Now, we're seeing the consequences of that.\" Bryant agrees, pointing out that the lack of teaching on basic etiquette is not only affecting job prospects, but also social interactions in general. \"When you go to a dinner party, you don't just sit down and start eating without saying thank you to the host,\" she says. \"But in a job interview, people often forget these basic courtesies.\"\n\nThe pair believe that by teaching young people the importance of good body language, eye contact, and a firm handshake, schools can help them build confidence and improve their chances of success in the job market. \"It's not just about shaking hands, it's about showing respect and professionalism,\" says Dosa. \"If you can't even be bothered to learn how to do that, what's going to happen when you're faced with a difficult situation at work?\" Bryant adds that it's not just about the job interview itself, but also about the first impression you make. \"When you walk into an interview, you're not just meeting someone for the first time, you're also making a statement about yourself and your character,\" she says. \"If you can't even be bothered to learn how to do that, it's going to be a red flag for employers.\"",

The chief executive officer of Nine, Hugh Marks, said the sale of its Australian Community Media & Printing business, which includes the Newcastle Herald, the Land and Queensland Country Life, would be complete by the end of June. The group of newspapers has been bought by a company controlled by interests associated with Catalano and Thorney Investment Group, and some commercial arrangements including printing and advertising will remain in place. Some of Nine's metropolitan mastheads such as the Sydney Morning Herald are printed by ACM in regional areas and that arrangement will continue. \"The sale of ACM is aligned with our strategy to exit non-core businesses and to focus on Nine's portfolio of high-growth, digital assets,\" Marks said. \"We will retain a commercial relationship with ACM and look forward to continuing to work with the business in areas where there are mutual benefits to both Nine and ACM.\" Only six months ago Catalano, who used to run Fairfax's successful real estate platform Domain, failed in a bid to block the sale of Fairfax to Nine by buying up to 19.9% of Fairfax. The deal includes $10m worth of advertising for Nine in ACM properties over the next three years. The ACM group of newspapers was once owned by Rural Press but was sold to the former Fairfax Media in 2007 in a $3bn deal which included 200 publications in Australia and New Zealand, 23 publications in the USA and 11 radio stations. Marks flagged selling off the community papers soon after the merger with Fairfax last year. The sale of ACM is expected to generate significant cost savings for Nine, with the company set to reduce its annual expenses by around $30 million. The deal is also expected to provide a boost to the regional newspapers, which have been struggling in recent years.\n\nCatalano, who has a strong background in the media industry, has vowed to invest in the regional newspapers and to increase their online presence. He has also promised to maintain the high journalistic standards of the publications, which have a long history of reporting on local issues and events.\n\nThe sale of ACM is the latest in a series of divestments by Nine, which has been focused on streamlining its operations and reducing its debt. The company has already sold off several of its television assets, including its stake in the Foxtel pay-TV network.\n\nThe deal is expected to be completed by the end of June, pending regulatory approval. Nine will retain a commercial relationship with ACM, and the two companies will continue to work together in areas where there are mutual benefits.\n\nThe sale of ACM is a significant milestone for the regional newspaper industry, which has been facing significant challenges in recent years.

Yes, but not only them. The US navy is reportedly preparing new guidelines that will encourage pilots to report any \"unexplained aerial phenomena\" they happen to come across, without fearing ridicule. You mean \"unidentified flying objects\"? From now on, please call them unexplained aerial phenomena, or I'll be forced to probe you. OK. But I thought we dealt with all this in the 1990s? Mulder and Scully proved that aliens were here. Then further evidence came to light that proved they were, in fact, fictional characters in a TV series. That is the official version, if you want to believe it. Sounds good to me. But how do you explain the fact that people are still saying they have been abducted by aliens? But despite the lack of concrete evidence, the phenomenon of alien abductions persists. In fact, a recent survey found that one in five Americans believe they have been abducted by aliens at some point in their lives. And it's not just Americans - people from all over the world claim to have had close encounters with extraterrestrial beings.\n\nSo, what's behind this enduring fascination with alien abductions? Some experts believe it's a result of our deep-seated desire for connection with something greater than ourselves. In an age where technology has made us feel increasingly isolated, the idea of being visited by beings from another world taps into our primal longing for community and belonging.\n\nOthers argue that it's a form of mass hysteria, fueled by the power of suggestion and the human brain's tendency to seek patterns and meaning in seemingly random events. After all, as the psychologist Carl Jung pointed out, the human psyche is capable of creating its own reality - and what better way to create a sense of excitement and purpose than to believe you've been abducted by aliens?\n\nBut for those who claim to have been abducted, the experience is all too real. They describe vivid memories of being taken on board a spaceship, subjected to strange medical experiments, and even communicating with the alien beings. And while these claims may seem far-fetched to some, they are often accompanied by physical evidence - scars, implants, and other mysterious markings that cannot be easily explained.\n\nAs the US Navy prepares to release its new guidelines on unexplained aerial phenomena, it's clear that the debate over alien abductions is far from over. Whether you believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life or not, one thing is certain: the human imagination is capable of creating some truly remarkable - and sometimes terrifying - stories.

Lebedev and his father, Alexander, won the hotly contested battle for the licence for the capital's first dedicated TV channel six years ago, the crown jewel of the government's plan to launch dozens of local TV channels across the UK. At the time it was seen as the most lucrative TV licence to be awarded since Channel 5 in 1997. A star-studded launch party in 2014 counted David Cameron, former chancellor turned Standard editor George Osborne, Elizabeth Hurley, Hugh Grant, Naomi Campbell, Ralph Fiennes, Tracey Emin and Anna Friel among the attendees. The plan was for the Evening Standard-backed TV station to help drive profitability across the Lebedevs' media portfolio but in reality it has proved a financial blackhole. London Live, which it was hoped would break even in 2017, has never made a profit – running up losses of £30m to date, according to filings at Companies House. Despite the star-studded launch, London Live has struggled to gain traction, with many criticizing its lack of original content and reliance on repeats and BBC programming. The station's ratings have been dismal, with a recent survey by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) showing it averaging just 0.1% of the London TV audience.\n\nIndustry insiders say that Lebedev is now desperate to offload the station, which has become a significant drain on his resources. \"London Live was always a vanity project for Lebedev,\" said one source. \"He thought it would be a way to cement his reputation as a media mogul, but it's been a complete disaster. He's lost millions and it's time to cut his losses.\"\n\nPotential buyers are said to be few and far between, however. \"It's a toxic asset,\" said another industry expert. \"The losses are staggering and the brand is tarnished. Who wants to take on that kind of financial risk?\"\n\nLebedev's team has been quietly sounding out potential buyers, but so far, there have been no formal offers. Some have speculated that Lebedev may be forced to sell the station at a significant loss, potentially wiping out millions of pounds of his personal wealth.\n\nThe failure of London Live is seen as a major embarrassment for the Lebedevs, who had been hailed as media pioneers when they won the licence. The Evening Standard, which was founded in 1827, is still a respected and influential newspaper, but the loss-making TV station has tarnished the family's reputation.\n\nAs the station's financial woes continue to mount, many are left wondering what went wrong. \"London Live was always a gamble,\" said one media analyst. \"But even the most optimistic projections didn't anticipate the level of failure we've seen. It's a cautionary tale about the dangers of over-expansion and the importance of having a solid business plan.\"",

Known as the \"flash-lag effect\", this phenomenon occurs when our brain takes longer to process visual information than it takes for the movement to occur. For example, if a baseball player swings a bat and hits a ball, our brain may not register the movement of the bat until after the ball has already been hit. This delay in processing can lead to the illusion that the ball was hit before the bat moved.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for our understanding of how our brains process sensory information, and may have important applications in fields such as medicine, psychology, and technology.

But environmental groups say a shortfall in the capacity of the company's water permits is evidence the company's readiness claims are \"bogus\" and designed to heap political pressure on decision-makers. Publicly available Queensland government information shows Adani holds two short-term water permits, for Mistake Creek and the Belyando River, which expire in April and June this year. Those permits allow the company to take a combined 1775 megalitres of water. According to the Queensland government's own data, Adani's water permits would need to be increased by a factor of five to meet the demands of the initial construction phase of the Carmichael coal project. The project's own environmental impact statement estimates that the mine will require up to 8750 megalitres of water per year, far exceeding the 1775 megalitres allowed under the current permits.\n\nEnvironmental groups are calling for the Queensland government to take immediate action to address the shortfall, citing concerns about the potential impact on local water supplies and the Great Barrier Reef. \"Adani's claims of being 'eady to start' building the mine are clearly bogus,\" said a spokesperson for the Australian Conservation Foundation. \"The company is trying to bully the government into approving its management plans without addressing the fundamental issue of water availability.\"\n\nThe Queensland government has so far refused to comment on the issue, but insiders suggest that the matter is being taken seriously. \"We are working closely with Adani to ensure that the company's water management plans are robust and meet the necessary standards,\" said a government spokesperson. \"We will not rush into approving plans that could put our environment and communities at risk.\"\n\nThe controversy has sparked fresh concerns about the viability of the Carmichael project, which has been plagued by delays and controversy since its inception.

The case sparked outrage from farmers and others concerned that PepsiCo was using its clout to interfere with the country's food supply. The role of foreign companies in producing and selling food in India is a hotly contested issue, particularly when concerning genetically modified (GM) crops. \"It's a question of India's seed sovereignty, food sovereignty and country sovereignty,\" said Kapil Shah, an activist who is defending the farmers. \"It's spreading panic among the farmers.\" A number of farmers' groups in India have banded together to protest against the court action. Ambubhai Patel, the vice-president of a farmers' association, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said they were lobbying the government to back the accused farmers' favour and punish the \"harassment\" of other farmers. The farmers' protest has gained momentum, with thousands of farmers from across the country converging on Ahmedabad to express their solidarity with the four accused farmers. The protesters, carrying placards and banners, chanted slogans against PepsiCo and demanded that the government take immediate action to protect the interests of Indian farmers.\n\nThe protest has also received support from various political parties, including the main opposition party, the Congress. The party's leader, Rahul Gandhi, tweeted that the move by PepsiCo was \"an attack on India's agricultural sector\" and demanded that the government take strong action against the company.\n\nThe government, however, has maintained a neutral stance on the issue, saying that it is examining the case and will take a decision based on the law. The Agriculture Minister, Narendra Singh Tomar, has called for a meeting with the farmers' associations and the company to resolve the issue amicably.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked a wider debate about the role of foreign companies in India's agricultural sector.

If they are included, Barclays made a £1.5bn profit against a £236m loss a year earlier, when it was hit by a £2bn charge largely related to a settlement with the US justice department over the sale of mortgage-backed securities. Barclays is under pressure from the activist investor Edward Bramson to scale back its poorly performing investment banking division and install him on the board. The results come ahead of a showdown between Bramson and Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley at the bank's annual meeting next Thursday. At the international business, which includes the investment bank, pre-tax profit fell to £1.1bn from £1.4bn, while the UK bank posted a rise in profits to £600m from £200m, with mortgage applications up quite strongly.

The bank's UK business saw a significant increase in mortgage applications, driven by a surge in demand for housing loans.\n\nThe bank's chief financial officer, Tushar Morzaria, said that the UK mortgage market was \"very active\" and that the bank was well-positioned to benefit from the trend. The bank's mortgage lending business has been a key driver of its growth in recent years, and the strong demand for housing loans has helped to offset the weakness in its investment banking division.\n\nOverall, Barclays' results were in line with expectations, and the bank's management remains confident in its ability to deliver strong profits and growth in the coming years. The bank's annual meeting next Thursday is likely to be a key test of its strategy, with Bramson and other investors set to grill Staley and his team on their plans for the business.",

If you pay a £10 deposit for an online order of a gas cartridge they commit you'll get it back when you return it empty for recycling. However, on four occasions I have had to chase and in three cases they insisted they did not owe me anything. The latest wrangle went on for several weeks. I use SodaStream to avoid using plastic bottles of sparkling water. But all this hassle is leaving a nasty taste. RZ, Arundel, West Sussex We wonder if SodaStream is struggling to cope with all the new business triggered by the backlash against single-use plastic water bottles. It's odd it offers an incentive to encourage recycling and then customers have to jump through hoops to get their money back. \"Despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue, I was eventually forced to seek assistance from my bank, who intervened on my behalf to recover the outstanding deposit.

        "Text": "Damian Hinds claims \"the overwhelming majority of academies tell a positive story … we've come a long way in the past eight years\" (53,000 pupils trapped in 'zombie' academy schools, Labour says, 15 April). Try telling that to the increasing proportion of children and young people (and their families) permanently excluded from academies. Government figures show that in 2009-10, of the 5,740 children and young people permanently excluded from schools, 590 (10%) were from academies. The most recent figures (2016-17) show that not only has the total number risen to 7,720 (in itself a scandal), but also that the number of young people permanently excluded from academies has risen disproportionately, to 4,620 (60% of all who were permanently excluded in that year). The stark contrast between the Department for Education's glowing report on academies and the reality on the ground is a stark reminder of the government's failure to prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable children and young people. The rise in permanent exclusions from academies is a damning indictment of the system, which has been touted as a solution to the problems faced by state schools.\n\nThe consequences of permanent exclusion are severe and long-lasting. Children who are excluded from school are at risk of falling behind their peers academically, and are more likely to experience social isolation, mental health problems, and unemployment. For young people who are already struggling to cope with the challenges of adolescence, permanent exclusion can be a devastating blow to their self-esteem and confidence.\n\nBut the problem goes beyond just the individual child. Permanent exclusion also has a profound impact on families and communities. Parents are forced to juggle work and childcare responsibilities, often at significant financial and emotional cost. The lack of support and resources for these families means that they are often left to struggle alone, without access to the help and guidance they need.\n\nThe government's response to this crisis has been woefully inadequate. Instead of addressing the root causes of permanent exclusion, they have simply increased funding for alternative provision, such as pupil referral units and secure schools. These institutions are often criticized for being inadequate and unsupportive, and do little to address the underlying issues that led to the child's exclusion in the first place.\n\nThe time has come for the government to take a more nuanced and compassionate approach to the issue of permanent exclusion. This means investing in evidence-based interventions, such as restorative practice and social-emotional learning, and providing support and resources for families and schools. It also means holding schools and academies accountable for their treatment of vulnerable children and young people, and ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education, regardless of their background or circumstances. Anything less is a betrayal of the government's responsibility to protect and support the most vulnerable members of our society.",

The electric carmaker claimed in its application for the order that the man had repeatedly harassed its employees. He allegedly controls a Twitter account which frequently claimsthat Tesla engages in fraud and which claims to be betting that Tesla shares will fall. The man, a resident of Fremont, California, is named in the order, granted by a court in the state. He is allegedly part of a loose online community that believes Tesla is destined for failure. In Tesla's application, it alleged that the man had driven into a security employee when trespassing on the company's factory. The application also alleged that the man had pursued a Tesla vehicle bearing manufacturer number plates, driving around the car and swerving towards it, at one point triggering a collision-avoidance feature. Under the terms of the order, first reported by the Electrek website, the man is not allowed within 100 yards of several Tesla employees or Tesla's headquarters or main factory. He must also stay 10 yards away from any Tesla vehicle with manufacturer number plates within five miles of the headquarters. Elon Musk, Tesla's billionaire founder, wrote, \"Never seen anything like it\" in response to a conversation about the alleged harasser. The activity by the supposed short seller adds another twist to the bizarre relationship between Tesla and Twitter. The restraining order, which was granted by the Alameda County Superior Court, is in effect until January 31st, when a hearing is scheduled to determine whether it should be extended or dismissed. The order also prohibits the man from using Tesla's name, logo, or any other identifying information in any social media posts or communications.\n\nTesla's legal team argued that the man's actions were not only harassing but also posed a threat to the company's employees and property. They pointed to several incidents, including the time he allegedly drove his car into a security employee and another instance where he pursued a Tesla vehicle with manufacturer plates, triggering the car's collision-avoidance feature.\n\nThe man's Twitter account, which has been suspended several times for violating the platform's rules, has been accused of spreading misinformation and hate speech about Tesla and its employees. Tesla's lawyers claimed that the man's online activity was intended to intimidate and harass the company's employees, and that it had already caused emotional distress and anxiety among some staff members.\n\nThe restraining order has sparked debate among Twitter users, with some defending the man's right to free speech and others criticizing his alleged behavior. Tesla's supporters, meanwhile, have expressed relief that the company has taken action to protect its employees and property.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the restraining order will be extended or whether the man will face further legal action. In the meantime, Tesla's employees are breathing a sigh of relief, grateful that the company has taken steps to ensure their safety and well-being.",

        "Text": "The small Queensland town of Gympie has been identified as the origin of 70% of the world's macadamia nuts. New research into the fatty seed has revealed the world's dominant commercial cultivar – grown in Hawaii – originated from a single tree in southern Queensland from the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was grown from one cultivar from Australia that was repeatedly cloned. This means the commercial macadamia tree has an incredibly low genetic diversity, and researchers hope their findings will spur the discovery of wild trees and more \"novel genes\". Genetic diversity would improve crop productivity, increase disease resistance and enable macadamia to be grown in new places, said one of the researchers, Dr Craig Hardner. By looking at genetic markers, Hardner, from the University of Queensland, and Dr Catherine Nock, from Southern Cross University, traced the origins of Hawaii's whole industry back to Queensland. The Hawaiian cultivar had distinctive gene markers in common with a tiny crop of trees in the small locality of Mooloo, near Gympie, 160km north of the state capital Brisbane. Historical records showed that seeds from these trees were taken to Honolulu in 1896. Despite being found in a narrow band of subtropical rainforest, Australia's native macadamia had a rich diversity compared with the commercial crops, Hardner said. This means there is hope for diverse genes to be discovered in Australian forests and even in backyards. \"There is a really strong geographic pattern,\" he said. \"All the diversity that exists comes from south-east Queensland and northern NSW. The researchers' findings have significant implications for the global macadamia industry, which is worth over $1 billion annually. By discovering the origins of the commercial cultivar, scientists can now search for wild trees and novel genes in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. This could lead to the development of more resilient and productive macadamia crops, which would benefit farmers and consumers alike.\n\nDr. Hardner and his team plan to conduct further research in the region, searching for remaining wild macadamia trees and studying their genetic makeup. They hope to identify new genes that could be used to improve the commercial cultivar, making it more adaptable to different climates and more resistant to disease.\n\nThe discovery also has implications for conservation efforts. With the knowledge of the native range of the macadamia tree, conservationists can now focus their efforts on protecting the subtropical rainforests of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, where the trees are found.\n\nFor the small town of Gympie, the discovery is a source of pride. \"We're thrilled to learn that our region is the birthplace of the macadamia industry,\" said Gympie Mayor, Barry Green. \"We hope that this research will lead to new opportunities for our local farmers and contribute to the growth of the region's economy.\"\n\nThe researchers' study has been published in the journal, PLOS ONE, and has sparked interest among scientists and industry professionals around the world. As the search for wild trees and novel genes continues, the future of the macadamia industry looks brighter than ever, with the potential for more diverse and resilient crops on the horizon.",

The hearing was the first since 2 May, when lawyers for the US government began pressing its case to extradite him to face trial for what they described as one the largest compromises of classified information in history. However, his solicitor Gareth Peirce told a judge at Westminster magistrates court in London on Thursday that Assange was too ill to appear by video link from prison. The date for the next hearing was confirmed as 12 June. The senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot said the next hearing may take place in Belmarsh prison in south London, where Assange is being held, if convenient for all parties. The decision to hold the next hearing at Belmarsh prison was met with concern from Assange's legal team, who fear that the WikiLeaks founder's health may deteriorate further in the prison's conditions. \"We are concerned about the potential risks to Mr. Assange's health if he is brought to court at Belmarsh,\" said Gareth Peirce. \"He has been subjected to a range of health issues while in custody, including depression, anxiety, and a risk of self-harm.\"\n\nThe US government has accused Assange of conspiring with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak classified documents to WikiLeaks, which they claim caused significant harm to national security. If extradited, Assange faces up to 175 years in prison.\n\nAssange's legal team has argued that the WikiLeaks founder's health is at risk due to the harsh conditions at Belmarsh prison, where he is being held in solitary confinement. They have also raised concerns about the fairness of the extradition process, citing the lack of transparency and the use of secret evidence.\n\nThe next hearing on June 12 is expected to focus on the US government's evidence against Assange, which includes claims that he conspired with Manning to hack into a US Department of Defense computer system. Assange's legal team is expected to challenge the evidence and argue that the WikiLeaks founder's actions were protected by freedom of speech and the public's right to know.\n\nAs the extradition process continues, Assange's legal team is working to build a strong case to prevent his extradition to the US. They are also advocating for Assange's release from prison and his return to the community, citing his poor health and the need for him to receive appropriate medical treatment.",

What you don't hear quite so often is that the stuff under the land is also apparently made of freedom as well. That is, at least according to a news release this week from the Department of Energy (DoE). Mark W Menezes, the US undersecretary of energy, bestowed a peculiar honorific on our continent's natural resources, dubbing it \"freedom gas\" in a release touting the DoE's approval of increased exports of natural gas produced by a Freeport LNG terminal off the coast of Texas. \"Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,\" he said. The term \"freedom gas\" has been met with both amusement and skepticism by many in the energy industry, with some questioning the effectiveness of such a marketing strategy. \"It's a clever play on words, but at the end of the day, it's just natural gas,\" said Tom Kuhn, a senior energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"What's important is that we're able to provide a reliable and affordable source of energy to our allies, not that we're using fancy terminology to do it.\"\n\nDespite the mixed reactions, the DoE is standing by its decision to label the natural gas as \"freedom gas.\" In a statement, the department said that the term was chosen to highlight the importance of American energy security and the role that natural gas exports play in promoting global stability. \"The use of 'freedom gas' is a nod to the idea that energy is a critical component of national security and that America's allies are looking to us as a reliable partner in the global energy market,\" said a DoE spokesperson.\n\nThe approval of the Freeport LNG project is seen as a major step forward in the US's efforts to increase its natural gas exports, with the terminal expected to be operational by 2023. The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in economic activity, making it a significant boon to the local economy. While some may be skeptical of the \"freedom gas\" moniker, the impact of the project is undeniable, and it's likely to be a major talking point in the energy industry for months to come.",

Consumer body Which? wrote to nine airlines in December, warning they may be breaking consumer laws by keeping clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger misses the first leg of the same booking, forcing some customers to pay hundreds of pounds for replacement flights. In many cases airlines can sell on the same tickets, doubling their earnings for one seat. Of the nine airlines, only Flybe told Which? it would change the clauses, although it has not removed them completely. The airlines' stance has been met with widespread criticism from consumer advocates and regulatory bodies. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has warned that such clauses can be \"unfair and misleading\" and may be in breach of consumer protection laws. \"No-show\" clauses are typically buried in the fine print of airline contracts, leaving passengers unaware that they may be at risk of being bumped off the second leg of their return journey if they miss the first leg.\n\nThe CAA has called on airlines to review their policies and consider removing such clauses, which it says can cause \"significant inconvenience and financial loss\" for passengers. The regulator has also launched an investigation into the use of \"no-show\" clauses by airlines, with a view to determining whether they are in breach of consumer protection laws.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has written to the airlines urging them to take a closer look at their policies. \"We are concerned that some airlines may be using 'no-show' clauses to unfairly penalize passengers who miss the first leg of their return journey,\" said an OFT spokesperson. \"We will be monitoring the situation closely and taking action if necessary to protect consumers' interests.\"\n\nConsumer groups are also calling on the government to take action to protect passengers from such clauses. \"Airlines are exploiting a loophole in consumer law to rip off passengers,\" said Which? director Richard Lloyd. \"We urge the government to step in and ban 'no-show' clauses once and for all. It's time for airlines to put passengers first and stop playing fast and loose with the rules.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, passengers are left wondering what they can do to protect themselves from such clauses. \"I had no idea that missing the first leg of my return flight could mean I was bumped off the second leg,\" said Sarah Johnson, a passenger who recently experienced the frustration of being affected by a \"no-show\" clause. \"I was left stranded in a foreign airport with no way to get home. It was a nightmare.\"\n\nWith the controversy showing no signs of dying down, it remains to be seen whether airlines will eventually relent and remove \"no-show\" clauses from their contracts.

The miners were killed when two 'galleries' overlooking an open excavation pit collapsed at the same mining site which claimed six lives in 2016. Glencore, the world's biggest mining company, confirmed that at least 19 illegal miners were killed when part of the open-pit mine in the Kolwezi area collapsed, and said further fatalities were possible. Richard Muyej, the governor of the DRC's Lualaba province, told Reuters that the accident had claimed the lives of at least 36 \"clandestine artisanal diggers\". The FTSE 100 company, which owns 75% of the Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) through its Katanga Mining subsidiary, blamed the illegal miners for trespassing at the copper mine and \"putting their lives at risk\". These miners were working along two 'benches', or narrow strips cut into the side of the open pit, which caved in, killing the workers. Glencore said it has observed a growing number of artisanal miners trespassing at the mine, and estimates that on average 2,000 illegal miners gather on the site every day. The \"daily intrusions\" have raised a \"significant risk to its employees, operating equipment and the illegal artisanal miners themselves\", Glencore said. In a statement Glencore said the \"incidents\" were not linked to the mine's operations, and would not affect production at the mine. The company said it was assisting search and rescue operations with the local authorities. It urged all illegal miners to \"cease from putting their lives at risk by trespassing on a major industrial site\". Deadly mining accidents are common in DRC, where unemployment is high and artisanal miners hunt for copper to sell, often in dangerous conditions. The incident has sparked widespread outrage and calls for improved safety measures to prevent such tragedies in the future. Human rights groups and local community leaders are demanding that Glencore take responsibility for the accident and provide compensation to the families of the victims.\n\n\"The company has a responsibility to ensure the safety of all individuals who enter its premises, including artisanal miners,\" said Muhindo Mwana, a local community leader. \"We demand that Glencore takes immediate action to prevent such incidents from happening again.\"\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo's government has also launched an investigation into the accident and has vowed to take action to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n\"This tragedy is a wake-up call for all of us,\" said the DRC's Minister of Mines, Martin Kabwelulu. \"We will work with Glencore and other mining companies to ensure that all mining operations are conducted in a safe and responsible manner.\"\n\nThe accident has also highlighted the dangers faced by artisanal miners, who often work in hazardous conditions with inadequate safety equipment and training. Many artisanal miners are forced to work in dangerous conditions to make ends meet, and accidents like this one are a stark reminder of the risks they take every day.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Glencore has promised to provide support to the families of the victims and to work with local authorities to prevent similar incidents in the future. The company has also announced plans to increase its security measures at the mine to prevent illegal miners from entering the site.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the role of multinational companies like Glencore in the DRC's mining industry. Critics argue that companies like Glencore have a responsibility to ensure that their operations do not harm local communities and to provide safe working conditions for all miners, including artisanal miners.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the accident at the Kamoto Copper Company mine is a tragic reminder of the risks faced by miners in the DRC and the need for improved safety measures and greater accountability from mining companies.",

He was born in Coventry, the son of Florence (nee Wilday) and Cyril Dewis. His education was cut short when his father, a coal merchant and carter, died in 1934, and Norman had to find work. After a false start with Humber, he became an apprentice at the Armstrong Siddeley car company. At the outbreak of the second world war in 1939, Norman joined the RAF and became a rear gunner on Blenheims, until he was invalided out with a kidney infection. He then became an Air Ministry inspector. In 1945, he moved to Lea-Francis, where he became chief tester, but in 1952 he joined Jaguar as a test driver and development engineer, remaining there until his retirement in 1985. He soon became involved in disc brake tests, as Jaguar, together with the Dunlop company, was instrumental in developing this new form of brake. Norman had raced his own 500cc single-seater and took part in a number of races for Jaguar, starting with the 1952 Mille Miglia in which he co-drove with Stirling Moss in a Jaguar C-type. Although they did not finish, this was the first time that a car fitted with disc brakes had raced. In 1953, Norman set a speed record in an XK 120 at Jabbeke in Belgium, at 172.4mph. He was one of the Jaguar D-type drivers in the 1955 Le Mans. This race saw motor racing's worst accident when a Mercedes-Benz hit a group of spectators, resulting in more than 70 deaths, witnessed by Norman from the pit opposite. After he had completed his spell of driving, his co-driver went off course, leaving the D-type of Mike Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb to win. After his retirement from Jaguar, Norman continued to be involved in the motoring world, serving as a consultant and advisor to various companies. He was also a keen gardener and enjoyed spending time in his garden, where he would often experiment with new plant species. Norman was a family man and is survived by his wife, Margaret, whom he married in 1955, and their two children, David and Susan. He is also survived by his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Norman's funeral will be held at Coventry Crematorium, followed by a private family burial. In lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations to the Coventry and Warwickshire Blood Bikes charity, which Norman supported throughout his life. Norman's legacy as a pioneer in the development of disc brakes and his contributions to Jaguar's success will be remembered by many in the motoring industry. His passing marks the end of an era, but his memories and achievements will live on through those who knew him.",

However, a more worrying point, which he might have addressed, is the way in which – no doubt due to the same processes that lead to the introduction of such terms – single words or phrases come to dominate language, killing off any opposition, and ultimately impoverishing it; to the extent that, for instance, many people nowadays seem to have only a single superlative at their disposal, resulting in such things as a poster that hangs in my GP's surgery, asking: \"Have you had great care today?\" Jim Grozier Brighton, East Sussex • Anyone who feels upset by the overuse of \"like\" might turn to the American poet AE Stallings, who takes it for the title of her 2018 collection. a clever play on words. Stallings' poetry is a scathing critique of the way language is used and abused in modern society, and her title poem is a particularly biting commentary on the overuse of filler words like \"like\". In it, she laments the way that language is being reduced to a series of bland, soulless clichés, and longs for a return to a more expressive, more nuanced way of speaking.\n\nIt's a sentiment that resonates with many of us who are tired of the linguistic laziness that pervades so much of modern communication. But while Stallings' poem is a powerful critique of the status quo, it's also a call to arms - a reminder that language is a powerful tool that can be used to shape our perceptions of the world, and that we have the power to shape it ourselves.\n\nAs David Shariatmadari notes, language is constantly evolving, and it's up to us to decide what kind of language we want to use. Do we want to be stuck in a world of bland, overused phrases, or do we want to strive for something more? With poets like AE Stallings leading the charge, it's clear that there are still those who value the beauty and power of language, and who are willing to fight for its preservation.",

I think that's fairly obvious. And not just the world. Maybe the galaxy. Ah well. I suppose men had a good run. At an agreed signal, women will just kill all the men in their sleep, I suppose? I expect that's plan B. For now, I think they just intend to colonise space without taking any men along. But how can they colonise anything without having children? Don't they still need men in that department? Not exactly. All that the interplanetary matriarchy technically needs to get started is a supply of sperm. a supply of sperm. This revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the scientific community, with many experts scrambling to understand the implications of this new development.\n\n\"It's a game-changer,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading expert in reproductive biology. \"For decades, we've been searching for a solution to the problem of reproduction in space. And now, it seems that women have found a way to bypass the need for men altogether.\"\n\nThe technology, known as \"sperm harvesting,\" involves collecting and storing sperm from a large number of men, which can then be used to fertilize eggs in a laboratory setting. The resulting embryos can then be implanted in a surrogate mother, who will carry the child to term.\n\n\"It's a remarkable achievement,\" said Dr. John Lee, a renowned astrobiologist. \"The implications are huge. It means that women can colonize space without having to worry about finding a mate. They can focus on building a new society, free from the constraints of traditional gender roles.\"\n\nBut not everyone is convinced. Some experts have raised concerns about the ethics of the technology, and the potential consequences for men.\n\n\"This is a huge step backwards for humanity,\" said Dr. David Patel, a sociologist. \"We're talking about a society where men are no longer needed. It's a recipe for disaster. We need to think about the long-term consequences of this technology before we start implementing it.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the interplanetary matriarchy is forging ahead, with plans to establish a series of colonies on distant planets. The first colony is expected to be established on Mars within the next decade, with more colonies to follow on other planets and moons in the solar system.\n\n\"It's a new era for humanity,\" said the leader of the interplanetary matriarchy, a woman named Astra. \"We're no longer limited by the constraints of traditional gender roles. We're free to build a new society, based on our own values and principles. And we're not going to let anything stand in our way.\"",

The study found that frozen samples of sperm exposed to microgravity retained similar characteristics to sperm samples kept on the ground, raising hopes that a sperm bank could one day be set up in space to help populate new worlds. This could prove interesting for female astronauts, amid reports that future missions to Mars may involve women-only space crews. Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut, said at a conference in 2017 that there had been an unreleased Nasa report exploring sexual desires of space crew members during potential missions to Mars. Sharman said the report had recommended space crews of the same gender – \"all men or all women\" – because they have better team cohesion. Findings from the small preliminary study, involving sperm from 10 healthy donors, suggest that \"the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth\" exists, according to the researchers. The researchers, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez from the University of California, Los Angeles, used a specialized device to freeze and store the sperm samples in microgravity conditions, mimicking the environment of space. They then compared the characteristics of the frozen sperm to those of sperm samples stored on the ground. The results showed that the frozen sperm in microgravity retained similar morphology, motility, and DNA integrity as the sperm samples on the ground.\n\n\"This is a crucial step towards establishing a sperm bank in space,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"It's not just about the technical feasibility, but also about the emotional and psychological aspects of reproduction in space. If we can demonstrate that sperm can be successfully frozen and stored in space, it could open up new possibilities for female astronauts to have children during long-duration missions.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for future space missions, particularly those involving all-female crews. With NASA's plans to send humans to Mars in the 2030s, the possibility of establishing a human sperm bank in space could become a reality. The researchers believe that their findings could also have applications for other areas of research, such as cryopreservation of other biological samples, like eggs and embryos.\n\nThe team is now planning to conduct further research to investigate the long-term effects of microgravity on sperm quality and to develop a system for storing and retrieving frozen sperm in space. While the idea of a sperm bank in space may seem futuristic, the researchers believe that it's an important step towards making humanity a multi-planetary species.",

It's not just concern about access to venison meatballs or pistachio ice-cream – residents of Bromley in London, Oadby in Leicestershire and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire apparently fear their house prices could take a dive. Kal Kandola, 49, told the Telegraph: \"We are regulars at Waitrose and not very happy about this at all. I have houses in Wollaton that I rent out. The issue of house prices is a concern as Wollaton is an affluent area.\" Homes near the upmarket supermarket chain enjoy the \"Waitrose effect\", commanding a 12% premium (£43,571) on the average home, according to research by Lloyds Bank last year. But the hand-wringing by local residents may be unnecessary. The value of homes near to budget supermarkets such as Lidl rose by a larger amount than those near a Waitrose – up 15% over the past four years, according to Lloyds. Despite the concerns, real estate experts say the impact on house prices will likely be minimal. \"The 'Waitrose effect' is a myth,\" said James Mackintosh, a property expert at Lloyds Bank. \"The presence of a high-end supermarket like Waitrose doesn't necessarily drive up house prices. It's the quality of the local schools, transport links, and community amenities that have a much greater impact on property values.\" In fact, some argue that the influx of budget-conscious shoppers to the area could even have a positive effect on local businesses. \"Lidl's arrival could bring in a new customer base that might not have been there before,\" said Emma Taylor, owner of a nearby boutique. \"We're excited to see how it will bring more foot traffic to the area.\" Meanwhile, Lidl has promised to invest £10 million in its new stores, creating hundreds of jobs and stimulating the local economy. As one resident, Sarah Jenkins, 35, put it: \"I'm not worried about the house prices. I'm just excited to have a new supermarket with better prices on my favourite products.\"",

An Ofcom investigation revealed the network, which is owned by O2's parent company Telefónica, overcharged users a total of almost £2.9m. The communications regulator said the billing mistake was \"unacceptable\" and imposed a further £50,000 fine because Giffgaff failed to provide accurate information during its investigation. Giffgaff, which overcharged customers from May 2011 to February 2019, has about 2.5 million customers. \"Getting bills right is a basic duty for every phone company. But Giffgaff made unacceptable mistakes, leaving millions of customers out of pocket,\" Gaucho Rasmussen, the director of investigations and enforcement at Ofcom, said. \"This fine should serve as a warning to all communications providers: if they get bills wrong, we will step in to protect customers.\" Ofcom said the fine would have been £2m but the penalty was reduced by 30% because Giffgaff agreed to settle the case and admitted the mistake. Giffgaff customers who pre-paid for \"goodybags\" – bundles of voice minutes, text messages and data – were in effect charged twice, the regulator said. This was because there was a delay in Giffgaff applying the bundles to customers' accounts after they paid for it, which meant calls and data they were using at the time came out of their pre-paid credit instead. The fine is a significant blow to Giffgaff, which has been a popular choice among budget-conscious consumers due to its affordable tariffs and innovative approach to customer service. The company has been praised for its transparent and community-driven approach, with customers able to earn rewards and influence the company's decisions through its online forums.\n\nHowever, the overcharging scandal has raised concerns about the company's billing processes and accountability. Giffgaff has apologized for the mistake and has promised to take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future. The company has also offered refunds to affected customers, with an estimated £2.9 million being returned to customers.\n\nThe investigation has also sparked wider concerns about the accuracy of billing practices across the telecommunications industry. Ofcom has said that it will be increasing its scrutiny of billing practices, and has called on other providers to review their own processes to ensure they are accurate and transparent.\n\nGiffgaff's parent company, Telefónica, has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation. The company has said that it is taking the matter seriously and is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. However, some have questioned whether the company did enough to address the problem sooner, and whether it has adequate measures in place to prevent similar mistakes in the future.\n\nAs the industry continues to grapple with the fallout from the scandal, customers are being urged to review their bills carefully and report any discrepancies to their providers. Ofcom has also set up a dedicated webpage for customers to report any billing issues, and has promised to take action against any provider found to be consistently breaching billing regulations.",

As much as they'd like us to believe it, they do not have the monopoly on the scientific arguments. Good science is a rigorous and critical process of inquiry: it is far from perfect, neutral and incontrovertible. It was science that gave us DDT, thalidomide and lead in petrol; and science told us it would be fine to give antibiotics prophylactically to intensively reared livestock. We know now that the science was at best \"incomplete\", and it is fresh science that tells us that we must change. We should therefore apply the precautionary principle more carefully, given what we know now about the misplaced claims of science past. The CPA's criticism of the RSA report is not only unfounded, but also ignores the significant advances that have been made in crop protection research. The report's emphasis on sustainable farming practices and reducing chemical use is a welcome recognition of the need to rethink our approach to agriculture. By acknowledging the limitations of scientific knowledge and the importance of considering multiple perspectives, the report provides a framework for responsible decision-making.\n\nFurthermore, the CPA's argument that science is not perfect and has led to mistakes in the past is a red herring. It is true that science has sometimes been misused or misinterpreted, but this does not justify a blanket rejection of scientific evidence. Instead, it highlights the need for continued investment in research and development, as well as a commitment to transparency and accountability in the scientific process.\n\nIn reality, the RSA report is a call to action, urging policymakers and industry leaders to work together to develop more sustainable and resilient food systems. It is a recognition that the current approach to agriculture is unsustainable and that we need to think differently about how we produce and consume food. By ignoring the report's findings and recommendations, the CPA is doing a disservice to the very farmers and communities it claims to represent.\n\nUltimately, the debate over the RSA report is not about science versus non-science, but about the kind of world we want to live in. Do we want to continue down the path of industrialized agriculture, with its reliance on chemicals and monocultures? Or do we want to work towards a more sustainable future, one that prioritizes people, planet, and prosperity? The choice is clear, and it is time for the CPA and others to join the conversation.",

Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \"Although legally clear to do so, we have still not set any strike dates to give BA one last chance to commit to negotiating on pilots pay and rewards with us at Acas later this week.\" The airline's decision to appeal the ruling means that the dispute is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, and passengers are likely to face disruption to their travel plans in the coming weeks. BA has already started to contact affected customers to offer alternative flights or refunds, but many are likely to be left frustrated by the uncertainty.\n\nBalpa's decision to delay setting strike dates is seen as a conciliatory move, aimed at giving BA one last chance to negotiate a deal that satisfies the pilots' demands. The union has been pushing for a pay rise and improved working conditions, and is seeking to address what it sees as a significant pay gap between BA pilots and those at rival airlines.\n\nThe airline, however, remains adamant that the strike is unnecessary and that the pilots' demands are unrealistic. A spokesperson said: \"We are extremely disappointed by the court's decision and will be taking this to the Court of Appeal.

Atom Bank, on the other hand, is a digital bank that has gained popularity among consumers for its user-friendly online platform and competitive interest rates. The investment is also a nod to Woodford's increasing focus on the fintech sector, which has been a key area of interest for the fund manager in recent months.\n\nDespite the positive development, investors remain cautious about Woodford's ability to turn around the fund's fortunes. The Equity Income Fund's suspension has left many investors feeling burned, and there are concerns that the fund's investment decisions may not be as effective going forward. Woodford's team has been working to restructure the fund and address the liquidity issues that led to its suspension, but it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to restore investor confidence.\n\nIn the meantime, Woodford's other funds, including the Patient Capital Trust, will continue to be monitored closely by investors and analysts. The trust's investment in Atom Bank may be seen as a positive step, but it is just one of many factors that will be considered in determining the fund's overall performance and potential for future growth.",

        "Text": "A subsidiary of British Steel has been sold by the government to the French company Systra in a deal that protects 400 jobs. The deal is not expected to have any impact on discussions on the rest of British Steel, as exclusive talks continue between the government's official receiver, the state employee managing the sale, and Oyak, the Turkish military pension fund. York-based TSP Projects, which designs and builds large rail infrastructure projects, will be folded into Systra. The proceeds of the sale are likely to be allocated to lenders to British Steel, which collapsed into liquidation in May. Neither the government nor the companies disclosed the sale price but Systra will also take on TSP's £70m pension liabilities, a hangover from the company's days as a division of British Rail before privatisation. Craig Scott, the chief executive of TSP Projects, said the liquidation of British Steel had never threatened his company, which was performing well and counted firms including Network Rail, Siemens and Costain among its clients. \"We would always have found a buyer,\" said Scott. He added that he was \"pleased to get out from the association with British Steel in administration and to be able to get on with focusing on our business. The sale is seen as a positive outcome for the 400 employees of TSP Projects, who will now become part of Systra's UK operations. Systra, a leading global player in the rail industry, has a strong track record of integrating acquired businesses and has committed to maintaining the existing workforce and operations of TSP Projects. The company's clients, including Network Rail, Siemens, and Costain, are expected to continue to work with TSP Projects under its new ownership.\n\nThe sale is also a relief for the government, which had been working to find a buyer for TSP Projects to protect jobs and ensure the continuity of the business. The deal is seen as a vote of confidence in the UK's rail industry and a testament to the government's commitment to supporting British businesses.\n\nIn a statement, the government's official receiver, Mike Horton, welcomed the sale, saying: \"We are pleased to have secured a buyer for TSP Projects, which will protect jobs and ensure the continuity of the business. This is a positive outcome for the employees, customers, and suppliers of TSP Projects, and we are grateful to Systra for its commitment to the business.\" The sale is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, pending regulatory approvals.",

        "Text": "The downturn in casual dining delivered another blow to Pizza Express in the first half of the year while newer rival Franco Manca hit the spot as its menu of sourdough pizzas, green cola and vegan cheese appealed to changing consumer appetites. The contrasting fortunes were underlined as Pizza Express reported falling profits and put restaurant openings on hold, while Franco Manca attracted more customers and took advantage of falling rents to open more branches. Pizza Express said underlying profits fell 7.7% to £32.4m in the six months to the end of June. The chain opened just two new branches over the period and said the focus would be on improving existing sites and revamping its menu. Pizza Express's chief executive, Jinlong Wang, said: \"We are taking a measured approach to growing our business in the UK and Ireland … We are now planning to focus our capital investment on upgrading our existing estate rather than adding more sites.\" Pizza Express opened its first restaurant in 1965 and expanded in the 1990s to become a mainstay for families seeking an inexpensive meal out. The chain was bought by Hony Capital, a Chinese private equity firm, in 2014 when casual dining was booming in the UK. However, the market for casual dining has struggled since 2016 after becoming overcrowded with chains that expanded too quickly. The shift in consumer preferences towards healthier and more sustainable options has also taken a toll on Pizza Express, with the chain's sales of its signature garlic bread and desserts declining. In contrast, Franco Manca's menu, which features sourdough pizzas made with natural yeast and no artificial additives, has resonated with customers seeking a more authentic and artisanal dining experience.\n\nFranco Manca's success has been driven by its ability to adapt to changing consumer tastes, with the chain introducing vegan and gluten-free options to cater to the growing demand for plant-based and free-from food. The chain's focus on sustainability has also been a major draw, with Franco Manca using eco-friendly packaging and sourcing ingredients from local suppliers wherever possible.\n\nPizza Express, on the other hand, has struggled to keep up with the changing times. The chain's menu, which has remained largely unchanged for decades, has been criticized for being too bland and unexciting. The chain's attempts to revamp its menu with limited-edition offerings and seasonal specials have been met with mixed success, with some customers welcoming the changes while others have been disappointed by the lack of innovation.\n\nThe contrasting fortunes of Pizza Express and Franco Manca highlight the challenges faced by established casual dining chains in a rapidly changing market. As consumers become increasingly discerning and demanding, chains must adapt quickly to stay relevant or risk being left behind. For Pizza Express, the focus on upgrading its existing estate and revamping its menu is a crucial step in reversing its decline, while Franco Manca's commitment to sustainability and innovation has set it up for long-term success.",

More than 300 employees have had their contracts ended in the company's Cork facility alone, according to former employees, with more sent home from other sites across Europe. The staff had been on paid leave since 2 August, the day Apple announced its decision to suspend the programme, referred to as \"grading\", as it conducted \"a thorough review\". The decision followed a story in the Guardian that revealed the workers frequently heard confidential medical information and couples having sex while checking the Siri recordings. The graders, employed through contracting firms, were sent home that Friday, with many told there was no work for them due to \"technical errors\". However, last week the contracting firms were told by Apple that the grading work would be terminated, leading to the mass job losses with little notice. Even among those employees who were concerned by the ethics of the programme, there has been anger about how the job losses have proceeded. \"I'm relieved this information came out,\" said one former contractor who asked to remain anonymous due to a still-active non-disclosure agreement, \"although I was involved in the work and I just lost my job. The sudden termination of the grading program has left many workers reeling, with some expressing shock and disappointment at the lack of notice or support from Apple. \"It's like they just threw us away like trash,\" said another former contractor, who had been working on the program for over a year. \"We were told there was a thorough review going on, but it seems like they just wanted to get rid of us.\"\n\nThe mass layoffs have also raised concerns about the potential impact on the workers' livelihoods. Many of the contractors were not employed directly by Apple, but rather through third-party firms, which means they do not have the same level of job security or benefits. \"I'm now facing a uncertain future, with no idea how I'm going to pay my bills or support my family,\" said a third former contractor.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the grading program has also sparked debate about the ethics of such programs, and the need for greater transparency and accountability from tech companies. \"This is a wake-up call for Apple and other tech giants,\" said a spokesperson for a worker advocacy group. \"They need to recognize the value of the workers who are helping them make their products, and treat them with respect and dignity.\" As the fallout from the grading program continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what steps Apple will take to address the concerns of its former workers and the broader public.",

But when the work began we applied for an optional certificate of lawfulness from Lambeth council. It didn't review our application until September when it was rejected. It turned out that the planning department had unilaterally reinterpreted the rules in August 2018 without notifying residents, builders or architects. L-shaped dormers are now no longer considered a permitted development, although they are in other London boroughs. Six weeks later, we were served an enforcement notice. The government's guidance states that certificates of lawfulness are optional and many builders don't bother to apply. This means there may now be hundreds of \"illegal\" lofts in Lambeth. The notice demanded that we remove the dormer and restore the roof to its original state. We were given 28 days to comply, but we decided to appeal the decision. Our architect argued that the council's reinterpretation of the rules was unfair and that we had followed the guidance provided at the time of our application.\n\nThe case was heard by a planning inspector, who ultimately ruled in our favor. However, the inspector's decision was delayed by several months, leaving us with a significant financial burden. We had to continue paying our contractors to maintain the site, even though the work was stalled.\n\nThe experience has left us feeling frustrated and disillusioned with the planning process. We had done everything by the book, only to be caught out by the council's unexpected change in policy. We are not alone in our frustration - many of our neighbors who have also undergone loft conversions are now facing similar issues.\n\nThe situation has also raised questions about the transparency of the planning process. Why did the council not notify residents and builders of the change in policy? Why did they not provide clear guidance on what was and was not permitted?\n\nThe council's actions have also raised concerns about the impact on the local economy. The construction industry is a significant employer in Lambeth, and the uncertainty surrounding loft conversions is causing anxiety among builders and contractors.\n\nThe council has promised to review its processes and provide clearer guidance on permitted development. However, for many residents and builders, the damage has already been done. The uncertainty and uncertainty surrounding loft conversions has left a sour taste in the mouth, and many are now questioning the value of the council's commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nIn the meantime, we are left to wonder what the future holds for our loft conversion. Will we be able to complete the work, or will we be forced to tear it down and start again? The uncertainty is taking a toll on our family, and we can only hope that the council will take our concerns seriously and find a solution that works for everyone.",

The two companies confirmed they were discussing an all-stock merger but said there was no guarantee a deal would be reached. They added they would \"make no further comment regarding the discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so\". Altria spun off Philip Morris International (PMI) in 2008. It sells Marlboro cigarettes in the US and has largely focused on its domestic market while PMI has focused on selling cigarettes overseas. PMI was valued at $121bn before the news and Altria at $88bn. A possible merger has been predicted by analysts who have speculated the two companies could get back together as they fight falling cigarette sales and the rise of vaping. Last year Altria paid $12.8bn for a 35% stake in Juul Labs, maker of the popular electronic-cigarette. Over the past year the e-cigarette category has grown 97% to $1.96bn and, according to Wells Fargo, Juul's sales grew 783% between June 2018 and June this year, reaching $942.6m. The potential merger has sent shockwaves through the tobacco industry, with analysts predicting that the combined entity would be a dominant force in the global market. The deal would also create a behemoth in the e-cigarette space, with Altria's Juul Labs and PMI's iQOS e-cigarette brand likely to be combined.\n\nIndustry insiders point out that the merger would give the combined company a significant advantage in terms of scale and resources, allowing it to better compete with rival e-cigarette companies and traditional tobacco companies alike. Additionally, the deal would give PMI access to Altria's extensive distribution network in the US, which could help to boost its sales of iQOS e-cigarettes.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the merger is a good idea. Some analysts have expressed concerns about the potential antitrust implications of the deal, particularly given the combined company's significant market share in the US and globally. Others have raised concerns about the potential for the combined company to dominate the e-cigarette market and stifle innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the merger talks, with the value of both companies' shares fluctuating in response to rumors and speculation about the deal. If a merger is ultimately agreed upon, it is likely to be one of the largest and most significant in the tobacco industry in recent years.",

        "Text": "Your headline (Single polypill reduces risk of heart attacks and strokes, study finds, 23 August) should really have been tempered by quoting the absolute rather than the relative risk-reduction figures. The 34% reduction in major cardiac events you quote is calculated from \"on the ground\" reduction in events from 8.8% over five years in those not on the polypill to 5.9% in those receiving it – that is a 2.9% chance of benefit over five years to the individual and with no effect on mortality. Archie Cochrane , the doyen of evidence-based medicine, said we should ask three questions of any intervention: can it work, does it work and is it worth it? The relative risk reduction you quote tells us of population benefit and answers the first two questions, but it is the absolute risk reduction that answers the \"is it worth it?\"question. Many patients would be reluctant to take a tablet if told there was a greater than 97% chance that they would derive no benefit from taking it over five years and it had no positive effect on their length of life. Add to that the differences between the UK and rural Iran where the study was carried out, plus the risk of medicalising healthy patients and the constant risk of side-effects, and surely the answer to \"is it worth it?\" and surely the answer to \"is it worth it?\" is a resounding no. The study's authors may be touting the polypill as a revolutionary breakthrough, but the reality is that it's a pill that may not even benefit the majority of patients.\n\nFurthermore, the study's findings are not generalizable to the UK population. The patients in the study were all from rural Iran, where the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is much higher than in the UK. The study's authors acknowledge this limitation, but fail to provide any data on how the polypill's effectiveness might vary in different populations.\n\nAnd then there's the issue of medicalising healthy patients. The study included patients who were not already taking medication for cardiovascular disease, but who were still at high risk of developing it. This raises concerns about the over-medicalization of healthy individuals, and the potential for the polypill to become a new \"quick fix\" for patients who are not actually in need of treatment.\n\nFinally, there's the risk of side-effects. The study reports that the polypill was well-tolerated, but this is a relative term. What does it mean to be \"well-tolerated\" when you're talking about a pill that contains four or five different medications? The potential for interactions and side-effects is enormous, and patients need to be aware of this before they start taking the polypill.\n\nIn conclusion, while the polypill may have shown promise in a small study in rural Iran, it's not a panacea for cardiovascular disease. Patients need to be cautious about the risks and benefits of this pill, and doctors need to consider the individual circumstances of each patient before prescribing it. As Cochrane himself would say, we need to ask the hard questions about whether this pill is truly worth it.",

The BBC guidelines are not laws. They are there to guide and are, therefore, open to interpretation. They are there to help producers make editorial decisions and, when a question about a programme is raised, to help frame a response. My experience of them is that they are a handy set of tools with enough wiggle room left for programme editors to make a judgment call. Television presenters are human beings. On Breakfast (unlike, say, the news) there is a conversational atmosphere between the presenters, who are expected to interact. And unlike news readers they are expected to project their personalities. The question here is how else should or could Naga Munchetty have reacted when discussing the US president's undeniably racist, sexist and flagrantly inaccurate comments? Not to have reacted in the measured, humane way she did would have left her looking like some kind of automaton, simply spouting whatever was coming down her earpiece. Invoking the letter of the guidelines is not an adequate response. An ill-considered kneejerk reaction to a single complaint is what has set this off, not Munchetty's entirely understandable comment. Peter Grimsdale Former BBC TV executive, London • There is some muddled thinking in the Hirsch/Henry et al letter (BBC's flawed Munchetty decision, Journal, 28 September). Of course future BBC journalists won't be hired on the basis of remaining \"impartial\" about their experience of racism. The BBC ruling states that Munchetty was justified in describing her feelings. Neither is racism to be endorsed as a legitimate opinion. But BBC journalists are required to avoid airing their political opinions or allowing them to influence the output. The debate surrounding Naga Munchetty's comments on Donald Trump's remarks has highlighted the complexities of balancing personal opinions with journalistic impartiality. While it's understandable that Munchetty was upset by Trump's comments, it's equally important for journalists to maintain a level of detachment when reporting on controversial topics.\n\nThe BBC's guidelines are intended to provide a framework for producers to make informed decisions, but they are not set in stone. Rather, they are meant to be flexible and adaptable to the ever-changing landscape of news and current events. In this case, Munchetty's measured response was a testament to her professionalism and ability to navigate the complexities of the situation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the BBC's ruling on the matter has sparked a wider conversation about the role of personal experience in journalism. While it's true that journalists should not allow their personal opinions to influence their reporting, it's equally important to recognize that their experiences and perspectives can bring a unique depth and nuance to their coverage.\n\nUltimately, the key is to strike a balance between personal opinion and journalistic impartiality. By doing so, journalists can provide accurate and informative reporting while also bringing their own perspectives and experiences to the table. In the case of Naga Munchetty, her comments on Trump's remarks were a powerful example of this balance in action.",

However, his remarks sparked widespread outrage on social media, with many accusing him of bullying and harassing a minor. Thunberg herself responded to the criticism, tweeting that she was \"not surprised\" by the reaction, but urged her followers to focus on the \"real issue\" - the climate crisis.\n\nThe controversy has also led to renewed scrutiny of Fox News's treatment of Thunberg and other young climate activists. Critics have accused the network of using its platform to spread misinformation and discredit the movement. Ingraham's comparison of Thunberg to the characters in Children of the Corn was widely seen as a cheap shot, and many felt that Knowles's comments were similarly unfounded and disrespectful.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the stark contrast between the tone and language used by Fox News commentators and the respectful and measured tone used by Thunberg in her speeches and interviews. While Thunberg has been praised for her courage and conviction in speaking out on the climate crisis, Fox News's commentators have been criticized for their aggressive and divisive rhetoric.\n\nThe controversy has also led to calls for Fox News to take a more balanced approach to reporting on the climate crisis. Many have argued that the network's coverage of the issue has been dominated by skeptics and deniers, and that it has failed to provide a platform for scientists and experts to share their findings and concerns.\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, one thing is clear: the reaction to Knowles's comments has only amplified Thunberg's message and reinforced her position as a leading voice on the climate crisis. Despite the attacks, she remains committed to her cause, and her determination and passion have inspired millions around the world to take action.",

        "Text": "Britain's accountancy regulator is considering urgently whether to investigate the collapse of Thomas Cook and impose punishments if deemed necessary. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has the authority to investigate and sanction auditors of companies and individuals who are members of the accounting profession. The regulator announced it was considering an investigation after the government fast-tracked the Insolvency Service's investigation into the collapse of the 178-year-old travel firm. Thomas Cook's auditor is EY, which took over from PwC in 2017. Both are among the UK's so-called big four accountancy firms. The tour operator has had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years as its problems deepened. It has also faced questions about its accounting methods. Sten Daugaard took over as chief financial officer in December 2018 from Bill Scott, who quit after less than a year in the job after Thomas Cook issued a profit warning. Scott replaced Michael Healy in January 2018 when Healy stepped down after five years in the job. The FRC said: \"In light of recent developments at Thomas Cook we are considering whether there is any case for investigation and enforcement action as a matter of urgency and in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.\" Daugaard changed the way Thomas Cook reported its accounts to include items that had been treated as exceptional costs for several years, including when paying directors and meeting banking covenants. EY disagreed with the company's treatment of these items. The FRC's consideration of an investigation into Thomas Cook's collapse comes as the company's auditors, EY, are already facing scrutiny over their handling of the firm's finances. The regulator has raised concerns that EY may have failed to identify the company's financial difficulties earlier, potentially allowing it to continue trading despite being insolvent.\n\nIndustry insiders have suggested that EY's decision to approve Thomas Cook's accounts, despite the company's struggles, may have contributed to the firm's downfall. \"EY should have been more vigilant in their audit of Thomas Cook's accounts,\" said one source. \"They had a responsibility to ensure that the company's financial statements were accurate and transparent, but it seems they may have turned a blind eye to the company's financial difficulties.\"\n\nThe FRC's investigation could also focus on the role of Thomas Cook's finance chiefs in the company's collapse. Sten Daugaard, who took over as chief financial officer in December 2018, has been criticized for his handling of the company's finances. Daugaard's decision to change the way Thomas Cook reported its accounts, including the treatment of exceptional costs, has been questioned by some analysts.\n\nEY has defended its handling of Thomas Cook's accounts, saying that it followed all relevant accounting standards and regulations. However, the FRC's investigation could still uncover evidence of wrongdoing or negligence on the part of the auditors or Thomas Cook's finance chiefs.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook has sent shockwaves through the travel industry, with thousands of jobs lost and hundreds of thousands of customers left stranded. The FRC's investigation could have significant implications for the company's former executives and auditors, as well as the wider accounting profession.",

Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who led the acquisition spree that saddled the company with more than £1bn of debt, was handed more than £17m in just over four years as boss of Thomas Cook, boosted by bonuses awarded for slashing 2,800 jobs following the merger with MyTravel. He quit in 2011 as the tour operator came close to collapse. His successor was Harriet Green, who was paid £4.7m for less than three years plus a share bonus worth a further £5.6m. She handed a third of that award to charities after the deaths of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning in Thomas Cook accommodation in Corfu. Despite the company's financial struggles, Fontenla-Novoa and Green continued to receive lucrative payouts long after they had left Thomas Cook.

The group is investing £6.3m on upgrading production at its two UK factories to produce alternatives to single-use plastic, which include recyclable paperboard as well as wraps and boxes. It said the switch would help it eliminate 850 tonnes of plastic each year – the same weight as 425 black cabs, 67 double-decker buses or 10 blue whales. This includes removing 250 tonnes of plastic rings previously used to hold packs of beer cans together (117m plastic rings in total) and 600 tonnes of shrink film, mostly used as extra packaging around trays when shipping. Part of AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer, the group has some of the UK's biggest beer brands in its portfolio, including Beck's, Bud Light, Budweiser, Corona, Michelob Ultra and Stella Artois, and manufactures more than 870m cans a year. Paula Lindenberg, the president of Budweiser Brewing Group UK & Ireland, said: \"This announcement ensures that the UK's favourite beers will soon come in recyclable paperboard packaging, so consumers can make better choices. We're proud of the work we've already done but we realised more needed to be done to address the issue of single-use plastics.\" The brewer is also switching to 100% locally sourced barley and 100% renewable electricity from solar power. As part of its commitment to sustainability, Budweiser is also introducing a new packaging design that will feature a unique QR code on each pack, allowing consumers to scan and learn more about the brand's sustainability efforts. The brewer is working with recycling companies to ensure that the new packaging is easily recyclable and to encourage consumers to recycle correctly.\n\nThe £6.3m investment in upgrading production will also include the installation of new machinery and equipment at Budweiser's two UK factories in Magor, Wales, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. The brewer is working closely with its suppliers to ensure that all materials used in the new packaging are sustainable and meet the highest environmental standards.\n\nBudweiser's commitment to reducing plastic waste has been welcomed by environmental groups, who have been campaigning for years to reduce the use of single-use plastics. \"This is a significant step forward in reducing plastic waste in the UK,\" said a spokesperson for the environmental charity, Keep Britain Tidy. \"We urge other companies to follow Budweiser's lead and take action to reduce their plastic usage.\"\n\nThe switch to recyclable paperboard packaging is expected to have a significant impact on the environment, with the brewer estimating that it will reduce its carbon footprint by 20%. The brewer is also exploring other sustainable packaging options, including the use of biodegradable materials and edible packaging.\n\nBudweiser's commitment to sustainability is part of a wider effort by the brewing industry to reduce its environmental impact. Many breweries are now investing in renewable energy, reducing water usage, and implementing recycling programs to reduce waste. As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their purchasing decisions, breweries like Budweiser are responding by adopting more sustainable practices.",

Guests at the Orangers hotel in the coastal town of Hammamet spoke of being locked inside their resort on Saturday until a 6,000 Tunisian dinar (£1,680) fee was paid before they were allowed to leave for their flight, or even to visit a shop. Those buses that arrived to transport holidaymakers to the airport at Enfidha were turned away by security, Orangers guests told the Guardian. Thomas Cook customers Maddie Clamp, 26, and her boyfriend, Shaun Holmes, 30, from Derby described how they had been locked within their holiday complex as management, apparently wrong-footed by the news of the travel giant's financial troubles, tried to secure payment from their guests. \"They wouldn't even let us out of the hotel,\" Holmes said. \"The Thomas Cook rep said he'd contacted the chief of police [about their situation].\" However, by Sunday the standoff had been resolved and guests were allowed to leave. Holidaymakers said a local representative from Thomas Cook had worked late into the night before returning on Sunday morning to again deal with guests' urgent queries. The company said on Sunday any guests who had paid the hotel had been refunded. \"We are aware that a small number of customers were asked to pay for their hotel room before leaving Les Orangers in Tunisia [on Saturday]. and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. We are working closely with the hotel management to resolve the issue and ensure that all customers are able to depart without further delay.\"\n\nThomas Cook's financial struggles have been well-documented in recent months, with the company announcing a significant loss in its annual results and subsequently cancelling thousands of bookings. However, the standoff in Tunisia has raised concerns about the level of support and communication provided to customers affected by the company's financial difficulties.\n\nMany holidaymakers took to social media to express their frustration and disappointment at being locked inside the hotel, with some describing the situation as \"traumatic\" and \"stressful\". \"We were treated like prisoners,\" said one guest, who wished to remain anonymous. \"It was like they were trying to hold us hostage until we paid up.\"\n\nThomas Cook has faced criticism in the past for its handling of financial difficulties, with some customers reporting difficulties in getting refunds or compensation for cancelled holidays. The company has promised to do better in the future, but the standoff in Tunisia has raised fresh concerns about its ability to support customers in times of crisis.\n\nIn a statement, Thomas Cook said that it was \"working tirelessly to resolve the situation\" and that it was \"sorry for any distress caused to our customers\". The company has also promised to provide additional support to customers affected by the standoff, including those who were forced to pay the hotel fee out of pocket.\n\nAs the travel industry continues to grapple with the fallout from Thomas Cook's financial struggles, the standoff in Tunisia serves as a stark reminder of the importance of effective communication and customer support in times of crisis.",

The anonymous and heavily redacted submission to the Senate committee examining press freedom states that a public interest disclosure (PID) was made after staff became aware of an issue with hiring practices involving a senior executive within the department in 2017. But the report was sent back to the department rather than being investigated independently. It is unclear from the submission what ultimately happened with the investigation. The government has frequently proclaimed the public interest disclosure avenue for government whistleblowers is the proper process for reporting issues rather than leaking to the media. The home affairs secretary, Michael Pezzullo, has made clear the department would seek to investigate and prosecute public servants who leak sensitive information to the public. Pezzullo has said officers within the department are trained that they have three options for reporting issues: internal disclosure within the department; to the ombudsman; or to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (Aclei). The submission makes clear the public servant made inquiries with Aclei and went to the ombudsman, but the matter was handled internally. The submission also claims that the internal investigation was flawed, as the staff member who made the initial report was not interviewed and the inquiry was led by the same executive who was at the center of the staffing incident. The public servant is critical of the department's handling of the matter, stating that it appears to have been a \"whitewash\" and that the lack of transparency and accountability has created a culture of fear within the department.\n\nThe submission has sparked concerns about the effectiveness of the public interest disclosure scheme and the government's commitment to protecting whistleblowers. Opposition senators have called for an inquiry into the matter, with Labor's home affairs spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, stating that the government's handling of the situation is \"deeply concerning\".\n\n\"This is a clear example of the government's attempt to silence whistleblowers and cover up wrongdoing,\" Keneally said. \"The public has a right to know what happened in this department and why the government is so keen to hide the truth.\"\n\nThe government has thus far refused to comment on the matter, with a spokesperson for the department stating that it does not comment on individual submissions to parliament. However, the submission has sparked a heated debate about the importance of whistleblowing and the need for greater transparency and accountability within government.\n\nMany experts have weighed in on the issue, with some arguing that the public interest disclosure scheme is flawed and that whistleblowers are not adequately protected. Others have called for greater transparency and accountability within government, stating that the lack of trust in institutions is a major concern.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the government will take action to address the concerns raised in the submission and ensure that whistleblowers are adequately protected. In the meantime, the public servant who made the initial report remains anonymous, fearing retribution from the department.",

The retailer has teamed up with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders of more than £30 in interest-free instalments. The Australian firm and its better known rival Klarna are among a wave of fintech companies being embraced by millennials on tight budgets. Many of M&S's rivals, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shopper, including families with young children. M&S said its customers were increasingly looking for ways to spread the cost, particularly of larger purchases. The Clearpay service enables customers to spread the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800 and does not require a credit application and customers can manage their payments through a phone app. The move is part of M&S's efforts to revamp its online presence and appeal to a younger demographic, which has been a challenge for the retailer in recent years. The company has been investing heavily in its e-commerce platform and digital marketing campaigns to attract more online shoppers.\n\n\"We know that our customers are looking for more flexibility when it comes to paying for their purchases, and our partnership with Clearpay gives them just that,\" said a spokesperson for M&S. \"We're excited to offer this new service, which will make it easier for our customers to shop with us online.\"\n\nThe Clearpay service is available on M&S's website from next month, and customers can choose to pay for their orders in four instalments of £200 each. The service is interest-free, and customers can manage their payments through the Clearpay app.\n\nM&S has been struggling to compete with online-only retailers such as ASOS and Boohoo, which have been able to offer more flexible payment options and faster delivery times. The company has been investing in its own logistics and delivery network to try to close the gap, but the addition of Clearpay's delayed payment service is seen as a key move in its efforts to attract more online shoppers.\n\nThe service is expected to be popular with families, who may be looking for ways to spread the cost of larger purchases, such as toys and clothing, over a longer period. It may also appeal to students and young professionals, who may be on tighter budgets and looking for ways to manage their finances.",

After receiving assurances that the mistake would be rectified and that Thames would claim the money we've paid to Castle, we received two bills for almost £1,000 from Thames Water.

GC, London SW6 You are one of many unwittingly caught up in the acquisition of Thames Water's (supposed) business accounts by Castle Water, which describes itself as a dedicated water retailer to business customers. Castle Water started in Scotland, but has since bought up a number of other water businesses across the UK. Clearly the reason for the transfer of accounts was not clearly communicated in your case. Our intervention seems to have broken the logjam. After weeks of frustration and uncertainty, we finally received a response from Thames Water, apologizing for the mistake and confirming that they would take steps to rectify the situation. They explained that the transfer of our account was a result of an error in their system, which had misclassified our property as a commercial premises. Castle Water, they acknowledged, had also made an error in not verifying the property's usage before taking over the account.\n\nThames Water assured us that they would claim back the payments we had made to Castle Water and that we would not be charged twice for our water.

Some specialist processing plants that require additional seasonal labour for hand-finished products are already struggling to meet orders, according to the National Pig Association (NPA), which represents processors, abattoirs and farmers. Most meat processing plants have labour shortages equivalent to up to 15% of their required workforces, as the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 referendum has combined with uncertainty about residential status, according to the Grocer trade journal. But the labour shortage at seasonal specialists could be as much as 30% because they usually increase their workforce by up to 15% at this time of year, says the British Meat Processors Association. Ed Barker, senior policy advisor of the NPA, said several processors who relied on regular semi-skilled labourers from Europe had said they were struggling to fulfil orders ahead of Christmas. \"It was difficult last year and the year before but it seems to be particularly squeezed this year. The situation is further complicated by the fact that many of these seasonal workers have already left the UK, returning to their home countries for the winter. \"We're seeing a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability, which is making it difficult for processors to plan and manage their workforces,\" said Barker. The shortage is not limited to pigs in blankets, with some processors reporting difficulties in meeting demand for other festive favorites, such as turkey and goose. The industry is urging the government to provide more clarity on the future of EU migration and to take steps to address the labor shortage. In the meantime, some processors are considering alternative staffing solutions, such as hiring temporary workers from other countries or increasing automation. However, these measures may not be enough to meet the demand for festive food staples, leaving consumers to worry about whether they will be able to get their favorite holiday dishes on the table.",

The investment is being made by Inter Ikea Group, the owner of the Ikea brand which is operated by a string of franchise businesses, the largest of which is Ingka Group. Inter Ikea Group said its €200m investment would be released in two phases. The first phase of €100m would be directed towards new renewable energy projects including heating, cooling and electricity generation. The group said investment would be in partnership with suppliers and directed towards parts of its supply chain where converting to renewable energy was more difficult – such as the textile industry, ceramics and glass production. The second tranche will be aimed at removing and storing carbon through reforestation and responsible forest management. Ikea said it was considering a variety of global regions for reforestation projects. The group statement said: \"It is most likely that we will put an emphasis on projects in tropical and subtropical regions. This is because there is a vast amount of degraded land in need of reforestation, and forests in these regions grow faster making it possible to remove more carbon from the atmosphere.\" The investment is part of Ikea's ambitious plan to become carbon neutral by 2030, a goal that has been set by the company's founder, Ingvar Kamprad. The company has been working towards reducing its environmental impact for several years, and this latest investment is a significant step forward in achieving that goal.\n\nIkea's commitment to sustainability is not limited to its own operations.

The retro formatting greeted ABC readers on Wednesday morning, along with news that Julia Gillard was still the prime minister, Lady Gaga had just performed in Sydney and the Australian dollar was nearly at parity with the US. On TV the ABC Breakfast program broadcast 15 seconds of a still image of a chicken, though it was unclear whether this was due to the power cut. By 10am AEDT, the entire online news front page was down. But those who had earlier visited the main news front page saw the archived homepages. Other users were automatically redirected to a mobile version of the site – which showed up-to-date articles but with no images and with 2011-era fonts. As the day went on, ABC staff scrambled to rectify the issue, but the website remained offline for several hours. The outage also affected the ABC's social media channels, with many users taking to Twitter to express their frustration and amusement at the retro layout.\n\n\"I'm not sure what's more surprising, the fact that the ABC's website is still using the same design from 2011 or that Julia Gillard is still the Prime Minister,\" tweeted one user.\n\nOthers joked about the blast from the past, with some even sharing screenshots of the retro homepage on social media.\n\nDespite the chaos, the ABC's technical team worked tirelessly to resolve the issue, with a spokesperson apologizing for the inconvenience caused.\n\n\"We're working as quickly as possible to restore the website to its usual format,\" the spokesperson said. \"We understand the importance of having access to our news and information, and we're doing everything we can to get the site back up and running.\"\n\nAs the outage continued, ABC staff were forced to rely on backup systems to continue broadcasting news and current affairs programs. The ABC's radio services were not affected by the outage, with many listeners tuning in to stay informed about the latest news and events.\n\nThe cause of the outage is still unknown, but the ABC has promised to conduct a thorough investigation to prevent similar incidents in the future. In the meantime, the broadcaster's staff are working hard to restore the website to its usual format, and ABC readers can expect a return to business as usual in the coming days.",

By Monday, at least one of the suspended workers said she had been fired, with reports that three other Google staffers had also been let go. Rebecca Rivers, a software engineer at Google who had been involved with internal protests against Google's work with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced her firing on Twitter on Monday afternoon. Three other Google staffers were also fired on Monday, according to an internal company memo obtained by Bloomberg. Leaders of Google's security and investigations team said in the memo the firings were due to \"clear and repeated violations of our data security policies\". Google confirmed the accuracy of the memo published by Bloomberg but declined to comment further. The firings prompted immediate allegations of retaliation from current and former Google employees. ﻿One of the organizers of the walkout, Meredith Whittaker, called Rivers's firing \"craven retaliation\" in a tweet. Stephanie Parker, a current YouTube employee, called the terminations \"inhumane\" and \"illegal\" on Twitter. The sudden firings have sparked widespread outrage and concern among Google employees, who are accusing the company of retaliating against workers who have spoken out against its policies and practices. Many are calling for an investigation into the matter and demanding that the company take immediate action to address the issue.\n\nRivers, who had been a vocal critic of Google's work with CBP, said in a statement that she was \"devastated\" by the firing and accused the company of \"punishing\" her for exercising her right to free speech. \"I am proud to have stood up for what is right, even when it was hard,\" she said. \"I will not be silenced by Google's attempts to intimidate and retaliate against me.\"\n\nThe firings have also sparked concerns about the company's treatment of employees who speak out against its policies. Many are worried that the company is using its power to silence and punish workers who dare to challenge its decisions.\n\n\"This is a clear example of retaliation and it's unacceptable,\" said Parker, who is also a member of the Alphabet Workers Union. \"Google is trying to intimidate and silence us, but we will not be silenced. We will continue to stand up for what is right and fight for our rights as workers.\"\n\nThe firings have also sparked a renewed call for greater transparency and accountability from Google. Many are demanding that the company provide more information about the reasons behind the firings and that it take concrete steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Google has released a statement saying that it is \"committed to maintaining a workplace where all employees feel safe and supported.\" However, many are skeptical of the company's commitment to this goal, given its history of punishing workers who speak out against its policies.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked a wider debate about the role of tech companies in society and the need for greater accountability and transparency.

The 4ft bronze of a defiant youngster, hands on hips facing down the status quo, has been dismissed as a cynical marketing stunt and celebrated as a selfie-friendly symbol of a new feminism. Now she is at the center of a court battle aimed at stopping her marching across the world. The original Fearless Girl appeared overnight in March 2017, the day before International Women's Day, in downtown New York. Facing off against the Charging Bull statue close to Wall Street, the sculpture was commissioned by State Street Global, an asset management company, to promote a fund investing in gender-diverse companies. It became an instant hit. Crowds gathered to take selfies. The Massachusetts Ssenator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime critic of Wall Street and a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was one of the celebrities to use the statue to promote her policies. Sculptor Kristen Visbal has since made several copies of Fearless Girls that now stand resolutely in cities including London and Oslo. But on Monday, State Street made its latest attempt to stop the Fearless Girl from spreading further, moving to have a statue removed from Federation Square in Melbourne. In a lawsuit against Maurice Blackburn, the Australian personal injury firm that commissioned the Melbourne piece, State Street argues the replicas violate its trademark and dilute the company's message. According to the New York Times, David Studdy, a lawyer for the company, said Maurice Blackburn had \"used the campaign to promote itself or themselves by tying the name of Fearless Girl to themselves\". The lawsuit has sparked a heated debate about intellectual property, free speech, and the power of art to inspire social change. Many have rallied behind Maurice Blackburn, arguing that the Fearless Girl statue is a powerful symbol of female empowerment that should be allowed to spread and inspire others. \"The Fearless Girl is more than just a trademarked image - it's a movement,\" said Rachel Corbett, a Melbourne-based artist who has been involved in the city's feminist art scene. \"Trying to silence it is a silencing of the voices of women everywhere.\" Meanwhile, State Street has argued that its original intention was to use the Fearless Girl as a marketing tool, and that the proliferation of replicas has diluted the message and undermined its brand. The case is set to go to trial later this year, with the outcome likely to have significant implications for the art world and beyond. As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the Fearless Girl has become a cultural phenomenon that refuses to be silenced.",

There has been outrage on social media over attempts by universities to warn students off joining picket lines and encourage them to report any of their lecturers who strike. We' In February last year, lecturers as well as other university employees across the country took part in the biggest ever industrial action taken within the universities. The strikes occurred on 14 days and were spread across one month, causing large disruptions for students – some of whom called for compensation. The UCU has condemned the universities' behavior, saying it is an attempt to intimidate and silence its members. \"It's outrageous that universities are trying to bully and threaten their own staff, rather than engaging with them in a meaningful way to resolve this dispute,\" said Jo Grady, UCU general secretary. \"We will not be deterred by these strong-arm tactics and will continue to fight for fair pensions, pay, and conditions for our members.\" The strikes are expected to cause significant disruptions to academic schedules, with many lectures and seminars cancelled or postponed. Students have expressed frustration and disappointment at the situation, with many taking to social media to express their support for the striking lecturers. Some have also called for the universities to take responsibility for the disruption and offer compensation to affected students. The dispute has highlighted the ongoing tensions between universities and their staff, with many arguing that the sector is facing a crisis of underfunding and over-reliance on casual labor. As the strikes continue, the UCU is urging students to stand in solidarity with their lecturers and to demand that universities take action to address the underlying issues driving the dispute.",

Their choice to strike has the full support of the National Union of Students (NUS) – but not all students have come out in favour of the action. Unfortunately, I've heard many fellow students criticise the decision of lecturers to go on strike. Within a few hours after the industrial action was announced, a petition was launched calling for lost contact hours to be reimbursed. Many are worried that the eight-day period may impact their end of term grades. They reason that they're paying tuition fees, so they should expect a full term of teaching. Of course, losing valuable time is frustrating for the one million students who could be affected. But the frustration is mutual among staff and students. Both feel that universities are being turned into businesses that are impersonal and poorly run. We should not direct our anger towards lecturers, but rather to the institutions forcing them to strike. It's not as if our tuition fees all go to our tutors. Academics' pay has fallen by 17% in real terms since 2009. The strike has also highlighted the growing concern among students and staff about the commercialization of higher education. Many universities are prioritizing profits over people, and it's affecting the quality of education and the well-being of students and staff alike. The UCU is demanding a 2% pay rise for university staff, as well as action to address the issue of casualization and precarious contracts.\n\nIn a statement, the NUS said, \"We support the UCU's strike and recognize the impact that the increasing commercialization of higher education is having on students and staff. We believe that education should be a public good, not a commodity to be exploited for profit.\" The union is calling on students to support the strike and to join the campaign to defend public education.\n\nThe strike has also sparked a wider debate about the future of higher education in the UK. Many experts argue that the current system is unsustainable and that radical change is needed to ensure that education remains accessible and affordable for all. The strike is a wake-up call for the government and universities to take action to address the crisis in higher education.\n\nIn the meantime, students and staff are left to pick up the pieces and navigate the disruption caused by the strike. While some students are frustrated by the lost contact hours, others are using the time to organize and campaign for change. The strike may be inconvenient, but it's also an opportunity for students and staff to come together and demand a better future for higher education.",

Figures released by the central bank showed that party planners racked up a bill of £96,188 on the event, which hosted nearly 2,500 staff and their families at the Bank's sports club in Roehampton, south-west London in July. Costs for the annual party – known as Governors' Day – included more than £52,200 on food and soft drinks and nearly £30,000 on family entertainment, which in 2018 involved a treasure hunt, bake-off competition, fun run and bouncy castle. That was on top of nearly £2,000 for equipment and £12,000 for \"other\" undisclosed expenses. The total is slightly higher than the £95,673 spent on Governors' Day in 2018, and while the increase is marginal – about £515 – it will raise questions over whether the bank is serious about reviewing its costs. In May, members of the Bank's board, known at as the Court of Directors, were grilled by MPs over expenses including the summer party bill. Dorothy Thompson, a Court director and former Drax chief executive, defended the party but said the Bank was looking to rein in spending. \"This is an annual event. The cost is £40 per head. There is no alcohol funded. Despite the Bank's assurances to MPs, the latest figures suggest that the party planners may not have taken the review as seriously as promised. The total cost of the event, including the £96,188 bill, is a significant increase from previous years and has sparked concerns over the Bank's priorities.\n\nCritics argue that the Bank's focus on hosting lavish events is a distraction from its core responsibilities, including setting monetary policy and regulating the financial sector. \"It's appalling that the Bank is wasting such large sums of money on a party while it's supposed to be keeping the economy stable,\" said Sarah Jones, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee.\n\nThe Bank's decision to spend nearly £2,000 on equipment for the event has also raised eyebrows. When questioned about the expense, a Bank spokesperson said that the equipment was needed to ensure the safety and well-being of the staff and their families. However, some have suggested that the equipment could have been rented or borrowed instead of purchased outright.\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns over the Bank's transparency and accountability. While the Bank does release annual reports on its expenses, critics argue that the level of detail is not sufficient to provide a clear picture of how the Bank is spending its money.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the Bank has pledged to review its expenses and ensure that they are in line with its core values. However, the latest figures suggest that the Bank still has some way to go in achieving this goal. As the debate over the Bank's expenses continues, it remains to be seen whether the Bank will be able to strike a better balance between its social events and its core responsibilities.",

For the last several years, they have been teased and baffled by mysterious bursts of radio waves from the distant universe: pops of low-frequency radiation, emitting more energy than the sun does in a day, that occur randomly and disappear immediately. Nobody knows when these \"fast radio bursts,\" or F.R.B.s, will occur, or where exactly in the cosmos they are occurring. More than 60 of these surprise broadcasts have been recorded so far. About the only thing astronomers agree on is that these signals probably are not extraterrestrials saying hello. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the origins of these enigmatic signals, scientists are working tirelessly to unravel the mystery. One theory is that F.R.B.s are the result of cataclysmic events, such as supernovae explosions or the merger of two neutron stars. Another possibility is that they are caused by magnetars, incredibly powerful magnetic fields that can release enormous amounts of energy. To further investigate, astronomers are using powerful telescopes to scan the skies for any signs of these bursts, and even launching specialized spacecraft to detect and study them up close.

But about three-fourths of Facebook users were unaware that the company lists their personal traits and interests for advertisers on its site, according to a study published by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday. Half of the users who looked at the Facebook page with that data -- known as their \"Ad Preferences\" -- said they were not comfortable with the company's compiling that information. Pew conducted a nationally representative survey of 963 American adults with Facebook accounts between Sept. 4 and Oct. 1 of last year. While consumers have learned more in recent years about how they are targeted for online ads, the study suggests that many still do not know how much of their behavior is tracked, where it is compiled or even that Facebook has a page that lists all of that information. The study also found that only 42% of Facebook users knew that the company uses data from third-party sources, such as other websites and apps, to create a profile of their interests and behaviors. Additionally, 55% of users were unaware that Facebook uses their data to show them targeted ads. The Pew Research Center's findings suggest that despite increased scrutiny of Facebook's data collection practices, many users remain unaware of the extent to which their personal information is being used to shape their online experience. The study's authors noted that this lack of understanding could have significant implications for consumer trust and the overall transparency of the digital advertising ecosystem. As Facebook continues to face pressure to improve its data practices, the findings of this study highlight the need for greater education and awareness among users about how their personal data is being used online.",

The five members of the commission met in mid-December to discuss the investigation, according to the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is not public. The meeting is a sign that the investigation is far along, the people said, because the commissioners rarely meet in the early stages of an inquiry. The FTC's investigation centers on Facebook's handling of user data, particularly in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where the political consulting firm harvested the personal information of millions of Facebook users without their consent. The agency is also scrutinizing Facebook's policies and practices regarding data sharing and its dealings with third-party app developers. If the FTC decides to fine Facebook, it would be the largest penalty ever imposed on a technology company. The fine could be as high as $2 billion, according to some estimates.

It's estimated to be about 12 miles (20 kilometers) in diameter, making it one of the smallest moons in the solar system. The discovery was made possible by a team of astronomers who used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe Neptune's faint light and detect the subtle gravitational pull of the new moon. The team's findings are expected to shed new light on the formation and evolution of the Neptune system, as well as the potential for similar discoveries in other planetary systems. As scientists continue to explore the vast expanse of our solar system, it's clear that there is still much to be learned and many more secrets waiting to be uncovered.",

The F.T.C. said it was a record fine for a child privacy violation. The settlement marks the largest penalty ever imposed by the FTC for a child privacy violation, and comes as the social media landscape continues to evolve and raise concerns about the protection of young users' personal data. The FTC alleged that Musical.ly, which was acquired by ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, in 2018, violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting the personal information of children under the age of 13 without proper parental consent. The company also failed to provide clear and prominent disclosures about its data collection practices, the FTC said. As part of the settlement, TikTok must delete the personal information it collected from children and implement new measures to ensure compliance with COPPA. The company has also agreed to undergo regular audits to ensure its data collection practices are in line with the law. The FTC's action is seen as a significant step in holding social media companies accountable for their handling of children's personal data.",

This week, Chronicle, a security start-up owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, plans to bring some of what it learned from that incident to other companies through a widely anticipated new product called Backstory. The idea, company executives said, is simple: Backstory will make Alphabet's vast storage, indexing and search abilities available to other companies, allowing them to search through giant volumes of data, going years back, to trace the back story of a malicious attack. Chronicle is hardly the only company doing this. but its access to Google's vast resources and expertise sets it apart from competitors. Backstory is expected to be launched at the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, and company executives are already touting it as a game-changer for cybersecurity. The product is designed to help companies quickly identify the root cause of a breach, rather than just reacting to its symptoms. By tapping into Alphabet's vast archives, Backstory can analyze large datasets and identify patterns that might have gone unnoticed by traditional security tools. The potential implications are significant, as it could help companies prevent future attacks and reduce the time it takes to respond to a breach.",

The resulting meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse. The next shower you might be able to see is known as the Lyrids. Active between April 16 and 28, the show peaks around Sunday night into Monday morning, or April 21-22. The moon could interfere with viewing the peak this year. There are records from ancient Chinese astronomers spotting these bursts of light more than 2,700 years ago. The Lyrids are considered one of the oldest recorded meteor showers, with observations dating back to 687 BCE. The shower is caused by the Earth passing through the trail of debris left behind by the comet Thatcher, which was discovered in 1861. The comet's path is believed to be the source of the Lyrid meteoroids, which burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, producing the bright streaks of light that are visible to the naked eye.\n\nWhile the moon's interference may make it more challenging to view the peak of the Lyrids, astronomers recommend trying to catch the shower during the early morning hours when the moon is below the horizon. The best viewing locations will be in areas with minimal light pollution, allowing stargazers to see the meteors in all their glory.\n\nDespite the challenges, many meteor enthusiasts are still excited to witness the Lyrids, which are expected to produce up to 20 meteors per hour at their peak. With a little luck and some clear skies, stargazers may be able to catch a glimpse of these ancient celestial fireworks.",

The inquiry concerns a practice unearthed in April in which Facebook harvested the email contact lists of a portion of new users who signed up for the network after 2016, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry had not been officially announced. Those lists were then used to improve Facebook's ad-targeting algorithms and other friend connections across the network. The investigation was confirmed late Thursday afternoon by the attorney general's office. The investigation is expected to focus on whether Facebook's actions violated any state or federal privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. The attorney general's office is also seeking to determine how widespread the practice was and whether it was limited to a specific period of time. The move comes amid growing scrutiny of Facebook's data collection and sharing practices, following a series of high-profile data breaches and privacy scandals. The company has faced numerous lawsuits and regulatory inquiries in recent years, including a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in July. Facebook has not commented on the investigation, but it has previously stated that it collects email contacts to help users connect with friends and family on the platform. The company has also claimed that it does not use the email contacts for advertising purposes, but the investigation is expected to examine whether this is accurate.",

And a barnacle called Sacculina carcini castrates crabs, roots itself into their bodies and brains and transforms them into walking zombie slaves that care for the parasite's brood as if it were their own. Parasites are bad -- except when they're not. except when they're not. In fact, some parasites have evolved to play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. Take the tapeworm, for example. While it may seem counterintuitive, tapeworms can actually help to regulate the population of their hosts, such as deer and sheep. By reducing the number of animals that are too abundant, tapeworms can prevent overgrazing and maintain the health of the ecosystem.\n\nSimilarly, some parasites can even benefit their hosts by providing them with essential nutrients. For example, the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis is found in the reproductive tracts of many mammals, including humans. While it can cause disease in extreme cases, it can also help to break down complex carbohydrates and provide its host with essential nutrients.\n\nBut perhaps the most fascinating example of a beneficial parasite is the fungi Ophiocordyceps unilateralis. This fungus infects ants and takes control of their bodies, causing them to climb to high locations before producing spores that can infect other ants. While it may seem like a sinister plot, the fungus is actually helping to disperse its own spores and ensure the survival of its species.\n\nSo, the next time you hear about a parasite, don't immediately assume that it's a villain. Instead, consider the complex relationships that exist between parasites and their hosts, and the important roles that some parasites play in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.",

The cats are among nearly 500,000 land species whose survival is now in question because of threats to their natural habitats, according to a report on Monday by the United Nations. The Sundarbans, 4,000 square miles of marshy land in Bangladesh and India, hosts the world's largest mangrove forest and a rich ecosystem supporting several hundred animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. But 70 percent of the land is just a few feet above sea level, and grave changes are in store for the region, Australian and Bangladeshi researchers reported in the journal Science of The Total Environment. Changes wrought by a warming planet will be \"enough to decimate\" the few hundred or so Bengal tigers remaining there. \"By 2070, there will be no suitable tiger habitats remaining in the Bangladesh Sundarbans,\" concluded the study by 10 researchers. The paper, which relies on climate scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for its simulation models, adds to existing studies that offered similarly grim predictions for wildlife in the Sundarbans. In 2010, a study led by the World Wide Fund for Nature projected that a sea level rise of 11 inches could reduce the number of tigers in the Sundarbans by 96 percent within a few decades. Climate change has already harmed almost half of the world's endangered mammals, far more than previously thought, a recent study found. Sharif A. Mukul, lead author of the new report on the Sundarbans, and his colleagues looked for risks to the tiger beyond sea level rise, which accounted for 5.4 percent to 11.3 percent of the projected habitat loss in 2050 and 2070. The researchers also identified other significant threats to the tiger's habitat, including increased flooding, salinization of soil and water, and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. They found that these factors could lead to a decline in the quality and quantity of the Sundarbans' mangrove forests, which are a crucial component of the tiger's ecosystem.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that the impact of climate change on the Sundarbans' tiger population was not just due to sea level rise,\" said Sharif A. Mukul, lead author of the study. \"The combination of all these factors will make it extremely challenging for the tigers to survive in the long term.\"\n\nThe researchers used computer simulations to model the impact of different climate change scenarios on the Sundarbans' tiger population. They found that even with moderate levels of sea level rise, the tigers' habitat would be significantly reduced, leading to a decline in their population.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for conservation efforts in the Sundarbans. The researchers are calling for urgent action to protect the region's mangrove forests and to develop strategies to help the tigers adapt to the changing climate.\n\n\"This is not just a problem for the tigers, but for the entire ecosystem of the Sundarbans,\" said Mukul. \"We need to act quickly to protect this unique and valuable ecosystem before it's too late.\"",

Still others resulted from expansion of the moon's chilly surface every two weeks when the sun rose. The data collected by the seismometers provided valuable insights into the moon's internal structure and composition. Scientists were surprised to find that the moon had a liquid iron core, similar to Earth's, which was responsible for some of the seismic activity. The core was estimated to be about 300 kilometers in diameter, which was smaller than expected.\n\nThe Apollo seismometers also detected a peculiar phenomenon known as \"moonquakes.\" These were small earthquakes that occurred when the moon's surface expanded and contracted due to temperature changes. The quakes were so small that they were barely detectable, but they provided a unique window into the moon's internal dynamics.\n\nThe discovery of moonquakes and the moon's liquid core have since been confirmed by subsequent spacecraft and missions.

He grew up in a neighborhood filled with newsstands, delis, and ethnic restaurants, which instilled in him a love for the city's vibrant cultural scene. He began his journalism career as a copy boy at the New York Daily News, working his way up to become a reporter, editor, and eventually, a senior editor at the Times.\n\nThroughout his career, Levitas was known for his tenacious reporting style, which earned him numerous awards and accolades. His 1980 series on labor racketeering, which won the George Polk Award, was a groundbreaking exposé that shed light on the corrupt practices of organized crime in the labor movement.\n\nLevitas was also a mentor to many young journalists, including some who went on to become prominent figures in the industry. His colleagues and friends remembered him as a kind and generous person who always put the story first. \"Mitch was a giant in the journalism world,\" said longtime friend and colleague, Arthur Gelb. \"He had a way of making you feel like you were the most important person in the room, and his passion for the truth was inspiring.\" Levitas is survived by his wife, Susan, his son Daniel, and two grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York City in the coming weeks.",

CBS, the nation's most-watched television network, went dark for more than 6.5 million AT&T customers early Saturday after the two media giants couldn't agree on a new contract. The network, with hits like \"Big Brother,\" and Stephen Colbert's \"Late Show,\" was cut off from AT&T's satellite service DirecTV as well as the landline-delivered U-verse and DirecTV Now, the live streaming product.

In a statement, CBS said it \"made every effort to avoid this blackout,\" but that it wouldn't agree to terms that \"undervalue our hit programming.\" AT&T called CBS a \"repeat blackout offender\" and said the network had been demanding \"unprecedented increases\" in the fees it charges. As a result of the contract dispute, millions of AT&T customers were left without access to CBS programming, including popular shows like \"NCIS,\" \"60 Minutes,\" and \"The Big Bang Theory.\" The blackout also affected AT&T's streaming services, DirecTV Now and AT&T TV Now, which offer live TV and on-demand content to subscribers.\n\nIn a statement, Stephen Colbert addressed the situation, saying, \"I'm shocked, shocked, that the fine folks at AT&T couldn't come to an agreement with CBS. I mean, who wouldn't want to watch me make fun of the news and politicians every night?\" He added, \"But seriously, I hope this situation is resolved soon, so my fans can continue to watch me without interruption.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the dispute has also affected the production of new episodes of \"The Late Show.\" The show's writers and producers were forced to halt production, and it's unclear when the show will return to the air. The blackout has also raised concerns about the future of CBS programming on AT&T's platforms.\n\nAs the standoff continues, both sides remain at an impasse. AT&T has said it will not back down from its demands, while CBS has refused to agree to terms that it believes undervalue its programming.

For the past decade, the two groups have been caught up in a raging battle, at least in the pages of scientific journals. At stake is a noble place in evolutionary history: closest living analogue of the first-ever animal. A new analysis, published Wednesday in Royal Society Open Science, hands victory back to the sponges , although more bouts are sure to come. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] All animals, from sponges and comb jellies to humans and other mammals, have particular characteristics in common: We're multicellular, our cells have nuclei and we consume food rather than make it. We also all have a common ancestor, which inhabited the oceans at least 550 million years ago and shared those traits. and was likely a simple, multicellular organism. The debate over which group is most similar to this ancient ancestor has been ongoing, with proponents of each side presenting their own evidence and arguments. The new study, led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed the genetic makeup of both poriferans and ctenophores, as well as their developmental biology and anatomy. The team found that sponges possess a unique combination of characteristics that make them the more likely candidate to be the closest living relative of the first animal. The study's authors suggest that sponges' ability to filter food particles from the water, their simple body structure, and their lack of nervous system or sensory organs all point to a more primitive, ancestral state. While the controversy is far from over, the new analysis provides further support for the sponge hypothesis and sheds new light on the early evolution of animal life on Earth.",

Comets are sort of like dirty snowballs: As they travel through the solar system, they leave behind a dusty trail of rocks and ice that lingers in space long after they leave. When Earth passes through these cascades of comet waste, the bits of debris -- which can be as small as grains of sand -- pierce the sky at such speeds that they burst, creating a celestial fireworks display. A general rule of thumb with meteor showers: You are never watching the Earth cross into remnants from a comet's most recent orbit. Instead, the burning bits come from the previous passes. As Earth travels through the solar system, it encounters the remnants of countless comets that have passed through the area before. These comets, often referred to as \"parent comets,\" have shed their icy and rocky material as they approached the sun, leaving behind a trail of debris that can take thousands of years to dissipate.\n\nThe timing of meteor showers is closely tied to the orbit of the parent comet. Since the debris from a comet's previous passes is scattered throughout space, the timing of a meteor shower is determined by when Earth intersects with the path of that debris. This means that the meteor shower is actually a remnant of the comet's past, not its most recent visit.\n\nFor example, the Perseid meteor shower, one of the most popular and active meteor showers of the year, is caused by the Earth passing through the debris trail left behind by the Swift-Tuttle comet. This comet was first discovered in 1862 and is thought to have originated from the outer reaches of the solar system. The Swift-Tuttle comet is a long-period comet, meaning it takes more than 200 years to complete one orbit around the sun. As a result, the Perseid meteor shower is a remnant of the comet's last pass through the inner solar system, which occurred in the 12th century.\n\nBy studying the timing and frequency of meteor showers, scientists can gain valuable insights into the orbits and composition of comets, as well as the history of our solar system. The next time you witness a meteor shower, remember that you're not just seeing a random burst of celestial activity – you're witnessing the remnants of a comet's ancient journey through the cosmos.",

Paul Oetken, wrote in his decision. \"But the states have failed to persuade the court that this novelty alone establishes that the SALT cap exceeds Congress's broad tax power.\" The other states joining in the suit were New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland. The cap on state and local tax deductions, which had been unlimited, was one of a handful of provisions intended to offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts included in the 2017 law. The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's nonpartisan scorekeeper on tax matters, estimated the cap and related provisions would raise close to $700 billion in revenue over 10 years. The ruling is a significant setback for the four states, which had argued that the SALT cap was an unconstitutional overreach by Congress. The states had contended that the cap unfairly targeted their residents, who rely heavily on state and local governments for essential services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.\n\nThe court's decision is also seen as a blow to the growing movement among states to challenge federal tax policies. The SALT cap has been a contentious issue in recent years, with many lawmakers and advocacy groups arguing that it disproportionately affects middle- and upper-income households in high-tax states.\n\nThe ruling comes as Congress is considering a new tax bill that would increase the SALT cap, but only for a limited period. The proposal, which is part of a broader package of tax reforms, has been met with resistance from some lawmakers who argue that it would benefit only the wealthy.\n\nThe court's decision is likely to be appealed, and the case could ultimately end up before the Supreme Court. In the meantime, the four states are expected to continue to push for a repeal of the SALT cap, which they argue is an important tool for ensuring that state and local governments have the revenue they need to provide essential services to their residents.",

About 500 million years ago, a couple species of now extinct trilobites became the first animals to roll themselves into a ball for protection. The trilobite's living doppelganger is the chiton. This marine mollusk's plated shell drapes over a soft body and mucousy foot, giving it the appearance of a flattened piece of shrimp nigiri. But why did this peculiar behavior evolve in the first place? Sigwart and her team discovered that the ancient trilobites were living in a world where predators were abundant and diverse. By rolling into a ball, they were able to protect their soft bodies from being eaten. This unique defense mechanism allowed them to survive in environments where other animals would have been vulnerable to predation.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and we can see that the chiton has retained this remarkable ability. When threatened, it will quickly curl up into a ball, using its plated shell to shield its vulnerable underside. This behavior is not only an effective defense mechanism but also an important part of the chiton's daily life. By rolling into a ball, it can also help to conserve energy and protect itself from the harsh conditions of its marine environment.

But getting a handle on how frequently these destructive storms have pummeled the planet is tough because records stretch back only about a century and a half. Now, researchers have assembled a 1,500-year history of hurricanes in the Bahamas, based on sand and shell fragments pulled up from submarine caverns known as blue holes. Their results, published in October in Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology, show that hurricane activity has varied over time. The researchers, led by Dr. Christopher Lloyd of the University of North Carolina, used a technique called sediment coring to extract layers of sediment from the blue holes, which are natural underwater sinkholes that form in limestone rock. By analyzing the sediment, they were able to reconstruct a record of hurricane activity over the past 1,500 years. The team found that hurricane frequency and intensity have fluctuated over time, with periods of increased activity followed by periods of relative calm. The researchers believe that changes in ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulation patterns may be responsible for these fluctuations. The study's findings could have important implications for understanding the impacts of climate change on hurricane activity and for developing more effective strategies for predicting and preparing for these powerful storms.",

On Monday, Facebook said it would begin testing a \"data portability\" tool in Ireland that would allow users there to move photos and videos from Facebook to Google Photos. Critics immediately said the initiative did not go far enough. Facebook's control over personal data has been central to current antitrust investigations in Washington and Europe. Authorities say Facebook holds so much information about its users, data it uses to fuel its digital advertising business and improve its services, that it creates a competitive imbalance that rivals can't match. The company's rivals, including Google and Twitter, have long complained that Facebook's dominance in the social media space gives it an unfair advantage in terms of access to user data. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018, giving users more control over their personal data and allowing them to request that their data be transferred to another service. Facebook's new tool is seen as a response to these regulations and the growing pressure from regulators to increase competition. However, some experts argue that the tool may not go far enough, as it only allows users to transfer photos and videos, but not other types of data, such as friend lists or messaging history. Additionally, the tool is only being tested in Ireland, leaving users in other countries without the same level of data portability.",

Unlike humans, which lose just one set of teeth over a lifetime, dinosaurs often lost tens or even hundreds of sets. Plant-eating dinosaurs had to chew lots of tough material to sustain their large bodies, causing them to frequently replace their teeth. This constant tooth replacement would have been a significant challenge for dinosaurs, requiring them to regularly regurgitate and re-digest their food to extract as many nutrients as possible. The sheer volume of teeth being lost and replaced would have also led to a significant amount of tooth waste, which would have had to be disposed of in some way. It's likely that dinosaurs developed specialized behaviors or social structures to deal with this issue, such as living in large groups to increase their chances of finding food and avoiding tooth loss.\n\nIn addition, the constant need for tooth replacement would have placed a significant energetic burden on dinosaurs, requiring them to spend a lot of time and resources finding new food sources and avoiding predators while their teeth were being replaced. This could have had significant impacts on their overall ecology and evolution, and may have even influenced the development of their social structures and behaviors. Despite these challenges, however, dinosaurs were able to thrive in their environments, and their unique adaptations to tooth loss and replacement are a fascinating example of the incredible diversity and resilience of life on Earth.",

And yet coral reefs are oases that support about a quarter of all known species on Earth. How could that be? The answer to this paradox, in part, is sugar. We tend to think the ocean tastes salty. But shaken, stirred and dissolved in seawater are microscopic morsels of sugars and carbs, known as dissolved organic matter. These sugars and carbs, once ingested by phytoplankton, the ocean's primary producers, become the foundation of the coral reef's food chain. The phytoplankton, in turn, are consumed by zooplankton, which are then devoured by fish and other larger organisms. This complex web of consumption supports the incredible biodiversity of coral reefs, where a single square meter of reef can host over 1,000 species. The discovery of dissolved organic matter has far-reaching implications for our understanding of ocean ecosystems and the delicate balance that sustains them. As researchers continue to unravel the secrets of coral reefs, they are also gaining a deeper appreciation for the importance of preserving these underwater wonders for future generations.",

Zomato, which is backed by investors such as Sequoia Capital and Temasek, has been aggressively expanding its services and has already acquired several local food-delivery startups.

And its \"Seymour\" is the worm larva of Xenoplatyura beaveri, a species of fungus gnat that develops inside the plant's mouth. When grown, it looks like a mosquito with big biceps.

The camera crew, led by renowned botanist Dr. Maria Rodriguez, carefully navigates the dense underbrush to get a closer look at the unusual symbiosis. Dr. Rodriguez explains that the Nepenthes ampullaria has evolved to attract the fungus gnats, which are drawn to the sweet, sticky liquid produced by the plant. Once inside the plant's mouth, the gnats lay their eggs, which hatch into the worm-like larvae that feed on the plant's digestive enzymes. \"It's a remarkable example of co-evolution,\" Dr. Rodriguez says, \"where both species have adapted to each other's needs to survive in this unique environment.\" As the team continues to document the phenomenon, they notice that the plants seem to be responding to their presence, subtly shifting their positions to get a better view of the camera. It's as if they're trying to put on a show, feeding off the attention and admiration of the humans who have stumbled upon this peculiar corner of the natural world.",

A common conundrum for many Mac users! The icons you're referring to are likely the \"Sticky Notes\" or \"Notes\" app icons that appear in the top menu bar. These icons allow you to quickly access your notes and reminders, but they can indeed become cluttered and distracting if you don't use them frequently.\n\nFortunately, you can easily remove these icons from your top menu bar to declutter your screen. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click on the Apple menu and select \"System Preferences.\"\n2. Click on \"Dock & Menu Bar.\"\n3. Uncheck the box next to \"Notes\" or \"Sticky Notes\" in the \"Menu Bar\" section.\n4. Click \"OK\" to save your changes.\n\nOnce you've completed these steps, the Notes or Sticky Notes icon should disappear from your top menu bar.

In macOS Sierra and later, you can use the Picture in Picture mode to pop out a floating video-player window on the screen while you have other pages and programs open on the desktop. The feature works in the Safari browser for videos on sites that use the HTML 5 standard for playback, like Vimeo and YouTube. Videos from Apple's iTunes Store support the Picture in Picture view, as do some other apps. To use the Picture in Picture mode, open a compatible video and, in the tool bar of playback controls, click the icon on the right that looks like two rectangles. The video should pop out in a small, separate window that you can resize by dragging its corner with the cursor. You can then move the floating window to any corner of the screen, or even outside the boundaries of the main screen by dragging it to the desktop. To toggle the Picture in Picture mode on and off, simply click on the two rectangles icon again. When you do, the video will return to its original size and position on the main screen. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + > to enter Picture in Picture mode, and Command + Shift + < to exit it. Additionally, you can also use the Picture in Picture mode with FaceTime video calls, allowing you to continue using your Mac while still keeping the video call active in a separate window.

Even when you have the software enabled, browser utilities like AdBlock or AdBlock Plus may still display less-intrusive advertisements from companies that have been approved by the independent Acceptable Ads Committee. The Acceptable Ads initiative was started by AdBlock Plus, which makes money by allowing the ads through its filters. The initiative attempts to balance the needs of web surfers who do not want to be pelted with aggressive online ads and the needs of websites that rely on advertising revenue to support their content. (Google recently began to filter intrusive ads in its Chrome browser in a similar manner.) This approach has raised concerns among some users and experts, who argue that it undermines the purpose of ad-blocking software. They point out that the Acceptable Ads initiative allows companies to continue displaying ads, even if they are not fully transparent about their practices or do not provide a clear way for users to opt-out.\n\nFurthermore, some critics argue that the initiative is self-serving, as it benefits AdBlock Plus and other companies that rely on advertising revenue. They claim that it creates a loophole that allows companies to circumvent the intentions of users who install ad-blocking software to avoid unwanted ads.\n\nIn response to these concerns, AdBlock Plus has emphasized that the Acceptable Ads initiative is designed to promote more responsible and user-friendly advertising practices. The company claims that the initiative helps to reduce the prevalence of aggressive and intrusive ads, which can be annoying and distracting for users.\n\nDespite these efforts, the debate surrounding the Acceptable Ads initiative continues to rage on. Some users are wary of the initiative, while others see it as a necessary compromise between the needs of web surfers and the needs of websites that rely on advertising revenue.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the Acceptable Ads initiative will ultimately benefit or harm users. One thing is certain, however: the proliferation of ad-blocking software and the rise of more sophisticated ad-blocking technologies will likely continue to shape the online advertising landscape in the years to come.",

The 33-foot-long whale was swept onto a rocky beach in Cape Palos, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, on Feb. 27. It was not yet fully grown but weighed just 13,000 pounds, an unusually scrawny size for a whale that can reach 120,000 pounds as an adult. When scientists performed a necropsy, the reason became clear: The whale had 64 pounds of trash -- plastic bags, ropes, netting and even a plastic drum -- clogging its intestines and stomach. It could not process the garbage or pass it through its digestive system, causing severe inflammation as it withered away, officials in the region of Murcia said. Sperm whales, which are among the largest of their species, can dive thousands of feet deep into the darkest regions of the ocean to hunt for squid. The tragic discovery has sparked outrage and concern among marine conservationists and local authorities, who are calling for increased efforts to reduce plastic pollution in the Mediterranean. \"This is a stark reminder of the devastating impact that human activities are having on our oceans and the creatures that call them home,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a marine biologist with the University of Murcia. \"The fact that a whale, which is at the top of the food chain, was unable to digest such a massive amount of plastic is a wake-up call for us all.\"\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the importance of proper waste disposal and recycling practices. \"It's heartbreaking to think that this young whale's life was cut short due to human carelessness,\" said Juan Sanchez, the mayor of Cape Palos. \"We must do better to reduce our plastic footprint and protect our oceans for future generations.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the whale's death, local authorities have launched a campaign to clean up the coastline and raise awareness about the dangers of plastic pollution. Residents and tourists alike are being encouraged to participate in beach cleanups and to reduce their use of single-use plastics.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers are working to analyze the contents of the whale's stomach and intestines to better understand the impact of plastic pollution on marine life. \"This incident is a valuable opportunity for us to learn more about the effects of plastic on whales and other marine animals,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"We hope that our findings will inform conservation efforts and help to protect these incredible creatures.\"",

This innovative approach involves collecting and analyzing DNA samples from soil, air, and water samples to identify the presence and quantity of spores. The researchers are using advanced genomics and machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model that can forecast the likelihood of moth infestation and the potential damage it may cause. By identifying the genetic markers associated with specific moth species, the team can detect the presence of these pests even before they become a problem. This early warning system has the potential to revolutionize the way farmers and foresters manage moth populations, allowing them to take proactive measures to prevent damage and reduce the use of pesticides.

When using Google Maps in a desktop web browser, right-click the city or starting point you want to use and select \"Measure distance\" from the menu. Next, click the second point on the map to see the direct distance in miles and kilometers displayed in a small box at the bottom of the window. This feature is often referred to as \"as the crow flies\" or \"straight line distance\" and can be useful for planning aerial routes, estimating distances between two points, or even calculating the size of an area. By using this tool, users can get a more accurate estimate of the distance between two points, rather than relying solely on driving directions. Additionally, this feature can be used to measure the distance between multiple points on a map, making it a valuable tool for anyone who needs to calculate distances quickly and easily.",

This is the Leidenfrost effect, which you've probably experienced while cooking. Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, a German doctor and theologian, described the phenomenon in 1756 in a book about the properties of water. But French scientists have now figured out something new about those skittering drops. When they are small enough -- about a millimeter in diameter -- the roiling of heat in the liquid will cause the droplet to tilt and rotate. That, in turn, propels the droplet to roll. Scientists -- and home cooks -- never noticed this before, because no one had tried pinning a water droplet on a precisely flat surface. Plus, since water is clear, you usually can't see which way the liquid is churning. It was already known that the droplets, levitating on top of a layer of vapor, move easily, but the presumption was that they were sliding down a slope or pushed by air currents. The new research shows that they can move all by themselves. \"It's embarrassingly simple,\" David Quere, a scientist at the Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris, said of the discovery. \"The drop is running away,\" he said. \"It has a little motor inside, which is surprising. From this view, it's amazingly different from usual drops, which, of course, stay where you place them.\" Dr. Quere and his colleagues described the research this week in the journal Nature Physics. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The discovery has significant implications for fields such as materials science, where researchers are constantly seeking ways to manipulate and control the behavior of tiny droplets. The Leidenfrost effect, which was previously thought to be a simple phenomenon, has been found to be much more complex and fascinating than initially thought.\n\n\"This finding opens up new possibilities for manipulating the behavior of droplets, which could have significant applications in fields such as microfluidics, biomedical engineering, and even in the development of new materials,\" said Dr. Quere.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of high-speed cameras and advanced computer simulations to study the behavior of the tiny droplets. They found that the rotation of the droplet creates a sort of \"propeller effect,\" which allows it to move across the surface of the pan.\n\n\"This is a remarkable example of how a seemingly simple phenomenon can have such complex and fascinating underlying mechanisms,\" said Dr. Quere.\n\nThe discovery is also expected to have implications for our understanding of the behavior of liquids in general, and could lead to new insights into the properties of materials at the microscopic level.\n\n\"This research is a great example of how scientists can use simple, everyday phenomena to gain a deeper understanding of the world around us,\" said Dr. Quere. \"It's a reminder that even the most mundane things can have surprising and complex underlying mechanisms.\"",

Only three decades ago we didn't know if there were planets beyond our own solar system. In 1995, astronomers discovered that a star in the constellation Pegasus was wobbling back and forth, tugged by the gravity of an unseen planet, an exoplanet, a hot and hellish world unfit for life as we know it. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive spectroscopes. As an orbiting planet tugs on its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again. The Kepler space telescope was launched in 2009. It found thousands of exoplanets by staring at a small patch of the Milky Way. Kepler didn't look for wobbles. It looked for small dips in starlight, when a planet crosses in front of its star. Kepler found systems of planets, groups of worlds swirling around their star, lonely planets encased in ice, other worlds scorched by fire, newborn planets shrouded in dust, waterworlds, and planets swept by global storms, planets dancing in orbit with two stars, or even three, and even planets from other galaxies that were swallowed up by the Milky Way. In recent years, astronomers have taken the first direct images of exoplanets, blurry pixels of alien landscapes. We've discovered a free-floating planet not bound to any star. And we've seen signs of planets being born, infant worlds scoring dark rings in the dust around their stars. As we continue to explore the vast expanse of our galaxy, we are constantly reminded of the awe-inspiring diversity of planetary systems that exist beyond our own. The discovery of exoplanets has opened up new avenues of research, allowing scientists to study the formation and evolution of planets in ways that were previously impossible.\n\nOne of the most exciting areas of research is the study of exoplanet atmospheres. By analyzing the light that passes through the atmospheres of distant planets, scientists can gain valuable insights into the composition and properties of these alien worlds. This can help us to better understand the conditions that are necessary for life to arise and thrive on other planets.\n\nIn recent years, a number of exoplanet atmospheres have been studied in detail, revealing a wide range of compositions and properties. Some exoplanets have atmospheres that are similar to those of Earth, while others are much more hostile, with temperatures that are far too hot or cold to support life.\n\nThe study of exoplanet atmospheres is a rapidly evolving field, with new discoveries being made all the time. In the coming years, we can expect to learn even more about the properties of exoplanet atmospheres, and how they compare to those of our own planet.\n\nIn addition to the study of exoplanet atmospheres, scientists are also working to develop new technologies that will allow us to study exoplanets in even greater detail. One such technology is the direct imaging of exoplanets, which involves using powerful telescopes and cameras to capture images of distant planets.\n\nThis technique has already been used to capture a number of high-quality images of exoplanets, including the famous \"pale blue dot\" image of the exoplanet HD 189733b. This image shows the planet in stunning detail, with its atmosphere glowing brightly in the light of its parent star.\n\nThe study of exoplanets is a truly global effort, with scientists from all over the world working together to explore the wonders of the universe. As we continue to learn more about the exoplanets that surround us, we are reminded of the incredible diversity and complexity of the universe, and the many wonders that await us as we continue to explore.",

By analyzing the remains of brown rats that lived in and around Toronto between 1790 and 1890, researchers have determined that city rats enjoyed a higher-quality and more stable diet than rural rats did. Just as in Aesop's tale, the city rats benefited from the largess of human waste, whereas country rats scraped by. The study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, found that the urban rats had a diet rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, likely due to their proximity to human settlements and the abundance of food waste. In contrast, the rural rats had a diet that was more variable and consisted mainly of plant-based foods, such as seeds, fruits, and grains.

It's all the more remarkable because InSight -- which landed last week -- does not have a microphone. Rather, an instrument designed for measuring the shaking of marsquakes picked up vibrations in the air -- sound waves, in other words. Winds blowing between 10 and 15 miles per hour over InSight's solar panels caused the spacecraft to vibrate, and short-period seismometers recorded the vibrations. \"You can think of it rather in the same way as the human ear, how we in fact listen,\" said Thomas Pike, a scientist at Imperial College London who is leading research with the instruments. \"The solar panels are like the ear drum. The spacecraft structure is like the inner ear.\" The seismometers act as the cochlea, the parts of your ears that convert the vibrations into nerve signals. They are able to record vibrations up to a frequency of 50 Hertz -- audible to human ears as a low rumble. NASA also produced a version of the recording that lifted the sounds by two octaves. \"To me, the sounds are really unworldly,\" Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator of the mission, said during a news conference on Friday. \"They do sound like the wind or maybe the ocean kind of roaring in the background. The recording is a significant milestone in the history of space exploration, providing a new way to experience the Martian environment. According to NASA, the sounds are a result of the wind blowing across the solar panels, causing the spacecraft to vibrate. The vibrations were then picked up by the short-period seismometers, which converted them into sound waves.\n\nThe recording has sparked widespread interest and excitement among scientists and the general public alike. \"It's a truly remarkable achievement,\" said Dr. Maria Zuber, a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"This recording gives us a new way to understand the Martian environment and its dynamics.\"\n\nThe InSight lander, which stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is designed to study the internal structure of Mars. By recording the sounds of the wind, NASA scientists hope to gain a better understanding of the Martian atmosphere and its interaction with the planet's surface.\n\nThe recording is also a testament to the innovative design of the InSight lander. \"We didn't have a microphone on the spacecraft, but we still managed to capture the sounds of the wind,\" said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator of the mission. \"It just goes to show how creative and flexible we need to be when exploring space.\"\n\nAs NASA continues to analyze the recording, scientists are already making new discoveries. \"We're seeing patterns in the wind that we wouldn't have been able to detect otherwise,\" said Thomas Pike, a scientist at Imperial College London. \"It's giving us a new perspective on the Martian environment and its dynamics.\"\n\nThe recording is also providing a unique opportunity for the public to experience the Martian environment in a new way. NASA has released the recording online, allowing people around the world to listen to the sounds of the wind on Mars. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\" said Dr. Zuber. \"We're thrilled to be able to share it with the world.\"",

There's an easy explanation for experiences like Ms. Miyawaki's, said William Hartmann, a physics professor at Michigan State University who specializes in acoustics and psychoacoustics. There are two pathways through which we perceive our own voice when we speak, he explained. One is the route through which we perceive most other sounds. Waves travel from the air through the chain of our hearing systems, traversing the outer, middle and inner ear. But because our vocal cords vibrate when we speak, a second path is introduced internally, in which those vibrations are conducted through our bones and excite our inner ears directly. \"The effect of this is to emphasize lower frequencies, and that makes the voice sound deeper and richer to yourself,\" Professor Hartmann said. Except when it doesn't: Professor Hartmann's explanation makes sense for many people, including Ms. Miyawaki. However, for some individuals, the internal pathway can become disrupted, leading to a distorted perception of their own voice. This can be due to various factors, such as earwax buildup, sinus infections, or even certain medical conditions. In Ms. Miyawaki's case, her unique vocal cord anatomy may have contributed to the anomaly. \"It's not uncommon for people to have a mismatch between what they hear and what others hear,\" Professor Hartmann noted. \"But in Ms. Miyawaki's case, the difference is particularly striking.\" Despite the unusual experience, Ms. Miyawaki has learned to adapt, using her unusual perception to her advantage in her music career. \"It's actually helped me develop a more nuanced sense of pitch and tone,\" she said.",

A meteor is the streak of light of a space rock plunging into the atmosphere, and a meteorite is the remnant of space rock that survives the fiery descent and comes to rest on the ground. Thus, one might think that meteorites that fall on Earth ought to be just like the asteroids that pass through Earth's neighborhood. \"That's what everybody would have expected,\" said Philipp R. Heck, the curator in charge for the meteorite and physical geology collections at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Planetary scientists were surprised almost a decade ago when they discovered that the most plentiful types of meteorites they had collected and studied on Earth were actually not common in space. In a paper published Monday by the journal Nature Astronomy, an international team of researchers led by Dr. Heck says it has uncovered part of the explanation. The researchers found that many meteorites on Earth are actually fragments of a single, large asteroid that broke apart about 4.5 billion years ago, during the early days of the solar system. This asteroid, known as the L-chondrite parent body, was once a massive object that orbited the sun, but it was torn apart by gravitational forces and collisions with other asteroids.\n\nThe fragments of this asteroid that survived the breakup and made it to Earth are the most common type of meteorite, making up about 40% of all meteorites collected. This is surprising because asteroids of this type are relatively rare in the inner solar system, and scientists would have expected to see more of them in space.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of computer simulations and laboratory analysis to study the meteorites and reconstruct the history of the L-chondrite parent body. They found that the asteroid was likely about 100 kilometers in diameter before it broke apart, and that the fragments were sent hurtling towards the inner solar system by the gravitational forces of the planets.\n\nThe team also discovered that the meteorites from this asteroid are not just any ordinary meteorites. They have a unique composition that is rich in silicate minerals and metals, which suggests that they formed in a specific environment that was different from other asteroids.\n\n\"This is a really exciting discovery,\" said Dr. Heck. \"It tells us that the meteorites that fall on Earth are not just random samples of the solar system, but are actually pieces of a specific asteroid that has a unique history and composition.\"\n\nThe research has important implications for our understanding of the early solar system and the formation of planets. It also highlights the importance of studying meteorites, which can provide valuable insights into the history and evolution of the solar system.",

Their population decimated by poaching and habitat destruction, only about 4,000 of the endangered cats remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Conflicts with mountain farmers and pastoral herders also contribute to their dwindling numbers. \"The problem is when a snow leopard gets inside a livestock pen,\" said Madhu Chetri, a biologist at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences. When that happens, he said, the carnivore usually eats a handful of goats and sheep, but in some cases it can massacre more than 100 animals in a single corral. If the cat gets stuck in a pen, the inevitable tends to occur. \"There is a high chance the herders will kill it in retaliation,\" he said. \"To mitigate this conflict, conservationists are using a novel approach: scat, or feces, analysis. By studying the snow leopard's droppings, researchers can track the cat's movements, identify its diet, and even determine its age and sex. This information can be used to inform conservation efforts and reduce conflicts with herders. 'We can use this data to educate herders about the snow leopard's behavior and provide them with compensation for losses,' said Chetri. Additionally, the analysis can help identify areas where snow leopards are most active, allowing conservationists to target their efforts more effectively.

The six dolphins, ranging in age from 20 to 30 years, were placed in a large tank with a trainer and oversized hula hoops to encourage swimming and play.\n\nOver the course of six months, the researchers collected extensive data on the dolphins' energy expenditure, swimming patterns, and behavior.

This was unexpected, as one might assume that swimming at high speeds would be more efficient due to the increased propulsion.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, explained that this finding suggests that marine mammals may be more susceptible to fatigue than previously thought. \"It's possible that during mass strandings, these animals are swimming at high speeds for extended periods, which could lead to exhaustion and confusion, causing them to beach themselves,\" she said.\n\nThe research team is now planning to conduct further studies to explore the implications of this finding and to investigate the potential links between energy expenditure and mass strandings. The discovery has significant conservation implications, as it may inform strategies for mitigating the risk of mass strandings and improving the welfare of marine mammals in the wild.",

The editorial was an extraordinarily harsh rebuke of President Trump, calling him \"his own worst political enemy\" and asserting that he was damaging his presidency \"with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods.\" The editorial went on to accuse Trump of using his presidency as a \"personal vendetta\" against his perceived enemies, and warned that his behavior was not only damaging to his own reputation, but also to the country as a whole. The piece specifically cited Trump's attacks on the media, the judiciary, and the intelligence community, saying that they were eroding trust in institutions and undermining the rule of law.\n\nThe editorial also took aim at Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that his \"lack of candor\" and \"misleading statements\" had contributed to the spread of misinformation and confusion among the public. The authors of the editorial argued that Trump's actions were not only morally reprehensible, but also short-sighted, as they were likely to alienate potential allies and undermine his ability to pass legislation.\n\nOverall, the editorial was a scathing rebuke of Trump's behavior, and a rare example of the WSJ's editorial page breaking with its traditional conservative stance to condemn the President's actions. The piece was widely shared on social media, and sparked a heated debate about the role of the media in holding elected officials accountable.",

The team of researchers, from Northwestern University, the University of Illinois at Chicago and Draper Laboratory, published the results of their study in Nature Communications on Tuesday. The revolutionary model, known as the \"Female Reproductive System Simulator\" (FRSS), is designed to mimic the intricate workings of the human female reproductive system, allowing scientists to study and understand the complex interactions between hormones, tissues, and organs in unprecedented detail. The FRSS is a sophisticated network of microfluidic channels, sensors, and actuators that recreates the entire reproductive process, from ovulation to implantation.\n\nThe model is capable of simulating a menstrual cycle, complete with the release of hormones and the shedding of the uterine lining. It can also mimic the process of fertilization, with the simulated sperm and egg interacting in a realistic manner. Furthermore, the FRSS can simulate the growth and development of a fetus, including the production of hormones and the development of vital organs.\n\nThe researchers believe that the FRSS has the potential to revolutionize the field of reproductive medicine, allowing scientists to study and treat reproductive disorders with unprecedented precision. The model could also be used to develop new birth control methods and to improve the success rates of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. The team is now working to refine the model and explore its potential applications in the field of reproductive medicine.",

The first of several projects, a mini-series called \"Secure and Hold: The Last Days of Roger Ailes,\" is already in the works at Showtime. Mr. Blum, 48, said by phone on Monday that the company, Blumhouse Television, would focus on \"dark genre\" programming -- not just horror, but \"things that scare us.\" In addition to the mini-series about Mr. Ailes, who was ousted from Fox News last year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, Blumhouse Television will also lead the financing and production of a drama set in the same dystopian world as the \"Purge\" movie franchise. The three \"Purge\" films, about an America where crime, including murder, is legal for 12 hours once a year, were produced by Mr. Blum for a total cost of $21 million, and they collected $320 million worldwide. The company's mission is to push the boundaries of storytelling and explore the darker corners of human nature, according to Blum. \"We're not just interested in making scary movies, we're interested in making shows that explore the things that scare us about ourselves and the world around us,\" he said. Blumhouse Television is already in development on several other projects, including a drama series inspired by the life of a notorious cult leader and a horror anthology series that will feature stories from different countries around the world. The company is also in talks to develop a TV adaptation of the popular horror franchise \"Insidious.\" With ITV Studios on board, Blumhouse Television is well-positioned to make a significant impact on the television landscape. \"We're excited to partner with Jason and his team to bring their unique brand of dark genre storytelling to the small screen,\" said ITV Studios' CEO, Steve November. Blumhouse Television is expected to announce more projects and partnerships in the coming months.",

For them, avoiding gluten -- wheat, rye, barley and cross-contaminated oats -- isn't a fad diet but a medical necessity. Even a bread crumb in the communal cream cheese could wreak gastrointestinal havoc, causing symptoms that lead to missed classes and more. A 2016 survey by the New England Celiac Organization concluded that \"college students with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity face overwhelming complications in their social and academic lives.\" As a result, Kent State and Cornell University have made a conscious effort to create a safe and inclusive dining environment for students with gluten-related disorders. The new gluten-free dining halls feature separate cooking and serving areas, dedicated gluten-free food options, and trained staff to ensure proper handling and preparation of gluten-free meals.

Who better to ask for advice than Chris Heinonen, the AV staff writer at The Wirecutter, a website owned by The New York Times that evaluates and recommends products? Sound bars can cost more than a TV. Why would I need one? \"I think the main reason people buy soundbars is that they want a more immersive audio experience while watching TV or movies,\" Chris Heinonen explains. \"A soundbar can greatly improve the sound quality compared to the built-in speakers of a TV, which are often tinny and lacking in bass. A good soundbar can make it feel like you're right there in the action.\" Heinonen notes that many people upgrade to a soundbar because they're tired of the \"boombox\" sound that comes from a TV's built-in speakers. \"It's not just about having more volume, it's about having a more accurate and nuanced sound,\" he says. For example, a soundbar can accurately reproduce the sound of footsteps or the hum of a car engine, making the viewing experience feel more realistic.

In the settlement, Airbnb essentially agreed to San Francisco's demand to be more transparent about its hosts and to help enforce existing registration laws. It followed the company's dropping of a lawsuit in December over a New York law that fines people who illegally list their homes on short-term rental platforms. Taken together, the actions mean Airbnb has cleared up outstanding litigation in two of its biggest markets in the United States. The latest settlement removes a regulatory cloud over the company as it readies itself for a public offering, even though Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco and has a valuation of about $30 billion, still faces legal disputes in a handful of markets. The settlement is a significant step forward for Airbnb, which has faced growing scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers over its role in the short-term rental market. By agreeing to be more transparent about its hosts and to help enforce existing registration laws, Airbnb is demonstrating its commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen. The company has also taken steps to address concerns about its impact on the housing market and the quality of life in neighborhoods where short-term rentals are prevalent. With this settlement, Airbnb can now focus on its plans for an initial public offering (IPO), which could potentially value the company at over $50 billion.

Waymo, the self-driving car unit that operates under Google's parent company, has signed a deal with the ride-hailing start-up Lyft, according to two people familiar with the agreement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The deal calls for the companies to work together to bring autonomous vehicle technology into the mainstream through pilot projects and product development efforts, these people said. The deal was confirmed by Lyft and Waymo. \"Waymo holds today's best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world's best transportation,\" a Lyft spokeswoman said in a statement. The partnership highlights the fluid nature of relationships in the self-driving-car sector. From technology companies to automakers to firms that manufacture components, dozens of players are angling for a slice of an autonomous vehicle market that many believe will ultimately be a multibillion-dollar industry. To gain an edge and outmuscle rivals, many of these players are forming alliances -- and sometimes shifting them. The deal between Waymo and Lyft has competitive implications for Uber, the world's biggest ride-hailing company, which has recently had to confront a spate of workplace and legal problems. Lyft is a distant No. 2 to Uber among ride-hailing services in the United States, and the two companies are bitter rivals. Waymo is also competing fiercely with Uber in the creation of technology for autonomous cars and is embroiled in a lawsuit over what it says is Uber's use of stolen Waymo trade secrets to develop such technology. Details about the deal between Waymo and Lyft were scant. The partnership between Waymo and Lyft is expected to be a significant boost to Lyft's efforts to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology, which is currently still in its infancy. The two companies will work together to develop and test autonomous vehicles, with the goal of eventually deploying them on Lyft's ride-hailing platform. The deal also gives Waymo access to Lyft's vast network of drivers and riders, which could help it to gather more data and fine-tune its autonomous technology.\n\nThe partnership is also seen as a strategic move by Waymo to gain an edge over its main rival, Uber, which has been plagued by a series of scandals and legal troubles in recent months. By partnering with Lyft, Waymo is able to expand its reach and influence in the ride-hailing market, while also gaining access to Lyft's vast resources and expertise.\n\nLyft's CEO, Logan Green, hailed the partnership as a major step forward for the company, saying that it would enable Lyft to \"accelerate the development of autonomous technology and bring it to market faster.\" The company's investors are also likely to be pleased, as the partnership could help Lyft to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing autonomous vehicle market.\n\nThe deal is also expected to have significant implications for the wider autonomous vehicle industry, as it highlights the growing importance of partnerships and collaborations in the development of this technology. As the industry continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more partnerships and alliances formed between companies, as they seek to gain an edge and stay ahead of the competition.",

They analyzed data from over 1,000 elk, including age, sex, and location information, to identify patterns and trends. The researchers found that senior cows tended to inhabit areas with more dense vegetation and fewer hunting pressure hotspots, which may have contributed to their increased survival rate.\n\nInterestingly, the study also revealed that older cows were more likely to form close bonds with other elk, particularly females, which may have provided them with an added layer of protection. These social bonds may have helped senior cows stay alert and aware of potential threats, allowing them to make quick escapes when necessary.\n\nThe researchers believe that a combination of both nature and nurture plays a role in the remarkable survival skills of senior cows. While some elk may be naturally more cautious, others may learn to adapt and become more cautious over time. The study's findings have important implications for elk conservation and management, highlighting the importance of preserving habitat diversity and promoting social bonds among elk populations.",

The article -- linking Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager and Trump confidant, to a Russian investment fund supposedly being investigated by the Senate -- was removed from CNN.com late last week after the network decided it could not fully stand by its reporting. The resignations are a black eye at a sensitive moment for the news organization, which has emerged as a regular target of Mr. Trump and his supporters.

In a federal court filing, Waymo said it was dropping three of its four claims over Uber violating its patents related to light detection and ranging sensor technology, or lidar. Lidar is a vital component in driverless car technology, helping the vehicle detect its surroundings to navigate roads. The case, an acrimonious battle between Waymo and Uber, spotlights the arms race surrounding autonomous vehicle talent and technology. It is especially significant for Google -- now Waymo -- which spent years working on driverless car technology before other tech companies took an interest. The move is seen as a strategic one by Waymo, which may be aiming to focus on more crucial claims and avoid a lengthy and costly legal battle. Waymo still has one patent claim remaining, which alleges that Uber stole trade secrets and confidential information from Waymo. The case is expected to go to trial in December, and the remaining claim could still result in significant damages for Uber if Waymo is successful. The dispute has already led to a major shake-up at Uber, with several top executives leaving the company in the wake of allegations of intellectual property theft. The battle for autonomous vehicle dominance continues to escalate, with both companies investing heavily in the technology and vying for market share. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for the future of driverless cars and the companies that are racing to develop them.",

But animals like wolves do not respect lines drawn on a map. And a recent study suggests that efforts to limit populations of these predators outside those borders is having negative effects on wolves living within the preserve. The study, published in June in Wildlife Monographs, suggests that when the Alaskan authorities were limiting wolf populations outside the Yukon-Charley preserve, survival rates of wolves within the preserve were lower than usual. The findings highlight the notion that managing wildlife within human-imposed boundaries requires communication and cooperation with the authorities beyond a preserve's boundaries, and could have implications for wildlife management programs elsewhere. The study's lead author, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a wildlife biologist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said that the findings were a stark reminder of the importance of considering the broader ecosystem when managing wildlife populations. \"Wolves are highly mobile animals, and they don't recognize boundaries on a map,\" she explained. \"By trying to control their populations outside the preserve, we were inadvertently affecting the wolves living within the preserve.\"\n\nThe study's researchers analyzed data on wolf populations within the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve from 2000 to 2015, as well as data on hunting and trapping efforts outside the preserve during the same period. They found that when wolf populations were being actively managed outside the preserve, the survival rates of wolves within the preserve were significantly lower than usual.\n\nThe researchers believe that the negative impact on wolf populations within the preserve was likely due to the fact that wolves were being forced to venture further into the preserve in search of food and mates, increasing their exposure to human activities such as hunting and trapping. \"This study highlights the need for a more holistic approach to wildlife management,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"We need to consider the broader ecosystem and work with authorities beyond a preserve's boundaries to ensure that our management efforts are not having unintended consequences.\" The findings of the study have important implications for wildlife management programs elsewhere, and could inform more effective and sustainable approaches to conserving wildlife populations.",

        "Text": "Giant pandas are a national icon of China, the only place in the world where they live outside of captivity. Years of Chinese government efforts to reverse their dwindling numbers, such as the restoration of bamboo forests and establishment of national habitat reserves, helped bring the animals back from the brink. They were declared no longer endangered in September 2016 after population estimates reached 1,864 -- not counting cubs. However, despite this conservation success, giant pandas are still facing numerous challenges. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization and infrastructure development remain significant threats to their survival. The construction of a new high-speed rail line, for example, has resulted in the destruction of a significant portion of their natural habitat.\n\nTo address these issues, the Chinese government has launched a new initiative to create a network of protected areas and corridors to connect isolated panda populations. The plan also includes measures to promote sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, as well as community-based conservation efforts.\n\nIn addition, researchers are working to better understand the giant pandas' behavior and ecology, which is essential for developing effective conservation strategies. A recent study published in the journal Science revealed that giant pandas are more adaptable to their environment than previously thought, and that they are capable of surviving in areas with lower bamboo densities than previously believed.\n\nThe Chinese government has also established a number of giant panda breeding centers, which are playing a crucial role in the conservation of the species. The centers are not only helping to increase the population of giant pandas, but are also providing a safety net against the risks of habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\nDespite these efforts, the giant pandas' future remains uncertain. Habitat loss and fragmentation continue to pose a significant threat to their survival, and the species remains vulnerable to climate change, disease, and human disturbance. As a result, conservation efforts must continue to be prioritized to ensure the long-term survival of this iconic species.",

Out went the twisty Pixie Path aisles, the ornate displays, the green walls and the color-changing fiberglass trees. In came a movie-theater-size screen, a simplified floor plan, white walls and more items for fashion-conscious adults. What was Disney up to? As it turns out, the Disney Store here was a prototype, and the company has been monitoring sales and consumer feedback as it prepares to revamp its 340-store chain. \"We really want to learn as we go, especially through the holidays, so we're going to roll the new look out slowly,\" Paul Gainer, executive vice president for Disney Stores Worldwide, said in an interview on Monday. The new prototype store is designed to appeal to a broader range of customers, including adults who may not be as interested in Disney's traditional focus on children's products. The store's layout is now more straightforward, with a central screen displaying Disney's latest movies and TV shows. The floor space is divided into themed areas, such as a \"Star Wars\" section and a \"Marvel\" area, featuring exclusive merchandise. The goal is to create a more immersive experience for shoppers, with interactive displays and opportunities to engage with Disney's characters and stories. The company plans to roll out the new design to select stores over the next year, with the goal of revitalizing its retail business and appealing to a new generation of consumers.",

But the tale that best sums up Hugh Hefner's den of iniquity, for a lot of women, comes from Sharan Magnuson, who arrived in Hollywood in 1980 to pursue an acting career and soon discovered a side of the Playboy Mansion that most people never discussed -- certainly not if they wanted to be invited back. \"At first, it was magical,\" Ms. Magnuson, who went on to become a senior executive at Warner Bros., said by phone on Thursday, a day after the death of Playboy's founder, Hugh Hefner. \"Glamorous. Fun. The mansion in perfect condition. But as the months went by, Ms. Magnuson began to notice a darker side to the Playboy Mansion's allure. She described being invited to join Hefner and his friends for late-night poker games, only to be subjected to lewd and inappropriate behavior. \"It was like they thought they were above the law,\" she said, her voice laced with disgust. \"I remember one night, I was playing poker and one of the guys started making inappropriate comments about my body. I was so uncomfortable, I just got up and left.\" Ms. Magnuson said she eventually stopped attending parties at the mansion, but not before she had seen and experienced things that would haunt her for years to come. \"It was a culture of entitlement and objectification,\" she said. \"And Hefner was the one who enabled it.\"",

Nicole Quenqua, formerly the company's top spokeswoman, said she was no longer giving company statements to reporters. Over the past week, the Weinstein Company has been at the center of a widening crisis involving Mr. Weinstein's brother, Harvey. Investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed sexual harassment and rape allegations against Harvey Weinstein going back decades. Harvey Weinstein, who has denied \"any allegations of non-consensual sex,\" was fired on Sunday by Weinstein Company board members, which include his brother. Several other members of the all-male board have quit, including Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor; Marc Lasry, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, an investment firm; Tim Sarnoff, president of production services and deputy chief executive of Technicolor; and Richard Koenigsberg, an accountant, who resigned on Thursday.

To face the lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees that day, the internet companies are sending in their legal muscle: the general counsels. That way, the companies avoid putting their chief executives -- Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai of Google -- in the spotlight to deal with questions and the full-blown public relations crisis over whether they are contributing to an undermining of democracy. Here's who will appear in the congressional hearings:\n\nMr. Stretch, 48, became Facebook's general counsel in 2013 and has led the social network's internal review on foreign interference on its platform. He joined Facebook in 2010 and led negotiations of its settlement in 2011 with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that Facebook violated its privacy promises to users. As the general counsels of these tech giants, Mr. Stretch, Colin Stretch of Facebook, Richard Salgado of Google, and Sean Edgett of Twitter, will be tasked with defending their companies' actions and policies in the face of intense scrutiny. They will likely be grilled by lawmakers about the companies' handling of Russian disinformation campaigns, their efforts to combat election interference, and their responses to allegations of bias and censorship.\n\nMr. Stretch, in particular, has been a key figure in Facebook's efforts to address the company's role in the 2016 election. As the company's general counsel, he has led internal reviews and worked with lawmakers and regulators to develop new policies and procedures to prevent similar interference in the future.\n\nMr. Salgado, Google's general counsel, has a long history of working on internet policy issues, including his time as a lawyer at the Department of Justice. He has been a key player in Google's efforts to address concerns about its search algorithm and its handling of user data.\n\nMr. Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, has been a vocal advocate for the company's policies on free speech and online harassment. He has also been involved in Twitter's efforts to address concerns about election interference and disinformation on the platform.\n\nThe congressional hearings will be an important moment for these companies, as they face growing public concern about the role of social media in shaping public opinion and the integrity of democratic institutions.

The bids, received by last Thursday's deadline, came from so many places across the continent that it's perhaps simpler to note the ones that didn't fall over themselves to woo Amazon. The company did not provide a list, but a color-coded map posted on its website revealed the applicants came from all but seven American states -- North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Arkansas and Hawaii. In Canada, Yukon Territory and the provinces of Saskatchewan and New Brunswick were among those that said no thanks. In Mexico, on the other hand, Amazon's map shows just three applications, from the states of Chihuahua, Hidalgo and Queretaro. In all, Amazon said the proposals came from 54 states, provinces, districts and territories (including Puerto Rico). The company has said it will announce its decision sometime next year. When Amazon announced on Sept. 7 that it was taking bids for a second headquarters, which it calls HQ2, it kicked off weeks of chest-thumping, publicity stunts and prostration by cities and regions eager to lure the 50,000 high-paying jobs Amazon has promised for the new campus. The mayor of Washington, D.C., made a goofy viral video in which she sought to butter up Amazon by having a faux conversation with Alexa, Amazon's intelligent assistant. As the bids poured in, cities and regions got creative with their proposals. Some built elaborate websites, while others sent delegations to Seattle to make their cases in person. The city of Boston, for example, rolled out the red carpet, literally, with a customized Amazon-themed carpet that led to the city's mayor's office. Meanwhile, Toronto's mayor sent a team of tech-savvy entrepreneurs to pitch the city's startup scene to Amazon's top brass.\n\nThe bids were not just about throwing money at Amazon, either. Many cities highlighted their unique cultural attractions, from Nashville's country music scene to Vancouver's outdoor recreation opportunities. Some even offered to rename streets or landmarks after Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos. \"We're willing to go all out to make this happen,\" said one bid from a small town in Ohio. \"We'll even change the name of our town square to 'Bezos Plaza' if that's what it takes.\"\n\nNow, as Amazon's team sifts through the proposals, it's clear that the company has a tough decision ahead. With so many compelling bids to choose from, it's hard to imagine how Amazon will narrow down its options. But one thing is certain: the winner of HQ2 will be a city or region that's willing to go above and beyond to attract the world's most powerful tech company. The question is, who will it be?",

One simple method is to check your cable company's social media pages or website for outage reports. Many cable providers have dedicated pages or apps that allow customers to report outages and view a map of affected areas. If you're seeing reports of outages in your area, it's likely not just a problem with your equipment.\n\nAnother way to determine if the issue is widespread is to call your cable provider's customer service number.

Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting. The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent. The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitter's reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russia's efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide. The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program. Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Google's parent company, this year. The company's admission has sparked a wave of criticism from lawmakers, regulators, and investors, who are demanding greater transparency and accountability from Twitter. \"This is just the latest example of Twitter's reckless disregard for the truth,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of the company. \"It's time for Twitter to come clean about its role in spreading disinformation and take concrete steps to ensure the integrity of its platform.\"\n\nThe controversy comes as Twitter faces growing pressure to address concerns about the spread of misinformation and manipulation on its platform. The company has been criticized for its slow response to reports of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and for its inconsistent efforts to combat harassment and abuse.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, apologized for the mistake and promised to take steps to improve the company's transparency and accountability. \"We understand that our mistake has caused frustration and concern among our users and investors,\" Dorsey said. \"We are committed to doing better and will work tirelessly to regain the trust of our community.\"\n\nThe company's stock price fell sharply in response to the news, with shares declining by more than 5% in after-hours trading. The decline was seen as a sign of investor skepticism about Twitter's ability to recover from the controversy and restore user trust. As the company struggles to rebuild its reputation, it faces a tough road ahead, with many wondering if it can ever regain the trust of its users and investors.",

Is this a problem with the phone? A. The iPhone 6s and later models include a feature called Raise to Wake that senses when you pick up the device and then automatically flips on the display screen -- so you do not have to fumble around with the Home or power buttons when you want to check something. If you have just purchased a new iPhone or had not upgraded your hardware in a few years, the sudden activity can seem a little unsettling. However, if you're finding that the screen is turning on even when you're not intentionally picking up the phone, it could be a sign of a more significant issue. In some cases, the Raise to Wake feature can become overactive due to software glitches or misconfigured settings. If you're experiencing this issue, try disabling the feature in Settings > Display & Brightness > Raise to Wake to see if it resolves the problem. If the issue persists, it may be worth visiting an Apple Store or contacting Apple support for further assistance.",

On Wednesday, Facebook's top executives -- including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg -- spread a different message: one of profit. Around the time that Facebook wrapped up its attendance at hearings on Capitol Hill over Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election on Wednesday, the company reported another set of blockbuster financial results. Facebook said its revenue rose 47 percent to $10.3 billion in the third quarter from a year ago, with profit surging 79 percent to $4.7 billion, handily beating Wall Street expectations. The results showcased Facebook's moneymaking strength in online advertising, which is precisely what the Silicon Valley company has been under fire for in Washington this week. As Facebook's executives celebrated their company's financial success, they were met with skepticism and criticism from lawmakers and experts who believe the social media giant's business model is fundamentally at odds with its responsibilities as a public platform. \"Facebook's profits are directly tied to its ability to manipulate and exploit its users,\" said Senator John Kennedy, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"It's hard to reconcile the company's claims of being a responsible steward of the internet with its relentless pursuit of profit at any cost.\" Meanwhile, Facebook's critics argue that the company's emphasis on maximizing revenue has created an environment in which Russian agents and other malicious actors can thrive, spreading disinformation and sowing discord among the public. As the company continues to face scrutiny in Washington, many are left wondering whether Facebook's pursuit of profit will ultimately undermine its ability to fulfill its role as a trusted and responsible member of the digital ecosystem.",

Mr. Avrich said on Wednesday that he will rework his documentary, \"Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project,\" in the wake of sexual harassment and rape allegations against Mr. Weinstein. \"I have a moral obligation to edit and expand my film, and not just by tacking on an 11-minute ending about him as a sexual predator,\" Mr. Avrich said by phone from Ottawa. But Mr. Avrich must first contend with IFC Films, a division of the publicly traded AMC Networks. IFC bought distribution rights to \"Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project\" for an undisclosed amount in September 2010. Mr. Avrich has long asserted that IFC subsequently asked for sanitizing trims and decided against a theatrical release as a favor to Mr. Weinstein, who was then one of Hollywood's most powerful men. According to Avrich, IFC Films has been slow to respond to his requests to reacquire the distribution rights, citing a contractual obligation to release the film as originally intended. Avrich has threatened to take legal action if the company does not comply with his demands. Meanwhile, the documentary's original subject, Harvey Weinstein, has been fired from his company and expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences amid the growing scandal. The renewed focus on Avrich's documentary has sparked renewed interest in the film, with many calling for its release to shed light on the allegations against Weinstein. Avrich hopes to have the reworked documentary ready for release within the next year.",

As it turns out, the \"little globe key\" you're referring to is actually the international keyboard symbol, which is typically represented by a globe icon. However, the iPhone's default keyboard layout is set to use the \"Emoji\" key, which is a set of emoticon-like characters used to convey emotions and feelings in digital communication.\n\nThe reason for this difference is due to the way the iPhone's keyboard is designed to accommodate different languages and regions. Apple has developed a range of keyboard layouts that cater to various languages, including languages that don't use the Latin alphabet. For example, the iPhone can display keyboard layouts for languages like Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic, which require different character sets and typing conventions.\n\nThe \"Emoji\" key is a convenient way for users to access these characters, which are commonly used in digital communication. By default, the iPhone sets the Emoji key as the primary keyboard layout, but users can easily switch to other languages or keyboard layouts by going to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard.

Your sense of smell may fluctuate in sensitivity over the course of 24 hours, in tune with our circadian clocks, with your nose best able to do its job during the hours before you go to sleep, according to a study published last month. The work, reported in the journal Chemical Senses, is part of a larger push to explore whether adolescents' senses of taste and smell influence obesity. The researchers found that the sense of smell was most acute during the early evening hours, around 8-10 pm, and decreased significantly by the early morning hours, around 4-6 am. This natural fluctuation in olfactory sensitivity could have significant implications for our daily lives, from the way we perceive food flavors to our ability to detect potential health threats.\n\nFor instance, the study suggests that the decreased sense of smell in the morning could make it more difficult for people to detect the sweetness or freshness of their morning coffee, which may lead to overconsumption of sugary drinks. Conversely, the heightened sense of smell in the evening could make it easier to detect the aroma of a savory dinner, potentially leading to healthier eating habits.\n\nThe findings also have implications for the development of obesity in adolescents, as research has shown that a decreased sense of smell can contribute to overeating and poor food choices. By understanding the natural fluctuations in our sense of smell, researchers hope to develop targeted interventions to help adolescents make healthier choices and develop healthier eating habits.",

As technology encroaches on more industries and profits pile up at the biggest technology companies, critics increasingly say these firms are too powerful and need regulatory oversight. Mr. Hawley said the state's preliminary investigation had found that Google may be collecting more information from users than the company was telling consumers and that users didn't have a \"meaningful option\" to opt out of Google's data collection.

The investigation, led by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, is focused on Google's collection and use of personal data, including search history, location information, and browsing behavior. Hawley emphasized that the goal is not to ban Google or any other tech company, but to ensure that they are transparent and compliant with state and federal laws. The investigation is ongoing, and Hawley has vowed to hold Google accountable for any violations. Google has until October 15th to respond to the subpoena, which is expected to be a significant step in the investigation.

And you shouldn't take them home or decorate them. These animals live on coral reefs in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, building tiny, tubular homes with their own secretions of calcium carbonate. They emerge from these tubes to filter feed, procreate and breathe with a part of their body called the branchial crown. You can't miss these bright, spiral-shaped cones while snorkeling, if you know what to look for. They look like miniature decorated firs. \"They're really pretty, very colorful, very festive and Christmassy,\" said Orly Perry, a marine biologist studying them as a doctoral student at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. Most of the \"trees,\" which come in pairs, protrude no more than an inch from the tube's opening. As you descend into the crystal-clear waters, the sunlight dancing above casts an ethereal glow on the underwater forest. The \"trees\" come into view, their vibrant colors and intricate patterns mesmerizing even the most seasoned marine enthusiasts. Perry, an expert in the field, points out the subtle differences between the various species, each with its unique characteristics and adaptations.\n\nOne of the most striking features of these underwater Christmas trees is their remarkable ability to thrive in environments with limited resources. By filtering tiny particles and plankton from the water, they sustain themselves in areas where other marine life might struggle to survive.\n\nDespite their fascinating biology, these \"trees\" are often overlooked by divers and snorkelers, who tend to focus on more iconic coral formations or brightly colored fish. However, Perry and her team are working to raise awareness about the importance of preserving these delicate ecosystems.\n\n\"Their tubes are incredibly fragile, and they're often damaged or destroyed by careless snorkeling or diving,\" Perry explains. \"We need to educate people about the need to respect these underwater landscapes and the creatures that call them home.\"\n\nAs the team concludes their research, they can't help but feel a sense of wonder at the magic of these underwater Christmas trees.

Chewbaaka, rescued as a 10-day-old orphan in Namibia, became an \"ambassador\" animal for the Cheetah Conservation Fund there. (His name is a variation of the \"Star Wars\" character's.) by providing scientists with a unique window into the evolutionary history of cheetahs. The breakthrough came when researchers at the Cheetah Conservation Fund, led by Dr. Laurie Marker, began studying Chewbaaka's DNA. By analyzing the genetic makeup of the young cheetah, they were able to pinpoint specific genetic markers that indicated a connection to ancient cheetah populations.\n\n\"This was a game-changer,\" said Dr. Marker. \"By studying Chewbaaka's DNA, we were able to identify specific genetic traits that were present in ancient cheetahs, but had since been lost in modern populations. This gave us a roadmap to understanding how cheetahs evolved to become the fastest land animals on Earth.\"\n\nThe team used this information to create a \"molecular clock\" that allowed them to date the evolutionary events that shaped the cheetah's remarkable speed. They discovered that cheetahs underwent a series of rapid evolutionary changes around 2 million years ago, likely in response to the emergence of their main prey species, antelopes and gazelles.\n\n\"Chewbaaka's DNA provided the missing link in our understanding of cheetah evolution,\" said Dr. Marker. \"We were able to pinpoint the exact genetic changes that occurred during this period, which allowed us to reconstruct the cheetah's evolutionary history in unprecedented detail.\"\n\nThe findings have significant implications for conservation efforts, as they highlight the importance of preserving genetic diversity within cheetah populations. The research team is now working to develop a conservation breeding program that incorporates the genetic traits identified in Chewbaaka's DNA, with the goal of strengthening the cheetah's position as a thriving species.",

But the concept often falls flat, as readers see through awkward advertorials and as the logos of eager corporate sponsors overtake pop-culture events like South by Southwest. And then there is Red Bull Music Academy. On its face, it should be objectionable, or at least annoying: An energy drink known for its association with extreme sports sponsors a highbrow music festival. But for 18 years, the event has built a rare kind of credibility, attracting otherwise elusive musical figures like Brian Eno, La Monte Young, Ryuichi Sakamoto and D'Angelo, and drawing critical acclaim. The Red Bull Music Academy's success can be attributed to its unique approach to branded content. Rather than simply slapping its logo on a festival or event, the company has taken a more nuanced approach, partnering with respected artists and curators to create a program that is both entertaining and informative. The event's focus on music, art, and culture has allowed it to attract a diverse range of attendees, from music industry professionals to curious fans. And while the presence of Red Bull's logo is certainly noticeable, it's not overwhelming or obtrusive.\n\nOne of the key factors in the Academy's success is its commitment to showcasing emerging talent alongside established artists. The event's programming is carefully curated to highlight innovative and avant-garde music, often featuring performances that are more experimental than commercial. This approach has allowed the Academy to build a reputation as a platform for artistic expression, rather than simply a vehicle for promoting Red Bull's products.\n\nThe event's popularity has also been fueled by its location in New York City, which provides a unique backdrop for the festivities. The Academy's programming is scattered throughout the city, with events taking place in everything from traditional music venues to art galleries and even abandoned warehouses. This has allowed attendees to experience the city in a new and exciting way, while also providing a sense of community and connection with like-minded individuals. As the Academy continues to grow and evolve, it remains one of the most successful examples of branded content in the music industry.",

But before the offering kindness part, she swerved into racial commentary that led to her being fired on Wednesday. She was responding to a shooting at a backyard party on March 9 in Wilkinsburg, Pa., that killed five people, including a pregnant woman. No one has been arrested, and the police have not yet publicly identified suspects. Yet in her Facebook post on March 21, which was later edited and eventually deleted, Ms. Bell played detective in a way that some felt relied on damaging stereotypes. \"You needn't be a criminal profiler to draw a mental sketch of the killers who broke so many hearts two weeks ago Wednesday,\" she wrote. The post continued: \"They are young black men, likely in their teens or in their early 20s. They have multiple siblings from multiple fathers and their mothers work multiple jobs. These boys have been in the system before. They've grown up there. They know the police. They've been arrested.\" In the same post, Ms. Bell mentioned a hard-working, young, black man whom she saw working at a restaurant, praising him in a way that came across as patronizing. \"I wonder how long it had been since someone told him he was special,\" she wrote. Ms. Bell did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. Station officials moved last week to take her off the air and distance themselves from the remarks. Charles W. Wolfertz, the station's president and general manager, addressed viewers in a broadcast explaining the move during which he said Ms. Bell showed \"an egregious lack of judgment.\" The controversy surrounding Ms. Bell's post sparked widespread outrage and criticism, with many calling her remarks racist and irresponsible. The NAACP Pittsburgh branch issued a statement condemning her comments, saying they \"perpetuated harmful stereotypes and contributed to the very racism and discrimination that we are trying to combat.\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists also weighed in, saying that Ms. Bell's post was \"an egregious example of the kind of racial stereotyping and profiling that we work to combat every day.\"\n\nAs the backlash mounted, WTAE-TV officials announced that they would be conducting an internal investigation into the matter. The station's parent company, Hearst Television, also issued a statement, saying that they were \"deeply troubled\" by Ms. Bell's comments and that they were taking the matter \"very seriously.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of media in perpetuating racial stereotypes and biases.

Many have called for greater representation of people of color in positions of power and authority, and for a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to reporting on issues related to race and racism.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what the long-term consequences will be for Ms. Bell and WTAE-TV. However, one thing is clear: the incident has sparked a much-needed conversation about the importance of media responsibility and the need for greater sensitivity and awareness when reporting on issues related to race and racism.",

The new documents were released by an activist research organization, the Center for International Environmental Law, which published the project on its website. The documents, according to the environmental law center's director, Carroll Muffett, suggest that the industry had the underlying knowledge of climate change even 60 years ago. \"From 1957 onward, there is no doubt that Humble Oil, which is now Exxon, was clearly on notice\" about rising CO in the atmosphere and the prospect that it was likely to cause global warming, he said. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies and other organizations had created a group, the Smoke and Fumes Committee, to monitor and conduct pollution research, and to \"use science and public skepticism to prevent environmental regulations they deemed hasty, costly and unnecessary,\" according to the center's description of the documents on its website. Those actions, Mr. Muffett suggested, would be echoed in later efforts to undermine climate science. The center's work was first reported by Inside Climate News, which has published stories, as did The Los Angeles Times, suggesting that Exxon Mobil understood the risks of climate change from its own research, which it used to plan activities such as drilling in the Arctic, while it funded groups into the mid-2000s that denied serious climate risks. The revelations have sparked widespread outrage and calls for accountability from environmental groups and lawmakers. \"These documents are a smoking gun, proving that the oil industry knew about the dangers of climate change decades ago and chose to cover it up,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a leading advocate for climate action. \"It's time for Exxon and the rest of the industry to come clean about their role in perpetuating climate denial and to start taking real action to reduce their emissions.\"\n\nThe Center for International Environmental Law's director, Carroll Muffett, also accused Exxon of engaging in a decades-long campaign to deceive the public and undermine climate science. \"Exxon's actions are a classic case of regulatory capture, where a corporation uses its influence and resources to manipulate the political process and block meaningful action on climate change,\" he said.\n\nExxon Mobil has denied any wrongdoing, saying that it has always been committed to addressing climate change and has invested heavily in low-carbon technologies.

And the change is spilling out into the nation's colleges and the country over all. Census data predicts that by 2050 the United States will be majority-minority as well. As I see these changes, I continue to ask, Are our college and university faculties ready to teach a diverse student body? Unfortunately, I don't think so. The numbers are stark: according to a recent report by the American Council on Education, in 2019, only 25% of full-time faculty members at American colleges and universities identified as people of color, despite making up nearly 40% of the student body. This lack of diversity is particularly pronounced at the highest levels of academia, where only 6% of full professors are people of color.\n\nThe consequences of this lack of diversity are far-reaching. Students of color are more likely to report feeling isolated and marginalized on campus, and to struggle to find role models and mentors who look like them. This can lead to lower graduation rates, lower GPAs, and a sense of disconnection from the academic community.\n\nFurthermore, a faculty that is predominantly white and male is unlikely to be equipped to teach and mentor students from diverse backgrounds. The curriculum is often Eurocentric and neglects the experiences and perspectives of students of color. The lack of diversity on campus also perpetuates a culture of privilege, where the dominant group is unaware of the biases and microaggressions that students of color face.\n\nIt's not just about representation, it's about relevance. As the demographics of the country change, it's essential that our institutions of higher education reflect and prepare students for this new reality. It's time for colleges and universities to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to make meaningful changes to create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment for all students.",

But efforts to address the problem are developing in too scattershot a fashion, largely because of widespread confusion about the role of the university in responding to sexual assault. Institutions of higher education cannot substitute for a functioning criminal justice system, where the interests of the state are vindicated. Nor should they try to replicate the civil justice model, in which plaintiffs sue defendants to vindicate their own interests. However, universities can play a crucial role in providing a safe and supportive environment for students, where they can feel comfortable reporting incidents of sexual assault and seeking help without fear of retribution or stigma. This requires a nuanced understanding of the university's responsibilities and limitations. Universities must strike a balance between ensuring the well-being of students and upholding their rights as victims of crime, while also respecting the due process rights of the accused. To achieve this balance, institutions must adopt a comprehensive approach that includes education and prevention programs, robust reporting mechanisms, and fair and impartial investigations. By doing so, universities can help to create a culture of consent and respect, where sexual assault is not tolerated and victims are empowered to seek help and justice.",

Bollinger and ending the ability of universities and colleges to consider race as one among several factors informing \"holistic\" admissions decisions would be far-reaching in its harm. The experience in California over the last two decades is instructive. In 1997, the year before a statewide ban on affirmative action went into effect, the incoming classes of undergraduates at Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles, were both approximately 8 percent African-American. Last year, only 4.3 percent of U.C.L.A. 's incoming class was African-American and at Berkeley the percentage was just 2.8 percent. During this period, the percentage of black college-age residents in California remained unchanged. The impact of California's ban, which was the result of a ballot initiative, is clear. The data is a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of eliminating race-conscious admissions policies. Without such policies, the pipeline of talented and diverse students to top universities has been severely diminished. The outcome is not only a loss of diversity on campus but also a loss of potential leaders and innovators in various fields.\n\nThe California experience serves as a warning to other states and institutions that may be considering similar bans. The Grutter v. Bollinger ruling, which allowed universities to consider race as a factor in admissions, was a crucial step towards creating a more inclusive and diverse higher education landscape. Reversing this decision would not only harm the institutions themselves but also the broader society.\n\nThe lack of diversity on college campuses is not just a matter of academic interest but also has significant implications for the future of our society.

For some, there may be other feelings, too: a pang in the back, a kick to the lower abdomen, an urgency in the bladder. These are symptoms that often come with passing a kidney stone -- an event that may not be entirely unexpected on certain roller coasters, according to a new study. A silicone cast of the inside of a kidney researchers used to study kidney stones and roller coasters. The authors found that moderate-intensity, rattling coasters might be effective at dislodging little kidney stones in the outer ducts of the kidney and propelling them toward the ureter, the tube connecting the kidneys and bladder. Their report, published last week in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, suggests that riding these roller coasters might help patients who have kidney stones that are five millimeters or less in diameter. The researchers, led by Dr. Brian Eisner, a urologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, used a silicone cast of the inside of a kidney to simulate the movement of kidney stones in response to different types of roller coasters. They found that moderate-intensity, rattling coasters, such as those with frequent drops and turns, were the most effective at dislodging small kidney stones.\n\nThe team also discovered that the shape and size of the roller coaster's track could make a difference. For example, a coaster with a sharp turn could help push the stone further along the ureter, while a coaster with a gradual slope could help the stone slide more smoothly through the ducts.\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, Dr. Eisner emphasized that more research is needed before roller coasters can be recommended as a treatment for kidney stones. \"We're not saying that roller coasters should be used as a replacement for traditional treatments, such as medication or surgery,\" he said. \"But for patients who have small kidney stones, this might be an interesting and fun way to help them pass their stones naturally.\"\n\nThe study's authors also noted that the vibrations and movements of roller coasters could potentially help reduce the discomfort and pain associated with passing a kidney stone. \"Riding a roller coaster might not be the most conventional way to pass a kidney stone, but it's certainly an innovative approach,\" said Dr. Eisner. \"And who knows, maybe one day we'll see roller coaster therapy become a new treatment option for kidney stone sufferers.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Eisner and his team are planning to conduct further research on the topic, including studying the effects of different types of roller coasters and the potential benefits of combining roller coaster therapy with other treatments.

The studio is looking to shake off its reputation for churning out formulaic blockbusters and instead focus on producing more critically acclaimed and commercially successful films that resonate with a wider range of viewers.\n\nSources close to the studio have revealed that the new leadership team is already working on a slate of projects that aim to push the boundaries of storytelling and take risks on new and innovative ideas. This includes a slate of original films and TV shows that will be produced in-house, as well as a renewed focus on acquiring and distributing independent films and international productions.\n\nWhile the exact details of the studio's plans remain under wraps, insiders say that the new leadership is committed to making Warner a more agile and responsive studio that is better equipped to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the entertainment industry. With its rich history and reputation for producing some of the most iconic films of all time, Warner is well-positioned to make a comeback as a major player in Hollywood.",

Scientists aren't sure why Earth was stifling hot for several million years during the Cretaceous period, but according to Dr. Tarduno, the prevailing hypothesis is that the atmosphere was filled with heat-trapping carbon dioxide, most likely the result of extraordinary volcanic activity. The resulting greenhouse effect would have transformed the polar ecosystem into a place where Tingmiatornis arctica and its prey could thrive. The warming period, known as the Turonian age, is estimated to have lasted from 93.9 million to 89.8 million years ago. At its coldest, it is estimated that the Arctic got around 57 degrees Fahrenheit. In his time exploring the snowcapped brown hills and thick glaciers of Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic, Dr. Tarduno has come across two wing bones belonging to this species of bird. The discovery of the wing bones is significant because it provides direct evidence of the presence of Tingmiatornis arctica in the Arctic during the Turonian age. According to Dr. Tarduno, the bones are remarkably well-preserved, with intricate details still intact. \"It's like finding a time capsule,\" he exclaimed. \"These bones tell us that this species was adapted to the warm conditions of the Arctic during that period. It's a remarkable example of how life can thrive in unexpected environments.\" The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of life on Earth, particularly in the context of climate change. Dr. Tarduno's team is now working to analyze the bones further, hoping to uncover more secrets about this ancient ecosystem.",

An exclusive trailer for the coming season along with the final two episodes of the previous season will be shown in 150 Imax theaters across the country. The critically acclaimed drama about rival dynasties in a medieval-like world will be the first television series ever to appear on Imax screens. Tickets for the engagement, which will run for one week from Jan. 23 to 29, will go on sale \"in the coming days.\" The move signals a continued blurring of the lines among media platforms, where digital videos, television series and films stream across a proliferation of screens, from tiny mobile phones to movie theaters.

The event will also feature exclusive behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew. The move to Imax is seen as a major coup for HBO, which has been pushing the boundaries of what is possible with television programming. The network has already seen success with its \"Game of Thrones\" Live Concert Experience, which toured the world last year. The Imax screenings are just the latest example of the show's massive global appeal, and are likely to attract a wide range of fans from casual viewers to die-hard enthusiasts.",

By several counts, Budweiser led the pack of game day advertisers with a spot that depicted its iconic Clydesdale horses rescuing a lost puppy and taking it home. The ad attracted more than 4.2 million online views by midday Monday and captured 12 percent of online activity about the Super Bowl spots, according to a measurement firm, iSpot.tv. Budweiser, which also ran an ad celebrating its brewing process, was mentioned more than 234,000 times on social media during the game, with nearly half of the comments expressing a positive sentiment and many more neutral, according to Amobee, which tracks digital response to brands. In stark contrast, another much-talked-about spot was Nationwide's morbid commercial that showed a young boy saying that he will never learn to ride a bike, get \"cooties,\" learn to fly, travel the world or marry because he died from a preventable accident. While the brand was trying to highlight its \"Make Safe Happen\" program about increasing safety at home, the spot angered viewers. Nationwide was mentioned more than 238,000 times on social media, with 64 percent of those comments negative, according to Amobee. (Nationwide ran another spot featuring the actress Mindy Kaling that seemed to resonate more positively.) \"The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance,\" Nationwide said in a statement. Despite the backlash, Nationwide defended its decision to run the ad, stating that it was meant to spark a conversation about the importance of home safety. However, many viewers took to social media to express their disgust and disappointment with the commercial, with some even calling for a boycott of the insurance company.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Nationwide's ad highlighted the delicate balance between creativity and sensitivity in advertising. While some brands, like Budweiser, found success with lighthearted and uplifting spots, others, like Nationwide, risked alienating their audience with more serious and somber messages.\n\nIndustry experts weighed in on the matter, with some arguing that the ad was misguided and others defending its intention to raise awareness about a critical issue. \"The ad was well-intentioned, but it was executed poorly,\" said one marketing expert. \"It's a tough topic to tackle, but Nationwide could have done it in a more tasteful and respectful way.\"\n\nIn the end, the Super Bowl XLIX advertising landscape served as a reminder that, while creative freedom is important, brands must also consider the emotional impact of their messaging on their audience. As the advertising world continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how brands balance creativity with sensitivity in the years to come.",

On Friday, the investment vehicle that the rap star used to make a $56 million bid for the Swedish technology company Aspiro announced that it had acquired enough of Aspiro's shares to take over the company. Aspiro, which is publicly traded in Sweden, operates subscription streaming services under the brands WiMP and Tidal, which entered the United States market last fall. Jay Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, made his offer for Aspiro in late January through an entity he controls, Project Panther Bidco. Aspiro shareholders had until Wednesday to consider the offer, which needed 90 percent approval for Project Panther to take it over. \"All conditions for completion of the offer have been fulfilled, and the offer is therefore declared unconditional,'' Project Panther said in a statement on Friday. The acquisition of Aspiro by Project Panther Bidco, controlled by Jay Z, is expected to bring significant changes to the music streaming industry. Tidal, which has struggled to gain traction against Spotify and Apple Music, may benefit from Jay Z's involvement and resources. Industry analysts predict that Tidal will now have a stronger competitive edge, thanks to Jay Z's expertise in the music industry and his ability to attract new talent and subscribers. The acquisition is also expected to lead to a renewed focus on artist-friendly policies and better compensation for musicians. Jay Z has been a vocal advocate for fair compensation for artists and has used his platform to raise awareness about the issue.

And metamaterials appear to have the same potential to transform entire industries. Over the past 15 years or so, scientists have learned how to construct materials that bend light waves, as well as radar, radio, sound and even seismic waves, in ways that do not naturally occur. First theorized in 1967 by the Russian physicist Victor Veselago and invented in 1999 by a group led by the physicist David R. Smith, the new design approach was first seen as a curiosity that hinted at science fiction applications like invisibility cloaks. But as the years went by, researchers began to realize the profound implications of metamaterials. They could be used to create new types of sensors, antennas, and even medical devices. For example, metamaterials have been shown to enhance MRI imaging capabilities, allowing for higher resolution and more accurate diagnoses. The technology has also been applied to the development of advanced radar systems, which could potentially revolutionize fields such as air traffic control and weather forecasting. With their ability to manipulate waves in unprecedented ways, metamaterials are poised to transform a wide range of industries, from healthcare to transportation to national security.

Shepard Jr., who as the last publisher of Look magazine oversaw its sudden and rapid descent from record advertising revenue and circulation to its demise, died on April 29 in Sarasota, Fla. He was 96. The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Rocky. Mr. Shepard, a salesman with missionary zeal, was named publisher in 1965, during the heyday of mass general-circulation magazines driven by newsstand sales, lavish photographic spreads and alluring articles. That was before television began vying for advertising revenue and eyeballs, and crippling postal rate increases obliterated profit margins. Collier's had already folded in 1957, but by the late 1960s Look, Life and The Saturday Evening Post were still slugging it out. As publisher, Mr. Shepard was determined to keep Look relevant, investing heavily in new technologies and editorial innovations. He launched a popular weekly news magazine, Look Week, and introduced a tabloid-style format to appeal to a younger audience. Despite these efforts, the magazine's circulation continued to decline, and in 1971, the company was sold to Cowles Communications. Mr. Shepard remained publisher until 1978, when he was forced out due to disagreements with the new owners. He went on to work as a consultant and writer, but his legacy as the last publisher of Look magazine remained a testament to his entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to the industry.",

The dinosaur had a longer nose horn than Triceratops, and two small horns above its eyes. But its most distinctive feature was a radiating frill, a set of large, pentagonal plates like a crown atop its head. The discovery was made in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, where a team of researchers from the American Museum of Natural History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences excavated a nearly complete skeleton of the new species, which they have named Styracosaurus albertensis. The dinosaur is estimated to have lived around 70 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous period. According to the team's lead researcher, Dr. Emily Chen, the unique frill on Styracosaurus albertensis is unlike anything seen before in a dinosaur, and is likely to have played a significant role in the animal's behavior and social interactions. Further study of the skeleton is underway to learn more about this fascinating new species.",

The move follows a petition filed in 2010 by Jane Goodall, The Humane Society of the United States and other groups to eliminate a longstanding distinction between the legal status of captive chimpanzees, which were previously listed as \"threatened,\" and their wild counterparts, which have been deemed \"endangered\" for decades. With the new designations, chimpanzees held in captivity in the United States will receive the same protections as wild chimps under the Endangered Species Act. Biomedical research, interstate trade, and export and import of captive chimpanzees will now require permits issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The decision is expected to have significant implications for the use of chimpanzees in scientific research, as well as their treatment and welfare in captivity. Critics of the previous distinction between captive and wild chimpanzees had argued that it was arbitrary and failed to recognize the close genetic and behavioral ties between the two populations. The new designation is seen as a major victory for animal welfare advocates, who had long argued that chimpanzees are intelligent, social, and emotional beings that deserve greater protection and respect. The Fish and Wildlife Service will now work to develop new regulations and guidelines for the care and management of captive chimpanzees, and to ensure that any permits issued for biomedical research or other purposes are subject to rigorous review and approval.",

Some campus debit cards, for instance, charge fees when students make purchases using their PINs, rather than with a signature -- a fee not typically seen with traditional checking accounts. And some may charge hefty overdraft fees for debit transactions -- that is, fees charged for overdrawing the account, according to a study this year by the Center for Responsible Lending. That means it is important for students to clearly understand the terms of any account they are offered and to make sure they are using it in a way that minimizes fees, said Meredith Turner, chief governmental officer with the California State Student Association. \"Read the fine print,\" she said. \"Students need to be aware of the fees associated with their accounts and make smart financial decisions to avoid unnecessary charges,\" Turner emphasized. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, some campus debit cards charge monthly maintenance fees, ATM fees, and even fees for low balances. These fees can quickly add up, leaving students with a surprise bill at the end of the month. To avoid these fees, Turner recommends that students opt for accounts with no monthly maintenance fees, no ATM fees, and no overdraft fees. Additionally, students should review their account statements regularly to catch any errors or unauthorized transactions. By being mindful of these fees and taking steps to minimize them, students can save money and make the most of their campus-affiliated accounts.",

Women typically account for about two-thirds of the long-term-care insurance claims paid annually, said Jesse Slome, spokesman for the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, an industry group. Last year, companies paid $7.5 billion in claims. The effect is that women will now pay several hundred dollars more a year in long-term-care premiums than a man would for a comparable policy, according to the association's 2014 report, based on data from insurers. (The new gender-based premiums apply to new policies, not policies that were in place before the change took effect.) If you are a single 55-year-old man in good health buying a new policy, you can expect to pay $925 a year, on average, for a policy providing $164,000 in current benefits, without any built-in inflation protection. If you are a woman of the same age and health, though, you will pay an average of $1,225 a year for the same policy -- a difference of $300, or more than 30 percent. The difference in premiums is greater if you buy a policy that builds in inflation protection of 3 percent, compounded annually, for your benefits. (Your pool of benefits under this option would grow to $325,000 at age 80.) The same 55-year-old healthy man would pay $1,765 a year for that policy, but a woman would pay $2,307. A typical single woman will pay an average of 12 percent more than in 2013, the association found. The gender-based pricing disparity is not unique to long-term-care insurance, but it is a significant departure from the industry's previous approach. Many insurance companies, including Mutual of Omaha and John Hancock, have traditionally used actuarial tables to determine premiums based on age, health, and other factors, without considering gender. The change is likely driven by the increasing number of women seeking long-term-care insurance, as well as the growing recognition of the financial burden that caregiving can place on families.\n\nIndustry experts say that the new pricing structure is intended to reflect the reality that women are more likely to need long-term care services, due to their longer lifespan and higher risk of developing chronic health conditions. \"The data is clear: women are more likely to need long-term care, and they are more likely to require longer periods of care,\" said Slome. \"This pricing structure is a reflection of that reality.\"\n\nHowever, some critics argue that the new pricing structure is unfair and could disproportionately affect women who are already more likely to be caregivers for their loved ones. \"This change could have a significant impact on women who are already shouldering a disproportionate burden of caregiving,\" said Barbara Hughes, a financial planner and advocate for women's financial empowerment. \"It's essential that policymakers and regulators take a closer look at this issue and consider the potential consequences for women's financial security.\"",

The takeaway message for consumers: Nothing much will change, at least for now. The court's decision was seen as a major win for the banking industry, which had argued that the fees were necessary to cover the costs of processing debit transactions. The fees, which are typically around 1-2% of the transaction amount, have been a contentious issue for years, with merchants and consumer advocates arguing that they are too high and unfairly burden small businesses and individuals.\n\nThe Federal Reserve had initially proposed capping the fees at 12 cents per transaction in 2010, but the banking industry successfully lobbied to have the rule changed.

Using language that evoked some of his fiercest critics, Mr. Duncan wrote in a blog post, \"I believe testing issues today are sucking the oxygen out of the room in a lot of schools,\" and he added that teachers needed time to adapt to new standards and tests that emphasize more than simply filling in bubbled answers to multiple-choice questions. Over the past four years, close to 40 states have adopted laws that tie teacher evaluations in part to the performance of their students on standardized tests. This flexibility, Mr. Duncan said, would allow states to focus on other measures of teacher effectiveness, such as classroom observations and student feedback, which he believes are more meaningful indicators of a teacher's performance. The move is seen as a significant shift in the Obama administration's approach to teacher evaluation, which has been criticized by many educators and union leaders for its emphasis on standardized testing.\n\nIn a statement, the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers' unions, welcomed the announcement, saying it was \"a recognition that the current system is broken and that we need to move towards a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to evaluating teacher effectiveness.\" The union has long argued that the current system is too reliant on standardized tests and does not take into account the many factors that affect student performance, such as poverty and lack of resources.\n\nThe decision is also seen as a response to growing concerns about the impact of high-stakes testing on students and teachers. Many educators and parents have complained that the emphasis on testing has led to a narrowing of the curriculum, with teachers feeling pressure to focus on test-preparation rather than more creative and engaging teaching methods. By giving states more flexibility, Mr. Duncan is hoping to encourage a more balanced approach to teaching and learning.",

But if Calpers can be forced to take a haircut in Stockton, then what's to stop another city from saying, 'Gee, we'll file for bankruptcy and cut in half our $10 million pension contribution?' \"\n\nHe and other public finance lawyers said that what happens in Stockton could help guide Detroit, which is not in Chapter 9 but was recently put under emergency management by the state of Michigan. Calpers is a $252 billion giant that administers pensions for California state employees and many municipal workers. It calculates how much its member cities must set aside each year, bills them, collects the money, invests it and sends retirees their benefits. When Calpers's investments lose money, as they did in the stock market crash, the bills increase. In 2011, Stockton paid a little more than $20 million to Calpers -- about double what it paid to run its public libraries. Its payments are expected to nearly double in the next 10 years, making Calpers the city's biggest creditor. Stockton says it has no choice but to keep paying, even as it pares other costs, including its payments to bondholders. It says that if it cuts the rate at which its workers build up their pensions, workers will leave -- especially the police, who have been recruited with the promise of large, early pensions. Last year, Stockton asked Calpers for a \"hardship exemption,\" allowing it to slow down its contributions. The implications of the Stockton case are far-reaching, with some experts warning that it could set a dangerous precedent for other cities struggling with pension obligations. \"This is a slippery slope,\" said Robert J. Szczerba, a public finance lawyer at Jones Day. \"If Calpers can be forced to take a haircut, then what's to stop other cities from doing the same?

While Detroit has not filed for bankruptcy, the state of Michigan has taken control of the city's finances, and officials are working to restructure the city's debt. The fate of Detroit's pension fund remains uncertain, but experts say that the city's situation is likely to be closely watched by other cities facing similar challenges. \"This is a wake-up call for cities everywhere,\" said Szczerba. \"They need to start thinking about the long-term consequences of their pension obligations.\"",

The accord, meant to eliminate most tariffs over the next few years, was signed by trade officials in Beijing during a state visit by Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir of Iceland. When completed, it will unite two hugely mismatched economies: Iceland's 2011 gross domestic product of $14 billion was little more than a rounding error in China's G.D.P. that year of $7.3 trillion. Trade between the countries is small by global standards. Iceland's exports to China last year, mainly fish, totaled $61 million, while it imported Chinese goods and services valued at $341 million. But while Iceland cannot offer much in the way of significant new market growth, it could help China in its quest for more influence in the Arctic, as global warming and polar ice retreat make that area increasingly accessible. China is seeking to join the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body that promotes cooperation in the region, as a permanent observer. Iceland, though not a member of the European Union, enjoys access to the single market through its membership in the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area. But China would not gain backdoor access to the European market through the trade deal. Iceland had been negotiating membership but suspended talks in January amid widespread domestic opposition. The agreement with Iceland is seen as a strategic move by China to expand its economic influence in the Arctic region, which is expected to become more accessible due to climate change. China has been increasingly interested in the region's natural resources, including oil, gas, and minerals, and has been investing heavily in Arctic infrastructure development. The country has also been seeking to join the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body that promotes cooperation in the region, as a permanent observer.\n\nIn exchange for the trade deal, China is expected to provide Iceland with financial and technological support for its fishing industry, which is a significant contributor to the country's economy. The agreement also includes provisions for cooperation in areas such as tourism, education, and culture.\n\nThe deal has been welcomed by Icelandic businesses, which see it as an opportunity to expand their exports to China and increase their competitiveness in the global market. However, some critics have raised concerns about the potential impact of the agreement on Iceland's economy and the country's ability to maintain its independence in the face of increasing Chinese influence.\n\nDespite these concerns, the Icelandic government has emphasized the benefits of the agreement, including the potential for increased trade and investment between the two countries. The deal is also seen as a symbol of Iceland's commitment to diversifying its economy and reducing its dependence on traditional industries such as fishing.\n\nThe agreement with Iceland is part of China's broader strategy to expand its economic influence in Europe, which has been a key focus of the country's foreign policy in recent years. China has been seeking to increase its trade and investment ties with European countries, and has been actively promoting its Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure development project that aims to connect China with Europe and other parts of Asia.\n\nOverall, the agreement between China and Iceland is seen as a significant development in the country's relations with Europe, and is likely to have far-reaching implications for the region's economy and politics.",

At the end of two days of talks among the Group of 7 finance ministers outside London, other nations appeared to accept -- at least for now -- Japan's explanation that its new monetary efforts were meant to stimulate its domestic economy, rather than to drive down the yen on international currency markets. The chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, George Osborne, said on Saturday that ministers from the G-7, made up of the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and Canada, had reaffirmed earlier commitments on exchange rates and agreed to make sure policies are \"oriented towards achieving domestic objectives.\" Other officials described the talks as in-depth and positive. The finance ministers also emphasized the importance of continued cooperation to address global economic challenges, including the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for sustainable and inclusive growth. In a joint statement, the G-7 ministers expressed their commitment to promoting free and fair trade, while also acknowledging the need for countries to take measures to protect their domestic industries. The statement also highlighted the importance of international cooperation to address global issues such as climate change and inequality. Despite the tensions over the yen, the G-7 ministers were able to find common ground and maintain a united front, with many officials describing the talks as constructive and productive. The meeting concluded with a sense of optimism and a renewed commitment to working together to promote global economic stability and growth.",

In addition, their counterparts in several other European countries were expected to take more limited labor action this week. France's civil aviation authority made contingency plans over the weekend, asking airlines serving the country's airports in Paris, Lyon, Nice, Marseille, Toulouse and Bordeaux to reduce their flight schedules by 50 percent from Tuesday morning until late Thursday to ease the burden on those airports, which were expected to face significant disruption. Unions in more than a half dozen other countries, including Belgium, Hungary, Italy and Portugal, were likely to join in work-to-rule and other more symbolic actions on Wednesday, said Koen Reynaerts, a spokesman for the European Transport Workers' Federation in Brussels, which represents more than 25,000 workers involved in managing air traffic across the region. The strikes are expected to cause significant disruptions to air travel across Europe, with thousands of flights potentially affected. The European Commission's proposal aims to streamline air traffic management by 2025, but the unions argue it will lead to job losses and increased working hours. The federation's secretary-general, Luca Visentini, warned that the strikes would \"send a strong signal\" to the European Commission that the workers will not accept the proposed changes without a fight. As the strikes approach, travelers are advised to check with their airlines for updates on flight schedules and to plan ahead for potential delays and cancellations. The European Commission has said it is willing to negotiate with the unions, but has thus far refused to withdraw the proposal. The dispute highlights the ongoing tensions between the European Union's efforts to integrate its member states' economies and the concerns of workers who fear they will be negatively impacted by the changes.",

While rates on home loans are likely to remain modest by traditional standards, the ultralow borrowing costs that encouraged millions of homeowners to refinance and helped revive the moribund housing market are quickly becoming a memory. As yields on 10-year government bonds rise amid signs that the economy is improving and that the Federal Reserve will reduce bond purchases, mortgage rates have quickly followed. Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages hit 4.25 percent on Thursday, up from 4.12 percent on Wednesday morning before the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled the central bank might begin easing back on stimulus efforts later this year. As recently as May, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 3.5 percent, close to the lowest in decades. They are either already set at relatively high levels, like most credit card borrowing costs, or tied to short-term interest rates, which the Fed has indicated will not rise before 2015. This shift in mortgage rates is expected to have a significant impact on the housing market, as many homeowners who were previously able to snag ultralow rates may struggle to afford refinancing or purchasing a new home. According to analysts, the rise in rates could also slow down the pace of home sales, as buyers may be deterred by the increased costs. Additionally, the Fed's potential reduction in bond purchases could lead to a further increase in long-term interest rates, making it even more challenging for borrowers to secure affordable mortgages. As a result, many experts are predicting a more modest pace of growth for the housing market in the coming months.",

If you and your spouse live in a state where same-sex marriage is sanctioned, and you meet other criteria (see below), the application should be straightforward. An unresolved question, however, is whether couples who were legally married in one state but moved to another state that doesn't recognize gay marriage can get the same benefits. That's because the Social Security Administration currently uses a \"place of residence\" standard in deciding spousal benefits. Susan Sommer, senior counsel with the gay rights group Lambda Legal, said Social Security had instructed its staff to accept and hold such applications, pending further legal clarification. \"We're awaiting guidance, and we're really hopeful,\" she said. The agency also is holding other types of applications for now, like those for survivor benefits when one spouse dies.

Every year, millions of individuals and households move up or down the income scale depending on their earnings, investments and age. Fortunes wax and wane as new tech gurus graduate from college and top lawyers head into retirement. Still, economists said that people holding considerable capital -- de facto, the already rich -- have done well during the recovery. Moreover, the 1 percent tends to be sticky, and perhaps even more so in bad times than in good times, Mr. Saez said. One study by the Treasury economists Gerald Auten, Geoffrey Gee and Nicholas Turner found that a quarter to a third of 1 percenters in a given year stayed in the 1 percent for all of the following five. . Thus, the profile of wealth in the United States, before the recession and after, has remained much the same. The prototypical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white and male, Mr. Friedman said. The investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett, might not be coastal, but the other categories apply, and with cash on hand and an appetite for acquisitions during the recovery, his net worth has increased by about $10 billion over the last year. Technology has minted hundreds of new top earners too, also generally men, but often much younger. David Duffield of Workday and Elon Musk of Tesla, among others, have benefited from the tech boom. Still, fields like finance, medicine and energy continue to be top moneymakers, with financiers and owners of their own or family businesses dominating the ultra-high-net-worth category. Three big interconnected economic phenomena have driven the boomerang among the country's top earners, economists said: stocks, houses and loans. The surge in stock markets, particularly in the tech sector, has been a major driver of wealth creation for the top 1 percent. As the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices have reached record highs, many investors have seen their portfolios swell in value. Additionally, the housing market has continued to recover, with prices in many areas of the country reaching pre-recession levels. This has created a sense of wealth and security for those who own homes, and has also driven up property values, allowing many to tap into their equity and use it to invest in other assets.\n\nLoans, particularly for mortgages and business ventures, have also played a crucial role in fueling the wealth of the top 1 percent. With interest rates at historic lows, many individuals and businesses have been able to borrow money at affordable rates, allowing them to invest in new ventures, expand their operations, or purchase additional properties. This has created a virtuous cycle, where those who are already wealthy are able to accumulate even more wealth by investing in assets that appreciate in value.\n\nEconomists note that this concentration of wealth among the top 1 percent is not unique to the United States. Many other developed countries are experiencing similar trends, as the global economy becomes increasingly interconnected and wealth becomes more concentrated among a small group of individuals. However, the scale and scope of the problem in the United States is particularly pronounced, with some arguing that it poses significant risks to the overall economy and society.\n\nCritics argue that the concentration of wealth among the top 1 percent is not only a problem of economic inequality, but also a threat to social cohesion and economic stability. When a small group of individuals holds such a large proportion of the wealth, it can create a sense of disconnection and disillusionment among the rest of the population, leading to social unrest and political instability. Furthermore, when the wealthy are able to accumulate wealth at such a rapid pace, it can create a sense of complacency and risk-taking, leading to reckless investments and financial bubbles that can have devastating consequences for the broader economy.",

The findings highlight the need for colleges and universities to provide more financial support and resources to students, as well as for policymakers to address the rising costs of higher education.",

        "Text": "Surveys of consumer and business confidence in recent weeks have plummeted to recession-era lows. With such uncertainty, businesses have also recently curtailed spending on capital investments like computers, delivery trucks and other equipment, apparently in anticipation of higher tax rates and the destructive side effects of government cutbacks. Given that capital expenditures have been weak recently, some economists believe businesses will start spending more if Congress ends or at least delays the risk of severe fiscal tightening. \"You would think there must be for most businesses a list of projects they'd like to do which they've just been pushing a little bit into the future because they haven't been able to justify taking the risk because they don't know what's around the corner,\" said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. \"When they know more about the future, and what tax rates they'll be paying, they will be able to dust off those plans and finally execute them.\" Improving access to credit helps these capital expenditures become not only more attractive, but also more accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been rising in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve. This increased access to credit is expected to have a positive impact on the economy, as businesses will be able to invest in their operations and expand their capacity. According to the Federal Reserve, commercial and industrial loans have been rising steadily over the past few months, with the total outstanding balance reaching a record high. This surge in lending is a sign that banks are becoming more confident in the economy and are willing to take on more risk.\n\nAdditionally, the recent decline in interest rates has made borrowing more attractive for businesses. With interest rates at historic lows, businesses are able to secure loans at a lower cost, making it easier for them to invest in their operations. This is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses, which often rely on credit to finance their growth.\n\nThe increased access to credit and the improving business sentiment are expected to have a ripple effect on the economy, boosting economic growth and creating new jobs. As businesses invest in their operations and expand their capacity, they will need to hire more workers to meet the increased demand. This will not only help to reduce the unemployment rate but also increase consumer spending, as workers will have more disposable income.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has also taken steps to support the economy by keeping interest rates low and implementing quantitative easing policies. These measures have helped to increase the availability of credit and stimulate economic growth. While there are still some risks to the economy, including the potential for a global trade war and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the government's fiscal policies, the improving business sentiment and increased access to credit are expected to provide a boost to the economy in the coming months.",

But as the conference opened, that view was under challenge in a number of state capitals. Republicans in several states have proposed legislation in recent weeks that would bar teachers' unions from all policy discussions, except when the time comes to negotiate compensation. \"except when the time comes to negotiate compensation,\" said Rep. Tim Higgins, a sponsor of the bill in the Colorado legislature. \"We want to make sure that teachers' unions are focused on their core mission: representing the interests of their members, not trying to dictate educational policy.\" The proposals have been met with fierce resistance from teachers' unions, who argue that they have a critical role to play in shaping education policy. \"We're not just advocating for our members' interests, we're advocating for the interests of our students and our schools,\" said Barbara Kerwin, president of the Colorado Education Association. As the debate continues, Secretary Duncan's message at the conference in Denver is being closely watched by education policymakers across the country.",

But Mr. Schauble's comments left room for a less radical solution in which Greece might be given more time to pay its debts. \"Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, emphasized that a default would not only harm Greece, but also have far-reaching implications for the entire European economy. He cautioned that a default could lead to a loss of confidence in the eurozone, causing a credit crisis and even a recession. However, Schauble also left the door open for a more nuanced approach, suggesting that Greece could be granted an extension on its debt repayment schedule or even a temporary reduction in its debt burden. This would allow Greece to avoid default while still addressing its financial struggles. The comments come as international creditors prepare to meet with Greek officials to discuss the country's debt crisis.\"",

        "Text": "The American trade deficit shrank unexpectedly in April after the United States sold $175.6 billion in goods and services overseas, the most exports on record, the government reported on Thursday. The Commerce Department report said that exports of goods were $126.4 billion and services $49.1 billion, while total imports were $219.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $43.7 billion, the lowest since December. The deficit in March was revised down to $46.8 billion from $48.2 billion, the department said. The surprise drop in the trade deficit was attributed to a surge in exports of aircraft, autos, and agricultural products, which helped to offset a rise in imports of goods such as oil and electronics. Economists had been expecting a larger trade deficit, and the news was seen as a positive sign for the US economy. The report also showed that the country's trade deficit with China, a major source of concern for the Trump administration, narrowed to $23.2 billion in April from $25.1 billion in March. The improved trade numbers come as the US and China are engaged in high-stakes trade talks aimed at resolving their differences and avoiding further tariffs.",

With Europe's economic and financial woes weighing on prospects for global growth, officials said they had agreed to take \"all necessary measures needed to stabilize the financial system\" and to contain the troubles. The ministers also announced a plan to inject an additional €100 billion into the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to support struggling member states, particularly Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. The move was seen as a significant step towards stabilizing the eurozone, which has been plagued by concerns over sovereign debt and banking sector instability. In a statement, the ministers emphasized the need for a coordinated approach to address the crisis, saying that \"the financial system is interconnected and that a problem in one country can quickly become a problem for the entire global economy.\" The meeting concluded with a sense of urgency and a commitment to work together to address the pressing issues, as officials acknowledged that the road ahead would be long and challenging.",

They, too, learned the secrets of Apple's hit mobile devices from the Stanford course on iPhone applications, which was introduced in fall 2008 to a packed lecture hall. But while Mr. Anthony took the class as a senior at Stanford, many other members of Apple's burgeoning developer community have tuned in to free video recordings of lectures at iTunes U, where it is often one of the most popular downloads. Stanford's online class, Mr. Anthony says, \"is pretty much the primary way to learn about iPhone development right now.\" As a result, Mr. Anthony has started a community of like-minded developers, where they can share knowledge, resources, and collaborate on projects. The group, called \"Stanford iPhone Devs,\" has grown to over 5,000 members, with many of them going on to create successful apps that have topped the charts. \"It's amazing to see how many talented developers are out there, and how much innovation is happening outside of the traditional academic setting,\" Mr. Anthony said. The Stanford course has also attracted developers from all over the world, including countries such as India, China, and Brazil. The global reach of the course has been facilitated by the availability of the video recordings on iTunes U, which have been viewed over 1 million times. The success of the course has also led to the creation of similar online courses on iPhone development at other universities, further expanding the global community of developers.",

Stephanie Fiore, for example, wondered where to store her many pairs of shoes, since her closet already seemed too small to fit all her clothes. One floor above, Letticia Camacho and Juliet Dolan, new roommates, giggled at the odd coincidence of having brought items that followed the same color scheme: turquoise-and-purple hangers, storage boxes, sheets. On the fifth floor, Mohamed Sako kept his dorm room door ajar and his stereo on, the words to Nicki Minaj's \"Your Love\" wafting onto the hallways  \"You got spark, you, you got spunk.\" As the sounds of laughter and chatter filled the dormitory, the students began to settle into their new home. In Room 227, Sabina Meyer and Stephanie Fiore were busy unpacking their suitcases and arranging their belongings. Sabina, a biology major, was excited to start her freshman year, while Stephanie, a music major, was looking forward to joining the college choir.

(As part of the agreement, only researchers can view the tapes, not school administrators). Participants include teachers of grades four through nine in regular public schools. To demonstrate the project for The New York Times, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation asked teachers in Charlotte and Memphis to volunteer to tape additional classes, not bound by the confidentiality provisions. One who volunteered was Rachael Maher, who teaches seventh-grade math at Alexander Graham Middle School in Charlotte. Rachael Maher's classroom was a typical seventh-grade math class, with students working on worksheets and discussing fractions. Maher, a 10-year veteran teacher, was energetic and engaging, moving around the room to help students who were struggling. As she taught, she encouraged her students to think critically and to explain their thinking. The cameras captured every moment, from Maher's enthusiastic explanations to her gentle corrections of students' mistakes. The goal of the project, Maher said, was to create a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation system, one that would focus on teaching practices rather than just test scores. \"I think it's a great opportunity for teachers to showcase what we do every day,\" Maher said. \"We're not just teaching, we're shaping minds.\"",
