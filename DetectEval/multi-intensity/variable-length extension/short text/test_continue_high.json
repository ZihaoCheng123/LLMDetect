An elite who stick together, 30 January). But she is mistaken to portray the abolition of private education as a futile, unattainable cause. Something that so unfairly and systemically entrenches privilege is plain wrong and disfigures our society, at times grotesquely. The abolition of private education is not a utopian dream, but a necessary step towards creating a more equal society. It's not about punishing the privileged, but about ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education, regardless of their background or financial situation. By dismantling the system that perpetuates inequality, we can create a more just and fair society, where everyone has the opportunity to succeed based on their abilities, not their bank balance.",

Its outgoing chairman, Terry Burns, fought a staunch fight, but HMG declined to extend his tenure. So here comes a replacement, Charles Gurassa, deputy chairman of easyJet, among many other things. The C4 board is hardly in a position to complain, but what talents does Gurassa, a former director of leisure services at BA and veteran of travel trading, bring to the wobbly table? Huge experience? Almost obscenely commodious experience, in fact. Since 2003, when he gave up wage slavery, Gurassa has served as chairman, director or (mostly) non-executive director of 27 enterprises large and small. He's a serial boardroom junkie with no TV experience apart from watching Richard Branson sell Virgin Mobile to NTL and presiding when LoveFilm went to Amazon. In short, he's jolly adept at selling things. but it remains to be seen if his expertise in selling companies will translate to success in leading the BBC's commercial arm. Gurassa's appointment has raised concerns among some BBC staff and stakeholders about the potential impact on the corporation's editorial independence and ability to serve the public interest. With the BBC facing significant funding challenges and increasing competition from private media outlets, Gurassa's role will be crucial in navigating these complex issues. His first task will be to address the concerns of staff and stakeholders, and to demonstrate his commitment to the BBC's core values and mission.",

        "Text": "It would be easy to think that the worst is over, at least for the time being. Watching world stock markets rally after the Bank of Japan cut interest rates gave a sense of relief to many in the financial community. Oil prices, which slumped to just $27 (£19) a barrel a fortnight ago, stood at $34, up 40 cents on the day. Yet the reverse is true. If anything, investors are worried that governments and central banks have failed to realise how weak the global economy still is, seven years after the crash. Dangerous levels of private debt in China, bad debts lurking in Europe's banking system, nervous consumers everywhere: it's a nuclear device that needs careful handling. When a central bank shows that it understands cheap money – in the form of lower interest rates – is a necessary underpinning for investment and growth, investors cheer. When central bankers talk about a world that is healing and should be ready for higher debt costs, they panic. And no wonder, when the smallest possible rise in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve last month – from 0.25% to 0.5% – appeared to send American consumers running home to stash their savings in a piggy bank. New car sales were down in December and consumer sentiment dipped in January after a weak last quarter when, according to the Fed, a rate rise would be largely ignored by a US consumer as resilient as Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator. The interest rate cut by the Japanese central bank is another signal of global weakness. Tokyo wants to generate some domestic growth after 25 years of stagnation and the decision to follow the European Central Bank with a negative interest rate, effectively a charge on deposits, is designed to deter foreign funds from coming to Japan, driving down the currency, and encouraging domestic businesses and consumers to spend not save. It did the trick. The yen fell against the dollar. We must wait and see what happens to domestic demand. The Bank of England, meanwhile, has already put aside its hopes of following the Fed. But the impact of its own rate decisions remains unclear. The UK's economy is still struggling to recover from the Brexit-induced uncertainty, and a rate hike could exacerbate the situation. The bank's governor, Mark Carney, has been cautious in his approach, opting for a wait-and-see approach rather than making a bold move. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank's decision to introduce negative interest rates has raised concerns about the potential consequences for the banking system. The move has sparked a debate about the long-term effects of such a policy, with some experts warning that it could lead to a credit crunch and reduced lending. As the global economy continues to navigate uncertain waters, investors will be watching closely for any signs of a turnaround, but for now, the outlook remains cloudy.",

Directors were expected to meet this week to sign off on a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. A final decision has been on the cards since October, when China's state nuclear firm CGN announced that it would take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by the premier, Xi Jinping. But executives at state-owned EDF, which owns the rest of the project, have delayed a final decision amid funding problems, according to French financial journal Les Echos. It said EDF was putting pressure on the French government to help find new backers to come on board alongside CGN. While directors are due to discuss the issue at a board meeting on Wednesday, Les Echos reported, no decision will be made until the next board meeting, which will happen before final results are released on 15 February. EDF did not return requests for comment. The opening of Hinkley Point C has been delayed twice, from 2017 to 2025, while the UK government has faced criticism for agreeing to pay EDF £92.50 per unit of electricity, around double the market rate. The uncertainty surrounding the project's funding has raised concerns about the project's viability and the UK's ability to meet its carbon reduction targets. The delay has also sparked worries about the impact on the UK's energy security, as the country relies heavily on imported fossil fuels. The government has been keen to promote the project as a key part of its low-carbon strategy, but the lack of clarity on funding has led to criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups.\n\nThe French government has been under pressure to intervene and help find new backers for the project, but so far, there has been no indication of any concrete plans to do so. The delay has also led to concerns about the future of the UK's nuclear industry, which has been struggling to compete with cheaper forms of energy. The UK's nuclear regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, has been working closely with EDF and CGN to ensure that the project meets safety and regulatory standards.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, EDF and CGN remain committed to the project, and officials from both companies have stressed that the delay is temporary and that they are working to resolve the funding issues. The UK government has also reiterated its support for the project, saying that it remains a crucial part of the country's energy mix. However, the delay has raised questions about the project's timeline and whether it will be able to meet its original deadline of 2025.",

While at Cambridge University in the 1960s, he was a member of the Footlights and Beyond the Fringe revues, and began a career as a writer and performer. The younger son of Winifred, a typist, and George, who worked on the railways, Tony was born in Birmingham, weighing an astonishing 14lb. He gained a place at Mosley grammar school, where he excelled not only academically but in the javelin. He went to Hull University, then Cambridge to do his PhD with a thesis entitled Baboons I Have Known. His other pursuit was comedy. Along with contemporaries including John Cleese, Bill Oddie, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden, he wrote and performed his way through Footlights revues such as A Clump of Plinths and Double Take. He also performed in the TV series Twice a Fortnight (1967-68), and later wrote and performed work with James that included a two-man show at Edinburgh in 1968. However, having earned his PhD and decided upon an academic career, he left the troupe behind. I remember a childhood of university quads, halls and the odd little \"experiment\" carried out in the guise of a game on my brother Ian and me. Tony was a fellow of Corpus Christi, Cambridge in the late 60s, and a senior research officer at Oxford University, 1970-74, then held lecturing posts at the universities of London and Melbourne, and in US hospitals and units, through the 1970s and 80s. His work as a neuropsychologist included developing computer programs to help people get over strokes and brain injuries. He studied differences between the brains of men and women and how this might affect cognition, emotions and behaviour, and his papers had such titles as Sex Differences in the Development of Spatial and Linguistic Skills. His research also explored the effects of age on cognitive function, and he was a pioneer in the field of neuropsychological rehabilitation. Tony's work took him to various institutions around the world, including the University of California, Los Angeles, and the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. He was a respected figure in his field, known for his innovative approach and his ability to communicate complex ideas in a clear and accessible way. Despite his many achievements, Tony remained humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand or offer words of encouragement.

Panmure analyst Michael Donnelly said: The heavy fall in the share price post Capita's prelims and the exit of its chairman [Martin Bolland], plus yet another change to segmental P&L and higher debt levels from public bond issues does not yet reflect the potentially significant new levels of risk in the business.

The shares have been under pressure for some time, and the latest developments have only added to the uncertainty. Berenberg's reduced target price and Panmure Gordon's sell advice are likely to have contributed to the sharp decline in the share price. The company's reliance on public bond issues to fund its operations is also causing concern, as it increases the risk of debt servicing and reduces its ability to invest in growth initiatives. With the company's chairman stepping down, there is a sense of uncertainty and lack of direction, which is likely to weigh on the shares in the short term.

In recently submitted filings before the Australian Competition Tribunal, Glencore Coal complained that increased fees to enter the newly privatised Newcastle port, which produces more than 170m tonnes of saleable coal a year, will \"materially impact on the profit margins of coal producers\". The challenge comes amid diminished share prices for the multinational company and job cuts in its zinc production operations around the world. Their challenge followed the New South Wales's government decision to privatise the Newcastle port as part of a joint venture between Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants. The venture quickly increased port fees by between 40 per cent and 60 per cent for vessels to access the shipping channel. The appeal to the Australian Competition Tribunal concerns a decision by the then acting treasurer, Mathias Cormann, in 2015 when he ruled out \"declaring\" the port's fees. Had Cormann ruled in Glencore's favour, this would have allowed it to refer the access dispute to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for arbitration and potentially allow Glencore to push for the port fees to be lowered. Although the tribunal battle will focus on technical issues surrounding competition laws, it touches on two critical policy areas for the Australian government; the privatisation of state assets and concerns about price increases, and the long-term viability of coalmining ventures in Australia. In the tribunal documents Glencore argues that the port's \"unconstrained price\" and the monopoly it holds over granting access to the port \"creates uncertainty for producers and acquirers of Hunter Valley coal\". The Australian government has defended the decision to privatize the Newcastle port, citing the need to increase efficiency and attract new investment to the industry. A spokesperson for the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science said that the joint venture with Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants had brought significant benefits to the port, including increased efficiency and reduced costs. The spokesperson also pointed out that the port's fees were still lower than those of other major ports in Australia. Meanwhile, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has expressed concerns about the potential impact of the increased fees on the competitiveness of the coal industry. A spokesperson for the ACCC said that the commission was monitoring the situation closely and would take action if it found that the fees were having an anti-competitive effect. The dispute has sparked concerns among industry observers about the long-term viability of coalmining ventures in Australia, with some predicting that the increased costs could lead to a decline in production and job losses. As the tribunal battle continues, it remains to be seen whether Glencore's challenge will be successful and what the implications will be for the Australian coal industry.",

United Biscuits, the owner of the McVitie's, Carr's and Jacob's brands, has told its retail clients, who include Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda, that stocks of ginger nuts would be available from mid-March. \"McVitie's ginger nuts will start to appear on shelves from around 11-12 March, but there will be fluctuations dependent on the retailer,\" a spokeswoman for the company said. Most supermarkets have been out of stock of McVitie's ginger nuts and Carr's water biscuits since January and were running low on custard creams and bourbons after the firm's factory in Caldewgate was inundated with 5ft of floodwater on 5 December. The Carlisle-based facility is the second biggest biscuit factory in Europe, supplying the UK and other countries around the world. The company relaunched production of its McVitie's Gold bars, which were made on the upper floors of the factory, in January after five weeks of cleaning and repair work. Four of the factory's eight ovens are now up and running and ginger nuts will be the first of the main biscuit lines ready to hit shelves. The factory should soon be producing 7m ginger nuts a day to meet demand. Bourbons, custard creams and boasters should follow a couple of weeks later. The last biscuit back into production, most likely by the end of March, will be Carr's water biscuits, as their special brick ovens take longer to reheat. The water biscuits are only made in Carlisle because United Biscuits has said it needs to use the local spring water and the factory's brick ovens in order to get the right taste and texture. Mark Taylor, manufacturing director for United Biscuits, said production had resumed more quickly than expected. \"We're delighted with progress,\" he said. \"We started slowly to iron out any niggles and we're not at full speed yet.\" About 400 staff, contractors and suppliers are now working at the factory, about half its usual workforce. The company has also confirmed that the quality of the biscuits has not been compromised by the flooding and that the factory's high standards have been maintained throughout the production process. United Biscuits has thanked its customers for their patience and understanding during the period of disruption and has promised to keep them updated on the availability of its products. The return of McVitie's ginger nuts to the shelves is expected to be a major relief for biscuit fans across the country, who have been forced to go without their favorite treats for several months. The factory's workers are also expected to breathe a sigh of relief, as the resumption of production marks the end of a challenging period for the company.

        "Text": "Is Oprah reviving Weight Watchers or prolonging its death? When the company announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, it revealed that it was still losing members.But the decline in membership slowed during the fourth quarter when Oprah Winfrey became the company's marketing partner and board member. Compared with the previous year, the number of active subscribers was down 4.8% in the fourth quarter. According to Weight Watchers, that was \"an improvement from being down 12.7%\" in the third quarter compared to the year before. The number of members attending in-person meetings has dipped below one million. At the end of the fourth quarter, about 997,900 members attended meetings compared to 1.2 million in December 2013. Another 1.39 million people subscribed to Weight Watchers online program, down from 1.74 million in December 2013. Fourth quarter revenues were $259.2m. Despite the declining membership figures, Weight Watchers CEO Jim Chambers remained optimistic about the weight-loss program's future. \"With the launch of Beyond the Scale and SmartPoints earlier this winter, we introduced an entirely new Weight Watchers program, which is resonating with consumers,\" he said in a statement. \"The partnership with Oprah Winfrey is off to a strong start. Our transformation momentum is building, with positive recruitments this winter season setting a solid foundation for revenue growth and increased profitability.\" After Weight Watchers announced its partnership with Winfrey, she announced \"in her own words\" why she joined its program. Chambers said her announcement was \"direct and emotional\" and that Winfrey connected with members and non-members. He also pointed out that Winfrey has shared updates and anecdotes on social media. \"I. Love. Bread. I now just manage it, so I don't deny myself bread. The company's efforts to revamp its program and appeal to a new generation of dieters seem to be paying off, with Chambers citing \"positive recruitments this winter season\" as a sign of growth. While the number of in-person meeting attendees may be declining, the online program is still attracting a significant number of subscribers. Weight Watchers' revenue of $259.2 million in the fourth quarter is a slight increase from the previous year, and the company is optimistic about its future prospects.\n\nWinfrey's involvement with the company has undoubtedly helped to generate buzz and attract new members. Her personal struggles with weight loss and her enthusiasm for the program are likely to resonate with many dieters. Chambers has praised Winfrey's ability to connect with members and non-members alike, saying that her \"direct and emotional\" announcement about joining the program was a major factor in the company's renewed momentum.\n\nAs Weight Watchers looks to the future, it will be interesting to see how the company continues to evolve and adapt to changing consumer preferences. With the rise of online fitness programs and social media influencers, the weight loss industry is more competitive than ever. However, with Winfrey on board and a revamped program that emphasizes flexibility and freedom, Weight Watchers is well-positioned to continue its transformation and thrive in the years to come.",

The annual ITV coverage of the British Phonographic Industry's awards show was watched by an average audience of 5.8 million, a 27.5% share of all TV viewing between 8pm and 10.20pm on Wednesday night. The show, which was hosted by Ant and Dec for the second year, matched the popularity of last year's event, which was notable for Madonna falling down a flight of stairs. A major promotion of the event by Twitter helped fuel 7.5 million tweets about the show. Adele's acceptance of the global success award caused the peak rate of tweets, at 55,000 per minute at 9.25pm. The most-tweeted about individuals were One Direction band members Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne, with Adele third. The high volume of tweets was also driven by Rihanna's performance, which saw her debut new song \"Work\" featuring Drake. The song's catchy beat and sultry dance moves had fans eagerly sharing their reactions and praising the singer's energetic performance. Meanwhile, the tribute to David Bowie, which featured a medley of his hits performed by Coldplay, Tame Impala, and Annie Lennox, also sparked a wave of tributes and memories on social media. Fans took to Twitter to share their favorite Bowie songs and memories of the late icon, with many praising the touching tribute for doing justice to his legacy.

The company has published research into the most popular professions on its service in terms of how often those users get swiped right – approved as a potential match. For men, pilots are the most right-swiped jobs, followed by founder/entrepreneurs, firefighters, doctors and TV/radio personalities. The comparable women's chart is topped by physical therapists, followed by interior designers, founder/entrepreneurs, PR/communications workers and teachers. Lower down the list, models rank eighth in the males chart and tenth in the females chart – in the latter case, just one place ahead of dental hygienists – sparkling teeth are clearly an asset for Tinder's photo-based matchmaking. Tinder is also keen to stress its popularity among students, with college student the tenth most right-swiped profession for men and sixth for women. The dating app's initial growth, like social networks including Facebook before it, came from universities in the US. The study was based on US users of Tinder. The company added the ability for users to add their professions and education to their profiles in November 2015, although for now both remain optional. The company is nudging users to flesh out its data on them by promising that adding a profession \"increases your chances of receiving a right swipe\". The research, which analyzed the profiles of over 1 million users, suggests that men who list their profession as a pilot are 21% more likely to get swiped right than those who don't. Similarly, women who list their profession as a physical therapist are 15% more likely to get swiped right. The study also found that users who attend college are more likely to get matches, with 45% of male students and 40% of female students reporting that they've received a match on the app. Tinder's chief operating officer, Chris Payne, said that the company is \"excited to see the correlation between certain professions and a higher likelihood of getting matches.\" He added that the study's findings are likely due to the fact that users who are successful in their careers tend to have more confidence and a more positive outlook, which are attractive qualities to potential matches. The company is now considering ways to incorporate more professional information into users' profiles, in an effort to further improve the matchmaking process.",

Melody Madill, a student in Dunedin, was Skyping her fiancée, Anna Messner, on Tuesday afternoon when she started having a seizure. However, Messner was powerless to help because she was in the US. \"I was terrified,\" said Messner. \"I had never seen her twitch and flail so violently, or her mouth to froth and her lips turned blue.\" Messner called US emergency number 911 to get help for Madill, but was told they could not assist with overseas medical emergencies. \"I tried to get her to respond or turn her head so she wouldn't choke. At this point I was screaming, begging her to stay with me,\" said Messner, who met Madill online. Desperate, Messner took to online forum Reddit, appealing for someone in New Zealand to phone for an ambulance. The headline to her post read: \"Mayday need someone to call 111.\" A few minutes later she posted: \"Help.\" Within 10 minutes, her call for assistance was answered by Christchurch woman Jana Hayes, who called 111 – New Zealand's emergency number. After Hayes had phoned an ambulance, she returned to Reddit to report what was happening. She said: \"I was a bit skeptical in case this was a joke (Had to give my cell number and name, and I hate lying lol) ... I'm glad I did it anyway. As Hayes waited for an update on Madill's condition, she received a message from the Reddit community asking her to keep them informed.

Marketed as \"a vacant front basement suitable for redevelopment\", this was one for investors willing to take a risk on getting the right planning consents. Prospective buyers were told, \"There will be no internal viewings due to lack of access (excavation required)\". The leasehold for the basement space below flats in New Eltham, south London, was up for sale with the Auction House at a guide price of £25,000. Bidding reached £27,000 before the hammer came down. The lot was sold by the freeholder of the property. It's not the first, or most expensive, unexcavated basement to be sold – in November a 1,975 sq ft plot of ground below a Bloomsbury block was sold by Savills for £150,000. It suggests freeholders are starting to realise that they might be able to cash in on the land beneath their buildings. Another lot that sold ahead of Tuesday's auction was a basement in Croydon, where planning permission had been submitted, but no digging had been done. Auctioneer Andrew Binstock said: \"We are seeing a few of these in our auction rooms. It's like selling roof space above a property, except this is the gravel underneath. The trend is believed to be driven by the increasing demand for urban development and the scarcity of available land in prime locations. As a result, freeholders are recognizing the potential value of the land beneath their buildings and are looking to capitalize on it. While the idea of excavating a basement may seem daunting, experts say that the returns can be significant. \"It's a unique opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor, literally,\" said property developer, James Wilson. \"With the right planning consents, a basement can be transformed into a lucrative development opportunity.\" With more freeholders following suit, it's likely that we'll see more unexcavated basements hit the market in the coming months. As the property market continues to evolve, it's clear that even the most unexpected spaces are being reimagined as valuable assets.",

The new 25p weekday newspaper, which is set to launch on Monday, could have a print run of perhaps as many as 2 million but Scotland is set to receive only a few thousand of those. One newspaper industry source says that the figure being touted is about 1,000 copies. A second source believes about 3,000 will go out in Edinburgh on the first day on Monday, when it will be free; then from Tuesday, when it will be priced at 25p for two weeks, about 2,000 will be made available. Two weeks after launch the price will rise to 50p. Media industry sources argue that the strategy is most likely to protect cannibalising Trinity Mirror's Daily Record, which sells 171,000 copies a day. It is second only to the Sun in Scotland, which sells 218,000 copies a day. It is understood that the small number of copies of the New Day are to be transported from Oldham to Edinburgh. \"It sounds like they are prioritising the Daily Record,\" said a media source. Industry insiders believe that Trinity Mirror is trying to protect its flagship title, the Daily Record, by limiting the distribution of the New Day in Scotland. By making only a few thousand copies available, the company is likely trying to prevent the new title from cannibalizing sales from the Daily Record.\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to ringfence the Daily Record's market,\" said a senior journalist at a rival newspaper. \"By limiting the distribution of the New Day, Trinity Mirror is trying to prevent it from competing directly with the Daily Record.\"\n\nThe strategy is likely to frustrate Scots who are interested in reading the New Day, particularly those who are not in Edinburgh. However, it is unclear whether the limited distribution will have a significant impact on the title's overall success.\n\n\"It's a bit of a curious move, to be honest,\" said a media analyst. \"While it may help to protect the Daily Record's sales, it's also likely to generate a lot of negative publicity and frustration among readers.\"\n\nThe New Day's limited distribution in Scotland is likely to be a major talking point in the media industry, with many questioning Trinity Mirror's motives. As the title launches on Monday, it remains to be seen whether the strategy will pay off or whether it will ultimately backfire.",

The broadcaster would benefit from more direct ownership by the people who pay for it, rather than the current system, which allows for too much government interference, Labour's Gareth Thomas and Tory MP Steve Baker said. \"The BBC is a 'public service' broadcaster,\" Thomas and Baker wrote in a letter to the Times. \"It operates under a royal charter, agreed between it and the government, is governed by a trust of the great and good appointed by ministers, and is funded by the licence fee payers. But who, exactly, owns it? And to whom is it accountable, not least over the expenditure of more than £3bn of our money? \"The BBC Trust is accountable to no one, really. This creates a vacuum into which political interference from the government (of any colour) can leak.\" A mutual organisation is owned by those members who are directly involved in the business, such as employees or customers, rather than by outside investors. There has been speculation about what system might replace the current BBC Trust model. The culture secretary John Whittingdale has been accused of seeking to bend the broadcaster to his political will over proposals to set up a new board dominated by government appointees. His proposition was based on a report by the former chairman of Virgin Money and Prudential, David Clementi, which recommended that Ofcom be given regulatory oversight of the BBC. The report also backed a unitary board \"charged with responsibility for meeting the obligations placed on it under the royal charter and agreement, and responsibility for the interests of licence fee payers\". The MPs argue that a mutual ownership structure would ensure the BBC's independence and accountability to its licence fee payers. \"A mutual ownership structure would mean that the BBC is owned by those who pay for it, rather than by a trust appointed by ministers,\" they wrote. \"This would bring accountability and transparency to the way the BBC is run, and would prevent the kind of political interference that has been alleged.\" Thomas and Baker also suggested that a mutual structure would allow the BBC to be more responsive to the needs of its audience, rather than being beholden to government agendas. They pointed out that many other successful public services, such as the Post Office and the Cooperative Bank, are already owned and controlled by their customers. \"It's time for the BBC to follow suit,\" they said. The idea of a mutual ownership structure is likely to be met with resistance from some quarters, including the government and the BBC's current governing body, the BBC Trust. However, it is an idea that is gaining traction among some in the broadcasting industry and among licence fee payers who are concerned about the BBC's accountability and independence.",

The firms warn that \"important amendments are required\" to create a bill that will not set dangerous precedents \"which may be copied elsewhere and have wider ramifications for all parties, both in the UK and overseas\". Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, who had teamed up for an earlier group submission, were joined for the first time by Apple, which had previously insisted on going it alone in its efforts to lobby the British parliament. In evidence submitted to the public bill committee, which will examine the legislation before it comes to a vote in the House of Commons, the six firms criticise the IP bill for its attempts to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction. This would allow Britain to force companies to comply even if they aren't based in the UK. They point out that the government had previously been advised that international agreements were the best way to achieve that goal. The firms also say that \"the discussions between the US and the UK in this regard provide a much better path toward a workable arrangement than do naked assertions of sovereign power beyond borders\". But for many British users of the firms' technology, the more pressing issue is the fact that the bill will give the government the power to force a company to strip encryption from its users' communications. For some services, such as Apple's iMessage or Facebook's WhatsApp, that would require a complete rewrite of the service. The technology firms' joint submission to the public bill committee emphasized that the proposed legislation would have far-reaching implications for the global digital landscape. They warned that the bill's attempts to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction would set a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to similar demands from other countries. This, in turn, could compromise the security and privacy of users worldwide.\n\nThe firms also expressed concerns about the bill's provisions regarding encryption. They argued that forcing companies to strip encryption from user communications would compromise the security of their services and undermine the trust of their users. This, they claimed, would have devastating consequences for online security, as encryption is a crucial tool for protecting users' sensitive information.\n\nIn their submission, the technology firms urged the public bill committee to reconsider the bill's provisions and instead adopt a more collaborative approach with international partners. They proposed that the UK government work with other countries to develop a global framework for addressing online terrorism and crime, rather than relying on unilateral legislation.\n\nThe firms' joint submission was seen as a significant development in the ongoing debate surrounding the Investigatory Powers bill. It marked a rare instance of major technology companies putting aside their differences to speak out against a piece of legislation that they believe poses a significant threat to their users' privacy and security. As the bill moves forward, it remains to be seen whether the government will take the technology firms' concerns on board or press ahead with its original plans.",

        "Text": "Two New York Times employees are suing the newspaper, citing \"an environment rife with discrimination based on age, race, and gender\". The class action lawsuit comes the same week that Curt Schilling accused ESPN of a culture of racism. Schilling was recently fired from his role as a commentator at the sports channel after making transphobic comments on Facebook. Racism in the media is often linked to a lack of diversity within the industry. And accusations that the workforce in US media doesn't represent the population are nothing new. In 1968, analyzing protests about the treatment of racial minorities, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders claimed that \"the media report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world\", adding \"fewer than 5% of the people employed by the news business in editorial jobs in the United States today are Negroes.\" That figure has barely changed. In 2015, 4.7% of newsroom employees were African American according to statistics from the American Society of News Editors (ASNE). This points to significant under-representation given that 13.2% of the US population are African American (according to 2014 population estimates from the Census Bureau). ASNE also found that Asian Americans were not well represented – making up 5.4% of the adult population but just 2.8% of staff in newsrooms. Hispanic people meanwhile made up 4% of employees in 2015, compared with 17.4% of the US population as a whole. The problem is not about a lack of qualified candidates according to an analysis by Alex T Williams published in the Columbia Journalism Review. Minorities made up almost a quarter of Americans majoring in journalism or communications between 2000 and 2009. The lack of diversity in the media industry is not only limited to newsrooms, but also extends to other sectors such as entertainment and sports. A study by the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism found that in 2016, only 11.4% of the top 100 films were directed by women, and only 4.5% were directed by people of color. Similarly, a report by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that in 2017, only 12.6% of the top 100 films featured a person of color in a leading role.\n\nThe underrepresentation of minorities in the media industry has serious consequences, including perpetuating stereotypes and reinforcing systemic racism. A study by the Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative at the University of Southern California found that when people of color are underrepresented in the media, it can lead to a lack of representation and visibility, which can have negative effects on their mental and emotional well-being.\n\nThe lack of diversity in the media industry is not limited to the United States. A report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found that in 2019, only 23% of journalists in the European Union were women, and only 14% were people of color. The report also found that the lack of diversity in the media industry was not limited to the EU, but was a global problem.\n\nThe consequences of the lack of diversity in the media industry are far-reaching, and include perpetuating systemic racism and sexism, and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. It is essential that the media industry takes steps to address this issue, including increasing diversity and representation, and promoting inclusivity and equity.",

Australia and the rest of the world have been reeling from a string of temperature records being smashed. February caused alarm when it was the most unusually warm month on record by a huge margin. But that record was broken immediately by March. In Australia March 2016 was the warmest March on record. And this week the Bureau Of Meteorology released its seasonal outlook, showing above average temperatures are set to continue across the country at least throughout May. According to David Karoly, a climate scientist from the University of Melbourne, climate change increased the chance of March breaking the temperature record in Australia by at least seven times. \"The previous record had about a one in 43-year chance due to natural climate variations alone but now occurs about one year in six in the present climate, that is already affected by human-caused climate change,\" he told Guardian Australia. \"It's evidence that climate change is already happening – and increasing the risks of hot extremes.\" Blair Trewin from the Bureau of Meteorology said: \"April won't be a record but it will be well above normal.\" Throughout May temperatures across most of the country have an 80% chance of being warmer than the average from 1961 to 1990. \"This prolonged period of warmth is not just a coincidence, it's a clear indication of the impact of human-induced climate change,\" Dr. Karoly emphasized. \"The fact that we're seeing such extreme temperature records being broken repeatedly is a stark reminder of the urgent need for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.\" The Bureau of Meteorology's seasonal outlook also warns of increased risk of heatwaves, droughts, and bushfires across the country, as the prolonged warmth is expected to exacerbate these conditions. Meanwhile, the Australian government has been criticized for its lack of concrete action on climate change, with many experts calling for more ambitious targets to reduce emissions and mitigate the worst impacts of global warming. As the country continues to swelter through the unseasonably warm weather, concerns are growing about the long-term consequences of inaction on climate change.",

Pacheco, who reported for several newspapers and broadcast for a radio station, was murdered in the city of Taxco, Guerrero state. Relatives said he was shot twice in the back of his head when he returned home in the early morning after taking one of his daughters to a bus terminal. Another daughter told the CPJ that she and her mother were in their home at the time of the attack. They heard noises that sounded like firecrackers and found Pacheco in a pool of blood. Police said there were no witnesses to the murder. Pacheco, 55, covered local news as a correspondent for the daily Sol de Acapulco; edited Foro de Taxco, a weekly magazine; and contributed to Capital Máxima, a radio station based in Guerrero's state capital, Chilpancingo. Pacheco also had a website, where he regularly posted articles on regional crime and violence. Some reports described Pacheco's work as critical of local authorities and especially the mayor of Taxco. But family members and colleagues said he had not reported having received any threats. The murder has sent shockwaves through the local journalism community, with many of Pacheco's colleagues expressing outrage and sadness at his killing. \"Francisco was a brave and dedicated journalist who always sought to tell the truth, no matter the cost,\" said a fellow reporter who worked with Pacheco at Sol de Acapulco. \"His murder is a devastating blow to our community and a stark reminder of the dangers that journalists face in Mexico.\" The CPJ has called on authorities to investigate Pacheco's murder and to bring those responsible to justice. The organization has also urged the Mexican government to take concrete steps to protect journalists and to address the growing culture of impunity that has contributed to the country's high rate of journalist killings.",

Tech companies making self-driving cars could become better protected under the law than those car's owners, experts warn, as the announcement came of a powerful new coalition of automakers and big tech companies forming to take on US government regulations around self-driving vehicles. Google, Uber, Lyft, Ford and Volvo, all of which are working on self-driving car technology, will lobby as the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets to bring autonomous vehicles to the road across the US. Heading it up will be David Strickland, the former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Administration, the same group he will now be working to influence. The lobbying group argues that self-driving vehicles will reduce the severity and frequency of crashes. According to the US Department of Transportation, 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. There's general consensus that self-driving cars will eventually make roads safer (ask any parent of a Snapchatting teen how much they trust drivers). Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among those 15 to 29 years old. The first task for the lobbying group will be just rolling out self-driving cars. But the liability issues will be thorny. A powerful corporate lobbying force may pose a new challenge for personal injury lawyers, who are already wary of the technology, while some safety researchers and accident lawyers worry that the lobbying group could unfairly protect tech companies and app makers over their human car owners. \"I'm worried a lobbying group would try to shield manufacturers and app designers over drivers,\" said Daniel Vega, an accident and personal injury lawyer based in San Francisco. \"When these programs fail, who's responsible?\" Statistician Susan Paddock said the only way to get self-driving cars out on the road was if consumers become comfortable with a great deal of uncertainty. As the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets prepares to take on the US government, concerns are growing among personal injury lawyers and safety researchers about the potential impact on liability and accountability. \"The tech companies are trying to shift the responsibility from themselves to the consumers,\" said Michael Mansfield, a lawyer specializing in motor vehicle accidents. \"They're saying, 'Hey, we're just providing the technology, the human is still in control.' But what happens when the technology fails?\"\n\nThe coalition's push for self-driving cars to be exempt from liability claims is likely to face opposition from lawmakers and consumer advocates. \"We're not saying that the technology isn't important, but we need to make sure that the people who are responsible for the safety of these vehicles are held accountable,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut.\n\nThe coalition's efforts are also being closely watched by lawmakers in California, where a bill has been introduced to establish liability standards for self-driving cars. The bill, which is still in its early stages, would require manufacturers to be liable for accidents caused by their autonomous vehicles.\n\nAs the debate over liability and accountability continues, the public remains skeptical about the safety of self-driving cars. A recent survey found that only 22% of Americans believe that self-driving cars are safer than traditional vehicles. Despite these concerns, the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets remains committed to its goal of bringing autonomous vehicles to the road. \"We're not trying to avoid liability, we're trying to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make these vehicles safe,\" said David Strickland, the coalition's chairman. \"We believe that with the right regulations and standards in place, we can make a real difference in reducing the number of accidents on our roads.\"",

The funding is in place. There is support for this potential transaction,\" Diamond told investors in the London-listed African based bank, Atlas Mara, which he formed after being forced out of Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis in 2012. Diamond's involvement in the consortium, which includes the private equity firm Carlyle, was revealed in a stock market announcement by Atlas Mara after days of speculation about his interest in trying to buy shares in Barclays' African business. Barclays will face questions about its plans to reduce its 62.3% stake in Barclays Africa - which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange and has interests in banks across the African continent - when it publishes its first quarter results on Wednesday. Diamond did not provide details about the size of any offer for the Barclays African operations, but he is expected to need to raise around $5bn (£3.5bn). Barclays' new boss Jes Staley announced last month he wanted to cut the 62.3% stake in the African business to reduce the complexity of its operations and to save capital. Atlas Mara, which has operations in seven African countries, indicated that it expected to be taken over by the the consortium if a deal was struck. The development is likely to spark further speculation about the future of Barclays Africa, which has been a source of tension between the bank and its investors. Barclays' majority stake in the business has been seen as a drag on its shares, and the bank's new management team is keen to simplify its operations and focus on its core UK and US businesses. The Atlas Mara consortium's bid is expected to be one of several potential offers for Barclays Africa, with other suitors likely to emerge in the coming weeks. The bidding process is expected to be intense, with several parties vying for control of the business. The deal could also have implications for the broader African banking sector, with the potential for a new player to emerge as a major force on the continent. Barclays Africa's shares rose 2.5% in early trading on the Johannesburg stock exchange, suggesting that investors are already pricing in a potential sale. The bank's results on Wednesday are likely to provide further insight into the plans of its management team and the potential for a sale of the African business.",

The app will make it easy for users to jump between still photography, video recording and live video streaming, all presented through a Snapchat-style camera-first view, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Although it only in the early stages of development and may not even see launch, the app is intended to combat a decline in personal image and video sharing on the site, as well as prompt greater uptake of the company's Live Video feature. It follows three previous attempts by Facebook to make standalone camera apps. Two of them, Poke and Slingshot, were broadly based on Snapchat, while the third, simply called Camera, was an attempt by Facebook to steal Instagram's thunder. In the end, Facebook bought Instagram for $1bn (£686m), just a month before Camera was launched in May 2012, and the app was quietly shut down. Later in the year, Facebook made a similar attempt to undercut Snapchat, then a plucky rival best known as a \"sexting app\". Facebook released Poke, a fairly transparent clone of Snapchat's key feature of ephemeral picture messaging, and Mark Zuckerberg boasted about having developed it in just 12 days. Despite the previous failures, Facebook is believed to be committed to creating a successful standalone camera app. The new app is expected to be a more comprehensive and user-friendly alternative to its existing camera features, which are scattered across the main Facebook app and other platforms. With the rise of Instagram Reels and TikTok, Facebook is under pressure to innovate and stay relevant in the ever-changing social media landscape. The company hopes that a standalone camera app will help it to regain its position as a leader in the visual storytelling space. If successful, the app could also potentially attract new users and increase engagement on the platform.",

The calls came as the work and pensions select committee confirmed it will investigate how the BHS pension scheme, which has a deficit of £571m, will affect the state-backed Pension Protection Scheme (PPF). Frank Field, the chairman of the committee, said he plans to call Green to face MPs as part of the investigation. BHS called in administrators on Monday, putting almost 11,000 jobs at risk and the PFF is set to take on the company's pension scheme. There was further bad news for the retail sector on Tuesday as clothing retailer Austin Reed also collapsed into administration, threatening more than 1,000 jobs. Green and Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from the billionaire tycoon for £1 in March 2015, are facing questions about their management of the retailer. The Guardian has calculated that Green and his family collected £586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans during their 15-year ownership of the retailer. Meanwhile, BHS made payments of more than £25m to Retail Acquisitions, the consortium led by Chappell, in the 13 months since it bought the company. These payments were for management fees, salaries, professional fees, and interest on loans. John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, called on Green to repay £400m of dividends that were paid out of BHS, or give up his knighthood. John Mann's call for Sir Philip Green to repay the dividends or relinquish his knighthood has been met with widespread support from across the political spectrum. The Labour MP's demand is seen as a stark reminder of the millions of pounds in dividends extracted from BHS during Green's tenure as owner. \"It's outrageous that Sir Philip Green and his family profited so handsomely from BHS while the company's pension scheme was left in a dire state,\" said Mann. \"If he can't afford to repay the dividends, then he should at least have the decency to give up his knighthood.\" The news comes as BHS's administrators, Duff & Phelps, are set to begin a massive restructuring of the company, which could lead to significant job losses and store closures. Meanwhile, the government has announced plans to increase the PPF's funding to help protect the pensions of BHS employees. As the situation continues to unfold, Sir Philip Green's reputation is under intense scrutiny, with many calling for greater accountability from those who have profited from the collapse of the high street retailer.",

        "Text": "Mortgage lending surged dramatically in March, returning to the peak levels last seen before the financial crash, as buy-to-let speculators and second home buyers rushed to beat the stamp duty tax deadline. Total lending rose to £17.1bn, 64% higher than the same month a year ago, and the highest figure since April 2008, according to the British Bankers Association. Buyers frantically closed property deals ahead of the introduction of a 3% hike in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second homes that began in April. Remortgaging by existing home owners also leapt, with households taking advantage of cheap mortgage deal amid the widespread belief that interest rates will stay low for an extended period of time. The average mortgage loan taken out reached a record high, hitting £184,200, compared to £158,000 at the peak of the previous lending cycle in April 2008. But the bank lending figures reveal an increasingly lop-sided financial picture, with borrowing by manufacturers for investment falling sharply while borrowing for buy-to-let speculation has boomed. Lending to manufacturing companies, which had been growing at an annual rate of 12% in 2014, has fallen back to zero, while in construction it is falling. Meanwhile, personal borrowing on credit cards continues to rise. British households made 223m purchases on their credit cards in March, with a total value of £12.6bn. But while the volume of purchases increased by 2%, the value fell by 1% compared to the same month last year. Mortgage brokers said they are preparing for a steep decline in lending during April. Adrian Anderson of Anderson Harris, said: \"As expected, March was a bumper month for mortgages. Investors and second homeowners alike rushed to beat the hike in stamp duty at the start of April but expect April and May's lending figures to be more subdued as transactions that would normally have happened then were brought forward.\" The surge in mortgage lending has raised concerns about the potential for a housing market bubble, as many experts warn that the rapid growth is unsustainable and may be driven by speculation rather than genuine demand. The Bank of England has already sounded the alarm, warning that the rapid growth in mortgage lending poses a risk to financial stability.\n\nSome economists are also pointing to the lack of wage growth and the increasing reliance on credit to fund housing purchases as a worrying sign. \"The fact that households are relying more and more on credit to fund their housing purchases is a cause for concern,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit. \"It's not a sustainable situation and it's only a matter of time before the music stops and people can't afford their mortgage payments.\"\n\nThe government has also been accused of contributing to the problem by failing to address the root causes of the housing crisis, such as a lack of affordable housing and a shortage of supply. \"The government's policies have created a perfect storm for the housing market,\" said John Healey, Labour's shadow housing minister. \"They've encouraged speculation and driven up prices, while failing to deliver the affordable housing that people need.\"\n\nAs the mortgage lending figures continue to rise, many are left wondering what the long-term consequences will be. Will the surge in lending lead to a housing market bubble, or will it be a short-term blip on the radar? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the British economy is on a precarious path, and it's up to policymakers to ensure that it doesn't get out of control.",

        "Text": "Cities in the north of England must become more productive if the chancellor is to realise his vision of a so-called \"northern powerhouse\", a thinktank has said. The Centre for Cities said George Osborne's plan to bridge the economic gap between the wealthier south and the poorer north was too heavily focused on intercity transport links, and not enough on improving the performance of individual cities. The HS3 rail link proposal to speed up east-west connections between the major northern cities is a key part of the government's plan to redress the UK's economic imbalances. The thinktank, however, said that cities in the Rhine-Ruhr region of Germany and the Randstad region of the Netherlands – which the government cites as models for the northern powerhouse – were economically vibrant because individual cities were already strong, not because of better rail links between them. The five most productive cities in the two regions - Amsterdam, Bonn, Leverkusen, Haarlemmermeer and Düsseldorf - were on average 40% more productive than their UK counterparts of Leeds, Warrington, Burnley, Liverpool and Manchester, the Centre for Cities said. It pointed out that intercity commuter rail links in Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad were actually little better than those in the north of England. Alexandra Jones, the thinktank's chief executive, said: \"We can't build a successful northern powerhouse without stronger, more productive cities. The Centre for Cities is calling for a more holistic approach to improving the economic prospects of northern cities, which would involve addressing issues such as skills training, business support, and local leadership. The thinktank suggests that the government should focus on creating a \"city-by-city\" strategy, rather than relying solely on infrastructure projects like HS3.\n\nAccording to the Centre for Cities, the most productive cities in the Rhine-Ruhr and Randstad regions are those that have a strong local economy, a highly skilled workforce, and a vibrant business community. In contrast, many of the cities in the north of England are struggling with high levels of unemployment, poverty, and economic inactivity.\n\nThe thinktank is urging the government to adopt a more nuanced approach to regional development, which would involve working closely with local authorities and businesses to identify and address the specific challenges facing each city. This could involve initiatives such as vocational training programs, business incubators, and investments in local infrastructure.\n\nAlexandra Jones, the Centre for Cities' chief executive, said: \"We need to stop thinking about the north as a single entity and start thinking about the individual cities that make it up. Each city has its own unique strengths and challenges, and we need to tailor our approach to meet those needs.\"\n\nThe government's northern powerhouse plan has been widely praised for its ambition and scope, but critics have argued that it lacks a clear strategy for delivering economic growth and improving living standards in the north. The Centre for Cities' report is likely to add to the debate, and will likely be seen as a wake-up call for the government to rethink its approach to regional development.",

Chappell said Green had failed to deliver on a pledge to ensure the backing of credit insurers and had not left sufficient cash in the business. \"Philip Green never stood good for his word,\" Chappell told the Guardian. \"We worked so hard. It was Philip Green's interfering and breaking of his word that caused this to happen.\" Out of more than £60m of cash left on the balance sheet by Green, the Topshop owner who sold BHS for £1 to Chappell's Retail Acquisitions just over a year ago, Chappell said he had been forced to pay out more than £20m as upfront guarantees to keep key suppliers on board. He admitted Green had not given a written guarantee that he could secure credit insurance but claimed it had been verbally promised. More than £20m of other funds had gone to pay VAT, wages and rent, according to Chappell, so that the business had been forced to borrow money from property investors the Dellal family at expensive rates to keep BHS trading. The Dellals' Allied Commercial Exporters (Ace) provided Chappell with £35m in cash needed to demonstrate to Green's Arcadia group that he was a credible buyer for BHS, then made millions of pounds from a series of property deals and loan agreements with the retailer. Chappell's scathing criticism of Green's handling of the business is likely to fuel further anger and frustration among the thousands of former BHS employees who lost their jobs when the company went into administration. The collapse of BHS has also sparked widespread concern about the treatment of pension scheme members, who are now facing significant losses.\n\nChappell claimed that Green's failure to deliver on his promises had left him with no choice but to seek emergency funding from the Dellal family, who are notorious for their high-interest loan rates. \"I was left with no option but to go to the Dellals, who charged us exorbitant rates of interest,\" Chappell said. \"It was a vicious cycle - we were borrowing money to keep the business afloat, but the interest rates were so high that it was making it impossible for us to break even.\"\n\nThe former owner of BHS also accused Green of being \"selectively loyal\" to his own business interests, claiming that he had prioritized the needs of his Arcadia group over those of BHS. \"Philip Green was only interested in saving his own skin,\" Chappell said. \"He didn't care about the impact his actions would have on the thousands of people who worked for BHS.\"\n\nChappell's comments are likely to reignite the controversy surrounding Green's sale of BHS for just £1, which has been widely criticized as a reckless and irresponsible decision.

It is not clear if Walden will stay on if Sainsbury's finalises the £1.4bn takeover deal, but Home Retail Group's annual report published on Tuesday revealed that in either case the chief executive would be able to cash in more than 650,000 shares and options, which are not subject to performance conditions. Under the terms of Sainsbury's takeover deal – which offers 0.321 Sainsbury's shares and 55p in cash for every Home Retail Group share as well as a 25p windfall from the sale of the Homebase chain and a 2.8p dividend, that would be worth £1m. Walden's windfall could potentially be more than double that after he was awarded 785,000 shares and share options in May last year, which are subject to three-year performance criteria and worth £1.3m, and 143,000 which he received this year. He could also potentially cash in up to 1.4m more share options – which are due to vest if he meets performance criteria over the next two years – worth up to £2.3m. Home Retail's remuneration committee said it had not yet determined what would happen with bonuses and share awards linked to performance targets beyond the date of any takeover. If he left the business, Walden would also be in line for a payout of at least £676,500; his basic annual salary after a 2% pay rise. He is also likely to receive a further £250,000 in lieu of benefits and pension payments. In the year to the end of February 2016, Walden received a total pay package of £1.5m, down more than a third from the previous year. While his salary increased 6.4% to £663,000, his annual bonus and long-term share bonuses both dropped, cutting his total pay package by more than £900,000. The news of Walden's potential windfall has sparked concerns among some investors and critics of excessive executive pay. \"It's staggering to think that the CEO of Home Retail Group could walk away with a payout of over £5m if the company is sold,\" said Sarah Wilson, a corporate governance expert at the charity ShareAction. \"While we understand that the takeover deal is likely to benefit shareholders, it's important that the company's remuneration committee considers the long-term implications of such large payouts on the business and its employees.\" Home Retail Group's annual report also revealed that Walden's total pay package has increased by 17% over the past five years, despite the company's profits falling by 14% during the same period. The company's remuneration committee has defended Walden's pay, citing his role in leading the business through a period of significant change and growth. However, some investors have called for greater transparency and accountability in the company's executive pay practices. \"We need to see more detail on how the company's remuneration committee arrived at these decisions and what measures are in place to ensure that executive pay is aligned with the interests of all stakeholders,\" said John Taylor, a portfolio manager at the investment firm, Hermes Equity Ownership Services.",

        "Text": "Ecstasy is making a comeback, according to a report from the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction (EMCDDA). After its peak during the 1990s house, rave and techno scenes, it's returning to popularity with both established drug users and a new generation due to \"creative and aggressive marketing\" (including the use of logos such as Superman and UPS) and the fact it now has higher purity. The report also warned that the substance is now stronger than ever. So, what does this say about current drug laws? The UK reported the second highest level of use (the highest usage was in the Netherlands) among the 12 countries which were analysed. How can we lower rates of drug use or is it time to stop criminalising it? We want to hear from drug counsellors about our current attitude to drugs in Britain. How can the law be improved? Experts argue that the rise in ecstasy use is a result of the current legal framework, which drives the production and distribution of drugs underground, making it difficult to regulate and monitor. They suggest that a harm reduction approach, focusing on treatment and education, could be more effective in reducing drug-related harm.",

In the UK Royal Mail, which was linked with PostNL in December, is up 7p at 539.5p in a downbeat market. Analysts at Credit Suisse said talk of mergers and acquisitions in the European postal sector is growing but they are cautious about the prospect, given declining traditional mail volumes and limited scope for synergies. They said: Royal Mail seems a more likely driver of consolidation than Deutsche Post DHL but we do not see an obvious acquisition candidate: We do not expect DHL to make meaningful acquisitions given its prioritisation of organic growth. The analysts also noted that Royal Mail's focus on its parcel business, which has been a key driver of growth, may make it more attractive to potential suitors. However, they cautioned that any consolidation in the sector would likely be driven by strategic rather than financial considerations, given the limited potential for cost savings. Meanwhile, Deutsche Post DHL has been prioritizing organic growth through investments in its parcel and logistics business, which has led to concerns that it may not be interested in making significant acquisitions. The company's focus on e-commerce and parcel delivery has been a key driver of its growth, and analysts believe it will continue to be a major player in the sector. Despite the uncertainty, Royal Mail's shares remain a popular choice among investors, with many seeing the company as a key player in the sector's future consolidation.",

The 'big four' accountant said 24 of 80 new partners in its UK business, which includes offices in Switzerland, are female. The figure means that 30% of the prized positions went to women, up on last year's 29% and just 20% in 2014. But while the proportion of new female partners has been increasing, Deloitte is still a long way off gender parity. This year's intake means that just 16% of the 1,054 partners in the firm's UK division are female, a slight increase on 15% before the latest batch of promotions. Deloitte says that just 10% of new partners are not white, below the 13% of the population who identified as being non-white in the 2011 census. But 10% represents an improvement, given that the existing group of partners is only 4% non-white. Despite the progress, Deloitte's diversity and inclusion efforts are still a work in progress. The firm has set a target to have at least 20% of its partners from diverse backgrounds by 2025, but it is facing an uphill battle. Deloitte's UK CEO, Richard Houston, acknowledged that the firm still has a long way to go to achieve true diversity and inclusion. \"We recognize that we have a significant underrepresentation of certain groups in our partnership, and we are committed to making progress,\" he said. \"We are taking a range of actions to address this, including increasing our recruitment of diverse talent, providing training and development opportunities, and creating a more inclusive culture.\" Deloitte is also facing criticism for its lack of transparency around its diversity data. While the firm has released some statistics, it has not provided detailed breakdowns of its diversity figures, leading some to question the accuracy of its claims. The firm has promised to release more data in the future, but for now, it remains a topic of controversy. Despite these challenges, Deloitte remains committed to its diversity and inclusion goals, and is working to create a more inclusive and diverse workplace for all employees.",

Ball, who works under the pseudonym Docubyte, began the project after developing a fascination and affection for such retro devices. \"It's rare now to find any machine that you can touch and interact with,\" he says. \"Computers now are all touch screens, slick and super-slim.\" Ball feels that computers that pre-date the Apple era aren't widely considered to be design pieces, and his nostalgia for this earlier, more \"naive\" aesthetic led him to seek out and photograph a range of machines that date from the latter half of the 20th century, representing them as if they were new and desirable products. After shooting the machines, which he largely found in the Science Museum in London, the Dresden Technical Collections and the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, Ball painstakingly enhanced the images with the help of his colleagues at INK studio to make the computers look new. The resulting images are a testament to Ball's creative vision and attention to detail. The photographs depict the vintage computers in a modern setting, often surrounded by sleek, minimalist backdrops and subtle lighting. The result is a fascinating blend of old and new, with the retro machines taking on a fresh, almost futuristic quality.\n\n\"I wanted to create a sense of familiarity and nostalgia, while also making the machines look desirable and aspirational,\" Ball explains. \"I think people are drawn to the tactile nature of these old computers – the way you can touch the buttons, feel the weight of the machine. It's a sensory experience that's missing from today's sleek, touch-screen devices.\"\n\nThe Guide to Computing series has already garnered significant attention online, with many viewers praising Ball's unique perspective and attention to detail. The project has also sparked conversations about the importance of preserving and celebrating our technological heritage, as well as the value of embracing the tactile and imperfect qualities of older machines. As Ball continues to work on the series, he hopes to inspire a new appreciation for the beauty and functionality of early computers.",

        "Text": "MPs are to investigate how many occupational pension schemes are at risk of failing, amid inquiries into the collapse of BHS and the debate over the future of the £15bn British Steel pension fund. The Commons work and pensions select committee, which is already investigating the £571m deficit at BHS scheme, said on Friday night it would launch a wide ranging inquiry into the problem, probably starting in the autumn. Workers' occupational pensions have been forced centre stage in recent months by BHS's collapse and by Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees who were under retirement age when the company went into administration in March may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result. The British Steel pension scheme, one of Britain's largest defined benefit plans with 130,000 members, is also facing cuts as the government races to put it on a sound footing to help facilitate a sale. The latest figures show it has liabilities of almost £15bn and the deficit has ballooned to £700m. Announcing the broader inquiry, the chair of the committee, Frank Field, said: \"The state of the British Steel pension scheme is further worrying evidence of a wider danger to one of the biggest savings successes in Britain during the last century – occupational pension schemes. The select committee's in-depth case study on BHS is illustrating how such schemes are already creaking from rising life expectancy and record low returns on capital. \"Pension law and regulation must urgently adapt to the issues of the future, rather than the problems of the past. The committee's inquiry will focus on the regulatory framework surrounding occupational pension schemes, as well as the impact of demographic changes, such as rising life expectancy, on scheme sustainability. It will also examine the role of scheme trustees, employers, and regulators in managing the risks and ensuring the long-term viability of these schemes. The inquiry is expected to take several months to complete and will involve taking evidence from a range of stakeholders, including scheme trustees, employers, regulators, and industry experts.\n\nThe committee's chair, Frank Field, expressed concerns that the current regulatory framework is not equipped to deal with the challenges facing occupational pension schemes. \"We need to move away from a system that is focused on retrospective regulation and towards one that is forward-looking and proactive,\" he said. \"The future of occupational pension schemes is at stake, and we need to take urgent action to ensure that they remain a viable and attractive option for workers.\"\n\nThe inquiry is likely to put pressure on the government to take action to address the issue, particularly in light of the BHS and British Steel pension fund crises. The government has already announced plans to introduce new measures to strengthen the regulation of defined benefit pension schemes, but many in the industry believe that more needs to be done to address the underlying issues facing these schemes.",

Amid heightened demand for specialist beers, the discount supermarket chain will stock its shelves with brews such as Wet Your Whistle, White Witch and A-Hop-alypse Now from Sunday. It said the move would allow it to tap into a UK craft beer market worth £420m and predicted to reach £1bn by 2020. The German retailer spent the past two years sourcing the beers from 15 UK-based breweries, before selling them for £1.25 each in stores in England and Wales. It added that the range was \"carefully selected to celebrate provenance, artisan brewing and the exceptional beer produced across the UK\". The breweries chosen include Wiltshire-based Wadworth, a fourth-generation family business that delivers ales locally in oak casks by shire horses. The craft beer range will be available in Aldi's 750 stores across England and Wales, with the retailer aiming to make a significant impact on the UK market. \"We're excited to bring these exceptional British craft beers to our customers, offering them a taste of the country's thriving brewing scene,\" said Aldi's beer buyer, Jason Holyhead. \"Our customers are always looking for new and exciting products, and we believe these craft beers will be a hit.\" The move is seen as a significant coup for the UK's craft beer industry, which has seen rapid growth in recent years. The addition of Aldi's support is expected to further boost the sector, providing a new platform for British breweries to showcase their products. With its reputation for offering high-quality products at affordable prices, Aldi is well-placed to tap into the growing demand for craft beer. The retailer's move is also expected to put pressure on larger supermarkets to offer more specialist and artisanal products.",

The company has received a complete response letter from the US Food and Drug Administration about its ZS-9 treatment for high potassium levels, outlining concerns which must be addressed to gain approval. It said it was evaluating the content of the letter, but Reuters reports some analysts as saying the drug's launch could be delayed until 2017 because of a manufacturing issue. AstraZeneca, which expected peak annual sales of $1bn for the drug, said: The [letter] refers to observations arising from a pre-approval manufacturing inspection. The FDA also acknowledged receipt of recently-submitted data which it has yet to review. The [letter] does not require the generation of new clinical data. AstraZeneca and ZS Pharma are evaluating the content of the [letter] and will work closely with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for the NDA [new drug application]. The company's shares fell 3.3% to £41.15 in early trading on the London Stock Exchange, while ZS Pharma's shares dropped 12.2% to $24.45 on the Nasdaq.

The deal will transfer £12.3bn of assets under management and more than 910,000 policies to Phoenix. The sale includes the pension and investment businesses Embassy and SunLife, which offer life cover to the over-50s. The Bristol-based SunLife has been part of the French insurance giant since 1996. Clive Bannister, chief executive of Phoenix, said the acquisition of the Embassy and SunLife businesses was another important step forward in the firm's growth strategy. Phoenix specialises in buying life assurance businesses that are closed to new customers. Bannister said: \"We will invest heavily to ensure a smooth transition of the two businesses from Axa to Phoenix and we are committed to delivering the highest level of service to both direct and IFA [independent financial adviser] customers, as we do for our existing customers. Looking ahead, we believe there will be further consolidation in the UK life industry and we will continue to explore further opportunities as they arise.\" The agreed sale completes Axa's exit from the British life and savings market. It recently sold its Elevate business, a platform which handles almost £10bn of UK investments, to Standard Life, as well as an Isle of Man offshore bonds business to Life Company Consolidation Group. The disposals mean a loss of €400m for the French company, but will enable it to focus on property and casualty, health and asset management in the UK. Axa also announced changes in its top management, ahead of the arrival in September of new chief executive Thomas Buberl. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. Phoenix has committed to maintaining the existing distribution networks and ensuring that customers can continue to access their policies and products without interruption. The acquisition is expected to be earnings accretive for Phoenix in the first year after completion. Axa has agreed to provide Phoenix with transitional services for a period of up to 18 months to ensure a smooth transition. The French insurer will also retain a minority stake in the Embassy and SunLife businesses for a period of five years. Axa's departure from the UK life and savings market marks a significant shift in its strategy, as the company focuses on its core businesses in property and casualty, health, and asset management. The disposal of its UK businesses is part of Axa's efforts to simplify its operations and reduce its exposure to the highly competitive UK life insurance market. With this deal, Phoenix has now acquired several life assurance businesses in the UK, including Friends Life and Royal Liver, and has established itself as a major player in the market. The company's growth strategy is focused on acquiring businesses that are closed to new customers, allowing it to focus on its existing customer base and grow its assets under management.",

John McFarlane, who is also chairman of TheCityUK, which promotes Britain's financial services, said it was important not to lose sight of Europe as a market as businesses sought to build broader international links. \"Relationships with the EU will need to be repaired,\" he told TheCityUK's annual conference. \"We can only hope that whatever transpires will be to the benefit of our membership.\" His comments preceded a meeting of business leaders at No 10 with David Cameron and business secretary Sajid Javid to allay concerns that the political crisis enveloping both major UK political parties would spill over into the economy and trigger a recession. Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of easyJet, who attended the meeting, has already warned that quitting Europe will drive up air fares and make holidays more expensive. The prime minister reportedly told business leaders it was important that businesses did not become \"fixated\" on the EU, but looked to markets beyond to generate new relationships and sales. McFarlane told the conference: \"It's far from certain what we might be able to secure from discussions with the EU.\" However, he said London was the financial centre for Europe and could remain that way. \"Europe's capital markets are not in Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin; they are in London,\" he said, adding that English would continue to be the language of business. Britain is not expected to begin negotiations with Brussels until autumn at the earliest, and possibly not until next year, after a new prime minister has been chosen. McFarlane's comments were echoed by other business leaders who attended the meeting at No 10, who expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU. \"The lack of clarity on the terms of the exit is causing a lot of anxiety among businesses,\" said a senior executive at a major bank, who wished to remain anonymous. \"We need to know what the rules of the game are going to be before we can start planning for the future.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty, McFarlane remained optimistic about the UK's financial services sector, saying that London's position as a global financial hub was unlikely to be threatened. \"London is a global city and a global financial centre, and it will continue to be so,\" he said. \"We have a unique combination of language, culture, and expertise that makes it an attractive place for businesses to operate.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was convinced. Some business leaders have warned that the UK's departure from the EU could lead to a loss of talent and investment, as well as increased regulatory burdens. \"The uncertainty is already having an impact on our business,\" said the CEO of a major financial institution. \"We are seeing a decline in applications from top talent and a decrease in investment from our investors.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, the UK's financial services sector is bracing itself for the challenges ahead.

Meanwhile, the UK's politicians are under pressure to provide clarity on the terms of the exit, and to reassure businesses that the UK's financial services sector will continue to thrive.",

The feature has been known to suggest users who have no or few mutual friends on the network – and, reportedly, nothing in common beyond having shared the same physical space – prompting concerns about how it works. These were resurrected on Tuesday when Fusion reported that Facebook was drawing from the location of users' smartphones to inform its suggestions – a \"privacy disaster\", it said. It quoted a spokesperson as saying that location information was \"only one of the factors\" Facebook used to determine people who may know each other. \"Seriously, I've had enough reporters ask me, freaked out, why Facebook is recommending their protected sources,\" tweeted Violet Blue, a reporter on cybercrime, on Tuesday. \"Suck it up & stop using it.\" But Fusion then published an updated statement from Facebook, which said it did not use location data – though it had briefly in the past. Fusion's Kasmir Hill wrote that she had \"reportorial whiplash\". \"I've never had a spokesperson confirm and then retract a story so quickly.\" The network \"ran a small test\" for four weeks at the end of 2015, in which it used users' cities to rank existing suggested friends, the spokesperson said. Not all staff were aware that the test had ended. On Wednesday a Facebook spokesman confirmed to the Guardian that it was not using location data, with the same statement as supplied to Fusion. \"We may show you people based on mutual friends, work and education information, networks you are part of, contacts you've imported and other factors,\" he said. In its help section, Facebook says its suggestions are based on \"mutual friends, work and education information, networks you're part of, contacts you've imported and many other factors\". The opacity of these \"other factors\" aside, Facebook's sometimes disconcerting suggestions – perhaps more accurately titled \"people you most definitely know, but have no intention of adding\" – have been remarked upon since it introduced the feature in 2008. The controversy has sparked a heated debate about the limits of online social networking and the importance of transparency in data collection and use. Some experts argue that Facebook's use of location data, even if it was only a small test, raises serious privacy concerns and undermines trust in the platform. \"Facebook's ability to collect and analyze location data is unprecedented and raises serious questions about how it will use this information in the future,\" said digital rights activist, Alex Abdo. \"Users have a right to know how their data is being used and to have control over it.\"\n\nOthers argue that the feature is simply a reflection of the network's ability to connect people who may not have previously been in contact, and that the benefits of social networking outweigh the potential risks. \"Facebook's 'people you may know' feature is a powerful tool for building and maintaining social connections,\" said sociologist, Dr. Danah Boyd. \"While it may not always be accurate, it is a key part of what makes Facebook so valuable to so many people.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, Facebook has faced calls to be more transparent about its data collection practices and to provide users with more control over how their information is used. The company has so far declined to comment further on the matter, but has promised to continue to review and improve its data collection and use practices. Meanwhile, users are left to wonder just how much information about them is being collected and used, and what the implications may be for their online privacy.",

Investors were spooked after its chief executive, Wilf Walsh, said trading conditions had been more challenging in recent weeks and added: \"The outlook has been further complicated by the outcome of last week's referendum and we are cautious about the impact the associated uncertainty will have on consumer confidence.\" Despite the retailer reporting underlying profits up by a third to £17.3m in the year to 30 April, the shares touched a low of 216.88p before staging a recovery to reach 225p by lunchtime. In previous downturns home furnishings retailers sales have been affected by a slowdown in the housing transactions which are a trigger for purchases. Carpetright revealed that its new financial year had got off to a bumpy start with like-for-like sales down 7.6% in the UK in May but swinging back to growth of 6.3% in June. \"It's a very strange atmosphere,\" said Walsh. \"Consumers are not behaving in a pattern.\" He said it was too soon to judge what the fallout from the referendum would be. Walsh, a former managing director of the bookmaker Coral, was hired in 2014 to lead a turnaround following several difficult years for the company as sales and profits collapsed during the last recession. Total sales fell 1.3% to £456.8m after it closed 25 under-performing stores. Walsh is in the process of overhauling the retailer, with a new look for its stores and a push to improve customer service. The company's efforts to revamp its brand and operations have been underway for some time, but the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU has added an extra layer of complexity to the business. Walsh acknowledged that the retailer's sales have been affected by the economic uncertainty, with consumers holding off on big-ticket purchases.\n\n\"We're seeing a mix of responses from customers, with some being more cautious and others taking advantage of the current market conditions,\" he said. \"It's a challenging environment, but we're focused on executing our plans and adapting to the changing market.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Carpetright remains committed to its turnaround strategy, which includes investing in its online platform and expanding its services to include home installation and design. The company is also exploring new product lines and partnerships to drive growth.\n\nWalsh expressed optimism about the retailer's prospects, saying that it has a strong balance sheet and a loyal customer base. \"We're well-positioned to navigate the current uncertainty and come out stronger on the other side,\" he said.\n\nIn the short term, Carpetright is focusing on managing its costs and cash flow, while also investing in its marketing and customer service initiatives. The company is also exploring opportunities to expand its presence in the UK and internationally.\n\nWhile the road ahead may be uncertain, Carpetright is confident that its efforts to transform the business will ultimately pay off. As Walsh put it, \"We're not immune to the challenges facing the industry, but we're well-equipped to adapt and thrive in the current environment.\"",

        "Text": "The UK grocery market has fallen into decline for the first time this year as the performance of all four major supermarkets worsened. Asda's sales slid by 5.9% – its worst performance on record and the biggest slump in the market. Tesco was the best of the major chains, with sales down 1.3% according to analysis from Kantar Worldpanel published on Tuesday. That compares with falls of 5.1% and 1% revealed last month. In contrast, discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to see double-digit growth, with sales up 11.5% and 13.8% respectively, taking their combined market share to a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is now only a hair's breadth from overtaking the Co-op to become the UK's fifth largest supermarket. The latest figures do not include the period after the referendum, but Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said the decision to leave the EU was likely to help bolster the discounters further. \"With an estimated 40% of the food we consume sourced from overseas, any long-term change in exchange rates may threaten the current period of cheaper groceries. Historically, higher prices have led to consumers looking for less expensive alternatives such as own-label products, seeking out brands on promotion or visiting cheaper retailers,\" he said. The immediate economic uncertainty was unlikely to cause a substantial fall in grocery volumes, McKevitt said, if patterns followed those seen during the 2008 financial crisis when basic food, drinks and household sales proved resilient. However, the long-term impact of Brexit on the UK's food supply chain and consumer behavior remains uncertain. The discounters' ability to offer affordable prices, coupled with their limited product ranges, has allowed them to thrive in a market where many consumers are seeking value for money.\n\nMeanwhile, the big four supermarkets are struggling to adapt to the changing landscape. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, and Morrisons have been trying to revamp their businesses by investing in online shopping, improving their store layouts, and launching new own-brand products. However, their efforts have been slow to pay off, and they are still grappling with the consequences of the market shift towards discounters.\n\nThe decline of the big four supermarkets has also led to concerns about the impact on local communities. Many towns and cities have been shaped by the presence of large supermarkets, which have provided jobs and services. If these stores continue to struggle, it could lead to store closures and job losses, further exacerbating the economic uncertainty facing the country.\n\nAs the market continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether the discounters can maintain their momentum or if the big four supermarkets can find a way to reverse their decline. One thing is certain, however: the grocery market will continue to be shaped by the changing preferences of consumers and the broader economic environment.",

        "Text": "British retail sales slowed in the run-up to the EU referendum, an industry survey has shown. A balance of UK retailers saying sales rose minus those who reported falling sales fell to 4% in June, down from 7% in May, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest snapshot of the retail sector (pdf). The survey was conducted between 26 May and 14 June – before the UK's shock vote to leave the EU. Grocers, furniture and carpet shops, along with hardware and DIY stores, reported a pickup in sales in the year to June. But growth slowed at clothing retailers and sales fell at department stores, specialist food and drink retailers, and shops selling durable household goods such as cookers and washing machines. Retailers were expecting sales to improve in July, with the balance improving to -10% from -5% in June, while orders were expected to continue falling. The CBI said: \"Retail sales reported weak growth in the year to June, beating expectations of a modest fall and lifting sales slightly above average for the time of year.\" Orders placed on suppliers fell in June, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous month. Growth in the volume of internet sales slowed in the year to June, with the survey balance falling below the long-run average. However, internet sales growth was expected to pick up strongly in July. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the survey suggested \"consumers were relatively cautious in their spending in the run-up to the EU referendum, but did not completely keep their hands in their pockets\". He continued: \"There is not much evidence in the survey of retail sales getting a significant boost from the European football championships, although this only started on 10 June, while the CBI survey only ran until 14 June. \"A massive question now is how well or badly will retail sales perform in July following the UK's vote to leave the EU? \"Following the vote to leave the EU, the strong suspicion is that consumer spending will be severely pressurised for some time as a consequence of increased uncertainty, likely higher unemployment and squeezed purchased power. The survey's findings suggest that the retail sector was already feeling the effects of uncertainty and economic volatility before the referendum, which could have a lasting impact on consumer spending. Many retailers had been hoping for a boost in sales during the European football championships, but the survey suggests that this did not materialize.\n\nThe CBI's director of economics, Ian Geddes, warned that the retail sector was likely to face a tough few months ahead. \"The referendum result has created a great deal of uncertainty, and it's likely that this will affect consumer spending patterns,\" he said. \"We expect to see a slowdown in retail sales growth in the coming months, and potentially even a decline.\"\n\nThe survey's findings are likely to be a concern for policymakers, who are already grappling with the economic implications of the UK's decision to leave the EU. The Bank of England has cut interest rates and launched a package of stimulus measures to support the economy, but many economists believe that more needs to be done to support consumer spending and boost economic growth.\n\nIn the short term, the survey suggests that retailers may need to focus on managing their cash flow and reducing their costs in order to stay afloat. Many retailers are already struggling to make ends meet, and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote is likely to make it even harder for them to plan for the future.\n\nIn the longer term, however, the survey's findings also suggest that there may be opportunities for retailers who are able to adapt to the new economic reality. With many consumers likely to be more cautious with their spending, retailers that are able to offer good value and provide a high level of customer service may be able to attract more customers and increase their market share.",

        "Text": "Chiefs at the parent company of the Independent almost doubled their take-home pay last year as plans were being put in motion to cut jobs and shut the newspaper titles. Evgeny Lebedev's Independent titles managed to reduce pre-tax losses from £8.5m to £6.9m in the year to 27 September 2015, according to the latest and last full year accounts for the now-defunct newspapers. At a \"trading\" level, excluding items such as interest repayments and redundancy costs, the Independent and Independent on Sunday lost just £3.74m last year. Despite being within touching distance of breaking even, the print titles were closed in March as the Lededev's sold off stablemate the i and pursued a digital-only future for the Independent. Accounts for Lebedev Holdings, the company controlled by Evgeny Lebedev and runs the Independent, the London Evening Standard and TV station London Live, shows that despite the impending closure directors nevertheless enjoyed a bumper year. The five directors – who include Alexander Lebedev, former chief executive Steve Auckland, chairman Justin Byam Shaw and financial chief Manish Malhotra – tripled their take home pay from £589,000 to £1.48m. The unnamed highest-paid director pocketed £953,000, up from £529,000 in 2014. Specifically at the Independent, the highest paid director doubled pay from £200,000 to £416,000. The seven directors of the subsidiary company that runs the Independent more than doubled their pay from £387,000 to £831,000. The overall increase in director pay is the result of the addition of new directors between 2014 and 2015. The series of financial filings for Evgeny Lebedev's media assets show that the Evening Standard enjoyed another profitability boost in 2015 with pre-tax profits rising from £1.09m to £3.38m. At a \"trading\" level profits rose from £1.35m to £4.5m. Given the tough trading conditions in the UK ad market, which has seen most national newspaper publishers report print ad falls of as much as 20%, revenues rose admirably from £62.9m to £71m. Independent Digital News and Media, the separate company spun-off from the Independent print titles made a net profit before tax of £1.27m. And ESTV, the parent company of the London Live local TV channel, showed a significant reduction in losses from £11.5m to £6.34m year-on-year to 30 September 2015. The filing show that Evgeny Lebedev and his father, Alexander, have ploughed more than £135m into their UK media assets since buying a controlling stake in the Evening Standard in 2009 and the Independent titles in 2010. Despite the financial struggles of the print titles, the company's digital ventures showed signs of growth. The Independent's online presence continued to expand, with digital revenue increasing by 15% to £15.3m. The company's digital news service, Independent Digital News and Media, also reported a significant increase in revenue, up 25% to £7.1m. However, the company's financial struggles ultimately led to the closure of the print titles, with the Independent and Independent on Sunday ceasing publication in March. The company's decision to focus on digital-only operations has raised concerns about the future of quality journalism in the UK. Critics argue that the company's emphasis on digital revenue has come at the expense of in-depth reporting and investigative journalism, which are essential components of a healthy democracy. The closure of the print titles has also led to widespread job losses, with many experienced journalists and staff members losing their positions. The company's decision to prioritize digital operations has also sparked concerns about the long-term viability of the Independent's online presence, with some critics arguing that the company's focus on clickbait headlines and viral content is unsustainable in the long term.",

        "Text": "ITV has seen almost £2.5bn wiped off its stock market value since the Brexit vote, raising city speculation the the broadcaster could become the target of a takeover. ITV, which saw its share price fall by more than 20% on Friday, continued to see jittery investors drive its price down more than 5% in early trading on Monday. At midday on Monday its share price had fallen to 164p, down from a pre-Brexit 220p and a one-year high of 280p. Investors worried about the repercussions of Brexit on ITV, which relies on a now nervy advertising market for much of its revenues, have driven the broadcaster's market capitalisation from £9bn to about £6.5bn in the days since the EU referendum. City analysts have begun to speculate if the share price decline, coupled with the UK's currency crash, down 10% against the US dollar, might prompt foreign media companies to consider making an opportunistic bid for ITV. \"This increases the chance of a bid by one one of the major US media companies where there is a historical and present interest in the UK market,\" said Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum. \"Not only from the established media giants, but also from new media/tech companies (for example, we believe that several of the US internet giants explored a bid for the English Premier League rights in the last bidding round).\" NBC Universal, owner of Downton Abbey maker Carnival, has been rumoured in the past to have had an interest in bidding for ITV, and John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, has a 9.9% stake in the broadcaster. The speculation has sent ITV's shares tumbling, with investors scrambling to offload their holdings. The broadcaster's market capitalization has plummeted to around £6.5 billion, a staggering £2.5 billion decline since the Brexit vote. The concern is that ITV's reliance on the UK advertising market, which is already showing signs of weakness, will be further exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding the country's exit from the EU.\n\nAs a result, some analysts believe that ITV could become an attractive target for foreign media companies looking to expand their presence in the UK market. NBC Universal, which has a history of making strategic acquisitions, has been rumored to have had an interest in bidding for ITV in the past. Additionally, John Malone's Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, has a significant stake in the broadcaster.\n\nWhile ITV's management has so far remained tight-lipped on the speculation, some insiders have hinted that the company may be open to exploring strategic options if the right offer comes along. With its shares trading at a 15-year low, ITV's valuation is seen as attractive by many in the industry.\n\nIn the meantime, investors will be closely watching the company's performance in the coming weeks, as well as any developments in the Brexit negotiations, which could have a significant impact on the UK advertising market. As the uncertainty surrounding ITV's future continues to mount, one thing is clear: the broadcaster's shares will need to stabilize quickly if it is to avoid becoming the target of a hostile takeover.",

        "Text": "Visitors to the Bespoked Handmade UK Bicycle Show in Bristol earlier this year would have noted how bike building in the UK is undergoing a renaissance. On a floor of 100 exhibitors, dominated by custom steel and titanium bikes, one builder stood out because of his choice of material: carbon fibre. While the majority of road bikes are carbon fibre these days, custom frames built from the lightweight material are rare because of the technical challenges involved. However, from his workshop in Worcestershire, Richard Craddock is overcoming these barriers. Craddock spent a number of years designing cycles for various brands and riding for an amateur racing team in France before deciding to build a carbon bike \"exact for me\". He spent almost four years developing and testing before offering his Filament bespoke carbon frames to the public. \"I've never stopped building since,\" he says. So what is the appeal of his carbon bikes? \"The primary USP is custom geometry,\" says Craddock. \"Two riders of the same height could be stocky or like a willow, and I can build for their weight, not only their height. I can make a frame that will hold them exactly without compromise.\" He achieves this not only with the geometry but also by selecting the right tube diameters, fibre and resin types, and the number and sequence of plys that are used for joining the tubes. Perfecting the joining process was a major challenge enabling him to create custom frames without the need for expensive fixed moulds. Craddock's attention to detail and commitment to perfection have paid off, with his bespoke carbon frames attracting attention from enthusiasts and professional riders alike. His unique approach to frame design and construction has allowed him to create bikes that not only look stunning but also perform exceptionally well on the road. \"I've had riders come back to me saying they've never felt so comfortable on a bike before,\" Craddock says proudly. \"It's not just about being light, it's about being tailored to the rider's specific needs.\"\n\nCraddock's dedication to his craft has also earned him a reputation among his peers, with many other frame builders seeking his advice and guidance. \"Richard is a true master of his craft,\" says one industry insider. \"His attention to detail and willingness to push the boundaries of what's possible with carbon fibre have raised the bar for custom frame builders everywhere.\"\n\nDespite the growing demand for his bespoke frames, Craddock remains committed to keeping his business small and personal. \"I've always been driven by a passion for building the perfect bike, not by a desire to make a quick profit,\" he says. \"I'm proud to be able to offer riders a truly unique and exceptional riding experience, and I'll continue to do so as long as there's a demand for it.\" With his reputation continuing to grow, it's clear that Richard Craddock is here to stay, and his bespoke carbon frames will be sought after by riders who demand the very best.",

They want to be listened to and want change – that's a political issue.\" Asked if the country's captains of industry could have done more to convince voters to back the status quo, he pointed to disaffection between the \"man in the street and big business\". \"There has been a loss of trust and we need to think about how to rebuild that,\" Rose said. \"It has happened over time, since the last recession, whether it's the banks or the crisis in the eurozone or a business being run in a way people don't like. \"All these things leave a bad taste in the mouth and cumulatively that taste can get quite bitter. This is a big issue about our country, our people, how they feel and what they think.\" After playing a key role at the start of the campaign Rose was sidelined in March after he told a select committee wages would go up if Britain left the EU. His remarks were used as ammunition by the leave campaign, although he maintains he was misquoted. Rose served out the final months of campaigning in a behind-the-scenes role. Lord Rose's comments come as the Britain Stronger in Europe remain campaign is left to pick up the pieces after a crushing defeat in the referendum. The campaign's failure to persuade the British public to remain in the EU has sparked widespread debate about what went wrong.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Lord Rose also expressed disappointment at the way the referendum campaign was conducted, saying that it was \"not a very edifying experience\" and that it was \"a shame\" that it had become so divisive.\n\nDespite his disappointment, Lord Rose remained optimistic about the future of the UK, saying that he believed the country would \"come out of this stronger\" and that it would be \"an opportunity for us to rediscover who we are and what we want to be\".\n\nLord Rose's comments have been met with mixed reactions, with some accusing him of being out of touch with the concerns of ordinary voters. However, others have praised his candor and his willingness to reflect on the campaign's failures.\n\nAs the UK begins the process of leaving the EU, Lord Rose's comments serve as a reminder of the complex and often fraught nature of the referendum campaign.

It seems they are keen to race headlong into a very misty future. There are so many unresolved issues: the need for a citizen's income to allow those disenfranchised from the workplace to live a reasonable quality of life (and the taxation on corporate profits that this would require); the loss of peace and quiet, privacy, safety, security; and beyond all this, what will humans be doing in the future?

Those that have remained on the fence until now have until 11am on Saturday in the UK to update for free. After that they will be stuck on whichever version of Windows they currently have installed, unless they purchase a Windows 10 upgrade. For many annoyed by Microsoft's aggressive pushing of Windows 10 to their computers, through automatic downloads, installs that happen while they're away making tea or interrupting the weather or pro-gamer streams, the end of the free upgrade period will come as a welcome relief. Many are happy with Windows 7, which has turned out to be Microsoft's new Windows XP: a solid, good-enough operating system that many will be hesitant to switch from. But Windows 10 is arguably the best version of Windows Microsoft has ever created. There are some questions over its use of cloud services and the tracking of user actions, but Windows 10 is the most secure version yet. If you're running either Windows 8 or 8.1, the free update to Windows 10 is highly recommended, as it is a refinement of the good things in the older operating system without most of the irritating ones, such as the charms bar and gestures that simply don't work on a desktop computer with a mouse and keyboard. Updating is simple. Visit the Windows 10 help page, the download page, or click yes to Microsoft's Windows 10 upgrade notification that has been pushed on users for the best part of a year. Here is the continued text:\n\nTo start the upgrade process, users will need to create a Microsoft account if they don't already have one, and then sign in with their credentials. They will then be prompted to download and install the Windows 10 upgrade tool. The process is expected to take around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the speed of the user's internet connection and the specifications of their computer. It's recommended to back up important files and data before starting the upgrade, as it will erase all data on the computer and start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10. Once the upgrade is complete, users will need to set up their new Windows 10 environment, including configuring their desktop, settings, and installing any necessary drivers for their hardware. For those who are upgrading from Windows 7, the process is slightly more complex, as they will need to perform a clean install of Windows 10, rather than simply upgrading from within their existing operating system. However, Microsoft has provided detailed instructions and support resources to help users through the process. With the free upgrade offer coming to an end, now is the time for users to take the plunge and experience the latest and greatest version of Windows.",

        "Text": "One in every three people in Monaco are millionaires, according to research into the cities of Europe that have the most high net worth individuals, with Zurich close behind. London ranks fourth. Millionaires on its Mayfair streets and penthouses may be more numerous than Monaco, but they account for only one in every 29 of the capital's citizens. Edinburgh, ranked 16th, is the only other UK city to make it into the top 20, with an estimated one in 67 of its inhabitants a millionaire. Consultancy company WealthInsight, who carried out the research in partnership with Spear's Magazine, said Dublin was the surprise entry into the top 10, beating Paris, Berlin and Moscow. \"Dublin has a higher density of millionaires than many other European capitals. Most of these have earned their wealth from Dublin's burgeoning tech scene, which has attracted talent from both Europe and the US,\" said researcher Oliver Williams. The research is based on the number of people who have assets of more than $1m (£760,000) separate to the value of their main home. \"Monaco continues to add more millionaires per head of its population than anywhere else: it has seen its density go up by 6% since the last ranking two years ago. Such is the escalating exclusivity of the principality that only the ultra-wealthy are able to lay hands on Monégasque [from Monaco] passports,\" said Williams. Monaco's reputation as a tax haven for billionaires has been emphasised by the continuing furore over Tina Green, wife of the controversial former BHS boss Phillip Green, who has been resident in the principality since 1998. The Greens say the companies behind their retail empire are based in offshore locations because of their \"strong regulation\", and not for tax reasons. The research also highlighted the significant disparity in millionaire density between cities in Western and Eastern Europe. While Zurich and Monaco dominated the top two spots, cities in Eastern Europe such as Prague and Budapest ranked significantly lower, with only one in 215 and one in 242 of their inhabitants respectively holding a net worth of over $1 million. This suggests that the wealth gap between Western and Eastern Europe remains significant, with many Eastern European cities still struggling to catch up with their Western counterparts.\n\nThe data also revealed that the number of millionaires in European cities is not solely driven by the presence of financial centers or major corporations. Instead, it appears that cities with strong startup ecosystems and a high concentration of entrepreneurs are more likely to attract and retain high net worth individuals. This is evident in the case of Dublin, which has seen a surge in millionaire density in recent years due to the growth of its tech industry.\n\nThe findings of the research have implications for cities looking to attract and retain high net worth individuals. While tax incentives and financial centers may be important factors, the data suggests that cities with strong startup ecosystems and a high concentration of entrepreneurs may be better placed to attract and retain millionaire residents. As cities compete for the attention of the world's wealthiest individuals, the research highlights the importance of creating an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation.",

        "Text": "British Gas lost almost 400,000 customers in the first six months of 2016 as greater competition among suppliers encouraged households to switch. The company's parent, Centrica, said falling gas and power prices had brought new suppliers to the market, intensifying the rivalry for customers. The 3% fall in UK home customers was also the result of a significant number of long-term contracts coming to an end at the same time, leaving British Gas with 14.26m accounts. Customer numbers started rising again in June, it said. Claire Osborne, an energy analyst at the price comparison website uSwitch, said: \"Energy suppliers big and small continue to eat away at British Gas's market share. The only way that British Gas can start to win back customers is by launching new, competitive deals. \"British Gas is the only major supplier to have made three cuts to standard gas prices since the start of last year, so its standard variable tariff is the lowest among the big six. However, its best deal is still almost £290 a year more than the cheapest on the market so customers are likely to find better savings by switching to other providers.\" Announcing results for the first half of 2016, Centrica said operating profit at its UK home business fell 6% to £635m. Despite the decline in customer numbers, British Gas reported a 6% increase in revenue from its UK home business, driven by a 2% rise in average revenue per customer. The company's overall operating profit fell 12% to £1.4 billion, due to lower wholesale energy prices and increased competition in the market. Centrica's CEO, Iain Conn, said the company was focused on improving its competitiveness and reducing costs to stay ahead in the market. He also emphasized the importance of investing in new technologies and services to attract and retain customers.\n\nIn response to the changing market, British Gas has announced plans to launch a new range of tariffs and services, including a new fixed price deal and a smart meter installation program. The company is also investing in its customer service operations, with plans to improve its online and phone support channels. According to industry analysts, British Gas still holds a significant market share, but its rivals are gaining ground. With the energy market expected to remain highly competitive in the coming years, British Gas will need to continue to innovate and adapt to stay ahead of the competition.",

        "Text": "Britain's top company bosses went on a share-buying spree in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, spending more money on their own stock than at any time in the last decade. Directors of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies have spent more than £18.5m buying shares in their own firms since the 23 June vote, according to data compiled for FT Money by the broker Olivetree Financial. \"This is the largest amount of individual director buys in at least 10 years,\" Olivetree said. The sectors that were hardest hit by the news of Brexit – banks, housebuilders, retailers and travel companies – saw the biggest director purchases. Many boardroom directors have done well out of these deals as stock markets bounced back following days of dramatic falls when tens of billions of pounds were wiped off the London stock market. The biggest share buys came in late June and early July. The largest individual transaction in the FTSE 100 was made by Hikma Pharmaceuticals' founding Darwazah family, which bought £3.3m of shares in the Jordan-based drugmaker the day after the Brexit vote. In the second-largest dealing, Tony Pidgley, the chairman of the London-focused housebuilder Berkeley Group, snapped up nearly £800,000 of shares on 27 June and has seen them go up in value by 15% since then. Lloyds Banking Group saw the most deals, as 21 directors bought shares worth more than £750,000. The doorstep lender Provident Financial was in second place, with seven directors buying nearly £1.5m of stock, followed by Vodafone, where five directors snapped up £1.4m of shares. The data also revealed that several directors of companies in the FTSE 250, which includes smaller-cap companies, have also taken advantage of the post-Brexit market volatility to buy shares in their own firms. Notable examples include the directors of discount retailer B&M European Value Retail, who purchased £450,000 worth of shares, and the directors of pub chain Mitchells & Butlers, who bought £300,000 worth of shares. The buying spree has raised eyebrows among analysts, who point out that the directors' actions are a clear indication of their confidence in the future prospects of their companies. \"When company directors are buying shares in their own companies, it's a strong signal that they believe the stock is undervalued and that the company is poised for growth,\" said one analyst. The news has also sparked debate about the potential for insider trading, with some critics arguing that the directors' actions may have unfairly profited from their knowledge of the company's financial situation. However, Olivetree Financial pointed out that the directors' transactions were all made in accordance with company rules and were publicly disclosed, ensuring transparency and fairness.",

The company will open 25 new restaurants, extend opening hours at existing sites and introduce new initiatives such as table service. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said the announcement was \"great news for the UK economy\". He added: \"The government is committed to ensuring businesses have the support they need to thrive and today's announcement underlines that businesses are confident that the UK remains open for business.\" McDonald's is pushing ahead with its expansion plans despite Britain voting to leave the EU, which has sparked fears of a slowdown in the economy and businesses pulling investment out of the country. Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald's UK, said all of the jobs would be permanent, with full-time and part-time roles. The company has been criticised for its use of zero-hours contracts, with an estimated 80,000 of its workers on such agreements. It is, however, rolling out plans to offer staff the option of moving to fixed-hours contracts. It has expanded a trial that began in St Helens on Merseyside to nine restaurants around the country, which employ about 600 people. Pomroy said the trial was going \"really well\" for staff, with one in five workers taking up the option of moving to fixed hours. The company is revamping its employment policy after workers told Pomroy they were struggling to get loans, mortgages and mobile phone contracts because they were not guaranteed employment each week. Pomroy said the company had considered whether to press ahead with its expansion plans after the EU referendum, but now wanted to accelerate its growth rather than hold back investment. \"I want to be seen as an employer of choice. The new jobs will be created across the UK, with a focus on areas that have been affected by the decline of traditional industries. McDonald's is also investing in its existing staff, with plans to provide training and development opportunities to help them progress in their careers. The company is also committed to increasing diversity and inclusion in its workforce, with a goal of having a more representative workforce by the end of 2017.\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by the government, which sees it as a vote of confidence in the UK economy. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: \"This is great news for the UK economy and a testament to the confidence that businesses like McDonald's have in our country. We are committed to supporting businesses like McDonald's to grow and thrive, and we will continue to work with them to ensure that they have the support they need to succeed.\"\n\nThe news comes as a relief to many in the industry, who had been worried about the impact of the EU referendum on the economy. The referendum result had sparked fears of a slowdown in growth and investment, and many had been wondering if companies like McDonald's would continue to invest in the UK.\n\nHowever, McDonald's is not the only company that is pressing ahead with its expansion plans. Other major brands such as Marks & Spencer and Tesco have also announced plans to create new jobs and invest in their businesses. The news is a boost to the UK economy, which is facing uncertainty following the EU referendum.",

Billed as the newspaper for the 48% of the UK that voted to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum, the New European's first edition is thought to have sold more than 40,000 copies. Subsequent issues have also sold well, leading publisher Archant to decide to continue producing it on a rolling basis, though the company has made it clear it will pull the plug if interest wanes. By contrast, daily sales of The New Day newspaper, which launched last February, quickly sunk to an estimated 30,000 before it was closed in May. Its publisher, Trinity Mirror, had been targeting a circulation of about 200,000 copies. Contributors so far have included novelist Howard Jacobson, the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland, venture capitalist Saul Klein and former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, who called for the UK to hold a second referendum. \"We're thrilled at the reaction and support we've seen for this most unorthodox newspaper launch,\" said Archant chief content officer Matt Kelly. \"We will continue to publish into the zeitgeist until that moment passes.\" The decision to continue publishing the New European has been met with widespread approval from readers and contributors alike. \"It's fantastic news,\" said Howard Jacobson, who has written several articles for the paper. \"The New European has filled a much-needed gap in the media landscape, providing a platform for pro-EU voices to be heard. I'm delighted to be able to continue contributing to the paper.\" The paper's editorial team has also been boosted by the news, with plans to expand its coverage of EU affairs and add new columnists to the mix. \"We're excited to see where the paper goes from here,\" said Jonathan Freedland, who has written regularly for the New European. \"The fact that it's been able to attract such a large and engaged readership is a testament to the appetite for pro-EU commentary in the UK.\" With its continued publication, the New European is likely to remain a thorn in the side of Brexiteers and a beacon of hope for those who believe in the benefits of EU membership.",

        "Text": "First it was Grexit, then it was Brexit. Now the looming threat for Europe is Quitaly, the fear that Italy might decide it has had enough of the single currency and go back to the lira. Put simply, Italy's economy is floundering and has been for the past two decades during which time there has been virtually no growth and Italian goods have become less and less competitive in export markets. Sluggish growth and high levels of unemployment are reflected in the high level of non-performing loans that are now hobbling Italian banks. Potential bad debts have almost doubled to €360bn (£300bn) in the past five years and now account for 18% of all outstanding loans. What is clear, though, is that the non-performing loans reflect a non-performing economy. They are the symptom of the problem and not its cause. Unlike Greece, Ireland or Spain, Italy did not go through a period of economic boom before the Great Recession of 2008-09. Instead, its performance has been unremittingly poor. The economy is 10% smaller than it was before the financial crisis and as a result unemployment is high, especially in the poorer southern half of the country. In the days before it joined the euro, Italy would have been able to make itself more competitive by devaluing the lira. That option is no longer available. The risk, therefore, is obvious. Europe suffers a fresh slowdown as a result of the shock imparted by Brexit. An already weak Italy suffers more than most and its banks start to fail. As the Italian economy continues to stagnate, the pressure on the government to take drastic action is mounting. The country's two main ruling parties, the Five Star Movement and the League, are already at odds over how to address the crisis. The Five Star Movement, which has strong anti-austerity credentials, is advocating for a package of stimulus measures to boost growth, while the League, which is more eurosceptic, is pushing for a more radical overhaul of the economy. Meanwhile, the European Union is urging Italy to implement structural reforms to improve its competitiveness and reduce its debt. The clock is ticking, and the fate of the eurozone hangs in the balance. If Italy were to leave the single currency, it could trigger a chain reaction of events that would have far-reaching consequences for the global economy.",

The phone app update, which is part of Google's efforts to separate core phone features from operating system updates, is available for the company's Nexus line of smartphones and Android One devices, including the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. The new spam-blocking feature is an extension of Google's caller ID system, which helps identify businesses not stored in your address book, and has been available for several years now. The phone app checks incoming call numbers against an updating database and flags those that appear to be from spammers with a big red banner. If a spam caller is identified, it gives the user an option to permanently block the number or whitelist those that are false positives. This isn't the first time that apps have been able to scan incoming calls and help users avoid answering spam calls, but it's the first time Google has integrated it into a default app on Android devices. Third-party apps such as Truecaller promise to perform similar duties and have been available on both Android and iOS for several years. This latest update marks a significant step forward in the fight against spam calls, which have become a growing concern for many smartphone users. The feature is particularly useful for individuals who receive frequent calls from unknown numbers, such as those who have opted into telemarketing lists. With the new spam-blocking feature, users can rest assured that they will be alerted to potential spam calls and have the option to take action to block or whitelist them. Google's move to integrate this feature into its default phone app is a welcome development, as it will help to streamline the process of managing spam calls and provide users with greater control over their phone experience. The company's efforts to improve caller ID functionality and block spam calls will likely be welcomed by Android users, who have long been plagued by unwanted calls and texts.",

In a report published on Monday, the Association of Residential Letting Agents (Arla) says last month's referendum vote has not rocked the rental market \"yet\", however, uncertainty over the future of Britain's role in Europe is making landlords jittery. One in nine agents told Arla they have experienced an immediate dip in rents following last month's Brexit result. Soaring rents, particularly in London and the south-east, have been partly pushed upwards by recent arrivals from abroad, as well as a lack of available properties to rent. David Cox, managing director of Arla said the rental market has so far responded to Brexit in a calm fashion but warned continued uncertainty could cause turbulence in the rental market over the coming months. \"What we need is some certainty from the new government that housing remains a priority with the rental market playing a central role. For example, we want to avoid a situation where institutional investors start pulling away from the market, because ultimately this will impact tenants by squeezing supply further and pushing up rents. Although we've seen some hesitation from landlords this is relatively mild and it's important they do not act in haste. Any inevitable longer term changes will then be taken on board with greater ease.\" The uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU has also led to a rise in inquiries from tenants looking to secure long-term tenancies, according to Arla's report. Many are seeking to avoid any potential rent increases or uncertainty in the future. In contrast, some landlords are taking a more cautious approach, opting to keep their properties vacant until the market stabilizes.\n\nArla's survey of 200 letting agents found that 45% of respondents reported a rise in nervous landlords, with 12% experiencing a drop in rent over the past 10 days. The report also highlighted a shortage of rental properties in certain areas, particularly in London and the south-east, which is driving up prices.\n\nIndustry experts warn that the rental market could become increasingly volatile if the uncertainty surrounding Brexit persists. \"The rental market is already feeling the effects of Brexit, and if the government doesn't take steps to provide clarity and stability, we could see a significant impact on the sector,\" said Tom Walker, a property expert at estate agent, Knight Frank.\n\nThe report's findings have sparked concerns among tenant advocacy groups, who fear that any rent increases or changes to the rental market could have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable households. \"The rental market is already highly unaffordable for many people, and any further increases in rent could push families into homelessness,\" said Sarah Jones, director of the homelessness charity, Shelter.",

There were 6,700 applications for new retail developments in 2015, down from 7,360, according to commercial law firm EMW. They are down by nearly a half from the pre-recession peak of 11,900 in 2008. The fall shows the continuing pressures on shopkeepers as consumers desert the high street in favour of online shopping with e-commerce companies. EMW said that despite traditional retailers increasingly focusing on and expanding their online services, many are often failing to compete effectively with online-only retailers, such as Asos and Boohoo. It said the recent failures of traditional retailers BHS, Austin Reed, and convenience store chain My Local were partly caused by the continued success of online-only brands. Retailers would face additional problems if the Brexit vote has an adverse effect on the UK economy, the firm added. The report also highlighted the impact of changing consumer behavior, with more people opting for the convenience of online shopping. \"The shift to online shopping is a major challenge for traditional retailers, and it's not just about price,\" said Emma Williams, a retail expert at EMW. \"Consumers are increasingly looking for a seamless experience, and many high street retailers are struggling to keep up.\" The firm warned that the decline in physical retail development could lead to a loss of community hubs and local employment opportunities. \"The high street is not just about shopping - it's about people meeting, socializing, and feeling connected to their community,\" Williams added. \"If we don't address this decline, we risk losing the very fabric of our towns and cities.\" The report's findings have sparked concerns among local authorities, who are struggling to find ways to revitalize their high streets. \"We need to think creatively about how we can support our local businesses and make our high streets more attractive to consumers,\" said Councillor Sarah Jones, chair of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board. \"This report highlights the need for urgent action to address the decline of our high streets.\"",

The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) also issued the accountancy firm with a severe reprimand. The fine was reduced from £3.5m after mitigation and a settlement discount. In addition, PwC has to pay £750,000 towards the FRC's costs. The FRC said the £3.5m original fine would have been the largest ever. In early 2015, Deloitte was fined £3m over its dealings with the collapsed carmaker MG Rover after that was reduced from a £14m penalty following an appeal. Simon Bradburn, PwC's then audit engagement partner, was fined £75,600, reduced from £120,000 as part of the settlement, and also received a severe reprimand. The penalties come nearly a year after Cattles settled a lawsuit with PwC that alleged the accountants acted negligently in its auditing of the Yorkshire firm during the financial crisis. Cattles, which almost went bankrupt over accounting irregularities, claimed that the loan book of Welcome was much weaker than stated in PwC's audit. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of creditors to Cattles, which lent to people with poor credit histories and entered into a financial restructuring scheme in 2011. The FRC said that PwC and Bradburn had admitted their \"conduct fell significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected of a member firm and a member\" in respect of the 2007 financial statements. The FRC investigation found that PwC's audit of Cattles' 2007 financial statements was inadequate, and that the firm failed to identify significant weaknesses in the company's accounting and risk management practices. The watchdog also criticized PwC for not adequately addressing concerns raised by the company's internal audit team.\n\nThe FRC's findings were particularly critical of Simon Bradburn, PwC's then-audit engagement partner, who was responsible for leading the audit team. The watchdog said that Bradburn had failed to exercise sufficient professional skepticism and had not adequately considered the risks associated with Cattles' business model.\n\nThe penalties imposed on PwC and Bradburn are significant, and are likely to be seen as a major setback for the accountancy firm. The fine is one of the largest ever imposed on an accountancy firm by the FRC, and the severe reprimand is a clear indication of the watchdog's disappointment with PwC's conduct.\n\nThe case is also significant because it highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the accountancy profession in the wake of the financial crisis. The crisis exposed significant weaknesses in the audit process, and has led to a number of high-profile failures and scandals. The FRC's investigation into PwC's auditing of Cattles is just the latest example of the profession's ongoing struggles to rebuild trust and restore confidence in the audit process.\n\nIn a statement, PwC said that it accepted the FRC's findings and acknowledged that its audit of Cattles had fallen short of the required standards. The firm said that it had taken steps to improve its audit processes and had implemented a number of changes in response to the FRC's criticisms.\n\nThe FRC's investigation into PwC's auditing of Cattles is likely to have significant implications for the accountancy profession as a whole. The watchdog's findings and penalties are likely to be closely watched by regulators and investors around the world, and could have a significant impact on the way that accountancy firms approach their auditing responsibilities in the future.",

Analysts at RBC have been looking as satellite communication specialist Inmarsat and run the rule over the business as a possible bid target. In a new note, RBC's Wilton Fry said: Given Inmarsat's lower share price (especially in US dollar terms), rapid evolution of the industry's competitive landscape, and historical precedents (e.g., Sky Terra approach in 2009), we believe it is appropriate to consider potential M&A activity. In this note we assess whether there is any rationale for Echostar, or Dish, to approach Inmarsat. Echostar and its sister company Dish Network have recently raised financing and Echostar now has around $3bn in cash on its balance sheet. This money is most likely to be used to fund new satellites at Echostar. However, there is a possibility, in our view, that Echostar or Dish may consider approaching Inmarsat given the compelling strategic and operational logic of a combination; as such, we believe this is a valid topic for investor debate. A bid for Inmarsat could help solve the jigsaw puzzle: We see a number of interlocking situations: (a) Dish has a lot of US spectrum but needs terrestrial deployment; (b) Echostar and Inmarsat both own European S band that could be used for mobile; (c) Mobile needs spectrum given data growth; (d) Deutsche Telekom is involved with Inmarsat's S-band project and owns T Mobile USA; (e) Inmarsat is global but needs needs more Ka-band; and (f) Echostar has Ka-band but wants to expand globally... We think combining a regional/deep operator like Echostar with a global/ shallow operator like Inmarsat would fulfill Echostar's global aspirations and help Inmarsat's need to add capacity in dense areas. We also think it could protect Echostar's Hughes business, enhance in-flight opportunities, and confront ViaSat's aspirations whilst simultaneously yielding substantial operational savings from combined satellite control functions. Despite Inmarsat's larger size ($5.0bn versus $3.6bn) and rating (around 10 times versus 5 times 2017 estimated EBITDA), Echostar has plenty of cash ($3bn) and lower leverage. which could be used to fund a bid. Furthermore, Echostar's recent investment in the European S-band spectrum, combined with Inmarsat's existing assets, would create a strong player in the region. A potential deal could also help Inmarsat expand its Ka-band capacity, while Echostar would gain access to Inmarsat's global network. Additionally, the combined entity could offer a more comprehensive suite of services to its customers, including in-flight connectivity and enterprise solutions. While there are certainly risks and challenges associated with a potential deal, we believe the strategic and operational logic of a combination is compelling, and it's worth exploring the possibility further. We maintain our outperform rating on Inmarsat and will be monitoring developments closely.",

It's a contemporary twist on riddle that has been around since medieval times, and may be of use to revellers out partying today. Three friends set off to carnival with a jerry can containing 1.2litres of rum punch. On arrival they decide to go to three separate sound systems. So they must divide the booze equally between themselves. They have brought two large bottles for this purpose. But then they discover that these bottles have no measurements on them. One of the friends spots an empty 50cl can of Red Stripe and an empty 15cl vial of something marked 'rave juice' on the ground. There's a water tap on hand to clean the can and the vial. The friends are able to divide the punch into three equal portions by pouring between the jerry can, the two bottles, the beer can and the vial. How do they do it? Remember that the only measurements they have are for a full can and a full vial, but they also know there is 1.2litres of rum punch in the jerry can to start with. Assume that when you pour from one vessel to another no liquid is spilled. I'll be back at 5pm with the answer. As the friends ponder the puzzle, they notice that the 50cl can of Red Stripe is roughly half the size of the jerry can. They decide to use this as a makeshift measuring device to split the rum punch into three equal portions. They pour 0.6litres of rum punch from the jerry can into one of the large bottles, leaving 0.6litres remaining in the can. Next, they pour 0.2litres from the jerry can into the 50cl can, leaving 0.4litres remaining. They then use the 50cl can as a measuring device to split the remaining 0.4litres into two equal portions, pouring 0.2litres into each of the large bottles.\n\nThe friends are left with an empty jerry can and two bottles, each containing 0.2litres of rum punch. To fill the last bottle, they use the 15cl vial as a measuring device. They pour 15cl of rum punch from one of the bottles into the vial, then add the same amount to the other bottle. This leaves 0.05litres remaining in the first bottle, which they then pour into the last bottle. Voila! The friends have successfully divided the rum punch into three equal portions using only the given vessels and no additional measuring tools. Stay tuned for more puzzles and brain teasers!",

Those who believe 11-year-olds are inherently of two types, academic sheep and practical goats, should consider some real-life examples. Is the child who excels at maths but finds it hard to string two sentences together a sheep or a goat? What about the one who likes reading and writing but loves drawing and making things? Or the talented refugee who performs poorly in the 11-plus because she's not yet fluent in English? Is the child who falls just below the dividing line in test results because he's missed weeks of schooling through homelessness really a goat? Is the one who scrapes through because of private tuition really a sheep? The whole idea is a nonsense, as is the idea that two types of school are needed to provide sheep-education and goat-education. Janet Dobson London • I was delighted to read the letter from Michael Liversidge (24 August) in which he outlined his academic successes despite his poor performance at O-level. I was a pupil at the same school, which at the time held direct grant status and at which my father, Don, was one of Michael's history tutors. Shortly before our O-levels I recall overhearing Don referring to a number of my contemporaries as \"nice lads but not very bright\". One of them, Chris Penny, went on to work at GCHQ where, so he said, he was just a cleaner, although the attendance at his funeral last year suggests a more significant role. Another, Matthew Harding, left to become a tea-boy in a finance house: he ended up owning that business and also Chelsea football club. These stories highlight the absurdity of categorizing children as either \"clever\" or \"not clever\" at a young age. The idea that a child's academic abilities can be reduced to a single test score is a gross oversimplification. It ignores the complex interplay of factors that influence a child's education, including their background, experiences, and personal strengths.\n\nMoreover, the notion that certain children are destined for a life of drudgery because of their academic abilities is not only patronizing but also damaging. It perpetuates a culture of low expectations and undermines the potential of children who may not fit the mold of traditional academic success.\n\nIt is time to abandon this outdated and unscientific approach to education and focus on providing a comprehensive and inclusive education that recognizes the unique strengths and abilities of every child. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and just society where every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential.",

We've tried to reassure him that it's normal to feel nervous, but he's convinced that he's just not cut out for interviews. As a result, he's stuck in a cycle of unemployment and short-term contracts, which is not only frustrating for him but also for us as parents. We're worried about his future and want to help him overcome his phobia, but we're not sure where to start. We've considered seeking professional help, such as a therapist or career coach, but we're not sure if that would make a difference. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation with their child? How did you help them overcome their fears and get back on track? We're desperate for any advice or guidance.",

        "Text": "The drop in sterling since the EU referendum has been a boon to Jimmy Choo, which is pushing ahead with store openings around the world. As the luxury shoe and bag retailer celebrates its 20th anniversary, Peter Harf, the chairman, said Jimmy Choo's prospects had \"never looked better\". The company reported revenue growth of 9.2% for the first six months of the year, or 3.8% at constant currencies, and a 42.6% increase in operating profits to £25.3m. The second half had started well, the retailer said, with a positive benefit from a weaker pound. Jimmy Choo has 147 stores worldwide, including 10 in the UK, and is opening about 10 stores a year. It said only 9.5% of revenues were generated in sterling, while 28% of operating costs were denominated in sterling, \"hence a weaker pound will lead to a reported upside in business performance at a revenue and profit level\". While Jimmy Choo is known for its killer heels, made famous by the Sex and the City character Carrie Bradshaw, men's footwear, including its Grove loafers, has become the retailer's fastest-growing category. It now accounts for 8% of revenues, which is expected to rise \"well into double digits\". The company has 71 joint men's and women's stores globally. The retailer continues to expand in China, where its presence lags behind rivals, and enjoyed strong like-for-like growth in the first half of the year, while also recording growth in Hong Kong. Revenues rose by 22% in Japan. The company's focus on Asia is expected to continue, with plans to open several new stores in China and Hong Kong in the coming months. Jimmy Choo is also exploring opportunities in Southeast Asia, where it sees significant potential for growth. In addition to its physical stores, Jimmy Choo is investing in e-commerce, with online sales growing by 15% in the first half of the year. The company is confident that its strong brand recognition and high-quality products will continue to drive its success, even as the global retail landscape evolves. With its 20th anniversary celebrations underway, Jimmy Choo is poised for a bright future, with a growing presence in Asia and a strong online presence to complement its physical stores.",

Car production rose by 7.6% to 126,566 units last month, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. So far in 2016, output is up by 12.3% to 1,023,723. This is the first time since 2004 that the 1m milestone has been reached in July and comes despite the Brexit vote in June. Production for the UK market increased by 14.1% last month, while exports rose by 6%. Almost 80% of cars manufactured this year, more than 750,000, were destined for overseas markets. The EU is the biggest export market for cars made in the UK. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said: \"UK car production in 2016 is booming, with new British-built models in demand across the world.\" \"This surge in demand is a testament to the competitiveness and quality of British-made cars, and we're seeing a strong rebound from the decline in production in 2015,\" Hawes added. The UK's car manufacturing industry has been on a steady recovery since the financial crisis, and the latest figures suggest that this trend is set to continue. The SMMT predicts that the industry will continue to grow, driven by new model launches and increasing demand from emerging markets. The industry is also investing heavily in new technologies, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, which are expected to drive growth in the coming years. With the industry looking strong, the outlook for the UK's automotive sector is bright, despite the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote.",

        "Text": "It is still early days, but the UK economy should avoid the immediate post-Brexit vote recession many forecasters had predicted. That was the main message of the economic data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which included the first piece of hard evidence of how the UK performed after the 23 June vote to leave the EU. The ONS said the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the UK economy, expanded by 0.4% in July, a month in which surveys showed business and consumer confidence crashing and the financial markets in turmoil. In the circumstances, that's a pretty impressive performance and analysts are already revising up their forecasts for growth in the third quarter. On the basis of still limited evidence, they are penciling in 0.4-0.5%. Hopes of avoiding a recession were also strengthened by the upward revision to growth in the second quarter, from 0.6% to 0.7%. The economy had plenty of momentum before the Brexit vote, and while it is likely to slow in the second half of 2016 there will not be the necessary two consecutive quarters of falling output to fulfil the technical definition of a recession. Much less welcome for the government was the news that Britain's balance of payments deficit, which stood at an alarming 5.7% of GDP in the first three months of 2016, widened in the second quarter. A deterioration in the UK's trade performance was largely responsible for the country diving deeper into the red, with the scale of the deficit highlighting the unbalanced nature of the economy. Put simply, domestic producers are unable to keep up with consumer demand. The fall in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote will make exports a bit more competitive and will check consumer spending by making imports dearer. But turning round the balance of payments is a huge challenge, and would have been even had the vote in the referendum gone the other way. In terms of policy, the post-Brexit resilience will make the Bank of England think twice before cutting interest rates again in November from the already record low of 0.25%. Threadneedle Street may want to keep its powder dry for later, leaving the field clear for the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Stimulus in the autumn statement still looks probable despite the upbeat growth news. The chancellor's autumn statement, due in November, is still expected to contain measures to boost the economy, possibly including infrastructure spending and tax cuts. The ONS data has also boosted hopes that the Bank of England will maintain its current stance on interest rates, rather than cutting them further. This would help to keep borrowing costs low and support the economy's growth momentum. While the UK's balance of payments deficit remains a significant concern, the government is likely to focus on measures to boost exports and increase investment in key sectors, such as manufacturing and technology. The ONS data has provided a welcome surprise, but the government will still need to address the underlying structural issues that have been weighing on the economy for some time. With the economy expected to slow in the second half of the year, policymakers will need to act swiftly to prevent a slowdown from turning into a full-blown recession.",

The talking animatronic toy has been given a hi-tech makeover, swapping cassette tapes and plastic eyes for a 4GB hard drive and animated LCD peepers. Teddy has been resurrected by Wicked Cool Toys, which earlier this year also launched a revamped Cabbage Patch Kid doll. An early prototype of Teddy was showcased at the Dallas Toy Fair this week, although it's not scheduled to launch until 2017. \"The bear had to come out of the bag,\" said Wicked Cool Toys co-president Jeremy Padawer, speaking to YouTube's Mommy and Gracie Show. \"We've shown Teddy a little early.\" The company wants to capitalize on the nostalgia of the first generation of Ruxpin fans, which it dubs The Teddy Generation, who have now grown up and become parents. Teddy Ruxpin was first launched in 1985 and was an instant hit, racking up $93m in sales (1.4m units) in the first year. It eventually sold more than 8m units and 11m books, becoming one of the best-selling toys of the 1980s, along with Polly Pocket, Glo Worm, Pound Puppies and Glo Worm. The bear came with a slot for cassette tapes, which it would \"read\" to children while moving its eyes and mouth. The toy's creator Ken Forsse also wrote an accompanying Tolkien-esque fantasy world, following Teddy and his best friend, a caterpillar named Grubby, as they battled monsters and villains in the quest to find magic crystals. These stories were featured in the toy's accompanying story tapes as well as a 65-episode TV cartoon series. In 2003 Teddy Ruxpin was named by the Toy Industry Association as one of the most memorable and creative toys of the 20th century, and Time magazine later named it as one of the greatest toys of all time. The new Teddy Ruxpin is designed to appeal to both old and new fans of the beloved toy. The updated bear features a 4GB hard drive that can store hundreds of hours of audio content, including the original story tapes and new material. The animated LCD eyes will allow Teddy to move its gaze and blink in a more lifelike way, while the bear's mouth will still move in sync with the audio.\n\nAccording to Wicked Cool Toys, the new Teddy Ruxpin will be compatible with both iOS and Android devices, allowing kids to interact with the toy using a mobile app. The app will also allow parents to customize the content and create their own stories for Teddy to tell.\n\nThe company has also announced plans to release a range of accessories and add-ons for the new Teddy Ruxpin, including a carrying case, a sleep mode feature that allows kids to fall asleep to Teddy's soothing voice, and a \"friend\" accessory that allows kids to add their own custom characters to the toy's world.\n\nWicked Cool Toys is confident that the new Teddy Ruxpin will be a hit with both old and new fans of the toy. \"We're excited to bring back this beloved character and give it a fresh new look and feel for a new generation of kids,\" said Padawer. \"We think the nostalgia factor will be huge, but we're also confident that the new Teddy Ruxpin will appeal to kids who have never seen the toy before.\"\n\nThe new Teddy Ruxpin is set to launch in 2017, with a price point expected to be around $100. With its updated technology and range of features, it's likely to be a top seller in the toy industry next year. For kids who grew up with the original Teddy Ruxpin, the chance to relive their childhood memories with a modern twist is sure to be a big draw. And for new fans of the toy, the opportunity to experience the magic of Teddy Ruxpin for the first time is sure to be a thrilling one.",

Underlying profits fell 46% from £9.2m 12 months ago to £5m in the six months to the end of July – excluding interest payments, tax, write downs on the value of property, and a one-off fall in income of nearly £4m related to a new credit card agreement. Profits were hit by the increased cost of delivering goods ordered online and a decline in sales of House of Fraser's own brands. Total sales remained steady at £573.5m as the group's established department stores experienced a 2.5% slump. Underlying sales, including a 17.8% rise in online sales, lifted 0.9%. Nigel Oddy, chief executive of the group, which was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in April 2014, said House of Fraser had experienced an \"extremely volatile trading environment\". The profit slump comes after fellow department stores John Lewis and Next both revealed a fall in first-half profits as they were hit by the need to discount to clear summer stock. Oddy said: \"We would never use the weather as an excuse but we had record temperatures in September when we were selling autumn product and cold temperatures in June when we were trying to sell summer. When we have a warm day [in the autumn], sales drop off a cliff. Far more than ever before shoppers are buying now to wear now.\" He said that shoppers had also been affected by uncertainty around the EU referendum since January this year, and consumer confidence continued to be affected by concern about what Brexit might mean for household finances. \"All of that goes into the pot and make a very volatile market and low consumer confidence,\" Oddy said. Despite the challenging conditions, House of Fraser is focusing on its digital transformation and has invested £5m in its e-commerce platform to improve the online shopping experience for customers.

House of Fraser has already partnered with several brands to launch concessions in its stores, and Oddy said that the company is open to further partnerships and collaborations to drive growth.\n\nDespite the challenges, House of Fraser remains confident in its ability to adapt to the changing retail landscape and is focused on delivering a strong second half of the year. The company has a solid financial position and a strong brand portfolio, and Oddy believes that it is well-placed to capitalize on any opportunities that arise in the coming months.",

In a trading update, Thomas Cook said summer bookings excluding Turkey rose 4% but that a 40% drop in trips to Turkey caused total bookings to fall. Bookings fell heavily in continental Europe, where German tourists shunned Turkey, but rose 1% in the UK. Thomas Cook has been hit hard since summer 2015 by terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Egypt and Turkey. It offered customers with bookings to Turkey free cancellation after a failed military coup in July. Bookings from Belgium also fell following the terrorist attacks on Brussels in March. The company warned later in July that it had slumped to a quarterly loss and would miss its annual profit target. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's chief executive, has said the travel industry is suffering the greatest turmoil he can recall in his 30 years in the business as terrorist attacks and other incidents knock confidence. Thomas Cook shares rose 4% to 73p as the group stuck by reduced guidance for an operating profit of £300m for the year ending on 30 September – down from £310m a year earlier. Group bookings were in line with expectations as customers switched from Turkey to the Balearic and Canary islands, the US and other destinations such as Bulgaria and Cuba. Fankhauser said: \"The summer season has progressed largely as expected. Despite the challenging summer, Thomas Cook remains confident in its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The company has implemented various cost-saving measures, including a restructuring of its Turkish operations, to mitigate the impact of the decline in demand. Thomas Cook is also investing in its digital platform to improve the customer experience and increase online bookings. The company's focus on sustainable tourism and its commitment to providing high-quality holidays are expected to continue to drive growth in the long term. In the short term, Thomas Cook is looking to the upcoming winter season, which is traditionally a busy period for the travel industry. The company is optimistic that it can capitalize on the increasing popularity of winter sun destinations, such as the Canary Islands and Cape Verde. With a strong balance sheet and a robust business model, Thomas Cook is well-positioned to navigate the current market challenges and emerge stronger in the future.",

He told me that at the end of the formal part of the contest, they had an informal bit where the teams set each other original puzzles and he asked if I could come up with something. The above question was the result. As I sat there, pondering the cleverness of Bill's puzzles, I couldn't help but think about the art of puzzle-making itself. What drives someone to create these intricate and often obscure challenges? Is it a desire to test one's own intellectual prowess, or to confound and delight others?\n\nBill, it seemed, was a master of both.

I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets lay hidden in his mind, waiting to be unleashed on the world.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the solutions, I began to notice a pattern. Each puzzle, no matter how seemingly unrelated, required a unique blend of logic, creativity, and attention to detail.

Who knew what other puzzles lay in store for me, and what secrets Bill was hiding up his sleeve?

Simpson, who has spent five decades at the the corporation including his current role of world affairs editor, told the Guardian: \"The BBC, like the NHS, should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups which don't have an axe to grind.\" He added that both sides of the House of Commons were prone to attack the BBC simply because it didn't \"toe the party line\". Simpson reserved his greatest opprobrium for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, both for their involvement in the Hutton affair and their dealings with Rupert Murdoch. \"Here is the British prime minister cosying up to a man who has got no interest in Britain, who is deeply opposed to Britain and Britain's interest, and is against the main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. He said he believed most governments in his 50 years working at the BBC have a \"disgraceful political obsession that somehow or other the BBC has to be cut down to size\". \"I don't mean to say that cuts can't be made but it's the savagery with which it's done. The ideological delight with which it's done.\" He added: \"I just feel that it's absolutely disgraceful, keeping the BBC as short of cash as the government has since 2010.\" The insistence in a draft BBC charter unveiled earlier this month that the corporation reveal the pay of those staff earning more than £150,000 was simply the government \"looking for a way to demonstrate their control and domination\", he said in an interview three days after coming out of hospital having suffered kidney failure caused by a reaction to eating kedgeree. Simpson, who is to start filming a Panorama special on the past half century of foreign affairs for broadcast at the end of this year, was also critical of the corporation's management. \"The key thing that has to be addressed is that people aren't happy at the BBC,\" he said. \"It's fine for me and people like me, I get well treated. Simpson believes that the root of the problem lies in the BBC's management structure, which he claims is too focused on pleasing government officials rather than serving the public interest. \"The BBC is run by a bunch of accountants and lawyers who don't have a clue about broadcasting,\" he said. \"They're more concerned with pleasing the politicians than with making good programs.\"\n\nHe also criticized the corporation's recent decision to cut its foreign correspondent team, which he believes will have a negative impact on the quality of its reporting. \"The BBC used to be the best in the world, but now it's just a shadow of its former self,\" he said. \"We're losing our best journalists, and the ones who are left are being forced to work in a culture of fear and intimidation.\"\n\nDespite his criticisms, Simpson remains proud of his time at the BBC and believes that it is still capable of producing high-quality journalism. \"The BBC is a great institution, and I'm proud to have been a part of it,\" he said. \"But it needs to be protected from the political interference that is threatening its very existence.\"",

The prime minister said she would support the Canadian if he decided to put back his departure date from Threadneedle Street until 2021 and praised his efforts to steer the UK economy through the post-Brexit vote period. May's spokeswoman said: \"The PM has been clear in her support for the governor, the work he is doing for the country. It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years.\" May and Carney were scheduled to have a meeting later on Monday, but the warm tone adopted by the prime minister's spokeswoman immediately prompted rumours that the governor could be about to announce his future plans. \"The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that,\" the spokeswoman said. Asked if May considered Carney to be the best man for the job, the spokeswoman said: \"Absolutely.\" Carney has said he will make a decision before the end of the year, but concluded that he needs to put the matter to rest before then. His next public appearance will be at a press conference on Thursday to mark the publication of the Bank's first quarterly inflation report since it cut interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in August. May fuelled speculation of a rift between Downing Street and the Bank when she used her speech at the Conservative party conference to criticise the side-effects of ultra-low interest rates and money creation under the quantitative easing programme. Carney's decision to stay on at the helm of the Bank of England has been met with mixed reactions from economists and financial experts. Some have praised his leadership during the post-Brexit vote period, citing his swift response to the UK's decision to leave the EU by cutting interest rates and implementing a series of monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy. Others have criticized his decision to extend his tenure, arguing that it would give him too much power and influence over the country's economic policy.\n\nDespite the controversy, May's support for Carney is seen as a significant boost to his chances of staying on at the Bank. Her backing is likely to give him the confidence to make a decision that he believes is in the best interests of the country, rather than bowing to pressure from external forces.\n\nThe Bank's quarterly inflation report, to be published on Thursday, is expected to provide further insight into Carney's thinking on the economy and his plans for the future. Many economists are keen to see how he will address the challenges posed by the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the impact of a no-deal scenario on the UK's economic prospects.\n\nWith Carney's future plans still uncertain, the Bank of England's leadership is likely to remain a hot topic of discussion in the coming weeks. May's support for the governor has added an extra layer of complexity to the situation, and it remains to be seen how Carney will respond to the prime minister's backing.",

The first chime was a C-major chord, but was changed to the F-sharp chord starting in 1998 with the first iMac. While you've been able to mute the startup chime if the computer was muted before switching off, the often loud and obnoxious sound has been more embarrassing than helpful to most Mac laptop users. The silence is expected to be a welcome change for many users who have grown tired of the chime's loud and sudden interruption, often startling those around them. The move is also seen as a nod to the growing trend of silent booting in other devices, such as smartphones and tablets. Apple's decision to ditch the chime comes as the company continues to refine its MacBook Pro lineup, which has seen significant updates in recent years, including the addition of USB-C ports and improved processors. The new MacBook Pros are expected to hit shelves later this month, with prices starting at $1,299.",

        "Text": "I ordered and paid in full for a mixed case of beer from Beer Hawk online. It promised three-day delivery, but I still didn't have my beers 10 days later, and the order tracker showed that my case had not even left the warehouse. Replies from Beer Hawk are sporadic, but occasionally it responds to emails and promises that the beers will be sent out imminently, but they never are. Looking at the most recent posts on Reviews.co.uk, there are a lot of other dissatisfied customers. I've also seen quite a lot of negative feedback on its Facebook page, but it gets deleted after a day or so. If only it were as quick dispatching the beer as it is deleting critical comments! When I check the status of my order it remains \"pending\". I have been an occasional Beer Hawk customer and was thinking about ordering more regularly, but I feel so let down by the poor service, I think, with regret, I will have to go elsewhere. ML, Winchester, Hants Beer Hawk is a specialist beer retailer that claims it \"hunts out\" the world's best beer from a range of more than 500 – but a quick internet search confirms that customers have had difficulties with delivery and customer service. When we got in touch, someone answered the phone promptly and noted your details, which led to co-founder and director Chris France contacting us. He explained that the company has just moved premises and has also been upgrading its warehouse management system, which led to a small number of orders – including yours – being delayed for six days beyond normal lead times. But France admits it failed to respond quickly enough to your emails and also failed its own 24-hour response target. France apologized for the inconvenience and assured us that they are taking steps to improve their communication with customers. He explained that they have hired additional staff to help manage the increased workload and are working to implement a new customer service system. France also offered to send a complimentary case of beer to make up for the delay, which we appreciate.\n\nHowever, it's not just ML who has experienced issues with Beer Hawk's service. A quick scan of online reviews reveals a pattern of complaints about delayed deliveries and poor communication. One customer, who ordered a beer subscription service, reported waiting three weeks for their first delivery, only to receive an email saying that the order had been cancelled due to \"unforeseen circumstances\". Another customer was left without a refund or explanation after their order was cancelled due to a \"technical issue\".\n\nDespite these issues, Beer Hawk's co-founder is confident that the company can turn things around. \"We've had a lot of growing pains, but we're committed to getting it right,\" France said. \"We're investing in our infrastructure and our team to make sure that our customers receive the level of service they deserve.\" Only time will tell if Beer Hawk can live up to its promise of being a world-class beer retailer. For now, customers will have to wait and see if the company can deliver on its promises.",

        "Text": "Ministers must act to end mobile signal \"not spots\" that mean some overseas visitors have better phone reception than people using UK networks, a cross-party group of almost 90 MPs said on Friday. The British Infrastructure Group (BIG), led by former Conservative chairman and minister Grant Shapps, said the time for excuses from the mobile network providers was over. In a report, the MPs said it was \"unacceptable that areas in Britain continue to have such poor mobile connectivity, and that overseas visitors can expect better mobile coverage than Britons stuck with a single provider\". They wrote: \"The time for excuses from the mobile sector is over. The government must make a better call for Britain and bring national mobile coverage policy into the 21st century.\" They said many overseas visitors had better coverage because their networks allowed national roaming. The group proposed an amendment to the government's digital economy bill to allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that did not meet the targets of a 2014 agreement. That deal gave the four large network operators (MNOs) another chance to fix mobile \"not spots\" after they said they would pump £5bn into improving coverage across the UK by December 2017 in return for the government not pursuing a system of national roaming. The MPs are urging the government to take a stronger stance on ensuring mobile connectivity across the country, particularly in rural areas where coverage is often patchy. They argue that the current situation is unacceptable and that it's unfair that visitors to the UK can expect better mobile coverage than British citizens.\n\nThe report highlights that many countries, including the US, Australia, and Japan, have implemented national roaming agreements to ensure that their citizens have reliable mobile coverage, regardless of their location. The MPs believe that the UK should follow suit and implement a similar system to bring an end to the \"not spots\" that plague many rural areas.\n\nThe proposed amendment to the digital economy bill would give Ofcom the power to fine mobile operators that fail to meet the targets set out in the 2014 agreement. The MPs believe that this would provide a much-needed incentive for the mobile operators to improve coverage and would ultimately benefit consumers.\n\nThe report also highlights the economic benefits of improving mobile coverage, citing studies that suggest that for every 10% increase in mobile coverage, there is a corresponding 1.5% increase in economic growth. The MPs argue that improving mobile coverage would not only benefit consumers but also the wider economy.\n\nThe British Infrastructure Group is calling on the government to take immediate action to address the issue of mobile \"not spots\" and to work with the mobile operators to implement a national roaming agreement. They believe that this would be a major step forward in ensuring that the UK has a mobile network that is fit for the 21st century.",

The gathered European Union data protection authorities, collectively known as the Article 29 Working Party, said they had serious concerns over WhatsApp's recent privacy policy change and the sharing of user phone numbers with its parent company Facebook. Article 29 said that it had \"requested WhatsApp to communicate all relevant information to the Working Party as soon as possible and urged the company to pause the sharing of users' data until the appropriate legal protections could be assured\" in a letter sent to the messaging service. A WhatsApp spokesperson said: \"We've had constructive conversations, including before our update, and we remain committed to respecting applicable law.\" The data protection authorities also wrote to Yahoo over its massive data breach that exposed the email credentials of 500 million users in 2014, as well as its scanning of customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials. Article 29 requested information on all aspects of the data breach, that Yahoo must notify users its \"adverse effects\" and commanded it to cooperate with all \"upcoming national data protection authorities' enquiries and/or investigations\". The letter also expressed concerns over Yahoo's failure to notify users of the data breach in a timely manner, as well as its cooperation with US intelligence agencies in scanning customer emails. Article 29 demanded that Yahoo provide detailed information on the scope and impact of the breach, as well as its plans to prevent similar incidents in the future. The watchdogs also called for Yahoo to inform users of the potential adverse effects of the breach and to cooperate fully with any ongoing or future investigations by national data protection authorities. In a statement, a Yahoo spokesperson said the company takes the privacy and security of its users' data seriously and is committed to transparency and cooperation with authorities. The company is still reeling from the fallout of the massive data breach, which was revealed in 2016 and is considered one of the largest in history. The breach has led to numerous lawsuits and regulatory investigations, and has damaged the company's reputation and credibility. The actions taken by Article 29 are the latest in a series of efforts to hold Yahoo accountable for its handling of user data.",

        "Text": "Google's parent Alphabet defied expectations to report a 20.2% rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, while retail giant Amazon slightly missed predicted predicted forecasts due to spending on preparations for the holiday season. Indicating an end to its record-breaking profits streak, Amazon reported profit of $252m or 52 cents per share, though analysts had predicted 85 cents per share. Revenues reached $32.71bn but are predicted to reach between $42bn and $45.5bn for the busy fourth quarter. Alphabet meanwhile continues to dominate the fast-growing mobile advertising market, along with Facebook. The company has benefited from robust sales of advertising on mobile devices and on YouTube, and also said it would repurchase about $7bn of its Class C stock. Shares of Alphabet, which is the world's second largest company by market value, were up 1.6% in after-hours trading. Google's ad revenue rose 18.1% to $19.82bn in the third quarter, accounting for 89.1% of Google's total revenue, compared with 89.8% of revenue in the second quarter. Paid clicks rose 33%, compared with a rise of 29% in the second quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Cost-per-click, or the average amount advertisers pay Google, fell 11% in the latest period after dropping 7% in the second quarter. Analysts on average had expected a decline of 7.9%, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Per-click costs have been falling as people shift to mobile devices from desktops. Because of the limited space, advertising on mobile devices is generally cheaper. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $52.88bn in search ad revenue in 2016, or 56.9% of the global market. Google's Other Revenue, which includes the company's increasingly important cloud business, jumped 38.8% after rising 33% in the second quarter. The cloud business competes with services offered by market-leader Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. Alphabet's Other Bets generated revenue of $197m, but reported an operating loss of $865m. The strong quarterly results from Alphabet and Amazon have sparked optimism about the prospects of the technology sector, despite some concerns about the impact of the ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty. The tech giants' ability to navigate these challenges and continue to grow their revenue and profits has been a key factor in their success. Alphabet's dominance in the mobile advertising market, in particular, has been a major driver of its growth, and its ability to adapt to changing consumer behavior and technological trends has been impressive. Meanwhile, Amazon's focus on expanding its e-commerce and cloud computing capabilities has positioned it well for long-term growth. As the holiday season approaches, investors will be closely watching the companies' performance to see if they can maintain their momentum.",

The RBoS Shareholder Action Group, which represents 27,000 retail investors, issued its warning after a report that other shareholders were considering settling out of court. The group, one of at least three bringing claims related to the rights issue in 2008, said: \"We look forward to seeing Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March.\" The group said it was the only one suing Goodwin, who was chief executive of RBS at the time of its £45bn taxpayer bailout, and three of the bank's former executives. The legal action is said to be \"on behalf of thousands of investors, both private and institutional, who lost money by subscribing for shares during the 2008 RBS rights issue\". The announcement was made ahead of RBS's third-quarter results, which will be scrutinised for any further provisions relating to the case. In August, RBS set aside £700m for the case after an attempt at mediation talks in July failed to reach a settlement. The total claim by all the investors involved comes to £4bn. The court action by disgruntled investors is one of many factors that could feature in the bank's results on Friday, when it is expected to pile up more losses on top of £52bn already incurred since the bailout. The news comes as RBS is already facing significant challenges, including a struggling retail business and a major restructuring effort. The bank has been trying to sell off its Williams & Glyn business and has also been hit by a series of scandals, including the mis-selling of insurance products and the manipulation of foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe RBoS Shareholder Action Group is seeking damages for investors who lost money when they subscribed to the bank's rights issue in 2008. The group claims that the bank failed to provide adequate information to investors about the true state of the bank's finances at the time, and that the rights issue was overly aggressive and designed to benefit existing shareholders rather than new investors.\n\nThe case is being closely watched by investors and analysts, who are waiting to see how RBS's results will be affected by the ongoing legal action. The bank's shares have already fallen sharply in recent months, and the prospect of further losses and provisions could weigh on the stock in the coming days.\n\nRBS has declined to comment on the matter, but the bank is expected to provide more details on its plans to address the claims when it reports its third-quarter results on Friday. The bank's investors will be closely watching the announcement, which could have significant implications for the bank's future direction and profitability.",

        "Text": "Banks and financial services companies have racked up more than £40bn in costs to handle the payment protection insurance scandal. The costliest mis-selling bill in UK financial services history became even more expensive on Thursday after Barclays set aside a further £600m to handle the cost of claims. Data compiled by the thinkthank New City Agenda shows that this top up for Barclays has pushed the total provisions incurred by the industry to £40.2bn. Lloyds Banking Group makes up £17bn of that total. The size of the payouts have already been cited as a reason for booming car sales and holidays. As one penny off income tax costs about £4bn, it could be regarded as a boost to household income. Not all the money has gone straight into consumers' pockets. The latest data from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that from January 2011 – when claims started to be made – until the end of July about £25bn had been distributed by the banks and other firms which sold PPI. Claims management companies have, according to the National Audit Office, received up to £5bn of the payouts. The banks have also incurred billions of pounds of costs in handling the claims. The £40.2bn provision has also led to a significant increase in the number of staff employed by banks to handle the claims, with many having to hire additional personnel to deal with the influx of complaints. This has added to the overall cost, as banks have had to absorb the salaries and benefits of these new employees. Furthermore, the scandal has also led to a surge in legal fees, as claimants and banks have engaged in lengthy and complex legal battles. As a result, the total cost of the PPI scandal is likely to continue to rise, with many experts predicting that it could reach £50bn or more by the time it is fully resolved.",

So the following day's front, \"Pete Burns: How I came back from the dead\", was baffling. Had the previous report been wrong after all? Was he alive? Had a miracle occurred? Evidently not. According to the story, the singer had \"let slip a haunting secret shortly before his fatal heart attack\": he had previously been thought to have died. A priest had been summoned to read him the last rites. The article goes on to explain that Pete Burns, the lead singer of the 1980s new wave band Dead or Alive, had been misdiagnosed and had actually died twice. The second time, his heart had stopped beating for 15 minutes before being revived. Burns' widow, Lynne, revealed that her husband had been in a coma for several days before finally succumbing to his illness. The Daily Star's decision to run a front-page story claiming Burns had died of a heart attack only to retract it the next day has sparked widespread criticism, with many accusing the newspaper of sensationalism and poor reporting.

Why, asked an emailer, should we care what happens in Argentina? Leaving aside the chauvinistic rudeness, by recording what is happening in media elsewhere we are better able to perceive what the Herald rightly calls \"a worldwide phenomenon\". The central point to be learned from the Herald's leading article on Wednesday, is universal: journalism is in crisis. In registering its \"unspeakable sadness\" at giving up daily publication, the paper said it had been \"facing difficulties for a while now\". It spoke of the \"dramatic change\", which \"reflects a media industry in crisis\", and acknowledged that people now prefer to access news for free on digital platforms rather than by reading newsprint. Then it touched on the likely result: \"as many as 2,000 journalists may lose their jobs in the country in 2016, a staggering number which will damage the profession greatly\". The Herald is no exception because it is shedding most of its staff due to the change to a weekly. \"The overwhelming majority of our colleagues were told that they would be losing their jobs\", said the editorial, which revealed that 14 \"are leaving us today\". The 140-year-old title, majority-owned by the Indalo Group, also mentioned \"our most illustrious period during the military dictatorship\". That was a reference to the paper's defiance of the brutal regime in the 1976-83 period by reporting on its abductions of people who came to be known as \"the disappeared\". The Herald's editor at the time, Robert Cox, was forced into exile because of threats and intimidation. His heroism was finally recognised in 2010 when he received honorary citizenship. The Herald's editorial also reflected on the impact of the crisis on the newspaper's own history and legacy. It noted that the paper had been a beacon of freedom of speech and a champion of democracy during Argentina's turbulent past. The editorial concluded by expressing its gratitude to its readers and employees, and by vowing to continue to provide high-quality journalism, albeit in a reduced format. The move to a weekly publication is a significant blow to the Herald's long history of daily reporting, but it is also a testament to the paper's determination to adapt to the changing media landscape. As the Herald itself acknowledged, the crisis facing journalism is a global phenomenon, and the paper's struggles are a reminder that the challenges facing the industry are far from unique to Argentina.",

The £1.7bn mine, which was given the go-ahead last year after a protracted planning battle, has promised to restore the region's proud mining heritage and bring more than 1,000 jobs. The project received a major boost on Tuesday when Sirius Minerals, the company behind the Yorkshire mine, announced a US$300m (£245m) deal with Rinehart's Australian agricultural firm Hancock Prospecting. The mine, which sits on protected moorland overlooking Whitby and Robin Hood's Bay, aims to produce up to 20m tonnes a year of a potassium-rich mineral called polyhalite, a type of potash fertiliser described by Sirius as a \"fertiliser of the future\". Under the deal Rinehart will purchase $50m of Sirius shares and pay $250m for a 5% royalty stream on the first 13m tonnes of fertiliser produced by the mine annually, and the right to purchase up to 20,000 tonnes of product each year for use on her expanding Australian agricultural holdings. Rinehart said: \"This project delivers a new and natural product that is relevant to Hancock's focus on agriculture, and after years of field tests and across many crop types, demonstrated improved yields. \"Sirius has a large, high-quality mineral resource and is located in a stable jurisdiction with a competitive tax rate. The project has the potential to become one of the world's leading producers of multi-nutrient fertiliser and could have a life of 100 years – this fits with my approach of investing in strategic areas for the long term.\" The mile-deep mine shaft was narrowly approved in June 2015, by eight votes to seven, after a protracted four-year planning wrangle that drew opposition from conservationists. The deal marks a significant milestone for Sirius Minerals, which has faced numerous challenges in bringing the project to fruition. The company's CEO, Chris Fraser, hailed the investment as a \"game-changer\" for the company, stating that it would provide the necessary funding to complete the construction of the mine and begin production. Fraser also emphasized the importance of the partnership with Hancock Prospecting, saying that Rinehart's expertise in agriculture would be invaluable in helping the company to develop its polyhalite product.\n\nThe investment has also been welcomed by local politicians and business leaders, who have long advocated for the project's development. North Yorkshire County Council's leader, Carl Les, said that the deal would bring \"significant economic benefits\" to the region, creating thousands of jobs and stimulating local growth. The project's opponents, however, have expressed concerns about the potential environmental impacts of the mine, including the destruction of protected moorland and the risk of pollution.\n\nDespite these concerns, the project is expected to move forward with construction work set to begin in the coming months. The mine is expected to take around five years to complete, with production expected to begin in the early 2020s. With the investment from Hancock Prospecting, Sirius Minerals is now poised to become one of the world's leading producers of polyhalite, a product that is expected to play a critical role in meeting the world's growing demand for food.",

The 10 students were invited by Property Week to judge a shortlist of providers for the \"student experience\" category of their inaugural Student Accommodation Awards. The judges instead criticised the entrants for pricing out poorer students and \"driving the social cleansing of education\". The panel cited a 2015 study by the NUS, which shows that university rent in the UK increased by 18% over two years, to an average of £146 per week. The report suggests the rise is largely due to the growth of private providers. A spokesperson for the Student Accommodation Awards said: \"Our student judges have sent a clear message that the industry needs to do better. In light of this, we have taken the decision to remove this category for this, our inaugural event, and review it for 2017. \"We will continue to encourage the industry to raise its game and put the student experience at the centre of everything it does.\" On the panel was Jenny Killin, welfare officer at the University of Aberdeen students' association, who said: \"The real 'student experience' is too often a choice between paying bills or buying food. The news of the withdrawn category sent shockwaves through the student accommodation industry, with many providers expressing surprise and disappointment. However, others praised the students for taking a stand against the rising costs.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for the industry,\" said Sarah Jones, a student at the University of Manchester. \"We're not just paying for a roof over our heads, we're paying for a way of life. And that way of life is becoming increasingly unaffordable.\"\n\nThe controversy has also sparked debate about the role of private providers in the student accommodation market. Critics argue that they are driving up prices and pushing out poorer students, while proponents claim that they offer a more personalized and convenient service.\n\nAs the industry reviews its practices, some students are calling for more government intervention to regulate rent prices. \"It's not just a matter of individual providers doing better, it's a systemic problem that needs a systemic solution,\" said Jenny Killin, the welfare officer who was part of the judging panel.\n\nThe University and College Union (UCU) has also weighed in on the issue, calling for greater regulation of the student accommodation market. \"Students are being priced out of their education, and it's unacceptable,\" said UCU general secretary Sally Hunt. \"We need to see a crackdown on unscrupulous landlords and a greater emphasis on affordable housing for students.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the Student Accommodation Awards have pledged to continue to encourage the industry to prioritize the student experience. \"We're committed to making a positive difference for students, and we'll work with the industry to make that happen,\" said a spokesperson.

It's time for business leaders to stand up and be counted. The government's proposal to require companies to disclose the pay ratio between their highest-paid executive and the average worker is a crucial step towards transparency and accountability. By shedding light on these disparities, May can help to address the growing sense of inequality and discontent among the public. It's not just about fairness, but also about ensuring that the economy benefits everyone, not just the privileged few.

Murdoch is reported to have invested $100m in Theranos between 2014 and 2015, when its valuation was soaring thanks to the promise of being able to revolutionize blood testing by replacing needles with low-cost finger pricks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Murdoch was part of a group of wealthy families and individuals who invested $632m in Theranos's latest funding round at about $17 a share, giving the Silicon Valley company a valuation of nearly $9bn, and making it the highest-valued private healthcare startup in the US. Murdoch is reported to have toured Theranos's laboratories in Palo Alto and inspected its proprietary devices prior to investing. The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's publishing group News Corp, has published a series of investigative stories questioning the accuracy of Theranos's testing and unusual management techniques. The WSJ investigation, which kept going despite intense pressure on its whistleblower from Theranos and its board of high profile figures, led to a government investigation that found the company's practices were putting patients' lives at risk. Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos's chief executive, was banned from the blood testing business for two years. Last month, the company shut down its labs. The company – which Holmes founded when she was 19, in 2003 – is also facing both criminal and civil investigations by the US attorney's office in San Francisco and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is looking into whether the company misled investors and regulators. Some investors on Monday launched their own lawsuit against the company, claiming they were misled. They said they hoped their suit would attract others and become a class action. High-profile Theranos investors include the billionaire Riley Bechtel, chairman of the private construction giant Bechtel Group, and Cox Enterprises, the family-controlled conglomerate. Murdoch's potential loss is a significant blow to his reputation as a shrewd investor, and it's unclear how he will respond to the fallout. News Corp, the parent company of the Wall Street Journal, has been criticized for its close ties to Theranos and its failure to investigate the company's claims more thoroughly. The scandal has also raised questions about the role of venture capital firms and individual investors in funding startups without properly vetting their claims. As the legal and regulatory battles continue to unfold, it remains to be seen how much of the $100 million Murdoch invested in Theranos will be recovered. In the meantime, the scandal has left a stain on the reputation of the media mogul and the Wall Street Journal, which is known for its rigorous reporting and investigative journalism.",

In a follow-up email it insisted there is nothing we can do to change the decision and that it will not give us a reason. Searchlight has campaigned against racism and fascism for 52 years, published a magazine since 1975, and is well respected. We are not aligned to any political party and are multi-faith. We currently work with the University of Northampton and recently launched a research arm, Searchlight Research Associates, with many distinguished patrons. We have no overdraft facility – our income comes from occasional grants, donations and subscriptions and is paid in by cheque, standing order or bank transfer. We have hardly any international transactions. We can think of nothing in our use of the accounts that could possibly give rise to any concerns. The only reason I can think of is that the fascist individuals and organisations that Searchlight combats have maliciously given false information to the bank for the sole purpose of getting our accounts closed, and the bank has accepted it without investigation. Obviously, this is very disruptive and we are applying for new accounts with another bank but we don't know whether it will accept our application in view of HSBC's action. Although HSBC is acting within its terms and conditions, its unilateral action is contrary to all principles of justice. GG, Ilford, Essex There's nothing you can do to change the decision, says HSBC – except write to the media. As soon as I contact the bank you receive a flurry of phone calls and then two senior officials beg a meeting. The upshot is that the four accounts are reinstated with no more of an explanation than when they were closed. Its press office will only comment opaquely: \"HSBC aims to provide the highest standard of customer service … where this has not been met we endeavour to work closely with the customer to resolve any issue as soon as possible.\" Abrupt closure of bank accounts without explanation is becoming a worryingly frequent issue in my inbox as banks run scared of draconian US crackdowns on anyone deemed complicit in money laundering. HSBC narrowly avoided prosecution by the US Congress, so the chances are it is neurotically reacting to any account with political overtones or foreign transactions, be it owned by a suburban householder or a high-profile campaigning group. This sudden and seemingly arbitrary decision has left us feeling betrayed and confused. We have been loyal customers of HSBC for decades, and we never expected such treatment. The bank's lack of transparency and unwillingness to provide a reason for the closure is unacceptable. We are considering taking our business elsewhere and advising our supporters to do the same. It's time for HSBC to take responsibility for its actions and provide a clear explanation for its decision. Until then, we will continue to fight for our right to have our accounts reinstated and to campaign against racism and fascism without fear of persecution.",

More than 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for the billionaire tycoon to fulfil his promise to \"sort\" the scheme. The petition will be delivered to Green's Arcadia business on Wednesday by John Hannett, the general secretary of the shopworkers' trade union Usdaw. Green promised to deal with the problems facing the pension scheme when he appeared before MPs in June. However, he has failed to agree a deal with the Pensions Regulator, which has now launched legal proceedings against Green and Dominic Chappell, the former owners of BHS. Hannett said Green needed to pump more than £250m into the scheme, which has more than 20,000 members, calling anything less \"derisory\". He said: \"Our priority is to see Sir Phillip do the right thing and deliver on his promise to 'sort' the pension fund. If he wants to recover any reputational credibility he must not haggle his way out of his responsibilities, he must make a full contribution and do it quickly. The protesters plan to gather outside Arcadia's headquarters in London, where they will hand over the petition and demand that Green take immediate action to address the pension crisis. Usdaw officials will also meet with Arcadia's management team to urge them to reconsider their stance and work with the Pensions Regulator to find a solution. The union has warned that if Green fails to act, it will consider taking industrial action to support its members, who are facing uncertainty and anxiety over their retirement prospects. The BHS pension scheme was left with a massive deficit when the company went into administration in 2016, and many workers are now struggling to make ends meet. The crisis has sparked widespread outrage and calls for accountability from Green, who was heavily criticized for his role in the company's collapse. As the protesters gather outside Arcadia's headquarters, they will be joined by former BHS workers and their families, who are determined to hold Green to his promise and secure a better future for those affected by the pension crisis.",

        "Text": "The Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic has won a contract believed to be worth £20m to expand a huge windfarm off the East Anglian coast. Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries Ltd has secured the manufacturing of 60 steel foundation jackets for the East Anglia One offshore windfarm, which will safeguard 200 jobs. At more than 65 metres high and weighing over 845 tonnes, the three-legged steel jackets will be almost as prominent on Belfast's skyline as Samson and Goliath, Harland and Wolff's giant yellow cranes. Work on the foundation jackets will start in the second quarter of 2017 and should be completed towards the end of 2018, Scottish Renewables said on Friday. The firm says East Anglia One, a £2.5bn North Sea windfarm, will generate 714 megawatts of electricity by 2020, enough to power 500,000 homes. Jonathan Guest, Harland and Wolff's director of business development said: \"In a global supply chain environment it is significant when a developer stands over its commitment to give opportunities to local fabricators, as Scottish Power Renewables have demonstrated for East Anglia One.\" Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power Renewables said: \"East Anglia One will be the best value offshore windfarm ever constructed, at the same time as delivering industry-leading levels of UK content. \"We are pleased that Belfast will play important roles in delivering their project supporting hundreds of skilled jobs.\" The contract win is a major boost for the historic shipyard, which has been working to rebuild its business after a period of decline. Harland and Wolff has been investing in new facilities and equipment to compete for large-scale offshore wind projects, and this contract is a testament to its capabilities. The company's workforce will be busy constructing the steel foundation jackets, which will be transported to the windfarm site off the East Anglian coast for installation. The project is expected to create a ripple effect throughout the local economy, with many suppliers and contractors also benefiting from the work. The success of East Anglia One will also pave the way for further offshore windfarm developments in the North Sea, providing a sustainable source of energy for generations to come. As the project progresses, it will be closely monitored by industry experts and environmental groups, who will be tracking its impact on the local ecosystem and the UK's renewable energy targets. With the contract win, Harland and Wolff is set to play a leading role in the UK's offshore wind industry, cementing its reputation as a major player in the global energy sector.",

He was charged with \"inciting hatred\" against the Gulf monarchy's rulers, and therefore facing a possible three-year jail sentence. Now I'm delighted to report that the charges against him have been dropped, according to a tweet issued by Bahrain's UK embassy. Sharif was detained because he gave an interview to a US news agency, the Associated Press, in which he suggested that the prince's day-long tour of the island kingdom could \"whitewash\" Bahrain's crackdown on dissent. The decision to drop the charges is a significant victory for Sharif and a welcome development for human rights advocates who have been critical of Bahrain's treatment of political dissent. Sharif, a prominent critic of the government, was arrested on June 15th, just days after Prince Charles's visit to the country. The Bahraini authorities had accused him of inciting hatred against the ruling family, but many saw the charges as an attempt to silence a vocal critic of the government. The dropping of the charges is a clear indication that the Bahraini authorities are willing to listen to international pressure and respect the right to free speech. Sharif's lawyer has welcomed the decision, saying it is a \"victory for freedom of expression\" and a \"step towards justice\". The Bahraini government has not commented on the decision, but the move is likely to be seen as a significant step towards improving the country's human rights record.",

        "Text": "My husband, Harry Jones, who has died aged 86, was a committed teacher and college principal at sixth-form and technical colleges, and in adult education. Harry was born and brought up in County Durham, the son of William Jones, a miner, and his wife, May (nee Cowley). His father was sent down the pit at the age of 12 to be the family breadwinner. Harry's mother left her village school at 14 but was a great reader. Raised on the estate of the Backhouses, the Darlington bankers, where her mother was housekeeper and her father coachman, May had access to their library, and thanks to this, Harry benefited from a pre-school education. Unemployment in Durham caused the family to move in 1940 to Coventry, where they experienced wartime air raids. Grammar schools were then fee paying, with a few bright children selected for special places, and Harry gained one at King Edward VI school, Nuneaton. It was a disrupted secondary education. The school was bombed, so for some time pupils went to school only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, to receive work to be done at home. Even when full-time schooling resumed, there were no laboratories, gymnasium or library. Nevertheless Harry was an exceptional student. As well as achieving academic success, he was captain of rugby, selected for Warwickshire's under-18s, editor of the school magazine, and played Prospero and Bottom in school plays. He won prizes for public speaking and as the best all-round sportsman. After national service as a technical instructor – he claimed the army taught him to teach in six weeks – he went to Birmingham University, where he and I met. First as a lecturer in English at West Bromwich and then as senior lecturer in liberal studies at Ipswich, he supported the movement to liberalise traditional technical colleges, which eventually led to the formation of new universities. As head of department at Northampton College of Further Education, vice principal at Dacorum College, Hemel Hempstead and principal at Borehamwood College of Further Education, he developed a vision of a student-centred combination of sixth-form college, technical college and adult education, acting as a resource for the whole community. This he worked to create as principal from 1978 at Isle College, Wisbech. Encouraging staff to engage in the life of the town, he was an active member of local organisations, published local history studies, and gave talks to local societies. In retirement from 1993, he enjoyed literature, theatre, film, music, politics and football. Open to new ideas, he developed expertise with the computer and the internet. In his later years, Harry remained intellectually curious and active, attending local events and participating in debates. He was a regular at the local library, often attending author talks and book clubs. His love for literature and history remained strong, and he was known to spend hours researching and writing about local history. Despite his busy schedule, Harry always made time for his family, and his grandchildren cherished the stories he would tell them about his childhood and teaching days. Harry is survived by his wife, his three children, and six grandchildren, who will deeply miss his wisdom, wit, and infectious enthusiasm.",

        "Text": "Sports Direct is selling Dunlop, the sportswear brand known for its green flash tennis shoes, to a Japanese buyer in a surprise $137.5m (£112m) deal. Sumitomo Rubber Industries confirmed that it will acquire the trademark rights of the Dunlop brand overseas, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Sports Direct's founder and major shareholder, Mike Ashley, acquired Dunlop Slazenger for an estimated £40m in 2004 from Royal Bank of Scotland – which had taken control of the struggling business from its private equity-backed owners – three years before he floated his sportswear retail chain on the stock exchange. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is associated with many sports including tennis, squash, badminton and golf. Its gear has been used by sporting figures including tennis champions Rod Laver, John McEnroe and Steffi Graf, as well as golfers such as the 2011 British Open winner Darren Clarke and the former world number one Lee Westwood. In a statement, Sports Direct said it did \"not currently have the bandwidth to develop and manage international brands simultaneously\", and needed to prioritise its core UK businesses and relationships with third-party brands. The Dunlop business made a pre-tax profit of £4m on sales of £41.8m, the retailer said. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, originally called the Dunlop Rubber Company, has a tyre business as well as a sports division that makes tennis and golf equipment. It already owns the rights to the Dunlop brand for other markets. Sports Direct has had a difficult 2016, in which criticism of its working practices was compounded by weak trading. In December, the retailer revealed that profits had more than halved to £71.6m in the six months to 23 October. At the time, the company's chairman, Keith Hellawell, blamed an \"extreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company\" for damaging its reputation. An undercover Guardian investigation last year exposed the fact that Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the minimum wage. A scathing parliamentary committee report later compared conditions at its Shirebrook warehouse to a Victorian workhouse. Since then, the company has been forced to give £1m in back pay to workers and offer staff guaranteed working hours. The sale of Dunlop to Sumitomo Rubber Industries is seen as a strategic move by Sports Direct to focus on its core UK business and strengthen its relationships with third-party brands. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has expressed its commitment to maintaining the Dunlop brand's heritage and reputation, and plans to expand its global reach through the acquisition. The sale is also seen as a boost for the Japanese company, which has been looking to expand its presence in the global sporting goods market. For Sports Direct, the deal marks a significant departure from its traditional business model, which has focused on retailing sportswear brands rather than owning them outright. The company's founder, Mike Ashley, has faced criticism in recent years over his business practices, and the sale of Dunlop is seen as a move to refocus the company's efforts and improve its reputation.",

        "Text": "A bailout of struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi should not be seen as a done deal, a key European Central Bank policymaker has said. Jens Weidmann, president of Germany's Bundesbank, said the Italian government ought to consider whether it should rescue the bank if it is in a bad financial state. \"For the measures planned by the Italian government the bank has to be financially healthy at its core,\" he said in an article published German newspaper Bild. \"The money cannot be used to cover losses that are already expected. All this must be carefully examined,\" added Weidmann, a member of the ECB's governing council. The ECB has taken a tough line with Italy's third-largest bank, refusing to give it more time to find private investment. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan last Friday after the Siena-based bank, which can trace its roots back to 1472, failed to convince investors to fund a €5bn (£4.25bn) cash injection. It plans to dip into a €20bn fund approved by the government earlier this month for the purpose of propping the bank up if no rescue plan could be secured elsewhere. The bailout plan was spurred by Monte dei Paschi's poor results in ECB \"stress tests\", a system set up by the European Union after the financial crisis to measure banks' resilience to unexpected economic shocks. Stress tests are intended to ensure that taxpayers are not asked to pick up the tab for multi-billion pound bailouts, such as those that the British government orchestrated to save Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. Fears about the strength of Monte dei Paschi began to mount after it came last out of 51 European banks in the ECB's latest round of tests in July. The bank was told to shore up its finances by the end of the year or face being wound down. \"These (rules) are meant especially to protect taxpayers and put responsibility on investors. State funds are only intended as a last resort, and that is why the bar is set high,\" Weidmann told Bild. Monte dei Paschi's problems have piled up since the 2008 banking crisis, when it paid €9bn (£7.6bn) for Banca Antonveneta. The deal doubled its size and turned it into Italy's third largest bank behind UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. It bought Banca Atonveneta from Santander, which had acquired the Italian bank during the three-way bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro, a deal that was a key factor in the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Weidmann's comments come as the Italian government is under pressure to find a solution to the bank's financial woes, with many experts warning that a state bailout could have far-reaching consequences for the country's economy. Monte dei Paschi's struggles have been exacerbated by a decline in the bank's core business and a series of costly acquisitions, including the purchase of Banca Antonveneta in 2008. The bank's poor performance in the ECB's stress tests has raised concerns about its ability to withstand a potential economic downturn. With the bank's fate hanging in the balance, Weidmann's warning serves as a reminder that a state bailout is not a guarantee, and that the Italian government must carefully consider the potential risks and consequences before proceeding.",

I used to rejoice as I walked through the municipal gardens near my home as we learned about the need for \"capacity building\" in the developing world. How grateful I was for all the local municipal provision that we lived with here: the parks, halls, toilets, youth centres, libraries. With central-government austerity policies (Cuts at catastrophic level, says Birmingham council chief, 13 December), they are now all vanishing, or hard-pressed local volunteers are struggling to deal with community-asset transfer, taking over the running and the management of such amenities, if they are not sold off to unaccountable private companies. The latest proposal from Bradford metropolitan district council is to pass many of its local halls over to local groups, should they be willing and able to take on this community-asset transfer. Our Silsden town hall is on the list. We will fight to retain it as it has been run over the past two years: with a local volunteer Friends group working hard to encourage use of the town hall (which is a fine, historic building in the heart of the former mill town), but with the council paying for the upkeep and staffing. This arrangement has been working very satisfactorily, the hall almost cost-neutral. I rejoice much less now as I go through the local park. As I walk through the park, I'm struck by the irony of our efforts to \"build capacity\" in developing countries, while our own local community is struggling to hold on to its most basic amenities. The council's proposal to transfer the town hall to a local group feels like a thinly veiled attempt to offload responsibility, rather than a genuine effort to empower the community. I fear that if we're not careful, Silsden will lose its very identity, as the town hall becomes just another casualty of central government's relentless austerity drive.",

When the glaziers showed up they said two of our windows needed safety glass (something not mentioned on the phone) and that they would have to come back.

Later that month I checked my credit card statement and £54 had been debited by Emergency Response Group, which said this was a \"cancellation fee\".

In your shoes I would be inclined to take the partial refund, put it down to experience and find another firm to replace the windows. However, I'm not convinced that the company's explanation is entirely accurate. I'm still waiting to hear back from them about the supposed phone call informing me of the price increase, and I'm skeptical that I would have forgotten such a significant conversation. Moreover, the fact that they charged me the £54 cancellation fee without my consent or prior notification is unacceptable. I'll continue to pursue a full refund and hope that others will join me in speaking out against this company's questionable business practices.",

In 2005, I led a Treasury committee inquiry into cash machine charges which found hundreds of local areas where consumers were being hit with high charges. In Speke, a low-income area in Liverpool, consumers faced charges of £1.50 for making cash withdrawals. I established a working group including banks, consumer groups and ATM operators. The banks unanimously committed themselves to the long-term future of a large network of free cash machines and a \"financial inclusion premium\" was introduced for operators of free cash machines in 1,500 under-served low-income areas. The importance of the free-to-use ATM network has increased as banks have closed 1,000 branches in the past two years. It would be a disaster for the banks, as well as consumers, SMEs and low-income areas, if we returned to the position of the 1990s, when a confusing patchwork of agreements caused many consumers to pay excessive cash machine charges and penalised challenger banks.

It included Libor manipulation, mis-selling mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Forex rigging, weakness in money laundering and systematic aiding of tax avoidance at its Swiss subsidiary. Two years on, we can now add disregard of local communities and high streets to that list. Last year, HSBC closed over 200 branches – more than any of the other major banks – and it has just announced another 62 closures this year (Report, 25 January), including in my constituency of Wood Green. Gone is its commitment to being the \"world's local bank\". If it carried on at this rate, it would have no branches left by the end of 2019. As I reflect on the past, I am reminded of the importance of preserving the free-to-use ATM network. The current negotiations are a critical moment in this journey. It is imperative that all parties involved - banks, ATM operators, the Payment Systems Regulator, and the Bank of England - work together to ensure the long-term viability of a widespread network of free-to-use cash machines. This is not just a matter of convenience, but a matter of financial inclusion and competition. Without a robust ATM network, vulnerable communities will be disproportionately affected, and the high street will continue to decline. I urge all parties to put the interests of consumers and communities first and to reach a deal that secures the future of our cash machine network.",

        "Text": "Platinum miner Lonmin has come under attack over its record on conditions for its workers, nearly five years after dozens of people were killed in violence at its Marikana mine in South Africa. Speaking as protesters displayed placards bearing the names of the dead, the chief executive, Ben Magara, told shareholders at the group's annual meeting that progress on building homes for 33,000 staff had been \"slower than we would have liked\". But he said rock-bottom platinum prices made it impossible for the company to resolve the housing issue and stay financially sound. Thirty-four people were killed near the Marikana mine in August 2012, after workers went on strike, demanding a living wage from Lonmin in a complex dispute that escalated into violence. The former bishop of Pretoria Johannes Seoka, who was on the phone to one of the victims when the police opened fire, said the company should take more responsibility. \"We're convinced that what happened is the result of their own reaction to demands of the workers,\" he said. \"If they had talked with the workers that massacre would not have happened.\" Seoka and Amnesty International called for the company to move faster on building homes for miners, many of whom live in informal communities with no electricity or running water. The protesters, made up of community leaders and relatives of the victims, chanted slogans and held up signs bearing the names of the 34 miners who lost their lives in the 2012 massacre. They demanded that Lonmin take immediate action to address the housing crisis, which has left thousands of workers living in squalid conditions. \"Lonmin must take responsibility for the lives they've ruined,\" said one protester, a community leader from the nearby township of Phokeng. \"They've made promises for years, but nothing has changed.\" The company's chief executive, Ben Magara, was met with skepticism by shareholders and protesters alike, who accused him of downplaying the severity of the housing crisis. \"Rock-bottom prices are just an excuse,\" said one shareholder. \"The company has the means to build these homes, but they're choosing not to.\" As the protest continued, a delegation of community leaders and relatives of the victims met with Lonmin executives to demand a concrete plan for resolving the housing crisis. The outcome of the meeting remained unclear, but one thing was certain: the Marikana massacre would not be forgotten anytime soon.",

        "Text": "Shareholders appear to have blocked a pay rise for Alison Cooper, chief executive of Imperial Brands, in a move that may affect other FTSE 100 companies aiming to hike the bonuses of their bosses. The maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes issued an unexpected announcement to the stock exchange on Thursday to say it would not put its new pay policy to a vote as originally planned at the annual meeting on 1 February. The policy, which must be voted on every three years, would have had the effect of increasing Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m a year from increased bonus opportunities. The move demonstrates that the company did not expect to win overwhelming support for the proposal from investors. The decision by ISS, the proxy voting agency which is influential with major US investors, to recommend a vote against the policy had signalled that a sizeable revolt was on the cards. Imperial's chairman, Mark Williamson, said investors had changed their minds about backing the plan. \"We have been actively engaging with shareholders for some time and while we received considerable support, it is clear that views have changed over that time and that the right course of action now is for the board to withdraw the resolution,\" he said. \"The board continues to believe that revising the policy is necessary for retaining and attracting the right calibre of talent to ensure the continued sustainable growth of the business and we will re-engage with shareholders to reach a consensus on this important issue.\" David Haines, who chairs the company's remuneration committee, said the pay rise was needed – not just for Cooper but other executives – because it was \"significantly below the average for companies of our size\". Critics of high pay said the move was a warning to company bosses about pushing through pay rises - but urged investors to keep up the pressure. Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, said: \"This is the first sign that some institutions are going to be a bit tougher this year, so it looks like good news. \"But just as one swallow does not make a summer, one example of effective criticism does not make a 'shareholder spring'. The news that Imperial Brands' shareholders have blocked a pay rise for CEO Alison Cooper may be a significant setback for the company, but it is also a welcome development for those who have been critical of excessive executive compensation. The move is seen as a warning to other FTSE 100 companies that may be considering hiking the bonuses of their bosses. \"This is a major victory for shareholders and a significant blow to the culture of excessive pay that has been prevalent in the UK,\" said a spokesperson for the ShareAction campaign group. \"It shows that investors are no longer willing to tolerate outrageous pay packages and are demanding more transparency and accountability from company boards.\" The decision by Imperial Brands' shareholders is also seen as a sign that institutional investors, such as pension funds and asset managers, are starting to take a more active role in scrutinizing executive pay. This could lead to a shift in the balance of power between shareholders and company boards, with investors playing a more prominent role in shaping corporate governance. As one analyst noted, \"This is a significant development and could have far-reaching implications for the way companies approach executive pay in the future.\"",

        "Text": "The Bank of England governor has warned that a new breed of internet-only lenders are beginning to pose risks to the financial system and without tighter regulation they could trigger the next financial crash. Mark Carney said high street banks were being displaced by online lenders that were untested in a recession, when bankruptcies might make their loans worthless. Cyber-attacks could also strip customers of digital money, leaving them to face huge losses without the traditional protection offered by regulators, he said. The warning follows a speech last year by Adair Turner, the former chief financial regulator, who said losses on loans made over the internet could make the worst bankers look like \"lending geniuses\". Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney said digital money held out the prospect of allowing millions of people excluded from the mainstream banking system to access loans securely. Threadneedle Street has several initiatives under way to allow peer-to-peer online lenders access to central bank funds and facilitate transactions. But he expected the authorities \"to pursue a more intense focus\" on financial regulations, lending rules \"and a more disciplined management of operational and cyber risks\" as the price of the industry's growing influence. In the UK, about 14% of new lending last year to small and medium-sized businesses was by so-called fintech lenders, which typically offer loans with funds provided directly by investors. He likened the growth in recent months to the explosion in securitised loans used by banks such as Northern Rock before the 2008 financial crash. \"It is not clear the extent to which P2P lending can grow without business models evolving in ways that introduce conventional risks. Were these changes to occur, regulators would be expected to address such emerging vulnerabilities,\" he said. The UK is expected to become a global leader in online lending, putting pressure on the Bank to adopt regulations that protect customers without stifling a still young industry. Bitcoin is the best known digital currency, but swings in its value have undermined consumer confidence and limited its growth. The currency has a fixed number of coins which can be used to buy goods and services from providers that accept them. A recovery in Bitcoin's value in recent months and the popularity of the blockchain electronic wallet, which mimics a bank account, has prompted some analysts to predict it will take off this year. The Bank of England's warning comes as the fintech industry is booming, with online lenders offering loans to small businesses and individuals. However, Carney's comments have sparked concerns that the rapid growth of the industry could lead to a repeat of the mistakes made during the 2008 financial crisis. The Bank is urging regulators to take a closer look at the risks associated with online lending, including the potential for cyber-attacks and the lack of transparency around loan portfolios. \"We need to make sure that we're not creating a situation where we're relying on untested business models and unproven technologies to support the financial system,\" Carney said. The Bank is also warning that the growth of online lending could lead to a reduction in traditional banking services, as banks shift their focus to more profitable areas of the market. This could leave vulnerable groups, such as small businesses and low-income households, without access to essential financial services. The Bank's warning has sparked a debate about the need for stricter regulation of the fintech industry, with some arguing that the industry needs more oversight to ensure stability and others arguing that regulation could stifle innovation.",

        "Text": "Snapchat is tightening up its guidelines for publishers on its Discover service, banning the posting of risque images without editorial value, and clarifying guidelines intended to prevent the spread of fake news on the platform. The changes, according to a spokeswoman for Snap, Snapchat's parent company, are intended to \"empower our editorial partners to do their part to keep Snapchat an informative, factual and safe environment for everyone\". Toeing the line between keeping Snapchat age appropriate for younger users – the app bars children from under 13 from making accounts, but allows 13- to 17-year-olds on the service – and allowing publications on Discover editorial freedom has been difficult for the company, particularly when media organisations know one way to appeal to the app's millennial user base is with prominent use of risqué images. The Daily Mail, for instance, has attracted user complaints for frequently posting semi-nude images as its \"cover\" on the service. \"I find it incredibly offensive that I can't opt out of seeing these images and that I am forced to see these images every time I open up the app to see my friends' stories,\" one user told the Guardian. \"Usually, I just put up with it, but a few weeks ago, a definite line was crossed\", she said: \"The image was of a completely nude female on the top … The picture was taken from the side, so you can't see the nipples but her breasts were dangling over her boyfriend who she was mounting. She was dressed on the bottom and I believe her boyfriend was completely dressed.\" Due to the prominence of Discover features in Snapchat's app, the cover story is visible even to users who simply use the service to talk with friends and family. In July 2016, Snapchat faced a lawsuit over sexualised Discover stories. The new guidelines aim to address these concerns by introducing stricter rules for what constitutes editorial value in risqué images. According to the revised guidelines, publishers must demonstrate a clear connection between the image and the story being told, and ensure that the image is not gratuitous or sensationalized. Additionally, Snapchat will require publishers to provide a warning to users before displaying explicit content, allowing users to opt-out of seeing such images if they choose to.\n\nThe changes are seen as a significant shift for Snapchat, which has historically been known for its lenient approach to content moderation. The company has faced criticism in the past for allowing explicit and offensive content to proliferate on its platform, particularly on its Discover service. The new guidelines are intended to strike a balance between allowing publishers to express themselves creatively and ensuring that the platform remains a safe and respectful environment for all users.\n\nSnapchat has also taken steps to increase transparency around its content moderation policies, including the creation of a new appeals process for users who feel that their content has been unfairly removed. The company has also committed to increasing its staff of content moderators, who will work to review and enforce the new guidelines.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the new guidelines will be received by publishers and users alike. Some have expressed concern that the changes will stifle creativity and limit the types of stories that can be told on the platform. Others have welcomed the move, seeing it as a necessary step to ensure that Snapchat remains a safe and respectful environment for all users.",

Politicians go through months of training to try to learn to speak with matter-of-fact honesty. Steve did that instinctively. His honesty was up front, the moment the green light came on.

He was not afraid to speak his mind, often with a wry sense of humor, and his critiques were always constructive. Many a BBC executive must have winced at his candid assessments, but they knew he was coming from a place of deep affection and respect. Steve's ability to dissect the complexities of the corporation, to highlight its strengths and weaknesses, was unparalleled. His insights were always informed, never vindictive.

        "Text": "The sucker punch has been coming ever since the press – with hundreds of local newspaper editors up front – tried to fend off the supposed royal charter regulatory menace of article 40 (the one where publishers pay legal costs, win or lose). Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on a regulator offering cheap arbitration was a terrible sticking point, the editors said: a final burden on a struggling industry. Which, of course, made arbitration itself the litmus test for MPs and ministers wondering what to do next. Thus the culture, media and sport committee now gives Ipso (the non-Leveson-compliant regulator almost everyone has joined) a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. If it doesn't, the baton of section 40 recognition passes to its sanctified (but scantily favoured) rival Impress. Either Ipso gets its act together, or nemesis – and the secretary of state – follows. Yes, but which scheme do you pick? Impress, asking £75 a time at the start of a three- to six-month road? Or Ipso, with super-silky barristers eager to sort you out for a downpayment of £300, possibly with much more to follow? One basic difference is that Impress caps arbitrators' fees at £3,500 win or lose, and no legal costs if you win the case. The plaintiff can't lose financially; binding participation in arbitration is nil problem there. No wonder the local press don't like the sound of that. Ipso is rather loftier in its costings and more flexible in its obligations, but you know what, and who, you're getting. Can't we have some hard data to help make up our minds? That rather depends on whether the demand for arbitration is really as big as its champions make out. Here is the continuation of the article:\n\nBut what does the data show? According to Ipso, it has received over 1,000 requests for arbitration since its launch, with a success rate of 70%. Meanwhile, Impress claims to have received over 500 requests, with a success rate of 80%. However, both bodies admit that these figures are likely to be skewed, as they only include cases where the parties have agreed to arbitration. The real test, say critics, is how well the schemes work in practice. And that's where the numbers get murky. Despite Ipso's claims of a high success rate, many of its arbitrations have been delayed or stalled, with some cases dragging on for months. Impress, on the other hand, has been praised for its efficiency, with most arbitrations resolved within a few weeks. But with the clock ticking, MPs and ministers are under pressure to make a decision. Will they opt for the more expensive, but potentially more effective, Ipso scheme, or the cheaper, but potentially more efficient, Impress option? Only time will tell.",

Rinehart had instigated legal action against Nine and the production company responsible for the program, Cordell Jigsaw, over the two-part miniseries recounting the family drama of one of Australia's wealthiest mining dynasties. Nine and Cordell Jigsaw apologised to Rinehart in a statement on Friday that clarified the program \"was a drama, not a documentary, and certain matters were fictionalised for dramatic purposes\". \"Nine and Cordell Jigsaw accept that Mrs Rinehart had a very loving and close relationship with her mother, father and husband, and has with [her children] Hope and Ginia ... \"Nine and Cordell Jigsaw accept that Mrs Rinehart found the broadcast to be inaccurate. That was certainly not the intention of Nine or Cordell Jigsaw, and each unreservedly apologises to Mrs Rinehart and her family for any hurt or offence caused by the broadcast and its promotion.\" The statement also acknowledged Rinehart's \"significant contribution\" to Australia's industry and economy, as well as her \"longstanding support of elite sport and numerous worthwhile charities\". The program makers agreed to pay Rinehart's legal costs, likely to be a six-figure sum, and confirmed that the miniseries would not be sold to streaming channels, foreign markets or released on DVD. The first episode attracted more than 1.4 million viewers when it aired on the Nine network in February 2015. Rinehart won the right to see the second episode before it was broadcast in an out-of-court settlement, and ordered Nine edit parts of it out. The settlement marks the end of a lengthy and contentious legal battle between Rinehart and the media companies involved. The billionaire's lawyers had argued that the miniseries was a breach of her privacy and had caused her significant distress and harm. Rinehart had also claimed that the program's portrayal of her family and personal life was inaccurate and misleading.\n\nThe apology and settlement come as a relief to Rinehart, who had expressed her disappointment and frustration with the program's content in the past. In a statement, her lawyers said that the agreement was a \"significant victory\" for their client and acknowledged the important role that Rinehart plays in Australian society.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the miniseries had also sparked a wider debate about the portrayal of wealthy and influential individuals in the media. Many critics had argued that the program was a form of \"class warfare\" and that it unfairly targeted Rinehart and her family.\n\nThe settlement will likely have significant implications for the way that the media covers the lives of wealthy and influential individuals in the future.

The courses had been arranged by their respective trade unions in agreement with their employers. The syllabuses were partly drawn up by the students themselves and the subject areas included economic and social history. Class members presented papers to each other and the topics ranged from collective bargaining to global politics. I first met Peter in 1966 at Sheffield University's Department of Extramural Studies, which he had joined six months earlier. He was always concerned to ensure that students were given the fullest opportunity to express and develop their own ideas. He understood clearly that serious adult education in the social sciences was a process of assisting the individual's understanding and not just a matter of instruction. He touched and enriched many people's lives, but perhaps his greatest legacy derives from his activities in the union-backed Society of Industrial Tutors. Peter was the son of Austen Smith and his wife, Isabel (nee Reed). On leaving school in Sunderland, where his father was a junior school headteacher, Peter studied economics at Manchester University and took his first job, teaching liberal studies at Stockport College of Technology, in 1962. In the same year he met Helen Naughton, when they were both doing holiday jobs for the Labour party in a north Manchester constituency. In 1965 Peter took up his extramural post at Sheffield University and he and Helen married the following year. He helped form the Sheffield Vietnam campaign and in 1968 led a large contingent to the famous demonstration outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square, London. At Teesside Polytechnic, where he was appointed principal lecturer and head of liberal studies in 1969, he served on the governing body and helped the institution gain university status in 1992. He and Helen lived in Stockton-on-Tees from 1970. Peter's passion for adult education and social justice led him to become a prominent figure in the local community. He was a vocal advocate for trade union rights and was involved in various campaigns to improve working conditions and workers' welfare. Peter's commitment to social responsibility extended beyond his professional life, as he was an active member of the local Methodist church and served as a school governor. His legacy continues to inspire generations of students and educators, and his impact on the lives of those he touched will be deeply felt for years to come.",

At the moment, being joint tenants, we have made a joint will, leaving the property to whoever survives the other, and in the event of both our deaths, to our children. There are also stipulations that each of our six grandchildren receives £10,000 when we both die, providing there is that amount left in our estate. If we become tenants in common, do we have to update our existing will to mention giving a life interest to the surviving spouse and leaving our half of the estate to our daughters and grandchildren, as in our existing will? SMF A Yes, you will have to draw up new wills if you decide to own your home as tenants in common by severing your joint tenancy. You will also need to draw up new wills if you really do have a joint will, as there is supposed to be no such thing under UK law. You have to have a will each, but they can \"mirror\" each other, so that the provisions in them are essentially identical. It is not possible to stipulate in a will who gets property that is jointly owned on the first death of one of the joint tenants. That's because property under a joint tenancy automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) on the death of the other(s). This is not the case if you own a property as tenants in common, where you can specify in your will who gets your share of the house on your death. However, simply leaving your share to your daughters does not in itself create a \"life interest\" in the property for your spouse. a life interest in the property for your spouse. A life interest would require a separate deed or declaration, which would need to be registered at the Land Registry. This would create a legal right for your spouse to occupy the property for the rest of their life, even if they are not the sole owner.\n\nIf you do decide to become tenants in common, it's essential to review your wills and ensure they accurately reflect your new ownership structure. You may also want to consider creating a trust or a deed of variation to ensure your wishes are carried out. It's recommended that you consult with a solicitor or a wills and probate specialist to ensure you're making the correct decisions for your family's inheritance.\n\nIn addition to updating your wills, you'll also need to consider the implications of becoming tenants in common on your grandchildren's inheritance. The £10,000 legacy you've specified in your current will may no longer be applicable, as the ownership structure of the property will change. You'll need to review your wills and consider making alternative arrangements to ensure your grandchildren receive the inheritance you intend for them.",

I selected a faded blue French Connection suit and was told it would be available for collection at my local branch in Ilford at the beginning of March, four weeks before the wedding. A month later, I received a call from the Ilford branch claiming that only my measurements were on the order form. When I examined the paperwork I found the suit ordered was bright blue and shirts that I had not requested had been added. I called in and was told the faded blue suit was not available for hire, that the groomsmen's measurements had been lost and that the promised large-order discount had only been applied to one of the eight suits. I was back to square one. I then chose a faded blue Ted Baker suit. I was told it would arrive at the start of March, but when I rang on 1 March I was told it was unavailable. They had also ordered the wrong colour waistcoats and the discount had only been applied to three suits. I now have four weeks until my wedding and have no idea what is happening with my suit, despite ordering it three months in advance and paying a £340 deposit. RK, London Sadly, the saga does not end there. Silence met my alert to the Moss Bros press office for eight days, during which the Ted Baker suit arrived and turned out to be different to the one you had tried on, so you had to choose yet another option, which would only be ready two days before the wedding. When you lodged a formal complaint via the website you were told that, since the order had now been corrected, your complaint was closed. After chasing, the press office finally got things moving. It arranged for the suits to be ready three weeks earlier than agreed and replacements would be couriered to you if need be. \"My sincerest apologies for the experience the customer has received,\" says a spokesperson. Despite the improved response from the press office, I'm still left feeling frustrated and anxious about the state of my wedding attire. I've had to make multiple trips to the store, only to be told that the suits I've ordered aren't available or have been incorrectly made. The lack of communication and poor organization has caused me a significant amount of stress, and I'm worried that I'll be walking down the aisle in a suit that doesn't fit or match the rest of the groomsmen. I've also had to pay additional fees to ensure that the suits are delivered on time, which has added to the overall cost of the wedding. I hope that Moss Bros will take steps to improve their service and avoid similar situations in the future.",

The Guardian reported that the sandwich chain hoped to solve its looming recruitment crisis by offering 500 16- to 18-year-olds a week of unpaid work experience. On Saturday, however, Pret's chief executive, Clive Schlee, tweeted that the company would pay all participants Pret's hourly starting rate \"and of course provide free food as well\". The minimum wage is £4 an hour for under 18s and £5.55 for 18- to 20-year-olds. Only one in 50 of Pret's job applicants are born in the UK, so the company is particularly exposed to the threat of non-UK workers leaving or avoiding the country in the wake of Brexit. Participants in Pret's Big Experience Week would \"get exposure to aspects of our business including food production, customer service, social responsibility [care for the homeless] and financial control\", the company said. With Brexit on the horizon, it said the new work experience programme was part of efforts to take on the \"long-term challenge that Pret and the wider industry must meet to ensure hospitality is seen by Brits as a serious career choice\". Andrea Wareham, Pret's human resources director, wrote in a blog on the company's website: \"Attracting British applicants is not exclusively a Pret problem, and is symptomatic of a wider cultural bias. British schools and parents don't always take careers in the hospitality industry seriously, but they really ought to. \"The industry has changed dramatically over the past 20 years and today it is strong, dynamic and growing.\" She said the company would find it all but impossible to recruit enough staff if it were forced to turn its back on EU nationals after Britain left the EU. The company's about-face on pay was met with widespread approval from campaigners and critics, who had accused Pret of exploiting young people. \"This is a significant victory for the young people who were willing to stand up for their rights and demand fair treatment,\" said Emma Lewell-Buck, a Labour MP who had been vocal in her criticism of Pret's initial plans. \"It's not just about the money, it's about the principle. Young people deserve to be paid for their work, and Pret has finally recognized that.\" The news comes as a blow to Pret's competitors, who had been hoping to capitalize on the company's recruitment crisis by poaching its staff. However, Pret's human resources director, Andrea Wareham, was quick to point out that the company's commitment to paying its work experience participants was not just a short-term fix. \"We're not just doing this to fill a gap in our staffing levels,\" she said. \"We're doing it because we believe that young people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and that includes being paid a fair wage for their work.\" With the company's new policy in place, Pret is now looking to fill the remaining 500 work experience spots with young people from across the UK. The company has also pledged to continue its efforts to attract more British applicants, and to work with schools and parents to promote the hospitality industry as a viable career choice.",

Did I want to sit in it, or did I want to race? The cabin is spacious but beset with tiny inconveniences. The gear housing was a bit lax, so when you put it in neutral, it would transpire you'd left it in second. You could never catch it in the act, so you never knew whether it was your fault, and had to fall back on \"But this has never happened to me in any other car\", like a bad relationship. The frame design is strange, with big wedges of plastic at the back; if you parked on a curve, the road was effectively all blind spot. There was a lot of red styling going on in the binnacles, which made me feel a little alarmed, as if I was being told something important in a dream. The cabin did not make me feel special: the screen was diddy and hard to read; the bits where you keep things were not where my hand wanted them to be. But it had so much going for it! It didn't look like a small car, or act like one; it wasn't a hybrid, but its emissions were amazing: it was the first car I've driven in so long to fall below 100g/km that I had to look up whether that made it a nine or a perfect 10. The exterior styling was all curves and nostalgia; from the front, it was a pure hymn to the 80s (if you leave aside all the cars of the 80s that were rough and clunky as cheap jewellery). The boot was ample for my purposes, but I cannot pretend to have moved anything larger than shopping. Leg room was fine in the front, a bit parsimonious in the back. So much so, in fact, that the car harked back to that other feature of the 80s, the principle that not everybody in the family had to be comfortable. The turbo diesel engine was the pits in the city, with a sluggish response, then a time-lagged whoosh of extra power, as if from nowhere. Motorway driving was much more enjoyable; the acceleration's fine in the higher gears, although the slightly stiff posture tells over time. After about an hour, I started to wriggle as if I was watching a children's film made by someone other than Pixar. There is nothing wrong with this car; it is decent, a standup car to start a family with. However, I must admit that it didn't quite capture my heart. Perhaps it's because I'm a city dweller at heart, and the Tipo's struggles in urban traffic left me feeling frustrated. The Fiat Tipo is a car that's clearly designed with the open road in mind, and while it's pleasant to cruise along the motorway, it's not the most agile or responsive car in town. Additionally, the infotainment system, while user-friendly, felt a bit dated, with a lack of modern features like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Despite its many virtues, the Tipo ultimately felt like a car that's stuck in the past, a relic of a bygone era when family cars were more about practicality than pampering.",

Users can, and should, opt in by clicking on the settings icon in the top right of their profile, hitting two-factor authentication in the following menu, and enabling the setting to \"require security code\". Once enabled, the app will text a six-digit code to users' phones every time they want to log in to the service. A simple security measure, it nonetheless provides an added layer of protection against accounts being hacked by attackers who have managed to steal credentials. Instagram joins Facebook, Twitter, Google and many others in offering some form of two-factor verification. Confusingly for users, all the methods are slightly different: Twitter requires logging in to be approved by opening the app on a trusted device, and Google uses an open standard to link up with its authenticator app, which generates new six-digit codes every 30 seconds. The site Turn It On provides a general step-by-step guide to enabling two-factor authentication on every service that offers it. The convenience of two-factor authentication comes at a cost, however. Users must ensure they have a reliable phone number linked to their account, as the security code will be sent to this number every time they log in. This can be a problem for those who have changed phone numbers or no longer have access to their original phone. Additionally, users may need to re-enable two-factor authentication on each device they use to access their Instagram account, as the feature is not device-specific.

Personal insolvencies in England and Wales totalled 24,531 between January and March, up 6.7% on the previous quarter and 15.7% higher than the same period a year earlier. It was the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014, according to the Insolvency Service, which published the figures. The rise comes at a challenging time for UK households, as incomes are squeezed by a combination of rising inflation and weak pay growth. The annual inflation rate is 2.3% and expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the impact of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote increasingly feeds through to higher shop prices. Meanwhile regular pay growth was just 1.9% in February compared with a year earlier. Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said the insolvency figures were concerning. \"Growing levels of household debt and extra pressure on budgets from inflation are a worry, and we expect this to translate into greater demand for free debt advice over the rest of 2017,\" she said. \"We would urge anyone who is already struggling with their finances, or is concerned that they are only one bill away from falling behind, to seek free advice as early as possible.\" At 59%, individual voluntary arrangements accounted for the majority of personal insolvencies in the first quarter, while debt relief orders made up a further 25% and bankruptcies accounted for 16%. IVAs are arrangements where money owed is shared out between creditors, while DROs are available to people with less than £20,000 of debt who do not own their own home. The Insolvency Service's figures also showed that the number of people seeking debt relief orders (DROs) rose by 12.1% compared to the same quarter last year, with 6,131 applications received. Bankruptcies, on the other hand, decreased by 10.4% to 3,889 cases.\n\nThe charity StepChange Debt Charity warned that the rise in insolvencies was a sign of the increasing pressure on household budgets. \"The UK's households are facing a perfect storm of rising costs, stagnant wages and increasing debt,\" said StepChange's chief executive, Mike O'Connor. \"We are seeing more and more people struggling to make ends meet, and the figures from the Insolvency Service are a stark reminder of the need for urgent action to address the root causes of this crisis.\"\n\nThe government has been under pressure to take action to help households struggling with debt, particularly in the wake of the Brexit vote. The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has promised to review the system of debt relief, but has not yet announced any specific measures.\n\nIn the meantime, debt advice charities are urging people to seek help early on if they are struggling with debt. \"The sooner you seek advice, the better your chances of avoiding insolvency and getting back on track,\" said Joanna Elson. \"It's never too early to seek help, and we would encourage anyone who is struggling to get in touch with a debt advice charity as soon as possible.\"",

Nearly 39% of investors voted against the pharmaceutical group's 2016 remuneration report at its annual meeting in London, similar to the rebellion it faced three years ago. Support for the new pay policy was much stronger, with 96% of investors backing it. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, received a total pay package of £13.4m last year because a long-term incentive plan and other rewards paid out. He was paid an annual salary of £1.2m and an annual bonus of £1.2m, down from £2m the previous year. But he pocketed a further £6.9m from a long-term incentive plan, plus a one-off payment of £3.6m in compensation for bonuses he lost when he left his previous employer. Royal London Asset Management, which holds 1% of AstraZeneca shares, said it voted against the remuneration report and the chair of the remuneration committee, but backed the new pay policy. After consulting its biggest shareholders, AstraZeneca said it had made changes to its long-term bonus plans to simplify them and make them fairer. It added that its remuneration committee would \"continue the dialogue with shareholders, as appropriate, regarding any concerns following its AGM\". Two advisory groups, PIRC and Institutional Shareholder Services, had urged shareholders to vote against the remuneration report and policy. The shareholder rebellion was seen as a setback for AstraZeneca's efforts to improve its reputation on executive pay. The company has faced criticism in the past for its compensation practices, and the latest revolt suggests that some investors are still unhappy with the company's approach. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, has been a vocal critic of excessive pay packages and has called for greater transparency and accountability in the industry. Despite the setback, AstraZeneca's new pay policy received strong support from investors, with 96% backing the changes. The company has promised to continue engaging with shareholders and to make further changes to its compensation practices. The outcome of the vote is likely to be closely watched by other companies in the pharmaceutical industry, which have also faced criticism over their executive pay practices.",

The camera uses the depth information to produce \"computer vision-based\" blurred backgrounds so you can apparently look your best in full-length selfies. It will also capture video, so you can give your audience a twirl in your finery. But Echo Look is more than just a glorified Echo Dot with a camera, says Amazon. The company's machine-learning system will compare the photos of different outfits you're wearing and judge which one is more \"in\" at that very moment. Amazon said on its product page for Echo Look: \"Style Check keeps your look on point using advanced machine-learning algorithms and advice from fashion specialists. \"Submit two photos for a second opinion on which outfit looks best on you based on fit, colour, styling and current trends.\" Amazon promises that Echo Look's style advice will get better the more people use it and the more fashion advisors pitch in. Echo Look performs all the duties of other Echo devices as well, allowing users to set alarms, ask questions, get the headlines, play music and the many other different activities Alexa is capable of. The camera's fashion expertise is limited to men's and women's clothing, and users can ask Alexa for style advice on specific items, such as which accessories to pair with a particular outfit. Amazon is also partnering with fashion brands to offer exclusive discounts and promotions to Echo Look users. The company claims that Echo Look's style suggestions will become more accurate over time as it learns a user's personal style and preferences. The device is expected to be a major player in the growing smart mirror market, which is expected to reach $1.3 billion by 2025.

The state's governor, Doug Ducey, bombarded Uber with pitches for Arizona after the taxi firm was banned from testing in California following a series of regulatory breaches. Waymo has been testing 100 self-driving minivans on public roads since \"earlier this year\", the company revealed, and now intends to add another 500 to its broader fleet. Krafcik added: \"Our early riders will play an important role in shaping the way we bring self-driving technology into the world – through personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics and more. Self-driving cars have the potential to reshape each and every one of these areas, transforming our lives and our cities by making them safer, more convenient and more accessible.\" For the time being, however, the programme is more akin to a subsidised taxi service than a truly open self-driving car release: Waymo says that \"our goal is to develop fully self-driving vehicles that require no intervention, though as part of this early trial, there will be a test driver in each vehicle monitoring the rides at all times\". As a result, however, the households that apply do not need driving licences, or even the physical capability to take control of the car. The trial is expected to provide valuable insights into how self-driving cars can be integrated into daily life, as well as identifying any potential issues or challenges that may arise. Waymo has stated that the feedback from participants will be used to improve the technology and address any concerns that may be raised.\n\nTo be eligible to participate in the trial, applicants must be at least 18 years old and have a valid email address. They will also need to agree to provide feedback on their experiences using the self-driving cars, which will be collected through a dedicated app.\n\nWaymo has emphasized that the safety of participants is its top priority, and that the test drivers will be trained to handle any situation that may arise during the trial. The company has also committed to maintaining the privacy and security of all participant data.\n\nThe news of Waymo's trial comes as the self-driving car industry continues to gain momentum, with companies such as Uber, Tesla, and Cruise also working on developing autonomous vehicle technology. As the technology advances, it is likely that we will see more trials and pilots of self-driving cars in the future.\n\nFor now, however, the focus is on Phoenix, Arizona, where hundreds of residents will have the opportunity to experience the future of transportation firsthand.

Additionally, the sample size was relatively small, with only 1,000 drivers participating. It's also unclear how the survey defined \"left-handed\" and \"right-handed\" drivers, as handedness is not always a binary trait. Furthermore, the survey did not control for other factors that might influence driving behavior, such as age, experience, and location. So, while the results might be interesting, they should be taken with a grain of salt. In any case, left-handed drivers, take heart! You may not be the most careful drivers, but you're certainly not the only ones with a few speeding tickets under your belt.",

        "Text": "The four top directors at UK turnaround specialist Melrose Industries are to share a bonus pot of £160m in one of the biggest corporate paydays in the City. The UK-listed engineering firm said on Wednesday it would pay out share bonuses to its three co-founders and the finance chief under a five-year incentive plan, which was approved by investors in 2012. Based on the average share price over the past 40 days of 234p, the total bonus pot is worth £240m. The quartet – Christopher Miller, executive chairman; David Roper, executive vice chairman; Simon Peckham, chief executive; and Geoff Martin, chief financial officer – are entitled to 68% of it. This means they will get £40m each in shares. The remainder of the pot will be shared between 20 senior managers. The executives can sell shares to cover the £70m of income tax due on the awards but must retain at least half the remaining shares for at least two years. They have never sold any shares, except to cover tax bills. At present, the four directors together own 2.25% of Melrose, which will rise to 3.1% after the share awards. The rest is owned by financial institutions led by BlackRock. Melrose stressed that the bonus plan was strongly aligned to shareholder returns, with £3.5bn returned to investors over the five-year period. The firm buys and turns around struggling manufacturing businesses before selling them on. Melrose's share price has soared from 42.97p five years ago to 236p on Wednesday. The company was founded and floated on the stock market in 2003 as a cash shell by Miller, Roper and Peckham, who put about £3m into the business. Melrose is listed in the FTSE small cap index but is expected to rejoin the FTSE 250 soon. It declared a statutory loss before tax of £69.3m last year. Excluding restructuring, acquisition and disposal costs, it made an underlying pretax profit of £96m, with revenues of £889m. The bonus payouts are among the biggest in City history, but are dwarfed by the £70m pay package awarded to WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell in 2015, including a £63m payout from a long-term incentive scheme, which triggered a shareholder revolt. The bonus payouts have been hailed as a success story for Melrose's turnaround strategy, which has seen the company return £3.5 billion to investors over the past five years. The firm's share price has soared from 42.97p in 2012 to 236p today, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the London market.\n\nAnalysts have praised the company's ability to identify undervalued assets and turn them around, with Melrose's latest acquisition, the aerospace and defense firm GKN, expected to deliver significant returns in the coming years.\n\nThe bonus payouts have also been seen as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects, with the four directors set to receive their awards in the coming weeks. The company's finance chief, Geoff Martin, said: \"We are delighted to be paying out these bonuses, which reflect the hard work and dedication of our team over the past five years. We believe that this is a well-deserved recognition of our achievements and a testament to the strength of our business model.\"\n\nThe news has sent Melrose's shares soaring, with investors piling in to take advantage of the company's strong performance. The firm's market capitalization has risen to over £2.5 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the FTSE small cap index.\n\nThe bonus payouts are also expected to have a positive impact on the company's employees, with many set to receive significant bonuses as a result of the company's strong performance. The news has been welcomed by employees, who have seen their salaries and benefits increase significantly over the past five years.\n\nOverall, the bonus payouts are seen as a major success story for Melrose, and a testament to the company's ability to deliver strong returns to its investors. The news is likely to send a positive signal to the market, and could lead to further growth and investment in the company in the coming years.",

        "Text": "Poor old British Airways. It was bad enough that backup systems failed after a power surge brought down its IT systems on Saturday morning. But when hundreds of passengers were then left stranded, crisis-response experts accused the airline of failing them, too. Four days later, half a billion pounds have been wiped off the value of BA parent company IAG. Paul Charles, a former director of communications for Eurostar and Virgin Atlantic, where he created the airline's crisis strategy, is baffled by how long it took BA to say anything. \"You have to respond within an hour with a full statement on what is going on,\" he says. \"It took seven hours for the CEO to record a video Twitter message. You could fly to New York in that time, it's ridiculous.\" In a second video, shared yesterday afternoon, Nicola Pearson, a former BBC News reporter who now runs BA's news operation, interviews her boss, the airline's chief executive Álex Cruz. He says he is \"profusely sorry\" for the disruption and attempts to reassure customers that it couldn't happen again. Charles, who now runs the PC Agency, a London travel consultancy, thinks BA's brand is strong enough to survive, \"but it is being eroded\", he adds. \"When airlines don't have good crisis plans in place it can lead to the decline of the brand.\" United Airlines' stock price took a dive when it managed to blame a passenger who had been dragged off an overbooked plane in Chicago. The airline later admitted that it had \"messed up\" its initial response and the share price has since recovered. Malaysia Airlines had to be nationalised to keep it flying after the loss of two planes in as many months in 2014. Even relatively minor crises tend to get amplified. The airline's silence in the early hours of the crisis only added to the frustration of passengers, many of whom were left stranded at airports or forced to cancel their travel plans. \"I was supposed to be on a flight to Madrid on Saturday morning, but it was cancelled,\" said Emma Taylor, a businesswoman from London. \"I had to spend the day at the airport, trying to get rebooked. It was a nightmare.\" Charles believes that BA's slow response to the crisis has damaged its reputation and will take time to recover. \"When you're dealing with a crisis like this, you need to be transparent and honest with your customers,\" he says. \"BA has failed to do that, and as a result, its brand is taking a hit.\" The airline's shares have fallen by over 10% since the crisis began, wiping off billions of pounds from its market value. In a statement, BA apologized for the disruption and promised to investigate the cause of the power surge. However, many passengers are left wondering why it took the airline so long to respond to the crisis and what measures it will take to prevent such a disaster from happening again in the future.",

        "Text": "Huge, concrete and with ominous phrases including \"Major Changes\" and \"Reject\" stamped on its six sides, a new monument in Moscow celebrates an unlikely hero: the anonymous peer reviewer. Unveiled at the Institute of Education, HSE University on Friday, the 1.5-tonne die is the result of a crowdfunding campaign that drew support from a host of researchers, including the Nobel laureates Erik Maskin and Andre Geim – the latter being the co-discoverer of graphene who is currently based at the University of Manchester. The project was predicted to cost about $1,300, with backers receiving rewards ranging from normal-sized replica dice, to having the title of one of their papers recorded on one of the monument's sides. The concrete block had long been sitting in the grounds of the Institute when Igor Chirikov, director of the Centre of Sociology of Higher Education, came up with the idea for the monument. \"Peer reviewing is a matter of love and hate,\" he said. But, Chirikov stressed, peer review helps to make sure that research is up to scratch. \"When I was thinking about what the monument could be, I wanted to emphasise reviewers' impact on research, on one hand, but to do this with a bit of irony on the other hand so as to motivate researchers who don't always get positive reviews of their papers,\" he said. The crowdfunding campaign itself poked fun at this bastion of academia with a proposal that sent up anonymous review with satirical comments from unnamed adjudicators. \"I would suggest a second feasibility study trying a pyramidal monument, a rhombus, and a dodecahedron, and you should also assess viewer reactions over a 5-year period,\" one reads. The campaign also hinted that the monument could become a site of academic pilgrimage. \"Researchers from across the world will visit to touch the 'Accept' side in the hope that the gods of peer review will smile down upon them,\" the proposal stated. \"Of course, some unsuccessful researchers will want to curse it, and that's their business.\" The monument's unveiling was met with a mix of amusement and appreciation from the academic community. \"It's a bit of a joke, but it's also a recognition of the importance of peer review,\" said Dr. Maria Kuznetsova, a researcher at the Institute of Education. \"I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but the more I think about it, the more I appreciate the humor and the message.\" The monument's creators plan to maintain a database of all the reviews and comments left on the monument, which will be available online. \"We want to create a sort of 'Wall of Shame' for negative reviews, and a 'Wall of Fame' for positive ones,\" said Igor Chirikov. The monument has already attracted a number of visitors, including researchers and students from nearby universities. \"I came to see what all the fuss was about, and I have to say, it's quite impressive,\" said Dr. Alexei Petrov, a researcher at Moscow State University. \"I might even bring my students here to show them the importance of peer review.\" The monument's creators hope that it will become a symbol of the importance of peer review in the academic community, and a reminder of the impact that anonymous reviewers can have on research. \"We're not trying to celebrate the reviewers themselves, but the process of peer review that they represent,\" said Chirikov. \"We hope that it will inspire researchers to take peer review more seriously, and to recognize the value that it brings to the scientific process.\"",

In an opening statement on Wednesday night, Guthrie said the job losses she had signalled in March were well under way and this round would involve senior and middle management roles based in Sydney. \"Redundancies, while regrettable, are a necessary part of funding this work,\" Guthrie said. \"In March, I signalled that that 150 to 200 positions would be made redundant. This includes the efficiency initiatives in television and news, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 70 employees. \"Consultations have begun with affected employees in some divisions and more will begin over the next few days.\" Guthrie also defended the ABC's digital presence, in an apparent reference to criticism from Fairfax Media's chief executive, Greg Hywood, at the Senate inquiry into public interest journalism last week. \"I need to make it clear that the public expect the ABC to make its full breadth of content, including the extraordinary journalism displayed on Four Corners, available to them on all platforms, including digital,\" Guthrie said. \"The national broadcaster should not be used as a scapegoat for the problems that confront others in the digital media landscape.\" Hywood had accused the ABC of stealing Fairfax traffic by \"aggressively expanding\" from television and radio into digital news and then paying Google \"taxpayers' money\" to put ABC websites at the top of the search engine. \"The ABC is creating additional pressure on commercial media by aggressively competing for the same audience that commercial media rely on by providing online content for free, undermining our ability to create a sustainable model.\" ABC staff are bracing for job cuts on Thursday. Staff have been called into meetings with management on Thursday and the cuts are expected to hit Radio National hard. The cuts are expected to have a significant impact on Radio National, with several high-profile programs and presenters already facing the axe. Insiders have revealed that the station's flagship program, \"The Nightlife\", is set to be axed, along with several other long-running shows. The station's management has also announced plans to reduce the number of programs broadcast on weekends, citing a decline in listener numbers.\n\nThe redundancies are part of a broader cost-cutting effort by the ABC, which is facing a significant budget shortfall. The broadcaster has been struggling to adapt to the changing media landscape, with many of its traditional revenue streams declining in recent years. The ABC has been forced to rely increasingly on government funding, which has led to tensions with the government over the broadcaster's independence.\n\nThe job cuts are expected to have a significant impact on the ABC's workforce, with many staff members facing an uncertain future. The broadcaster has already shed hundreds of jobs in recent years, and the latest round of redundancies is expected to be one of the largest in the organization's history. The cuts are also expected to have a significant impact on the ABC's programming, with many popular shows and programs facing the axe.\n\nThe ABC's managing director, Michelle Guthrie, has defended the job cuts, citing the need for the broadcaster to adapt to the changing media landscape. She has also emphasized the importance of the ABC's digital presence, saying that the broadcaster needs to be able to reach its audience on all platforms. However, many staff members are concerned about the impact of the job cuts on the ABC's ability to produce high-quality programming. The broadcaster's unions have vowed to fight the cuts, and are expected to hold protests and rallies in the coming weeks.",

We are students and former students on the internationally renowned counselling programme at the University of East Anglia. We trained to be counsellors, or \"shrinks\", to quote Prince Harry in his recent interview. But now the university has closed the course and even made it impossible for some students to complete their professional qualification. As part of this draconian process, in which consultation was at a minimum, responsibility to students, staff and the wider local community has been completely deprioritised. This is exactly the opposite of what the princes, applauded by the government, were calling for. The impact is not only on the course itself, but also on those therapy organisations where students have for many years worked as volunteers on placement and beyond, and on the availability of the kind of in-depth listening relationship – described as so crucial by the princes – in the university's own counselling service. As a result, the closure of the course has left a gaping hole in the provision of mental health services in the region. Many students who were mid-way through their training have been left without a clear path to become qualified therapists, while those who have already graduated are struggling to find employment in a shrinking job market. The university's decision has also had a devastating impact on the local community, which has relied on the student-led counselling service for support. The sudden loss of these services has left many people feeling abandoned and without access to the help they desperately need. It is a stark reminder that, despite the rhetoric, the reality is that mental health is not a priority for this university or the government.",

Another supporter is former Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, who once again got to say \"I'm in\", after revealing that he and his companies have invested a six-figure sum in the not-for-profit enterprise. Credit unions are financial co-operatives owned and controlled by their members that have traditionally specialised in loans and savings for the less well-off, but are now targeting people of all incomes. They are seen as offering a vital alternative to banks, expensive payday lenders and loan sharks, and the launch of this latest union, called retailCURe, is a big boost for the sector. Membership of retailCURe is open to anyone aged 16 or over who works in retail or a support industry – a total of 4.5 million people, it is claimed. The retail sector is one of the UK's largest employers, but is also one of the industries with large numbers of people on low pay. Earlier this year, research showed that the biggest annual drop in advertised salaries was in the retail sector, where the average fell by 17.4% to £21,769, though it is a sector with high numbers of part-time workers. RetailCURe is run \"by the retail industry for the retail industry\", and other high street names backing it include Iceland, New Look and Pets at Home, with more names likely to come on board, according to a spokesman. All members will have access to loans from £500 up to £5,000 at interest rates ranging from 9.9% APR-26.8% APR, while two-thirds of the loans that have already been issued – the union has been live and trading for some weeks – are less than 10% APR. By contrast, many payday lenders charge more than 1,000% APR. The new credit union is also offering \"market-beating\" rates up to 3% on its savings accounts. The launch of retailCURe is a significant development in the fight against payday lending, which has been criticized for its exorbitant interest rates and predatory practices. By offering affordable loan options and competitive savings rates, retailCURe aims to provide a safer and more sustainable alternative for retail workers who may be struggling to make ends meet. According to the union's CEO, the response to the launch has been overwhelmingly positive, with many members already taking advantage of the loan and savings options. The union is also planning to roll out a range of financial education and budgeting resources to help its members manage their finances more effectively. With its backing from major high street names and its commitment to serving the retail industry, retailCURe is poised to make a real difference in the lives of thousands of retail workers across the UK.",

The engineering firm struck a deal with trade unions that will safeguard work for nearly a third of its 22,300-strong UK workforce for five years, as it prepares to double the number of engines it builds. Rolls-Royce will ditch plans to close a precision machining facility in Derby, saving 150 jobs that were at risk, as well as creating 200 new positions by building a new testing facility for jet engines. Of the £150m planned investment, £90m will be spent on building the \"testbed\", Rolls-Royce's sixth in Derby, where it puts engines destined for commercial jets through their paces. The testbed will be large enough for Rolls-Royce's new range of UltraFan engines, which are bigger and designed to be more fuel efficient than previous models. It will also use the site to test the Trent 900, which powers the Airbus A380 \"superjumbo\"; the Trent 1000, used on Boeing's \"Dreamliner\"; and the Trent XWB, which powers the Airbus A350 and has become the world's fastest-selling engine. The overall plan also includes investment in Rolls-Royce's large engine maintenance, repair and overhaul facility, as well as the Hucknall and Annesley sites in Nottinghamshire. The trade union Unite, which had been campaigning for extra investment from Rolls-Royce, said the plan \"effectively secures the manufacturing base of Roll-Royce in the UK for the next 20 years, along with 7,000 high-quality jobs\". The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: \"This is great news for a world-beating workforce making world-class engines and testament to the hard work of Unite's shop stewards and members. \"It is a good day for British manufacturing that must not be undone by a botched Brexit. The investment will also enable Rolls-Royce to increase its capacity to produce large engines, which are used in commercial airliners. The company plans to hire an additional 200 staff to work on the new testbed, which is expected to be completed by 2025. The move is seen as a major boost for the UK's aerospace industry, which has been facing uncertainty in recent years due to Brexit. Rolls-Royce's CEO, Warren East, said the investment was a vote of confidence in the UK's engineering capabilities and a demonstration of the company's commitment to its UK workforce. \"This investment is a key part of our strategy to drive growth and increase our competitiveness in the global aerospace market,\" he said. \"We are proud to be able to make this commitment to our UK workforce and to continue to play a leading role in the country's aerospace industry.\" The news has been welcomed by local politicians and business leaders, who have hailed the investment as a major coup for the region. \"This is fantastic news for the east Midlands and a testament to the region's reputation as a hub for engineering and manufacturing excellence,\" said the region's mayor, Nigel Simpson. \"We are delighted that Rolls-Royce has chosen to invest in our region and we look forward to working with the company to ensure that its plans are a success.\"",

Scientists took the extraordinary footage after stalking the shy and elusive Cape York palm cockatoos for seven years through the unspoilt wilderness of the peninsula in far north Queensland. The recordings show 18 males knocking out more than 130 drum solos which sometimes start with a flourish and nearly always contain a signature pattern distinct to each bird. Most of the musical outbursts were performed in front of females, apparently to win them over, with males embellishing their drumming efforts with calls, periodic blushing, and raising the feathers on their crests. Robert Heinsohn at the Australian National University in Canberra and others witnessed the birds tweaking sticks and seedpods before banging out sequences of 27 to 92 beats long. The birds varied their repertoires immensely to include rapid strikes less than a tenth of a second apart, to more casual taps repeated every few seconds. The researchers were amazed by the complexity and diversity of the drumming patterns, with some males incorporating complex rhythms and others using a more straightforward beat. The birds even appeared to improvise, adding their own unique flair to the performances. \"It's like they're having a conversation with each other, or even with themselves,\" said Dr. Heinsohn. \"The way they vary their drumming is like a musical language, and we're only just starting to decipher it.\"\n\nThe team's findings have significant implications for our understanding of animal behavior and intelligence. \"These birds are showing us that music is not unique to humans,\" said Dr. Heinsohn. \"They're using sound to communicate and express themselves in a way that's both creative and complex.\" The researchers are now working to analyze the audio recordings and identify patterns and themes in the drumming displays. They hope to use this information to better understand the social dynamics of the cockatoos and their mating rituals.",

        "Text": "Miguel Gómez Garza was on his final expedition to the Yucatán Peninsula to gather information for his book Parrots of Mexico when it happened. He heard a group of parrots in the distance, but their call was like none on record. So he loitered by a tree full of pods that parrots like for lunch, hoping they would come and feed. The wait was worth it. When half a dozen parrots flew over to the tree, Gómez Garza noticed their intense red fronts and the beautiful blue tips on their wing feathers. The plumage set them apart from the two species known to live in the area, which both have distinctive white fronts. \"I could not believe it. The different noise belonged to a different parrot,\" said Gómez Garza, a vet and ornithologist at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Monterrey, Mexico. In research published on Tuesday, an international team of scientists describe the new parrot for the first time. Named the blue-winged Amazon parrot, or Amazona gomezgarzai in honour of its discoverer, the bird stands 25cm or so tall and has a loud, short and repetitive call that would not sound out of place on the soundtrack to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. One of the calls the bird makes imitates that of the hawk, a natural enemy of parrots. While scientists are not sure why the parrot mimics the predator, they speculate that it scares other birds from the surrounding trees, leaving more seeds, fruit and flowers for the parrots to eat. Having spotted the birds in their habitat, Gómez Garza got permission from the Mexican authorities to capture a male and a female for further study. With help from Tony Silva at the University of Florida and Pawel Mackiewicz at the University of Wroclaw, he measured the animals and collected feather and blood samples. Tests on the parrot DNA described in the journal PeerJ show that the new species evolved from the white-fronted parrots (Amazona albifrons) that were native to the region about 120,000 years ago. The discovery of the blue-winged Amazon parrot has significant implications for the field of ornithology, as it highlights the complexity and diversity of the avian world. According to Dr. Gómez Garza, the new species is not only a fascinating find, but also a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts. \"We must protect the habitats of these birds, as well as the other species that coexist with them, to ensure their survival,\" he emphasized.\n\nThe team of scientists plans to continue studying the behavior and habits of the blue-winged Amazon parrot, with a focus on its unique mimicry of the hawk's call. They hope to gain a better understanding of the parrot's role in its ecosystem and how it interacts with other species.\n\nIn the meantime, the discovery of the blue-winged Amazon parrot has generated excitement among bird enthusiasts and scientists alike. The finding has also sparked a renewed interest in the Yucatán Peninsula, a region known for its rich biodiversity and cultural heritage.\n\nAs news of the discovery spreads, conservation efforts are underway to protect the habitat of the blue-winged Amazon parrot. The Mexican government has announced plans to establish a protected area in the Yucatán Peninsula, which will provide a safe haven for the parrots and other endangered species.\n\nThe discovery of the blue-winged Amazon parrot is a testament to the importance of scientific research and exploration. It serves as a reminder that there is still much to be learned about the natural world and the incredible diversity of species that inhabit our planet.",

Ten was forced into a trading halt and then voluntary administration last month when financial backers Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon failed to guarantee a new $250m loan. On Monday, after the first creditors' meeting was held in Sydney, Ten's administrators said leading shareholders Gordon and Murdoch, who now jointly own 22.5% of Ten, and James Packer, have agreed to provide the funds needed to keep the network on air. \"We have adequate cash resources at the present time but, by the end of this week, the shareholder guarantors will put a financing facility in place to ensure Ten has sufficient cash to continue to operate,\" partner Mark Korda said. Ten posted a disastrous half-year loss of $232m and warned in April that its future as a \"going concern\" was in doubt if it could not secure another loan. Monday's meeting was the first for creditors since the MasterChef and Bachelor broadcaster went into voluntary administration on 13 June. A 14-member creditors' committee was appointed to oversee the administration of Ten. Members include senior Ten journalist Hugh Riminton, representing the employees, and representatives from Cricket Australia, the US network CBS, broadcaster Fox, production houses Endemol Shine and Fremantle Media, the Commonwealth Bank and the investment vehicles of Gordon and Murdoch, Birketu and Illyria. The Australian Shareholders' Association's chief executive, Judith Fox, who was excluded from the meeting, said she would prefer to see the network re-listed, the business salvaged and shareholders' stake in the business continue. The administrators also announced that a new board will be appointed to oversee the network's operations, with the current board members stepping down. The creditors' committee will work closely with the new board to ensure the network's continued viability. The administrators have until November to find a buyer or secure a refinancing deal, and if neither option is successful, Ten's assets will be sold off to pay off its debts. The network's employees and suppliers are breathing a sigh of relief, with many having been left in limbo since the announcement of the voluntary administration. The administrators have promised to keep the network's operations running smoothly until a new owner is found, and have assured employees that their jobs are safe for the time being. Despite the challenges ahead, the administrators remain optimistic that Ten can be salvaged and emerge from administration in a stronger position.",

The company did read the emails in personal Gmail accounts in order to target users with personalised adverts but said in a blogpost it would stop doing so in order to \"more closely align\" its business and consumer products. Its business offering, part of G Suite, has never involved scanning emails. \"G Suite's Gmail is already not used as input for ads personalisation,\" wrote Diane Greene, the senior vice president in charge of Google Cloud. \"Google has decided to follow suit later this year in our free consumer Gmail service. Consumer Gmail content will not be used or scanned for any ads personalisation after this change.\" Although G Suite customers, who pay Google for business use of a portfolio of web apps including Gmail, Google Docs, Calendar and Contacts, have never had their messages scanned for use in advertising, many potential customers were nonetheless put off the product by the mistaken impression that they were, Greene told Bloomberg. \"What we're going to do is make it unambiguous,\" she said. G Suite will still scan emails for other features. Security scans, common to both the consumer and business products, will continue to pick up spam, hacking and phishing attempts, while features like Gmail's \"Smart Reply\" – which offers suggested replies to messages based on previous emails – will be available for administrators to enable in G Suite. The change is expected to take effect later this year, and Google has promised to provide more transparency and control over the use of Gmail data for G Suite customers. The company has also committed to releasing more detailed information about how it uses Gmail data for security and spam filtering purposes. Additionally, Google has announced plans to introduce new features to help businesses manage and control the use of Gmail data, including the ability to set custom retention periods for emails and to restrict access to certain types of data. The move is seen as a significant step towards addressing concerns about data privacy and security, and is likely to be welcomed by businesses and individuals alike. Google's decision to stop scanning Gmail content for advertising purposes is a major victory for privacy advocates, who have long been critical of the company's data collection practices. The move is also seen as a major coup for Google's rivals, who have been quick to capitalize on the company's perceived weaknesses in the area of data privacy.",

        "Text": "So the Mail responded \"with both barrels\" (Letters, June 23). That trigger-happy metaphor says it all. Lefties don't reach for their guns or express \"hatred\" against others – including Daily Mail readers – they use satirical cartoons and mild rebukes. The increasing numbers of death threats in our society virtually all come from \"alt-right\" extremists, as even Charles Foster might agree. It is not the readers who lead the alt-right charge at the Mail, but the unbalanced editors, who go far beyond simply having \"opinions\". Has this mild letter put me in the firing line? Virginia Cumming London • As Charles Foster suggests, it isn't always possible to divine the political stance of people from the newspapers they read. A late and much-missed colleague used to buy the Daily Mail every day, which astonished me because I knew where he stood politically. I tackled him one day about it. \"He just laughed and said he liked the puzzles and celebrity gossip. I realized then that not everyone reads a newspaper for its politics. Perhaps the Mail's editors should take a similar approach and focus on providing a balanced mix of content, rather than appealing to a narrow section of the audience. This would help to reduce the polarizing effect of their reporting and create a more harmonious media landscape. After all, a newspaper should be a source of information and entertainment for all, not just a mouthpiece for a particular ideology.\"",

        "Text": "Santander has reduced its mortgage lending and its loans for car purchase amid Bank of England warnings about reckless lending and a \"spiral of complacency\" over mounting consumer debt. Its total mortgage lending fell by £1bn to £11.6bn in the first half of 2017 compared with 2016, with lending for buy-to-let down significantly. Net lending – which takes into account how many people remortgaged away from Santander – fell over the half year by £200m. Net consumer finance lending – covering car loans and credit cards – fell to £97m from £266m, partly due to \"a decrease in the stock of new car registrations\". Nathan Bostock, the Santander UK chief executive, said: \"We do face uncertainty and that was my view at our last results. Generally we have done less unsecured and credit card lending, and are probably down 10% on balances.\" Bostock said intense competition is driving down interest rates to historically low levels, and accused competitors of offering better rates on car loans and credit cards than are charged to much more secure mortgage customers. But he added that the risks of car loans should be put in a broader context. \"Unsecured lending is a £60 to £70bn market, but the mortgage market is £1.3tn.\" He added that non-performing loans (where customers have fallen behind payments) stood at just 0.48% of the unsecured book of lending, and that mortgage arrears remained very low. Bostock pledged not to make further rate cuts to the hugely popular 123 account, where interest rates were halved in November last year. The bank's decision to reduce lending comes as the Bank of England has warned of a potential \"spiral of complacency\" in the financial system, citing rising levels of consumer debt and a surge in buy-to-let lending. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, has urged lenders to exercise caution and warned that the UK's financial stability could be at risk if debt levels continue to rise unchecked.\n\nSantander's decision to reduce lending has been seen as a sign that some lenders are beginning to take the Bank's warnings seriously and are adopting a more cautious approach to lending. The bank's chief executive, Nathan Bostock, has stressed that Santander is not seeking to cut off credit to customers, but rather to ensure that lending is sustainable and responsible.\n\nDespite the reduction in lending, Santander remains one of the largest mortgage lenders in the UK, and its decision is likely to have a significant impact on the market. The bank's move is likely to be closely watched by other lenders, and could signal a shift towards more cautious lending practices in the industry.",

The tour operator Thomas Cook said it was seeing a pick-up in demand for Turkish holidays because they were good value for money. The chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said Turkey was proving attractive at the moment, even though Berlin has warned its citizens to be careful when travelling there. Visitors shunned the country last year after a failed military coup, which led to the company offering free cancellations to customers with existing bookings. Overall bookings for summer this year were up 11%, said the company. Greece was also back in favour, with bookings jumping by 22%. Thomas Cook also plans to restart holidays in Tunisia now that Britain has softened its travel advice to the country following a militant attack in June 2015. Business for tour operators such as Thomas Cook has suffered in the Middle East and north Africa in recent years as security issues deterred visitors, with travel firms laying on more holidays to the western Mediterranean to compensate. However, traffic has bounced back this year in these markets, while other destinations such as Spain have experienced problems. despite the challenges posed by terrorism and economic uncertainty. The company's decision to restart holidays in Tunisia is a significant development, as it marks a major shift in the travel industry's approach to the country. Thomas Cook's move is expected to boost tourism in Tunisia, which has been struggling to recover from the 2015 attack. The company is also eyeing other destinations in the region, including Morocco and Egypt, where it plans to increase its presence. Overall, Thomas Cook's positive outlook on Turkey and Tunisia is a welcome sign for the travel industry, which has been grappling with the impact of terrorism and economic uncertainty on travel patterns.",

        "Text": "A regulatory regime intended to crack down on the behaviour of bank bosses is to be extended to 47,000 firms including dentists, gyms and tool hire companies that offer credit to customers. The Financial Conduct Authority estimated that the new regime would cost firms £550m, with up to £190m of ongoing costs for the firms involved. It had been expected that the additional firms would be covered by the senior managers and certification regime (SMCR) from 2018, although the FCA's consultation document does not indicate if this is still the timetable. The SMCR came into force for almost 900 banks and building societies in March 2016 and was intended to tackle the fact that no bank bosses were held to account when their firms collapsed in 2008. It requires the responsibilities of top managers to be spelt out and for them to certify their key staff are suitable for their roles. This certification must now happen annually, whereas under the previous system the FCA approved individuals only once, unless they moved roles. The extension of the SMCR to 47,000 firms is expected to improve accountability and governance across the financial services sector. The FCA believes that the regime will help to prevent another financial crisis by ensuring that senior managers are held responsible for their actions. The new regime will also require firms to conduct regular assessments of their employees' fitness and propriety, and to report any concerns to the FCA.\n\nIndustry experts have welcomed the move, saying that it will help to raise standards across the sector. \"This is a significant step forward in ensuring that firms are held accountable for their actions,\" said John Tiner, former CEO of the Financial Services Authority. \"The SMCR has been successful in the banking sector, and it's only logical that it's extended to other firms that offer credit to customers.\"\n\nHowever, some firms have expressed concerns about the cost and complexity of implementing the new regime. \"We understand the need for greater accountability, but we're concerned about the additional burden this will place on our staff,\" said a spokesperson for a large tool hire company. \"We hope that the FCA will provide guidance and support to help us navigate the changes.\"\n\nThe FCA has promised to provide detailed guidance and support to firms affected by the new regime, and has also announced plans to review the regime's impact after three years to ensure that it is working effectively. The extension of the SMCR is expected to come into force in the next 12-18 months, although a precise timeline has not been announced.",

        "Text": "Televisions, fridges and other internet-connected home appliances should carry cyber security ratings alongside energy efficiency ratings, a police chief has suggested. Durham chief constable Mike Barton said customers should be given the at-a-glance information for internet-ready equipment in the same way fridges, freezers, TVs and other appliances have to display their energy efficiency ratings before sale. Barton, the national policing lead for crime operations, proposed the idea as part of efforts to protect households from fraudsters and hackers in the era of the Internet of Things, where otherwise \"dumb\" devices can be put online and be interconnected for automation and smart appliance activities. Analysts have forecast that by 2020 there will be as many as 21bn connected devices around the world, with the surge in the number and variety of internet-ready products sparking a string of security warnings. Earlier this year, an official report warned that smartphones, watches, televisions and fitness trackers could be targeted by cyber criminals seeking to hold users to ransom over their personal data. There have even been reports that baby monitors and pacemakers could be vulnerable to hacking. Barton said: \"It's not just how many yoghurts you are eating that is at risk, it's that your internet of things are all plugged into the same network. That is a back door into your network.\" Barton queried why devices designed to be connected to the internet are not being accessed for internet security and said that the responsibility for devising a suitable rating system should fall to the industry. Barton said: \"Whenever you go into a store now you see fridges and it's A down to F in terms of its energy efficiency. Where are the security ratings? \"You've got a situation where we don't know what the security is like in the devices we are buying in the internet of things. It's just not reported. Barton's proposal has sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that it is a step in the right direction towards increasing consumer awareness of the cyber security risks associated with internet-connected devices. \"It's a great idea to have a rating system that gives consumers an idea of the level of security they can expect from a device,\" said Dr. Emma Jones, a cyber security expert at the University of Cambridge. \"At the moment, consumers are often left in the dark about the security risks associated with these devices, and it's only when something goes wrong that they find out.\"\n\nHowever, others have raised concerns about the practicality of implementing such a system. \"It's not as simple as just slapping a rating on a device,\" said David Evans, a technology consultant. \"Cyber security is a complex issue, and it's difficult to quantify the level of security a device provides. It's also not clear who would be responsible for ensuring that the ratings are accurate and up-to-date.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, Barton remains convinced that a rating system is necessary to protect consumers from the growing threat of cyber attacks. \"We need to start taking cyber security seriously, and that means giving consumers the information they need to make informed decisions about the devices they buy,\" he said. \"It's not just about protecting our devices, it's about protecting our homes and our families.\"",

        "Text": "The bankers running JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs saw their shareholdings rocket in value by $314m last year due to the stock market surge following Donald Trump's election as US president. The JPMorgan boss, Jamie Dimon, and the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, enjoyed rises of more than $150m (£115m) each in the value of their stock and options in the banks they run, according to an annual review of bank CEO pay by Equilar for the Financial Times (paywall). The other 18 best-paid bank chief executives in the world fared less well, with average gains of $4m in their stock-related holdings last year. Dimon was also the best-paid banking boss in the world for the second year running, raking in $28.2m of pay, bonus and pension contributions last year. The Morgan Stanley chief executive, James Gorman, came second at $22.5m, followed by Blankfein at $22.3m. Blankfein was the world's best-paid banker in 2013 and 2014. However, the average remuneration for the top 20 chief executives fell last year, the review found, to $12.5m, from $14.2m in 2015. The Bank of America boss, Brian Moynihan, registered a big increase, of 23% to $20m. Shares in US banks soared after Trump's victory in the 9 November election, with Goldman's share price rising 24% in the last seven weeks of 2016. In Europe, bank bosses earned $8.5m on average, less than half of what their US peers made. HSBC's Stuart Gulliver enjoyed the biggest rise among European banking chief executives, up 32% in constant currency terms. The review also highlighted a significant gap in pay between CEOs of large and small banks. The average remuneration for CEOs of the 20 largest banks in the world was $18.3m, compared to $5.3m for CEOs of smaller banks. The gap is likely to continue to grow as larger banks continue to dominate the industry and smaller banks struggle to compete.\n\nThe review also found that the majority of bank CEOs received significant bonuses, with 15 of the 20 CEOs receiving bonuses worth more than $1m. The largest bonus was awarded to Dimon, who received a bonus of $13.5m, bringing his total compensation to $28.2m.\n\nThe review also noted that while bank CEOs have seen their pay rise significantly, the industry is still struggling to recover from the financial crisis. Many banks are still grappling with the legacy of bad debt and the need to increase capital buffers. The review warned that the industry's struggles are likely to continue, and that bank CEOs will need to work hard to justify their pay packages.\n\nThe review also highlighted the increasing trend of CEOs of large banks receiving significant amounts of stock options and other forms of equity compensation. This trend is likely to continue, as banks look to tie their CEOs' pay more closely to the performance of the company.",

        "Text": "Can they fix it? John Lewis reckons it knows someone who can. Middle England's favourite retailer has signed up an army of plumbers, electricians, decorators and gardeners to offer a new home maintenance service launching next month. The retailer, which has built up one of the most trusted brands in the UK partly thanks to its highly rated customer service and \"never knowingly undersold\" pledge, is now aiming to make employing a tradesperson a lot less hit and miss. The Home Solutions service is part of the department store's effort to fend off competition from online upstarts such as Amazon by providing more services. New boss Paula Nickolds said the business needed to bring in more beauty salons, home design, personal styling and other services as shoppers' behaviour changes \"profoundly and fast.\" In a bid to add pizzazz to shopping trips the company is also sending store staff to theatre school to teach them entertainment skills and its new Oxford store, which opens in October, will have an experience manager dedicated to organising daily in-store events. The new Home Solutions service has already been tested in Milton Keynes and is being extended to Bristol, Cardiff, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Taunton from 12 September. About 150 tradespeople have been signed up to the scheme so far and the number is expected to increase as the trial expands this year. They will remain independent contractors rather than becoming partners, the term John Lewis uses for its staff who jointly own the company. The independent tradespeople have all been through a \"rigorous\" six-stage recruitment process in partnership with trade associations including interviews, background checks, reviews of their past work and training in customer service. The retailer says it will also carry out spot checks responding to customer feedback. Customers select a job that needs doing and pick a time slot before being matched with available tradespeople via the service's website, app or call centre. The company is confident that the new service will not only provide customers with a convenient and reliable way to get their homes maintained, but also help to support local tradespeople and the economy. \"We're not just about selling products, we're about helping people live better lives,\" said Paula Nickolds. \"By offering this service, we're giving our customers peace of mind that their homes are in good hands, and we're also providing a valuable opportunity for local tradespeople to grow their businesses.\"\n\nTo ensure the quality of the service, John Lewis is implementing a rigorous quality control process. All tradespeople will be vetted and trained to provide excellent customer service, and customers will be able to leave feedback and ratings after each job is completed. The company is also working with trade associations to ensure that the tradespeople are up-to-date with the latest industry standards and regulations.\n\nThe new service is expected to be a game-changer for John Lewis, as it will allow the company to differentiate itself from online retailers and provide a unique experience for customers. \"We're not just a retailer, we're a destination,\" said Nickolds. \"We want to make shopping with us an experience that customers will want to repeat again and again.\" With the launch of Home Solutions, John Lewis is taking a bold step into the future, and it will be interesting to see how customers respond to the new service.",

        "Text": "Credit card lenders appear to be targeting people struggling with unaffordable levels of debt, according to a new report calling on Britain's financial watchdog to intervene. Research from Citizens Advice finds almost one in five people struggling with debts have had their credit card limit raised without them requesting it. The charity has demanded the Financial Conduct Authority bans the practice, amid growing concerns over a boom in lending. Unsecured lending is returning to levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis, raising alarm bells at the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn, thus putting financial stability at risk. The Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: \"It's clear that irresponsible behaviour by some lenders is making people's debt situation worse – such as offering more credit when they already have thousands of pounds of unpaid debt.\" She said lenders must act responsibly to direct people struggling with debt towards free and independent advice and support – rather than offering them more credit. People with long term outstanding balances were more likely to have their spending limit raised, with 18% of struggling credit card users seeing their limit increased in the past year without requesting it, compared to 12% of all credit card holders, Citizens Advice found. People with credit card debts were also more likely to get into long-term debt than those with personal loans, and were less able to pay their debt down. One pensioner helped by the charity was repeatedly called by firms offering more credit cards, despite the fact that she could only afford to make minimum repayments on her existing debts. She used these to pay essential bills and ended up with a total of 21 credit cards and debts totalling £70,000. Citizens Advice said it has helped 66,000 people with over 140,000 credit card debt problems in the last year. The report highlights the need for the Financial Conduct Authority to take action to protect vulnerable consumers from irresponsible lending practices. Citizens Advice is calling for the regulator to ban the practice of increasing credit limits without consent, and to introduce stricter rules to prevent lenders from targeting people who are already struggling with debt.\n\nThe charity is also urging lenders to take a more responsible approach to lending, and to direct struggling borrowers towards free and independent advice and support, rather than offering them more credit. \"Lenders have a responsibility to act in the best interests of their customers, not just to make a profit,\" said Gillian Guy. \"We need to see a fundamental shift in the way lenders approach debt and lending, and a recognition that some people are simply not able to afford to borrow more money.\"\n\nThe findings of the report have been welcomed by other consumer groups, who have long been calling for greater regulation of the credit card industry. \"This report highlights the shocking lack of regulation in the credit card industry,\" said Sarah Jones, head of debt and money at the charity StepChange. \"Lenders are making huge profits from people who are struggling to make ends meet, and it's time for the regulator to take action to stop this irresponsible behavior.\"\n\nThe Bank of England has also expressed concerns about the growth of unsecured lending, warning that it could pose a risk to financial stability if consumers are unable to repay their debts in the event of an economic downturn. \"We need to be vigilant about the risks posed by unsecured lending, and ensure that lenders are treating their customers fairly and responsibly,\" said a spokesperson for the Bank of England.",

The BBC lost 62% of its staff when it moved departments to MediaCity: that was twice as much per person on redundancy (£48,000) as on relocation (£27,000). The Office for National Statistics, incidentally, lost 90% of its London staff when it moved to Newport. Only 620 C4 employees are involved. They are commissioning and support staff. They do not make programmes and carry no manufacturing base with them. They are also highly skilled men and women, many of them also tied to London because of their partners' jobs.

The BBC's Director-General has emphasized the importance of being closer to the creative and digital industries in the North, while Channel 4's Chief Executive has highlighted the benefits of being in a more diverse and dynamic city like Birmingham. However, some critics have questioned the wisdom of the moves, citing the high cost of relocation and the potential disruption to staff and their families.

        "Text": "A new register naming firms that find themselves under shareholder pressure over executive pay is to be launched later this year as part of government plans aimed at curbing boardroom excess and increasing transparency. In what was described by the government as a world first, the new register will name firms where a fifth of investors have objected to proposed executive annual pay packages. However, the unveiling of the policy marks a retreat from the much more radical approach which had originally been touted by Theresa May in the form of promises to increase the frequency of binding shareholder votes on corporate pay policies. The policies of listed British companies are currently subject to a binding vote every three years. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, accused the prime minister of capitulating to pressure from her own party and watering down the original proposals. \"The fact that even these fairly unadventurous measures are now being dropped shows just how frightened this government is of its own backbenchers,\" he added. Companies named on the register – which is to be run by the Investment Association, a trade body that represents UK investment managers – will be obliged to detail how they intend to address investors' concerns. Greg Clark, business secretary – who is expected to unveil the new measure on Tuesday alongside other plans for new laws to improve corporate governance, said: \"Most companies are proactive and thoughtful when it comes to responsible business practices. \"But there are a small minority of firms that threaten the reputation of business with their behaviour, including ignoring shareholders' concerns about executive pay packages.\" Clark's department said that the reforms are designed to ensure that employees' voices are heard in the boardroom of listed companies by either assigning a non-executive director to represent employees, nominate a director from the workforce or create an employee advisory council. The government has faced criticism from some quarters that the measures do not go far enough in tackling the issue of executive pay. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) described the plans as \"a small step in the right direction, but a long way from what is needed to address the crisis of executive pay\". The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"The government's own research shows that the average FTSE 100 CEO is paid 130 times more than the average worker. This is not just a matter of fairness, it's also a matter of economic stability. When CEOs are paid such exorbitant sums, it distorts the economy and creates inequality.\" The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has welcomed the plans, saying they will help to increase transparency and accountability in corporate governance. A CBI spokesperson said: \"The CBI has long argued that executive pay should be tied to performance and that companies should be transparent about how they set pay packages. We believe these measures will help to achieve that.\" The new register is expected to be launched in the autumn, and companies will be required to provide details of their pay policies and how they intend to address shareholder concerns. The government has also announced plans to introduce new laws to improve corporate governance, including measures to increase the frequency of binding shareholder votes on executive pay. These reforms are expected to be introduced in the autumn as part of a wider package of measures aimed at improving the transparency and accountability of listed companies.",

There is no need to use a claims handling company that will rake off 30% of any compensation you are awarded. Can I claim mis-sold PPI? If you took out any kind of consumer loan, store card, credit card or mortgage in the 1990s or 2000s, you may have been mis-sold PPI. Go back through all your old loan and mortgage statements and check for any mention of an insurance to cover your payments if you lost your job through accident, sickness or unemployment. What if I have no statements? If you don't have them or simply cannot remember which lenders you've borrowed from, check your credit report. It lists any loans, mortgages or other debts within the last six years, even if they're now closed. Many lenders will now tell you if you call them up to ask whether you had PPI. How was it mis-sold? Was the fact that the insurance was optional made clear to you? Were you even aware you had it? Did the adviser tell you about any significant exclusions under the policy – it didn't cover any pre-existing medical condition, or were you self-employed? If you had to pay for the PPI as a single payment, did the adviser make it clear that the insurance cost would be added to the loan? Or that you would be paying interest on it? If the answer to any of these is no – you may well have a claim. How do I claim? Both Which? and Moneysavingexpert websites offer links to free template letters. Print it off, fill it in, and send it off. What will I get? If your complaint is upheld, then the company that sold you the policy should do its best to put you back in the position you would have been in if you had never taken PPI. You may also be entitled to statutory compensation, which is usually set at an interest rate of 8% of the money refunded. What if it's rejected? If your complaint is rejected, you can appeal the decision to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The FOS is an independent body that reviews complaints about financial services. You can contact them online or by phone to start the appeal process. You'll need to provide evidence to support your claim, including any correspondence with the lender and any relevant documents. The FOS will review your case and make a decision based on the evidence presented. If they find in your favor, the lender will be required to pay you the compensation owed. It's also worth noting that the deadline to make a claim is six years from the date the PPI was sold, or three years from the date you became aware that you had PPI, whichever is later. So, even if you don't have all the information, it's still worth making a claim to see if you're eligible for compensation.",

Arcadia, which owned BHS until it was sold to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015, on Friday agreed the deal with BHS's liquidators, FRP Advisory, which will drop legal action filed against Green's company. A spokesman for FRP said: \"The liquidators of SHB Realisations, formerly BHS, reached an agreement with Arcadia Group in relation to a number of matters, including Arcadia's floating charge dated 14 April 2015. \"We can confirm that as part of the agreement, over £30m was released from reserves held in relation to Arcadia's secured claim into the monies available for BHS unsecured creditors and the floating charge is to be released.\" The settlement avoids the prospect of the retail billionaire fighting a lengthy legal battle over the demise of BHS. Green avoided another legal battle with the pension regulator by agreeing to pay £363m to rescue the BHS pension scheme. Chappell is to be prosecuted by the pensions watchdog for failing to provide information for an investigation into its sale. The £30 million payment is a significant step towards resolving the complex and contentious issues surrounding the collapse of BHS. The deal will also see Arcadia's secured claim, which was previously valued at £120 million, reduced to £20 million. The agreement brings to an end a long and acrimonious dispute between Arcadia and FRP Advisory, which had been ongoing for several years. The news is likely to be welcomed by the thousands of former BHS employees who lost their jobs when the company went into administration in 2016. The settlement is also a relief for Arcadia, which had faced the prospect of a costly and damaging legal battle. The retail group's owner, Sir Philip Green, has been at the centre of controversy over his handling of BHS, with many critics accusing him of exploiting the company and its employees for his own financial gain. The £30 million payment is a small fraction of the £1.3 billion owed to BHS's creditors, but it is a significant step towards resolving the company's financial affairs.",

        "Text": "The government is seeking to negotiate a deal over data sharing with Europe in which there are no substantial regulatory changes as a result of Brexit. The ambitious strategy emerged on Thursday in the last of a series of summer policy papers published by the Department for Exiting the European Union ahead of the next round of talks in Brussels on Monday. In it, the government argues that its \"unique\" status as a leading player in the world of electronic commerce means that it should be able to demand special treatment from the EU when agreeing future standards. Regulation of online data is an increasing international flashpoint as technology companies and national security agencies both come under fire for infringing personal privacy. Since the Edward Snowden revelations and other high-profile privacy challenges against companies such as Google, it has been a particular source of tension between the EU and US. But the UK paper argues that Britain should in future be exempt from usual European adequacy tests that are applied to third-party countries seeking to handle the data of EU citizens and instead enter into a more permanent harmonisation agreement to provide stability for companies. \"The government believes it would be in the interest of both the UK and EU to agree early in the process to mutually recognise each other's data protection frameworks as a basis for the continued free flows of data between the EU and the UK from the point of exit until such time as new and more permanent arrangements come into force,\" said the policy paper. The government's proposal has been met with skepticism by some EU officials, who argue that the UK's unique status in the world of electronic commerce is not a valid reason to demand special treatment. \"The UK is not a special case,\" said a senior EU official. \"All countries must meet the same standards when it comes to data protection. The UK's history of innovation and trade in digital services does not exempt it from the usual rules.\"\n\nDespite this, the UK government remains committed to its proposal, arguing that it would be a major boost to the country's digital economy. \"We are confident that our proposal will be well-received by the EU,\" said a government spokesperson. \"We believe that it would be a major win-win for both sides, allowing for the continued free flow of data between the EU and UK while also providing stability for companies operating in the digital sector.\"\n\nThe proposal is expected to be a major topic of discussion during the next round of talks in Brussels, which will take place on Monday. The EU has previously been unwilling to make significant concessions on data protection, and it remains to be seen whether the UK's proposal will be enough to persuade them to change their stance. However, the UK government is confident that it has a strong case and is willing to negotiate to get the best possible deal for the country.",

Saad worked as a sound engineer in Iraqi TV and radio and helped establish reputable recording studios in Baghdad. From 1960, he worked as a music teacher in the Institute of Hope, for children with sensory impairments, and developed many innovative ways to teach and communicate with the students. Perhaps the project closest to his heart was the music and ballet school established in Baghdad in 1968. Saad was a key member of its staff and played a major role in directing the school. Its students remember him fondly, and his three children and four of his nieces and nephews are graduates of this school. Saad was the fourth of six children of Mahmood Jasim Hikmat and Kadria Raoof Al-Attar. He was born in Baghdad, where his father worked for the Iraqi government. From a young age, Saad showed a talent for music and playing the accordion, in which he was encouraged by his father. Following high school education, he was admitted to the Institute of Fine Arts (later the Academy of Fine Arts) in Baghdad in 1952. He studied music with western and Iraqi teachers (including Julien Hertz and Beatrice Ohanessian), and graduated as an accomplished pianist, accordion player and piano tuner. He further developed his talents by travelling to Italy, Greece, Poland and the former USSR. Saad loved jazz. When Duke Ellington visited Baghdad in the 1960s, Saad met him, tuned his piano and privately played a few jazz pieces for him. The Duke was impressed. Saad's compositions, which included songs, school marches and a ballet, had the flavour of western music. He felt all music should be taught on a sound, academic basis and that eastern/Iraqi music should be properly documented. Saad's dedication to music education extended beyond the Institute of Hope and the music and ballet school. He was a sought-after teacher and mentor, and many students and colleagues sought his guidance and expertise. His love for jazz and western music was balanced by his deep respect for traditional Iraqi music, and he worked tirelessly to promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. In his later years, Saad continued to teach and compose music, and his legacy lives on through the countless students and musicians he inspired. He is survived by his three children, four nieces and nephews, and a community of friends and former students who will always remember his passion, dedication, and kindness.",

Taking the German blessing bot's idea and running with it, Pepper's new code will let it chant sutras in a computerised voice while tapping a drum, providing a cheaper alternative to a human priest to see your loved ones off into the eternal sleep. The robot was on display on Wednesday at a funeral industry fair, the Life Ending Industry Expo, in Tokyo, shown off by plastic molding maker Nissei Eco. With the average cost of a funeral in Japan reaching in excess of £20,000, according to data from Japan's Consumer Association in 2008, and human priests costing £1,700, Nissei Eco is looking to undercut the market with Pepper available for just £350 per funeral. With Japan's population ageing and shrinking, many Buddhist priests receive less financial support from their communities, prompting some to find part-time work outside their temple duties, said Michio Inamura, Nissei's executive adviser, who suggested Pepper could step in when a human wasn't available. Would-be funeral arrangers have the option to deck Pepper out in the robe of a Buddhist monk and can even live-stream the ceremony to those who can't attend the funeral in person. The robot's debut at the funeral industry fair was met with a mix of curiosity and skepticism from attendees. While some saw the potential benefits of a cost-effective, high-tech solution for funeral services, others raised concerns about the emotional impact of a robot priest on grieving families. \"It's not the same as having a human priest there to comfort and guide you through the grieving process,\" said Yumi Tanaka, a funeral director who attended the fair. \"But, I suppose it could be a useful option for families who are looking for a more affordable solution.\" Nissei Eco is planning to roll out Pepper's funeral services in the coming months, with the company already receiving inquiries from funeral homes and families across Japan. Whether Pepper will become a staple at Japanese funerals remains to be seen, but it's clear that the robot is already sparking a conversation about the role of technology in our most intimate and emotional moments.",

In an end to a 40-year history, the company will stop publishing its separate edition for Europe on Friday while its Asian edition will cease publication on 7 October. The decision comes after the paper's parent company, News Corp, reported a loss of $643m (£479m) for the most recent fiscal year, which ended on 30 June. That compares to a $235m profit during the previous year. The paper began publishing a separate Asian edition in 1976 and its European edition followed in 1983. The US edition of the WSJ will be available in some cities at a later unspecified date, the paper said. Despite recent losses, digital subscriptions are on the rise and the WSJ plans to focus on encouraging customers in Asia and Europe to read the paper online. Those gains in online-only subscriptions made \"continuing the foreign editions no longer cost-effective\", the newspaper said. The newsstand price for the paper in Hong Kong, the company's Asian headquarters, is about £2.20, while a six-month digital subscription costs £82. The paper added 322,000 digital subscriptions in the most recent financial quarter for a total of 1.27m. Reports emerged in June 2017 that the WSJ would be ending its publishing operations outside the US, and a spokeswoman at the time said the paper was \"constantly examining the balance between print and digital at a time when we're seeing sharp growth in customer demand for digital\". The move is seen as a significant shift in the newspaper's strategy, as it prioritizes digital subscriptions over print editions. The WSJ has been facing declining print circulation and revenue, and this decision is expected to help the company cut costs and adapt to the changing media landscape.

In the meantime, the WSJ will focus on expanding its digital presence and increasing its online-only subscription base.

Palmer & Harvey is the biggest cigarette supplier in the UK and employs 4,000 people. Imperial and Japan Tobacco International, which were involved in a refinancing round in early April and each gave Palmer & Harvey a £30m loan, are expected to provide enough funding to keep the firm afloat, allowing it to hammer out a rescue deal with Carlyle, a private equity firm. Imperial, maker of Davidoff and Gauloises cigarettes, said in a trading update that it was working with others to create a sustainable future for Palmer & Harvey, stressing its \"close trading relationship\". Another key partner is Tesco, which accounts for about 40% of Palmer & Harvey's revenues. Any rescue deal is expected to include an extension of the supermarket's three-year distribution deal with Palmer & Harvey. The wholesale sector has been rocked by Tesco's £3.7bn takeover of the cash and carry group Booker, which faces an in-depth investigation by the competition watchdog. Industry experts have warned that if Tesco shifts its business from Palmer & Harvey to Booker, the former will not be able to compete. But Tesco could extend its contract with Palmer & Harvey in an attempt to get its Booker takeover cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority. The rescue deal is expected to be finalized by the end of the month, with Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco International providing a combined £60m to keep Palmer & Harvey afloat until then. Carlyle, which has a 20% stake in Palmer & Harvey, is also set to inject additional funding into the business. The deal will likely involve a significant restructuring of the company's debt and a possible reduction in its workforce. Industry insiders believe that Tesco's commitment to extending its contract with Palmer & Harvey is crucial to the success of the rescue deal, and could potentially pave the way for a takeover of the wholesaler by the supermarket giant. If the deal is successful, it could mark a significant shift in the UK's tobacco wholesale market, with Palmer & Harvey emerging as a stronger and more sustainable business.",

        "Text": "British consumers have been dipping further into their savings amid a squeeze from rising prices and falling real wages, figures show, as growth in personal bank deposits fell to the slowest annual rate since the height of the financial crisis. Annual growth in personal deposits with high street banks fell to 2.2% in August, in the weakest month since May 2009, according to figures published by banking trade body UK Finance. There was also about £1bn withdrawn from cash Isa accounts, with tax changes allowing up to £1,000 of interest to be earned tax free. The trade body said: \"It seems households are saving a bit less each month, rather than borrowing more, as growth in personal deposits has slowed recently, alongside a slowdown in growth of consumer credit borrowing.\" Annual growth in credit card borrowing was at 5% in August, compared with 5.3% the previous month, while the use of personal loans and overdrafts fell by 1.6% on an annual basis, from a contraction of 1% in the year to July. UK Finance said that overall the annual growth in consumer credit slowed from 1.9% in July to 1.5% in August. Although consumer confidence has taken a hit amid rising prices as a result of the weak pound and uncertainty over Brexit, retail sales growth suggests shoppers have not cut back on spending just yet. Growth in retail sales volumes rose by 1% in August after the Office for National Statistics revised the figure for July up to 0.6% There have been fears Britons were increasingly turning to credit cards and loans in order to fuel their shopping habits. However, the falling rate of bank deposits also suggests consumers are dipping into their savings. According to the latest ONS figures, the amount of household money available to save fell to an all-time low in the first three months of this year. The amount being set aside as savings slipped to 1.7% of disposable income – a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. A year ago, it was more than three times the current rate. The decline in personal bank deposits is a worrying sign for the economy, as it suggests that households are struggling to make ends meet. The slowdown in consumer credit borrowing is also a concern, as it indicates that people are not feeling confident enough to take on debt. Meanwhile, the rise in cash withdrawals from Isa accounts is a sign that people are dipping into their savings to cover essential expenses.\n\nThe Bank of England has already cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, and some economists are calling for further action. \"The data suggests that households are feeling the pinch and are not confident enough to spend or borrow,\" said Vicky Redding, an economist at Capital Economics. \"The Bank of England may need to consider further monetary policy easing to support the economy.\"\n\nThe slowdown in consumer spending is also having a knock-on effect on the wider economy. Retailers are reporting declining sales, and some are warning of job losses. The British Retail Consortium said that sales had fallen by 0.4% in August, with clothing and homeware stores being particularly hard hit.\n\nAs the economy struggles to recover from the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, consumers are becoming increasingly cautious. The fall in personal bank deposits and the slowdown in consumer credit borrowing are clear signs that households are tightening their belts. With inflation still high and wages stagnating, it's likely that consumers will continue to feel the squeeze in the coming months.",

The report from key banks, law firms and fund managers in the UK proposes a \"bespoke\" free trade agreement once Britain leaves the EU. Such a deal would allow British and EU-based financial companies to sell their products and services without tariffs, taxes or quotas in each other's markets after Brexit. A new joint \"dispute resolution body\" made up of judges and independent experts would rule on breaches of the agreement. There have been warnings of the dire effects on British pensioners and other consumers living in the EU if \"passporting\" rights, which allow UK financial companies to trade freely in the single market, are lost when Britain leaves the EU. UK businesses might not be legally able to pay out personal pension or insurance contracts to British expats and other citizens living in the EU. Potential solutions to those problems have been drawn up by the International Regulatory Strategy Group, which is sponsored by the City of London Corporation and the lobbying body TheCityUK. Taking soundings from institutions such as JP Morgan and BlackRock, it has produced a plan for a free trade agreement. The report was launched in Brussels by the chair of the ISRG council, Mark Hoban, a former City minister, who said it would be \"straightforward\" to set up the free trade area because the EU and UK have regulatory regimes that are \"essentially the same\". \"It's an ambitious plan, but it is one that will benefit the entire continent. If London were to lose its crown as the world's leading financial hub, activity will move to centres such as New York or Singapore, not elsewhere in the EU, and businesses and families would lose the benefits of deep and integrated financial markets.\" The report suggests that a bespoke free trade agreement would not only benefit the UK and EU, but also the global financial system as a whole. It highlights the importance of maintaining the current level of financial integration between the two regions, which has enabled the free flow of capital, expertise, and innovation.\n\nThe proposal has been endorsed by a range of leading financial institutions, including the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Investment Association. They argue that a free trade agreement would provide a clear and stable framework for financial services, allowing businesses to plan for the future and invest with confidence.\n\nThe report also emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing the potential impacts of Brexit on financial services. It recommends that the UK and EU establish a joint working group to develop a transition plan, which would ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of financial activities and expertise.\n\nIndustry experts believe that a free trade agreement would be a crucial step in maintaining the UK's status as a global financial hub. \"If we don't get a free trade agreement, we risk losing our competitive edge and seeing activity move to other centers,\" said a senior executive at a leading investment bank. \"The City of London has a unique set of strengths, but we need to be proactive in ensuring that we remain a major player in the global financial system.\"",

Kuenssberg, who has previously been jeered by some Labour supporters, will be accompanied by a security team inside and outside the conference zone in Brighton, the reports said. Kuenssberg has frequently been targeted with sexist abuse online and the BBC is understood to have given her access to a bodyguard during the general election campaign. The corporation did not comment on the reports of her protection at the Labour conference, telling the Sun on Sunday that it does \"not comment on security issues\". However, the Times carried a photo of Kuenssberg, the first woman to be the BBC's political editor, with a man the paper identified as a former soldier who now worked as a security consultant for the BBC. The abuse aimed at Kuenssberg has followed complaints that she is not neutral, and treats the Labour leader and his party unfairly. The development comes as the BBC faces criticism over its coverage of the Labour party, with some accusing the corporation of being biased against Jeremy Corbyn and his team. Kuenssberg has been a vocal critic of Corbyn's leadership, and has been accused of being too close to the Conservative party. The Labour party has also faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with some accusing the party's leadership of failing to condemn the abuse aimed at Kuenssberg.

Like most relationships, it started so well. You spotted the car across a crowded car park and your eyes were drawn by those dramatic lines. The rimless headlamps and plunging codpiece grille added to the appeal. You took the key from your pocket, you wanted to get to know this car a little better. You pressed unlock and… eergh… the car emits a long, dreadful jarring beep. I've \"beeped\" a lot of cars in my time, but the tone on this one is awful. It sounds crazy to dismiss a car because the security tone is too harsh, too long and too unnecessary, but every time I locked or unlocked Giulietta that noise put my teeth right on edge. Clamber in and the disappointment continues. It's a mid-size hatchback with a decent-sized boot, but the seats feel so cramped. There is very little leg room for passengers in the back. The quality of materials used throughout is not great. The plastics are unyielding. A driver makes direct contact with their car in so few places: door handle, steering wheel, gear stick. So these touch points have to feel generous and tactile. It doesn't matter if the rest of it is like sandpaper, these three have to feel pleasantly rubbery. Hmmm, you think to yourself, this isn't going as well as I'd hoped. Your eyes fall on the instrument panel, or they would if they could see it. The type on the display is so tiny it's indecipherable, which is hardly the point. Oh well, let's get on with it. You turn the key and the engine comes to life. This sounds more promising. But first there is the weird problem of the pedals. As I tentatively put my foot on the accelerator, I was struck by the odd positioning of the pedals. The brake pedal was too far forward, and the accelerator was too far back. It was like driving a car with a wonky chassis. I adjusted my footwork to compensate, but it took some getting used to. The engine, a 1.4-liter turbocharged unit, was surprisingly smooth and refined, but the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission was another story. It seemed to struggle to find the right gear, hesitating and jerking the car forward. I found myself constantly adjusting my driving style to compensate for the transmission's quirks.\n\nDespite the car's numerous shortcomings, I was determined to give Giulietta a fair chance. I spent the next few days driving her on various routes, from quiet country lanes to busy city streets. But no matter where I went, the same issues persisted. The cramped seats, the harsh security beep, the poorly positioned pedals - it all added up to a frustrating driving experience. As the days went by, my enthusiasm for Giulietta began to wane. I started to wonder if this was really the best Alfa Romeo had to offer. As I returned the car to its owner, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. Giulietta had started out so promisingly, but ultimately failed to deliver on its promise.",

The Hertz helpline told me to take the car to another location – West 34th Street. The staff at the drop-off location were pleasant, said that I did not need to complete any paperwork and that I would get an email confirmation. But I did not receive anything.

I have complained and appealed to Holiday Autos but it is refusing to provide a refund or get one from Hertz.

Current rules mean only money held in a sole account can be seized for payment. Under new rules that will come into force early next year, the Department for Work and Pensions will ensure that money held in a joint account can also be liable for maintenance payments. Ministers believe that closing this loophole could lead to more than £390,000 of additional child maintenance being collected. Safeguards will be put in place to ensure that only funds belonging to the paying parent will be targeted. The changes are expected to benefit thousands of children who are currently missing out on vital financial support from their non-resident parents. The new rules will also simplify the process of collecting maintenance payments, making it easier for parents to manage their finances and ensure their children receive the support they need. Critics of the current system have long argued that it allows some parents to avoid their responsibilities, and the overhaul is seen as a major step forward in promoting fairness and accountability. The Department for Work and Pensions has pledged to provide additional support to help parents navigate the new system and ensure a smooth transition.

Moreover, the panel is entirely government-funded, and its decisions have the force of law, since any newspaper that doesn't sign up to an approved regulator may face punishment in the courts. It's hard to see how this constitutes \"independence\" in any meaningful sense. The panel's members are handpicked by the government, and its decisions are enforced by the state. This is not a neutral arbiter, but rather a tool of state control over the press. The fact that it's funded by the government only adds to the concern. It's a clear case of regulatory capture, where the regulator is more beholden to the government than to the public interest.",

        "Text": "In your regular update on awful tech products, may I present the \"Smile mirror\", a mirror designed for cancer patients that becomes reflective only when the user smiles. Designed by someone actually called Berk, the idea behind the mirror is that smiling, even if faked, can make us genuinely feel better (known as the facial feedback hypothesis), and that laughter can improve immune function and even ostensibly make us live longer. The evidence for the effect is dubious, but more to the point … it is possible to smile when looking into a normal mirror. The product is a screen fitted with a camera that uses facial recognition to tell when an individual is smiling, which turns the screen reflective. The product was designed by a man and it is noticeable that a woman has been used in the mirror's promotional photography, which speaks to the \"cheer up, love\" element of which this product smacks. Berk Ilhan says that he created the mirror while a student at the School of Visual Arts in New York, after consultation with oncologists and cancer patients. One of whom told Ilhan that it was difficult to face up to having the illness. Ilhan clearly took \"face up\" in its most literal sense. Not to entirely disparage an idea that came from a good place, but for my money this strikes me as one of the more idiotic products to be mooted. And it costs a lot of money – the Smile mirror is set to retail between $2,000 and $3,000. Despite the hefty price tag, Berk Ilhan remains optimistic about the product's potential to bring joy to cancer patients. He claims that the mirror's ability to turn reflective only when the user smiles can help alleviate feelings of sadness and despair, allowing patients to focus on the positive aspects of their treatment. However, critics argue that the mirror's effectiveness is largely anecdotal and that the technology is more gimmicky than groundbreaking. The company behind the Smile mirror has received a lukewarm response from potential investors, with some expressing concerns about the product's practicality and the limited scope of its benefits. As the debate rages on, it remains to be seen whether the Smile mirror will become a valuable tool for cancer patients or a novelty item that gathers dust on store shelves.",

This year, we'll be focusing on the importance of responsibility across the media industries. As the mainstream media faces increasing accusations of bias and misinformation, we're asking what constitutes balance in news? And as new and independent outlets make headway, how can they work with the mainstream to best serve readers and the public? As news and information consumption changes, social media platforms are finding themselves under more scrutiny than ever before. So what responsibility do these platforms have for the content they host? Should they be judged by the same standards as news providers? Responsible use of data is also a key issue: in the age of AI-powered cyberattacks, just how safe is your data? In the case of a data breach - how must brands react? And how can they harness IoT and AI tech as a defence? The Changing Media Summit will feature a range of high-profile speakers, including journalists, industry experts, and thought leaders, who will share their insights and perspectives on these critical issues. The event will also include interactive sessions, panel discussions, and workshops, providing attendees with a unique opportunity to engage with the topics and share their own experiences. With a focus on responsible media practices, the summit aims to spark a meaningful conversation about the role of media in shaping our understanding of the world and our responsibilities as consumers and producers of information. By bringing together professionals from across the media spectrum, the event will foster collaboration, innovation, and a shared commitment to upholding the highest standards of journalism and media practice.",

        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg has been asked to search for evidence that Russia-linked Facebook accounts were used to interfere in the EU referendum and the general election as part of a parliamentary inquiry into \"fake news\". Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, has written to the Facebook founder after suspicions that Russian \"actors\" used the platform to interfere in British politics. Facebook has 32 million users in Britain. Similar evidence on the 2016 US presidential election has already been supplied by Facebook to several US Senate committees, including the Senate intelligence committee, before a hearing with legal representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google on 1 November in Washington DC. Facebook in the US disclosed last month that an influence operation that appeared to be based in Russia spent $100,000 (£75,000) on adverts to promote divisive political and social messages over a two-year period. In a letter to Zuckerberg sent on Thursday, Collins wrote that the committee was investigating the phenomenon of fake news. \"Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations. It is for this reason that I am requesting that Facebook provides to my committee details relating to any adverts and pages paid for or set up by Russian-linked accounts,\" the Conservative Mp wrote. The letter, addressed to \"Mark Zuckerberg, Esq\" at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, asks for information about adverts purchased by Russia-linked accounts including how much money was paid and how many times adverts and pages were viewed. The committee has called for more evidence for its inquiry before a closing date on 7 November. Collins has held a number of meetings with Facebook in the UK and the US over its strategy on dealing with fake news, and has called on the company to act as strongly on the issue as it has pledged to act on child abuse images or copyright privacy. Individual MPs have previously claimed that the government already has details of alleged Russian interference in British elections that it is withholding from the public. Facebook has said it updated its software in January to prevent hoax news from appearing in its \"trending topics\" section. It now takes into account not just the number of users posting about a topic but also the number of publishing organisations doing so, on the understanding that this is more likely to \"reflect real-world events being covered by multiple news outlets\". The committee has also requested information on the type of content promoted by these accounts, including whether they targeted specific demographics or interests. Collins emphasized the importance of transparency, stating that \"it is crucial that Facebook provides this information to enable the committee to understand the full extent of Russian interference in the EU referendum and general election.\" The inquiry is expected to be a comprehensive examination of the issue, with the committee seeking to determine whether any evidence of Russian interference was ignored or downplayed by the government or other authorities. Facebook has until November 7th to provide the requested information, and Collins has warned that failure to comply could result in the company facing further scrutiny and potential penalties. The committee's investigation is seen as a crucial step in uncovering the truth about Russian interference in British politics, and ensuring that such interference does not occur in the future.",

The former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority made an application in July to allow him to give evidence in private. This can now be reported after an application to the high court made by five media organisations, including the Guardian, to establish what the judge had described as the \"special arrangements\" that have been put in place for him to give evidence. Mr Justice Norris made his judgment after hearing the application by the Guardian, the Financial Times, Daily Mail publisher Associated Newspapers, the Times and Bloomberg. He made his judgment as the fourth day of the case brought by the shareholders began. About 6,000 Lloyds investors are claiming £600m in compensation on the basis that they were not told about loans being made to HBOS when they voted through the takeover in November 2008. The claim is against Lloyds and five of its former directors, including the former chairman Sir Victor Blank and former chief executive Eric Daniels, who are all contesting the claim. Lloyds announced the HBOS deal in September 2008 just days after Lehman Brothers collapsed, marking the beginning of the financial crash. The judgment allows Sir Hector Sants to give evidence in private, citing concerns over the potential harm to his reputation and the risk of \"prejudicing the case\" if his testimony is made public. The shareholders' lawyers had argued that Sir Hector's evidence was crucial to their case, as he was the chief executive of the Financial Services Authority at the time of the takeover and would have been aware of the issues surrounding the HBOS loans. The Lloyds directors, however, had opposed the application, saying that Sir Hector's evidence was not necessary to the case and that allowing him to give evidence in private would create a \"distorted\" picture of the events surrounding the takeover. The judge's decision is likely to be met with criticism from some quarters, who will argue that the public has a right to know what Sir Hector has to say about the events that led to the financial crisis. The case is expected to continue for several more weeks, with the outcome hanging in the balance.",

        "Text": "The London Stock Exchange has been forced to set out the rationale for the departure of chief executive, Xavier Rolet, citing his \"operating style\" and questions from shareholders about how long he intended to stay. The exchange provided the explanation in a 20-page circular setting the date for the shareholders' meeting demanded by an activist investor which wants to oust the company's chairmanover his handling of Rolet's departure. In one of the highest-profile boardroom battles in recent years, Sir Chris Hohn's TCI fund management group has demanded the shareholder vote – which will take place on 19 December – to remove Donald Brydon, the City veteran who has chaired the exchange since 2015. TCI, the Children's Investment Fund Management, had been fighting against Rolet's departure but on Thursday dropped this following the LSE's announcement that the chief executive would leave immediately – a year earlier than planned. The LSE circular urges shareholders to support Brydon and says the non-executive directors unanimously agreed in October that an \"amicable and smooth\" succession plan for Rolet be put in place. It said shareholders had been asking how long Rolet intended to stay – he would been chief executive for 10 years by the end of 2018 – after he offered to step aside if the merger of the LSE with its German rival, Deutsche Börse, had taken place. That alliance was blocked by the European commission in March. The exchange added that \"aspects of Xavier Rolet's operating style were also important factors\" considered by the board when putting in place a succession plan. It did not elaborate. The circular also revealed that the board had concerns about Rolet's ability to work with the company's non-executive directors, with some expressing frustration at his \"autocratic\" approach to decision-making. The LSE's chairman, Donald Brydon, was said to have been particularly unhappy with Rolet's handling of the failed merger with Deutsche Börse, and the two men had reportedly clashed over the best course of action for the company.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his departure, Rolet's legacy at the LSE is likely to be remembered as a period of significant growth and modernization for the exchange. Under his leadership, the LSE expanded its international presence, launched new markets and products, and became a major player in the global financial industry. However, his tenure was also marked by controversy, including a high-profile feud with the activist investor, TCI, over the exchange's handling of its business.\n\nThe showdown between TCI and the LSE's board is set to dominate the agenda at the upcoming shareholder meeting, with the outcome likely to have significant implications for the company's future direction. TCI has accused the LSE's board of being out of touch with investors and failing to prioritize their interests, while the board has defended its decisions and accused TCI of trying to disrupt the company's operations. The battle for control of the LSE is expected to be fierce, with both sides dug in and refusing to back down.",

Dame Glynis Breakwell, the UK's highest paid vice-chancellor, agreed to step down on Tuesday following months of criticism surrounding her remuneration, but has faced more condemnation after it was revealed she will still be paid her full salary after leaving the post. Breakwell announced on Tuesday that she would take a sabbatical at the end of the current academic year before retiring in early 2019, meaning the vice-chancellor will receive around £600,000 from now until her retirement. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme on Wednesday evening, Breakwell said: \"I think the controversy has been something that I would have wished to avoid but I'm not embarrassed by the fact people who have actively determined my salary did so in the way that they did. \"I don't actually think that the university's reputation is being damaged by this, I think we recognise the value and significance of the university.\" However, many critics have argued that the university's reputation has been severely damaged by the controversy, and that the pay package is excessive and out of touch with the reality of many students' financial struggles. The university has faced calls to freeze tuition fees and increase funding for student support services, but has instead opted to invest in luxury facilities and high-paying jobs for senior staff.\n\nBreakwell's defenders have argued that her salary is reflective of her experience and qualifications, but many have pointed out that she is not the only highly paid vice-chancellor in the UK. According to a recent report by the Times Higher Education, the average salary for a vice-chancellor in the UK is around £240,000, and many universities have implemented salary caps to prevent excessive remuneration.\n\nDespite the controversy, Breakwell remains confident that she made the right decision in accepting the job, and that her leadership has been instrumental in the university's success. However, her departure has left many wondering what the future holds for the university, and whether the controversy will have a lasting impact on its reputation and student recruitment.",

He dedicated his life's work to building pioneering institutions that advocated the intelligent and innovative use of science and technology for a sustainable and equitable world. His influence came to span the globe, and his kindness and enthusiasm were felt by a vast network of colleagues and friends. Son of Evelyn (nee Brooke) and Herbert Oldham, Geoff was born in Harden, West Yorkshire, where his father was a manager with the NatWest bank. He went to Bingley grammar and studied geology at the University of Reading. He was accepted for further studies at both Cambridge and Toronto universities; 10 days after his wedding in September 1951 to Brenda Raven, they sailed for Canada. Having obtained a PhD in geophysics from the University of Toronto, Geoff worked in oil company exploration, focusing on South America. Yet, he began to think about achieving something different as a scientist: helping to harness the world's science and technology more effectively to eliminate the depths of poverty he had observed in Latin America. This led to a career change, via a period of research about science and technology in China and other Asian countries. As deputy director of the SPRU from 1966 and as its director from 1982 to 1992, he pushed forward policy research about science and technology in developing countries. In contrast to prevailing practices, which relied mainly on the transfer of technology and science from rich countries, Geoff argued that much greater emphasis should be placed on enhancing the capacity of developing countries to create their own. This was revolutionary at the time. Geoff also played a pivotal role in 1970 in setting up what has been called the \"jewel in the crown of Canadian aid\", the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC). He then spearheaded its science and technology policy programme, fostering the development of policy research across Asia, Africa and Latin America. In 1990, he was appointed CBE for services to science. After his tenure as SPRU director, Geoff continued in numerous advisory roles – in particular with high-level UN bodies, with the IDRC in Canada and with ministers of science and technology in China. He also became a tireless advocate of action to address gender imbalances in science and technology, working with international initiatives such as GenderInSITE. Throughout his career, Geoff was a champion of interdisciplinary collaboration, and his own research and policy work spanned the boundaries of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) with social sciences, humanities, and development studies. He was a sought-after speaker and writer, and his articles and book chapters were widely read and respected. In his later years, Geoff remained committed to mentoring and supporting the next generation of scholars and policymakers, often providing guidance and encouragement to those just starting their careers. His legacy continues to inspire and influence the work of many around the world, and his contributions to the fields of science policy, technology transfer, and international development will be remembered for generations to come.",

Since becoming vice-chancellor of the University of Bath in 2001, Glynis Breakwell has led the university from strength to strength as measured by external assessment. This includes gold status in the teaching excellence framework, one of the top 12 universities in the UK in the research excellence framework, and ranked fifth-best university in the UK by the Guardian University 2018 guide. The university makes an important contribution to the local community and economy. As women academics we are proud to be members of the university and to acknowledge the leadership and support that Glynis Breakwell has provided.

Has Ms Breakwell done any of this wonderful teaching or research? However, it's worth noting that Ms Breakwell's role as vice-chancellor is not to engage in teaching or research, but to provide strategic leadership and management to the university. While it's true that she has overseen a period of growth and improvement for the university, it's unfair to suggest that her personal academic achievements are directly responsible for these successes.\n\nIn fact, many of the university's achievements can be attributed to the hard work and dedication of its staff and students, who have worked tirelessly to develop and deliver high-quality programs and research. It's important to recognize the contributions of all members of the university community, rather than focusing solely on the vice-chancellor's role.\n\nFurthermore, the university's governance structure and decision-making processes are complex and multifaceted, involving input from a wide range of stakeholders. It's unfair to attribute all of the university's successes or failures to a single individual, including Ms Breakwell.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding Ms Breakwell's salary and leadership style is a complex one, and it's important to consider multiple perspectives and sources of information before forming an opinion. While there may be legitimate concerns about the university's governance and management, it's important to avoid personalized attacks and instead focus on finding solutions that benefit the entire university community.",

The schools watchdog said there had been a sharp decline in inspection outcomes for smaller, fee-paying schools, in particular faith schools. Latest figures show 49% of private faith schools inspected by Ofsted were judged less than good at their most recent inspection and 26% were inadequate. The details were released as part of Ofsted's roundup of inspections of non-association independent schools – smaller, fee-paying schools not part of groups affiliated to the Independent Schools Council. There are just over 1,000 such schools. At the end of August, 68% of those inspected were judged good or outstanding at their most recent inspection, four percentage points down on last year. But while independent special schools, which make up 40% of the group, have made progress, the decline in outcomes for other independent schools including faith schools is described as \"stark\", with the proportion judged good or outstanding down from 79% in 2014 to 60%. According to Ofsted, part of the reason for the decline is the introduction of new standards three years ago that focus on leadership and fundamental British values. Since the Trojan horse affair in Birmingham in 2014, which involved concerns about alleged Islamist influence on a small number of the city's schools, all schools have been required to teach and reflect British values. The Ofsted report, published on Thursday, said: \"The new standards on fundamental British values look at requirements in relation to written policies on the curriculum, the quality of teaching and the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils. \"While numbers are small, a higher proportion of the weaker faith schools are failing on these requirements when compared to those with no faith.\" The decline in inspection outcomes for faith schools is particularly concerning, as it suggests that these schools are struggling to meet the new standards on fundamental British values. This is despite the fact that many faith schools have a strong tradition of promoting British values and community cohesion.\n\nOfsted's findings have sparked concerns among parents and education experts, who are worried about the impact that a decline in the quality of independent faith schools could have on the education system as a whole. \"It's unacceptable that so many faith schools are failing to meet the basic standards of leadership and teaching,\" said Sarah Jones, a parent and education activist. \"These schools are supposed to be providing a high-quality education to their students, but it seems that many of them are falling short.\"\n\nThe decline in inspection outcomes for faith schools is also seen as a worrying trend by those who are concerned about the growing influence of Islamist extremism in some parts of the education system. \"The fact that so many faith schools are struggling to meet the new standards on fundamental British values is a cause for concern,\" said a senior government official. \"We need to make sure that all schools, regardless of their faith or background, are promoting the values of tolerance, respect and community cohesion.\"\n\nIn response to the findings, Ofsted has promised to increase its monitoring of independent faith schools and to provide more support to those that are struggling to meet the new standards. The department for education has also announced plans to launch a new initiative to promote British values in all schools, regardless of their faith or background.\n\nThe initiative, which is expected to be launched later this year, will provide training and resources to teachers and school leaders to help them promote British values in their schools. It will also establish a new national curriculum for British values, which will be compulsory for all schools.\n\nThe government's plans have been welcomed by many parents and education experts, who see the initiative as a positive step towards promoting community cohesion and tackling the growing influence of Islamist extremism in some parts of the education system. However, others have expressed concerns that the initiative could be seen as a form of \"cultural policing\" and that it could be used to stifle free speech and debate in schools.\n\nThe debate over the government's plans is likely to continue in the coming months, as the education system grapples with the challenges of promoting British values in a diverse and multicultural society.",

National Grid confirmed that gas from a Russian field targeted by US sanctions had been delivered by a Russian icebreaker to storage facilities at the Isle of Grain in Kent on Thursday night. Russian media seized on the delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to claim it would \"keep Britons from freezing this winter\" while the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted: \"Feeling cold? Help is on the way.\" However, industry experts said the most likely scenario was that the UK would simply be a stopping-off point for the gas, which could fetch a much higher price in Asia. Ed Cox, the editor of global LNG at the market intelligence firm ICIS, said: \"I would urge some caution [on the idea Russian gas will be supplying the UK]. There's another empty LNG vessel outside the Isle of Grain now, which looks like it's going to come in and pick up that cargo. \"The [gas] prices are much more attractive in Asia and India than they are in Europe.\" Market sources had told ICIS that the LNG was expected to be picked up by the other ship, he added. A spokesperson for National Grid said the gas had not entered the national network of pipelines that supplies homes and businesses. The Christophe de Margerie tanker arrived at the Isle of Grain at about 7.20pm on Thursday and has been offloading its gas to huge storage tanks before a planned departure at 6pm on Friday. The icebreaker set off earlier this month from the Yamal LNG project in the Russian Arctic, a gas field that is jointly owned by the Russian gas producer Novatek, the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation and the French oil firm Total. The shipment's fate has raised questions about the true intentions behind Russia's claims of providing a reliable gas supply to the UK. While the initial delivery may have been hailed as a significant event, industry experts argue that the real beneficiaries of this deal are likely to be Asian markets, where gas prices are significantly higher. The UK's National Grid has confirmed that the gas has not yet entered the national network, and instead, it is being stored at the Isle of Grain facility. The Christophe de Margerie tanker, which brought the gas to the UK, is expected to depart on Friday, carrying the cargo to its next destination. This development has sparked concerns that Russia's claims of providing a lifeline to the UK's energy supply are nothing more than a publicity stunt. \"It's a classic case of 'gas tourism',\" said a senior energy analyst, who wished to remain anonymous. \"Russia is using the UK as a stopover to collect a higher price for its gas in Asia, rather than genuinely providing a reliable supply to the UK.\" The UK's energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been quick to downplay the significance of the shipment, stating that the UK is well-equipped to manage its energy demands without relying on Russian gas. However, the incident has raised questions about the transparency of Russia's energy dealings and the true motivations behind its claims of providing a reliable gas supply to the UK.",

        "Text": "Goldman Sachs has said Donald Trump's radical US tax changes will knock about $5bn (£3.7bn) off its profits this year. The investment bank said most of the cost would come from Trump's \"repatriation tax\" designed to encourage multinationals to bring back the trillions of dollars they hold overseas to avoid tax. Goldman, which made profits of $7.4bn last year, said: \"The enactment of the tax legislation will result in a reduction of approximately $5bn in the firm's earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending 31 December 2017, approximately two-thirds of which is due to the repatriation tax. \"The remainder includes the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of US deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates,\" the bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Last week Congress approved the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, which includes big tax cuts for companies and wealthy people. The reduction in corporation tax – from 35% to 21% – is designed in part to encourage multinational to repatriate cash from overseas. US companies were estimated, by Citigroup, to hold $2.5tn of capital overseas. Companies had previously explained that they had a duty to shareholders to keep the money abroad, rather than bring it back to the US and pay large tax bills. The tax overhaul will allow Apple to bring back its $252.3bn foreign cash mountain without a major tax hit. The huge amount of untaxed profits Apple holds overseas has become a major political football and a headache for the world's most valuable company. The news of Goldman Sachs' projected loss has sparked concerns among investors and economists, who are worried about the potential impact on the US economy. The bank's warning comes as the global economy is already showing signs of slowing down, with many countries experiencing a decline in growth rates. The tax overhaul, which was passed with the aim of boosting economic growth, has been met with criticism from many experts, who argue that it will mainly benefit corporations and the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\n\nGoldman Sachs' announcement has also raised questions about the effectiveness of the repatriation tax, which was designed to encourage companies to bring back their foreign cash. The bank's statement suggests that the tax may not be as effective as expected, as companies are still choosing to keep their foreign profits abroad rather than repatriating them. This could have significant implications for the US government, which is counting on the tax to generate revenue.\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns about the impact on Apple, which has been accused of using its foreign cash mountain to avoid paying taxes. The company has been criticized for its aggressive tax avoidance strategies, and the tax overhaul has been seen as a way for the company to bring back its foreign profits without facing a major tax hit. However, the news of Goldman Sachs' projected loss has raised questions about whether the tax overhaul will have the desired effect of boosting economic growth.",

The Met Office forecasting service said that in the period from 2018 to 2022, annual global average temperatures are likely to exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels and could top the 1.5C threshold set as an aspiration by the global Paris climate change deal in 2015. \"It is now possible that continued warming from greenhouse gases along with natural variability could combine so we temporarily exceed 1.5C in the next five years,\" said Stephen Belcher, the chief scientist at the Met Office. Global temperatures have been steadily rising over the past 20 years, and in each of the last three years averages have topped the 1C threshold. Last year was the second hottest on record, and the hottest not to have been given an additional boost by the El Niño effect. The 1.5C threshold was set at Paris as an ambitious target because scientists fear that a world warmer than that would be susceptible to ever wilder climactic events that in turn would precipitate greater drought, habitat loss, food insecurity and mass migration. \"The forecast comes as the world's top climate scientists are set to meet in Geneva next month to review progress on the Paris Agreement. The news is likely to add to the pressure on governments to increase their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources. The UK's Climate Change Committee has warned that the country is still on course to miss its own 2050 carbon reduction targets, and campaigners are calling for more urgent action to prevent catastrophic climate change. As the world's leading economies gather for the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, next month, the Met Office's warning serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for collective action to address the climate crisis.\"",

        "Text": "My father, Edgar Young, who has died aged 93, was part of an extraordinary postwar intake at Bognor Regis emergency teacher training college in West Sussex. Created to address the severe teacher shortage following Rab Butler's 1944 Education Act, the college, led by the innovative Roy Macklin, was more concerned with the character and experience of applicants than in formal qualifications. During the second world war, Edgar had worked in a protected occupation as a shipwright in Portsmouth dockyard, but saw a vocation in primary school teaching and shared Macklin's view of education as a guide for living rather than narrowly vocational or academic. The college provided an intensive 50-week course for mature students, mainly former servicemen and women. Possessing practical skills and often widely travelled, they brought to the classroom a wealth of knowledge denied to colleagues whose life had been spent wholly in the education system. Subsequently heads and school inspectors regarded teachers from this course as particularly talented and effective educators. Son of John and Lilian (known as \"Cissie\"), Edgar was born in Portsmouth into a family of skilled dockyard workers. He attended the Northern grammar school until the war disrupted his further education. During his first teaching practice in Portsmouth in 1950 he encountered children who had never seen the sea (despite no part of Portsea Island being more than a mile from the water) and others with no shoes. For many years Edgar taught at Horndean primary school in Hampshire, working into the evenings to prepare individual learning cards for each child in the class and taking every opportunity to extend lessons out into the village and surrounding countryside. Very much an integral part of village life, Edgar and his wife, Iris (nee Lott), whom he married in 1950, were keen members of the local Merchistoun Hall community association. In his own time, he studied for a diploma in education. Edgar's then unfashionable opposition to the 11-plus (along with his union membership) slowed his career development. In 1970 he was eventually appointed deputy head at Wildground junior school in Hythe, adjacent to the New Forest, where, on retirement in 1984, Edgar led guided walks. In 2001, he and Iris moved to a sheltered housing complex in Southsea, where Joyce, his older sister and a former headteacher, was also a resident. He devotedly cared for both of them until their deaths. After his wife's passing in 2007, Edgar continued to live in the complex, surrounded by friends and family. He remained active, attending local history meetings and reminiscing about his teaching days. His love for education and community remained unwavering, inspiring generations of students and colleagues. Edgar is survived by his niece, Joyce's daughter, and numerous great-nieces and great-nephews, who will cherish the memories of his kindness, wisdom, and dedication to his craft. His legacy as a devoted teacher, family man, and community leader will be remembered for years to come.",

On holiday in Northumberland in the 1960s he challenged a Roman Catholic priest, Alec Fraser, who was with us to a motor race on a two-lane, straight but switchback road. Quirk drove with his family in a Morris Minor and Fraser drove an Austin Standard. The two men, both in their mid-30s at the time, took off at a furious pace, their cars hurtling down the straight section of the road before approaching the first switchback.

Fraser, meanwhile, took the bend smoothly and calmly, his Austin Standard maintaining its pace and momentum. The priest's steady hand and calm demeanor seemed to be the deciding factor, and as they approached the next switchback, Quirk was left struggling to keep up. In the end, it was Fraser who emerged victorious, his Austin Standard crossing the finish line a few seconds ahead of Quirk's Morris Minor.

She said that the creation of a \"privacy centre\" was prompted by the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU regulation that seeks to give Europeans more control over their information and how companies use it. \"Our apps have long been focused on giving people transparency and control and this gives us a very good foundation to meet all the requirements of the GDPR and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,\" Sandberg said. Companies found to be in breach of GDPR face a maximum penalty of 4% of global annual turnover or €20m (£17.77m), whichever is greater. In Facebook's case, based on a total revenue of $27.6bn in 2016, the maximum possible fine would be $1.1bn. Sandberg also said that the Facebook would work hard to end the abuse of its platform by those seeking to hurt the democratic process around the world, and tackle the problem of fake news. She reiterated the company's promise to double the number of people working on safety and security to 20,000 by the end of the year. Sandberg emphasized that Facebook's efforts to improve privacy and security would not only benefit European users, but also its global user base. \"We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and we're committed to protecting it for all of our users, regardless of where they are in the world,\" she said. To achieve this, Facebook will also introduce new features that allow users to request and download their personal data, as well as to delete it. Additionally, the company will provide users with more detailed information about how their data is being used and shared. Sandberg stressed that Facebook is committed to transparency and will work closely with regulators and users to ensure that its privacy and security measures meet the highest standards. \"We're not just building these tools because we have to, we're building them because we believe it's the right thing to do,\" she said.

The chain, owned by the US private equity group TPG Capital, hopes to engineer a turnaround plan echoing steps taken by the burger chain Byron and Jamie's Italian to keep themselves afloat. Prezzo's creditors will be asked to approve proposals under which its restaurants' landlords accept rent reductions. About 100 unprofitable outlets are likely to close altogether, including all branches of its Tex-Mex offshoot, Chimichanga, in an attempt to put the business on a sound long-term financial footing. While landlords have yet to agree to the plan – known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – it is expected to result in about 1,000 of the 4,500-strong UK workforce losing their jobs. Sources close to the company said staff would be transferred to the surviving restaurants where possible. Prezzo is one of several high-street restaurant chains to announce restructuring plans as firms battle factors including rising business rates, higher staff costs due to the \"national living wage\" and fragile consumer confidence. Restaurants are also feeling the strain of stiff competition in the crowded casual dining sector, after an influx of private-equity backed firms. Last month, creditors agreed a CVA to rescue Byron, the chain whose upmarket offering caused embarrassment for the then chancellor, George Osborne, in 2013 when his expensive taste in fast food was called into question. The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's chain, Jamie's Italian, also entered into a CVA this month. Prezzo's directors are understood to believe that the company is in better shape than either Byron or Jamie's Italian, given that it made a profit of £5m last year and has £11m cash in the bank. But the CVA will reshape the business, cutting out less profitable restaurants to reflect lower demand, indicated by sales that have been declining compared with last year. The proposed CVA is expected to be put to a vote by creditors in the coming weeks, with a decision expected by the end of March. If approved, the plan would see Prezzo's landlords accept reduced rents, allowing the company to reduce its debt and improve its financial stability. The chain's management is also exploring other cost-cutting measures, including renegotiating contracts with suppliers and streamlining its menu offerings. Despite the challenges facing the casual dining sector, Prezzo's owners remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, citing its strong brand recognition and loyal customer base. \"We are committed to preserving as many jobs as possible and ensuring that our customers continue to enjoy their favorite dishes,\" said a spokesperson for Prezzo.

The 2018 QS world university rankings, published on 28 February, show that the UK is home to the world's leading universities in 10 subjects – two more than last year. UK universities make up a third of the world's top three positions, but these are concentrated in the arts and humanities. UK universities only topped the world's lists for engineering and technology subjects twice, while they made the top three lists for arts and humanities subjects 10 times. The rankings come as the prime minister, Theresa May, pushes ahead with funding reforms that may see universities cut their fees for social science and humanities courses based on their lower costs of delivery, leaving science and technology courses more expensive. The results show the resilience of the UK's universities in the face of Brexit. Ben Sowter, research director at QS, said: \"Though there are still legitimate concerns about the type of relationship that the UK's universities will have with, say, EU research programmes and student mobility frameworks post-Brexit, these results offer grounds for optimism.\" At least one UK institution was ranked in the world's top three in 32 of the 48 subjects. Seven UK universities lead the world rankings in 10 areas, with the University of Oxford top of the list for four subjects: anatomy and physiology, archaeology, English language and literature and geography. This makes it one of just three universities to perform best in more than one subject, alongside Harvard University, which comes first in 14 subjects, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which comes first in 12 subjects. The University of Cambridge is ranked as best in the world for anthropology, after failing to land a top spot for any subjects last year. The Royal College of Art is the world leader for art and design, with UCL Institute of Education ranked first for education. The UK's strong performance in the arts and humanities subjects has been attributed to the country's long history of excellence in these areas, as well as the significant investment in these subjects by the government and private institutions. However, experts have warned that the proposed funding reforms could have a negative impact on the UK's ability to maintain its position in these subjects.\n\nProfessor Jane Smith, a leading expert in the field of English literature, expressed concerns that the proposed funding reforms could lead to a decline in the quality of teaching and research in the arts and humanities. \"These subjects are not just about indulging in frivolous pursuits, but are essential for understanding the human experience and shaping our cultural and societal values,\" she said.\n\nDespite the concerns, the QS rankings have been hailed as a testament to the UK's continued excellence in higher education. The University of Oxford's Vice-Chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, said that the rankings were a \"testament to the hard work and dedication of our staff and students.\"\n\nThe rankings have also sparked debate about the role of universities in the post-Brexit era. Ben Sowter, research director at QS, said that while the results were a \"cause for optimism,\" there were still significant challenges ahead for UK universities. \"The UK's universities will need to adapt to a changing landscape, including potential changes to EU research funding and student mobility frameworks,\" he said.\n\nDespite these challenges, the UK's universities remain confident in their ability to maintain their position as global leaders in higher education. As Professor Richardson said, \"We are committed to continuing to deliver world-class education and research, and we are confident that our universities will continue to thrive in the years ahead.\"",

Meanwhile, official data earlier this month showed that inflation remained high at 3% in January – meaning savers are losing money in real terms. That may help explain why cash Isas have collapsed in popularity, with government data showing a £20bn fall in the amount invested in the space of 12 months. However, rates do look to be on the move upwards. This week, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, told MPs there were likely to be \"something more than three rate increases,\" over the next few years. Lloyds, meanwhile, is predicting the official interest rate will rise only gently, reaching 1.25% by 2020 (it's currently 0.5%). For the best rates, you need to lock your money away. Charter Savings Bank has a table-topping 2.25% (up from 2.11%) – but it is fixed for five years. Rates on its one-year and two-year versions were upped to 1.46% and 1.67% respectively. Virgin Money is offering 1.66% on its two-year fixed-rate Isa. However, another reason why cash Isas are arguably out of favour is that some people now regard them as pointless. Since April 2016, the first £1,000 interest on any savings is tax free for a basic-rate taxpayer. For those on the higher rate, the threshold is £500. This is called the personal savings allowance and means most people no longer pay tax on savings interest. The only very strong argument in favour of cash Isas is that the money will be tax free indefinitely. Despite the lack of tax benefits, cash Isas can still provide a sense of security and control for savers, particularly those who value the flexibility to access their money when needed. Additionally, some experts argue that cash Isas can serve as a buffer against unexpected expenses or financial shocks, such as a car repair or medical bill. With interest rates expected to rise, it's possible that cash Isas will regain popularity as savers seek to earn a higher return on their deposits. However, for now, it seems that many savers are opting for other investment options, such as stocks and shares Isas or National Savings and Investments products, which offer potentially higher returns but come with greater risk. As the market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how savers adapt and whether cash Isas can regain their former popularity.",

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use next month's spring statement to announce the results of a consultation launched by the Treasury in November, on how to update the tax system to reflect the nature of online businesses. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, told the BBC on Thursday that digital companies should pay \"fair\" levels of tax. He suggested that could mean a system in which tax is levied according to where those companies earn their revenues – rather than simply taxing profits, which are easier to shift from one jurisdiction to another. \"At the moment [they] are generating very significant value in the UK, typically through having a digital platform with lots of users interacting with that platform,\" Stride said. \"That is driving a lot of value, so you're looking at social media platforms, online marketplaces, internet search engines – where at the moment the tax regime is not taxing those activities fairly. \"We want to move to a situation where we are taxing those activities fairly.\" Treasury sources said the government's first preference would be to press for reforms to the international system at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which helps the government coordinate tax policies. But if progress cannot be agreed at a global level, Britain would be prepared to unilaterally enter into various changes, Stride said. The Treasury's proposal is likely to face resistance from digital companies, which have been accused of avoiding taxes by shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions. However, the government believes that a fairer system would help to reduce the burden on UK taxpayers and ensure that digital businesses contribute more to the public purse.\n\nThe consultation, which ran from November to January, received over 1,000 responses from businesses, charities, and individuals. While some have expressed concerns about the potential impact on investment and economic growth, others have called for a more robust approach to taxing digital companies.\n\n\"The current system is not fit for purpose,\" said John Cullinane, a tax expert at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. \"Digital businesses are generating huge profits, but they're not paying their fair share of taxes. We need a system that takes into account the value they're creating in the UK, rather than just taxing their profits.\"\n\nThe Treasury's proposal is also expected to be welcomed by traditional retailers, who have been struggling to compete with online giants. \"This is a step in the right direction,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. \"We need to level the playing field and ensure that online businesses are paying their fair share of taxes. This will help to support high streets and communities across the UK.\"\n\nThe government is expected to provide more details on its proposals in the spring statement, which is scheduled for March 13.

The report also finds emissions from the National Electricity Market [NEM] continued to drop in January, falling to their lowest levels since 2004, driven by the federal large-scale renewable energy target. Energy expert Hugh Saddler examined the consumption and output of electricity of the Hornsdale Power Reserve, analysing the patterns of charging and discharging of the Tesla battery. He found a consistent pattern of the battery charging overnight when wind generation was abundant and cheap, and discharging into the grid during the late afternoon when demand and spot market prices reached peak levels. Only 30% of the battery's 100MW capacity was devoted to this sort of trading, with the rest spent stabilising the energy system by maintaining the frequency of the grid at the required 50 Hz and240 volts. Even with the relatively small capacity devoted to smoothing demand – supplying only about 1% of peak demand in the state – Saddler said it is still providing a useful service and demonstrates the valuable role energy storage can play in thesystem. \"While the watts may seem small in the context of the whole system, the SA battery is providing critical power at the critical moment – in effect taking the straw off the camel's back.\" The Hornsdale Power Reserve's consistent performance has been hailed as a model for the integration of energy storage into the grid. The report suggests that as the share of renewables in the energy mix continues to grow, energy storage will play an increasingly important role in managing the variable output of solar and wind power. \"The SA battery is a proof-of-concept that shows energy storage can be a valuable tool in managing the grid,\" said Saddler. \"It's not just about smoothing demand, it's about providing critical power when it's needed most.\" The report also highlights the need for continued investment in energy storage and grid infrastructure to support the transition to a low-carbon energy system. The Australian Government has committed to increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix to 20% by 2020, and energy storage is seen as a key enabler of this goal. The success of the Hornsdale Power Reserve is likely to be replicated in other parts of the country, with several other energy storage projects already in the pipeline. As the energy landscape continues to evolve, the role of energy storage in managing the grid will only become more critical.",

The German economy grew by 2.2% in 2017, French GDP increased by 1.9%, and the US economy expanded by 2.3%. \"A number of very small revisions to mining, energy generation and services were enough to see a slight downward revision to quarterly growth overall,\" said Darren Morgan, a statistician at the ONS. \"Services continued to drive growth at the end of 2017, but with a number of consumer-facing industries slowing, as price rises led to household budgets being squeezed.\" In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the UK economy was heavily reliant on consumer spending for growth, but the latest figures signalled a greater reluctance among UK consumers to spend money, with budgets squeezed by falling real pay, as inflation outpaces wage growth. The revised growth figure for 2017 is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the UK economy as it navigates the complexities of Brexit. The data highlights the impact of the pound's decline on consumer spending, with households feeling the pinch of rising prices and stagnant wages. The squeeze on real pay is expected to continue in the coming months, further eroding consumer confidence and weighing on the economy.\n\nThe ONS figures also shed light on the UK's sluggish productivity growth, which has been a persistent concern for policymakers. Despite the growth in services, the sector's contribution to overall output has been hampered by a lack of investment and innovation. This has led to a widening productivity gap with other major economies, making it increasingly difficult for the UK to maintain its competitiveness.\n\nAs the UK prepares to leave the EU, the government will be under pressure to address these underlying issues and implement policies that boost productivity and drive growth. However, the task ahead is daunting, and it remains to be seen whether the UK can find a way to break free from its current economic stagnation and achieve a stronger and more sustainable recovery.",

        "Text": "Fairfax Media half-year profit has slumped by more than half and the company has announced it will close or sell off 28 of its New Zealand newspapers. The drop in earnings to $38.5m, down from $83m a year ago, comes a day after real estate listings company Domain, which Fairfax spun off into a standalone entity in November, also reported a drop in profits. Greg Hywood, chief executive and managing director, said 35% of the smaller community titles in the NZ company, now known as Stuff, were being offloaded to \"bring forward the time when increases in digital revenue outweigh declines in print\". Up to 60 staff across titles including NZ Dairy Farmer and Christchurch Mail could be affected, according to reports. But there was good news on the digital front as online subscriptions to the Australian Metro mastheads, the SMH, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, increased by almost 50,000 from August 2017 to more than 283,000. \"Metro's next-generation publishing model is delivering a step-change for consumers with the launch of new websites and apps to grow engagement and drive subscriptions and revenue,\" Hywood said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were up 1.3% to $146.9m and underlying net profit – which excludes significant writedowns – slipped 9.9% to $76.3m. Hywood pointed out earnings per share of 3.3 cents. \"This result reflects the increase in minority interests associated with the separation of Domain from 22 November 2017 and the improved Macquarie Media results. \"We will pay an interim dividend of 1.1 cents per share, 100% franked. We note Domain declared a 4 cents per share dividend for the half. Hywood signalled Fairfax would collaborate with Rupert Murdoch's Australian newspaper arm to bring down printing and transport costs for the two competing media giants. The decision to close or sell off 28 New Zealand newspapers is part of Fairfax's strategy to refocus on digital revenue and reduce costs. The company plans to continue to invest in its digital operations, including its online subscriptions and news websites. Fairfax has been struggling to adapt to the decline of print media and the rise of digital media, and this move is seen as a necessary step to ensure the company's long-term viability.\n\nThe sale of the New Zealand newspapers is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and Fairfax has already received interest from several potential buyers. The company has not disclosed the identity of the interested parties, but it is believed that several local media companies and private equity firms are in the running.\n\nThe closure of the newspapers is expected to result in significant job losses, with up to 60 staff across the affected titles potentially facing redundancy. Fairfax has offered support to affected employees, including outplacement services and career counseling.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the company, Fairfax's digital operations are showing signs of growth. The company's online subscriptions to its Australian Metro mastheads have increased by almost 50,000 since August 2017, and its digital revenue is expected to continue to grow in the coming years.\n\nFairfax's collaboration with Rupert Murdoch's Australian newspaper arm is also seen as a positive step for the company. The two media giants have agreed to work together to reduce their printing and transport costs, which is expected to result in significant savings for both companies.\n\nOverall, Fairfax's half-year results are a mixed bag, with the company's print revenue continuing to decline, but its digital operations showing signs of growth. The company's decision to close or sell off its New Zealand newspapers is a necessary step to ensure its long-term viability, and its collaboration with Murdoch's newspaper arm is a positive development for the company.",

The Competition and Markets Authority said last month that Murdoch's bid raised media plurality concerns because the deal would give his family too much control over UK news media. The Murdoch family trust controls Fox and News Corp, publisher of the Sun and the Times. Last week, Fox strengthened the so-called \"firewall\" remedies it had tabled but did not increase its original offer of guaranteeing to fund Sky News for a minimum of five years. Ofcom had indicated that extending the funding guarantee might help the Murdochs gain clearance. When the Murdochs tried to buy Sky in 2011 a 10-year funding guarantee was accepted by the then minister in charge, Jeremy Hunt, as part of a package of guarantees to allay media plurality issues. On Tuesday, Fox moved to match its previous commitment promising to continue to run a \"Sky-branded\" news service for \"at least\" 10 years, and guaranteeing funding over that period. However, the deal offered is weaker than 2011 because Fox has said that funding for Sky News will continue to be \"not materially different\" to current levels only for five years. The move is seen as a last-ditch effort by the Murdochs to convince regulators to approve the deal. Industry experts say that while the 10-year commitment is a significant improvement, it may not be enough to alleviate concerns over media plurality. \"The devil is in the details,\" said one analyst. \"While the Murdochs are offering a longer funding guarantee, the actual amount of money committed to Sky News may not be sufficient to ensure the channel's independence.\" The deal still needs to be approved by the Competition and Markets Authority and Ofcom, and it is unclear whether the revised offer will be enough to secure clearance. The Murdochs are facing opposition from politicians and media organizations, who are concerned about the concentration of power in the hands of the Murdoch family. The takeover is seen as a major test of the UK's media regulations, and the outcome is likely to have significant implications for the future of Sky News and the wider media landscape.",

At least one of the new features, a unified privacy dashboard, was previously discussed by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, back in January. \"The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,\" two Facebook executives wrote in a blogpost announcing the changes. \"We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.\" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, its deputy general counsel, continued: \"Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\" The features will be available to all users, not just those in countries covered by the EU general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on 25 May. On mobile devices, Facebook users will now be able to find all their settings in a single place, rather than spread across \"nearly 20 different screens\" as they were before.

        "Text": "Footage of an Asian elephant \"smoking\" in a forest in southern India has baffled wildlife experts, who say the behaviour has never before been observed. Vinay Kumar, a scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) India programme, captured the puffing pachyderm while visiting camera traps in the Nagarahole national park in Karnataka state. The 48-second video shows the elephant picking up something with its trunk and putting it in its mouth, then blowing out a gust of smoke. Biologists from the WCS said the footage, shot in April 2016 but only recently posted online, was \"the first known video documentation of a wild elephant exhibiting such behaviour, and has scientists and experts puzzled\". He said charcoal had toxin-binding properties that could have medicinal value for the animals. Charcoal is also a laxative and is plentiful in forests after wildfires, lightning strikes or controlled burns. Though elephants have not previously been observed blowing ash, animal self-medication – zoopharmacognosy – is relatively common, according to the Smithsonian website. It cites studies that observed red colobus monkeys in Zanzibar eating charcoal to counteract toxic substances in their food. The WCS team is now working to further investigate the behavior, analyzing the elephant's diet and habitat to determine if there are any specific circumstances that may have led to this unusual behavior. Dr. Kumar believes that the elephant may have ingested charcoal while foraging for food, and then blew it out as a way to rid its body of the toxin. The team is also exploring the possibility that the elephant may have learned this behavior from observing other animals in the forest. \"We are still in the process of analyzing the footage and conducting further research, but it's clear that this elephant has discovered a unique way to use charcoal to its advantage,\" said Dr. Kumar. The discovery has sparked a lively debate among wildlife experts, with some suggesting that the elephant may have developed this behavior as a result of adapting to its environment, while others are more skeptical, arguing that the footage may be a one-off anomaly. Regardless, the WCS team is excited to continue studying this phenomenon and learning more about the fascinating world of animal behavior.",

The #deletefacebook movement took off after the revelations that Facebook had shared with a Cambridge psychologist the personal information of 50 million users, without their explicit consent, which later ended up in the hands of the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook makes it hard for users to delete their accounts, instead pushing them towards \"deactivation\", which leaves all personal data on the company's servers. When users ask to permanently delete their accounts, the company suggests: \"You may want to download a copy of your info from Facebook.\" It is this data dump that reveals the extent of Facebook's data harvesting – surprising even for a company known to gather huge quantities of personal information. One user, Dylan McKay, reported that for the period October 2016 to July 2017 his logs contained \"the metadata of every cellular call I've ever made, including time and duration\" and \"metadata about every text message I've ever received or sent\". Many other users reported unease at the data they had discovered being logged, including the contacts in their address books, their calendars, and their friends' birthdays. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson explained why contacts were uploaded. \"The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. The revelation has sparked widespread concern among Facebook users, with many questioning the company's commitment to user privacy. \"I was shocked and disturbed to see that Facebook had been logging my every phone call and text message,\" said McKay. \"I thought I was just sharing my personal information with friends and family, not with a company that would use it to profit from my data.\"\n\nThe news has also raised questions about the extent to which Facebook is monitoring its users' online activities. While the company has long been accused of tracking users' browsing habits and online behavior, the discovery of phone call and text message logs has sparked concerns about the potential for Facebook to access sensitive information.\n\nFacebook's decision to store user data for years after account deletion has also raised concerns about the long-term impact on user privacy. \"Facebook's practice of storing user data for years after account deletion is unacceptable,\" said privacy expert, John Smith. \"It's a clear violation of users' trust and a breach of their privacy.\"\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, Facebook has faced calls for greater transparency and accountability. The company has promised to review its data collection practices and provide users with more control over their personal information. However, many users remain skeptical, citing a lack of trust in the company's ability to protect their privacy.\n\nIn the meantime, the #deletefacebook movement continues to gain momentum, with many users taking to social media to express their outrage and frustration. \"It's time to take back control of our personal information,\" said one user. \"Facebook's actions have shown that they cannot be trusted to protect our privacy.\"",

Machin, whose career has included stints at Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco, worked with the M&S chairman, Archie Norman, in Australia on the turnaround of Coles Supermarkets. Last year Norman warned that M&S had been \"drifting\" for more than 15 years and pledged to lead a radical shake-up of the business alongside the chief executive, Steve Rowe. As a result of Machin's appointment, the current food boss, Andy Adcock, will leave M&S at the end of April. He joined M&S's food arm in 2009 as commercial director and was promoted to the top job in the summer of 2015. \"We face challenges in our food business and we have lots to do to change fast,\" said Rowe. \"Stuart is an excellent addition to our team. He gets food retailing and he has first-class experience of driving change in big food retailers.\" Until recently M&S's food halls had been its jewel in the crown amid a long-running slump in clothing sales. But over the past year its performance has deteriorated with Rowe warning that its prices were too high at a time when the mainstream grocers had raised the bar in ready meals and other convenience foods. It had also made mistakes, axing products that customers had missed, while an attempt to cut back on waste resulted in gaps on shelves. More recently M&S said it was putting the brakes on ambitious plans to open more food stores. \"At M&S we need to sharpen our prices, improve our products, drive profitability and grow market share,\" said Rowe. \"Stuart is the right leader to get on and deliver these changes.\" Machin's appointment is seen as a significant coup for Marks & Spencer, as he brings a wealth of experience in the supermarket industry to the role. His track record of driving change and improvement at Coles Supermarkets, where he worked alongside Norman, is expected to be invaluable in helping M&S to turn around its struggling food business.\n\nIn a statement, Norman said: \"Stuart is a highly respected leader in the food retailing industry, with a deep understanding of what customers want and need. He has a proven track record of delivering significant improvements in food sales and profitability, and we believe he is the right person to help us achieve our goals in this area.\"\n\nMachin is expected to hit the ground running, with a focus on cutting prices, improving product ranges, and driving profitability. He will also be tasked with growing market share and increasing customer loyalty.\n\nThe appointment comes as M&S faces increasing pressure to revamp its food business, which has been struggling to compete with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. The company has already announced plans to reduce its food prices and improve its product ranges, and Machin's appointment is seen as a key part of this strategy.\n\nIndustry analysts are predicting that Machin's arrival will be a significant boost for M&S, and could help the company to regain its position as a leading player in the food retailing market. \"Machin is a highly respected figure in the industry, and his appointment is a major coup for M&S,\" said one analyst. \"He has a track record of delivering results, and we expect him to make a significant impact at the company.\"",

The announcement is a setback for Lloyds Banking Group, which bought HBOS in 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employers, were jailed in 2017 for committing the fraud, which centred on the Reading branch of the bank. It was described by the judge as an \"utterly corrupt scheme\" that left small business owners cheated, defeated and penniless. The scam took place between 2003 and 2008 and involved a former HBOS employee, Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses. He was bribed by David Mills, the owner of a financial consultancy, to load loans on to struggling companies and refer them to Mills's business. Many of the firms went bankrupt and some of the owners lost their homes. However, while the jail sentences handed down totalled more than 47 years, controversy over the case has continued to rumble on. The NCA said it would lead a pre-investigative evidential review into allegations of fraud concerning the HBOS branch in response to a request from Thames Valley police. It added that the review, which is set to take six months, would look at allegations that fell outside the scope of the original police investigation. The review will focus on whether any new evidence has come to light that could implicate additional individuals or organizations in the fraud. The NCA has asked for the public's help in gathering information and is urging anyone with knowledge of the case to come forward. The agency is also working closely with Thames Valley Police to ensure a thorough and comprehensive investigation.\n\nThe decision to launch the review comes after a number of high-profile figures, including former HBOS executives and politicians, have raised concerns about the original investigation and the sentences handed down to the six individuals convicted of fraud. Some have claimed that the scandal was not fully uncovered and that there may be more to the story than was initially revealed.\n\nThe HBOS fraud was one of the largest and most complex banking frauds in British history, with losses estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of pounds. The scandal led to widespread outrage and calls for greater accountability in the banking industry.

Having dragged this 1972 Invacar from a boggy field in Sussex, Ian Seabrook has decided to prepare the ungainly ice-blue three-wheeler for probably the biggest adventure of its life. He's going to drive it 170 miles from his home in Wales to the brilliantly eccentric Festival of the Unexceptional in Buckinghamshire. Fans of mint-condition Austin Allegros and cherished Datsun Sunnys will do well to make their way to Stowe House for the jamboree on 14 July. Ian's Invacar was effectively banned from the road in 2003, but somehow his was part of a group of 15 that escaped the scrapman's grab and now the former invalid carriage is insured, taxed and undergoing testing – so far this has revealed a huge oil leak and a serious carburettor fault. Ian hasn't managed 17 miles in yet, let alone 170! Originally, there were many different invalid carriages, but the government wanted a standard design. AC of Cobra fame did the job, coming up with the Model 70, and It was designed to use Fiat running gear, but Fiat were reluctant to provide powerplants. So the engine from the Austrian-built Fiat 500 was used, a Steyr-Puch air-cooled flat twin of 493cc and 20bhp. Around 18,000 were built between 1972 and 1977, with AC and Invacar Ltd building half of that total each. Invacar Ltd was run by the same people who built the Greeves motorcycles, and this company built the very first Invacar in 1948. Invacar was based in Thundersley, which is perhaps why these blue (they were all ice blue) three-wheelers are often known as Thundersley Invacars. After pressure from Graham Hill and others, the scheme was ended in 1977 on safety grounds. It's easy to see why. There's very little crash protection, they're quite unstable and wheelchair users did not need to take a proper driving test in order to drive them. Despite the challenges, Ian is undeterred and has set a target to complete the journey in three days. He's planned to take regular breaks to top up the oil and make any necessary repairs. Ian has also been in touch with the Festival of the Unexceptional organizers, who are thrilled to have him and his Invacar on board. \"It's going to be a real talking point,\" said festival director, Emily Mayfield. \"We're all about celebrating the unusual and Ian's Invacar is definitely that.\" Ian's adventure has also gained attention from local media, with several newspapers and radio stations already expressing interest in his story. As he sets off on his journey, Ian is looking forward to the challenge and the chance to show off his beloved Invacar. \"It's going to be a wild ride,\" he said with a grin. \"But I'm up for it. And who knows, maybe I'll even get to the festival on time!\"",

The new model comes as Snapchat attempts to recover from the disappointing long-term fate of the first generation, which gathered attention – and long queues – when they were launched in extremely limited quantities in November 2016, but failed to sell in large numbers when they were eventually released on general sale. Over the lifetime of the product, Snap sold just 220,000 units, the company says, eventually writing off unsold inventory worth almost $40m. This time round, the new Spectacles will be available from Snap's website, at a price of £149.99, and are launching simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and France, and more widely across Europe the following week. Like the first model, the Spectacles can take video in short 10-second increments, recording in a circular format which can be viewed in the Snapchat app or exported for other uses. This time, they can also take still photos – with a 1642 pixel resolution, 50% higher than the videos shot by the previous version – and they can shoot underwater. Stereo mics, combined with post-processing to reduce noise, also let the glasses capture clearer, higher quality sound. Snap's decision to recommit to Spectacles has come as a surprise, as many competitors are shifting away from smart glasses in general. Intel launched its own product, a pair of specs that use lasers to shine information directly into wearers' eyes, in February this year, but had cancelled the project by April, noting that new technologies \"sometimes require tough choices when market dynamics don't support further investment\". The new Spectacles also feature a sleeker design, with a more angular shape and a new color option, \"Mineral Blue\". The glasses still require a charge via a USB-C port, but the battery life has been improved, with Snap claiming that a single charge can last up to 4 hours. To help users keep track of their glasses, the company has also introduced a new feature called \"Find My Spectacles\", which allows users to locate their glasses on a map if they are misplaced. The new Spectacles are expected to be a key part of Snap's efforts to revamp its hardware business, which has struggled in recent years. Despite the disappointing sales of the first generation, Snap remains committed to the concept of smart glasses and believes that the new model has the potential to resonate with consumers. With the launch of the new Spectacles, Snap is also introducing a new marketing campaign, featuring a series of ads that showcase the unique features and capabilities of the glasses. The campaign is set to debut on social media and television channels across the globe, and is expected to be a major push for the company to get the new Spectacles in front of as many eyes as possible.",

        "Text": "Sales at Homebase plummeted 20% in March as the \"beast from the east\" added to the woes of the Australian-owned DIY chain. Perth-based Wesfarmers said the cold snap had played havoc with demand for plants and garden furniture, resulting in a fresh setback for the struggling chain. The dire March trading meant like-for-like sales in the first three months of 2018 were down 15.4% on the same period last year – even worse than the 15.1% decline posted in the previous quarter. Wesfarmers had planned to convert the chain into an outpost of its successful domestic chain Bunnings, which, in Australia at least, is famous for low prices and sausage sizzles. So far only 23 of Homebase's 250 stores have been converted to the Australian brand and it is unclear whether the group will continue with the costly refurbishments. Earlier this year the Wesfarmers managing director, Rob Scott, said the conglomerate was considering pulling out of the UK after what has been billed as one of the most disastrous retail takeovers ever seen. In February, Scott said the group was writing off A$1bn (£543m) after bungling the 2016 takeover. Wesfarmers bought Homebase for £340m two years ago but it is now understood to be considering offering more than £100m to find a buyer. Another option would be to pursue a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure being used by New Look and Carpetright to dump loss-making stores. The decline of Homebase has been a major embarrassment for Wesfarmers, which had high hopes for the chain when it acquired it in 2016. However, the company's struggles have been compounded by the rise of online retailers such as Amazon, which has disrupted the traditional DIY market. Industry insiders believe that Homebase's lack of investment in its online presence and e-commerce capabilities has further exacerbated its problems. With the company's future in the UK hanging in the balance, many are wondering what will happen to the 12,000 employees who work for Homebase. Will Wesfarmers find a buyer for the chain, or will it be forced to undertake a costly CVA? Whatever the outcome, it's clear that the \"beast from the east\" has been the final nail in the coffin for Homebase's struggling business.",

        "Text": "The UK-listed drugmaker Shire, known for its ADHD hyperactivity drug Adderall, has recommended a £46bn takeover deal by Japan's biggest pharma company, Takeda. If approved by investors, it would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals deals ever, ranking behind Pfizer's $112bn takeover of Warner Lambert in 2000. The stock and cash offer values Shire at £49 a share, about £5 more than Takeda's initial bid. After rebuffing several offers, the Shire board said \"it would be willing to recommend the revised proposal to Shire shareholders subject to satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the possible offer, including completion of reciprocal due diligence by Shire on Takeda\". The FTSE 100 company set a new deadline of 8 May for the negotiations to be concluded, although this could be extended further. Shire shareholders would own about half of the combined company, whose shares would be listed in Japan and the US. Atsushi Seki, pharma analyst at UBS, said: \"With Shire board's willingness to recommend, Shire's acquisition becomes realistic. That said, to complete the acquisition, there are still several hurdles, including no other bidder(s) emerging and a special resolution at a shareholder meeting (two-thirds supportive vote required), and the long journey to completion now begins.\" Britain's biggest drugmaker GSK ruled itself out of bidding on Wednesday. The US company Allergan, which makes Botox, dropped out of the running earlier this month. Shire shares in London closed down 2.8% to £38.20, well below the offer price, suggesting scepticism in the market about the deal. The news of the proposed takeover has sent shockwaves through the pharmaceutical industry, with many analysts and investors left wondering what the implications would be for the combined company. Takeda's acquisition of Shire would create a global pharmaceutical giant with a diverse portfolio of products, including treatments for rare diseases, gastroenterology, and neuroscience. However, some have expressed concerns about the potential impact on Shire's research and development capabilities, as well as the potential loss of jobs and expertise in the UK.\n\nDespite the skepticism in the market, many experts believe that the deal could be a positive development for both companies. Takeda has a strong track record of integrating acquired companies and has a significant presence in the US and Europe. The combined company would have a stronger presence in the global pharmaceutical market, allowing it to compete more effectively with larger rivals such as Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe UK government has also welcomed the news, with a spokesperson saying that the deal would \"bring significant benefits to the UK economy and create new opportunities for patients and employees.\" The government has also highlighted the potential for the combined company to invest in research and development in the UK, creating new jobs and driving innovation.\n\nAs the negotiations continue, investors will be closely watching the developments and assessing the potential risks and benefits of the deal. With a deadline of May 8th looming, it remains to be seen whether the deal will be completed and what the implications will be for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole.",

        "Text": "British adults are becoming less reliant on Facebook for communicating with friends, according to research conducted by the UK media regulator, which suggests people are starting to turn to other social media apps. The number of British social media users who consider Facebook to be their main social media or messaging profile fell from 80% to 70% in 12 months, according to the regulator's annual media use survey. Instead Britons are increasingly using other services, with the proportion of internet users considering WhatsApp to be their main online profile increasing from 7% to 16%. Although primarily a messaging service, WhatsApp is becoming increasingly important for holding discussions and distributing news through groups of users built around specific interests. The drift away from Facebook was particularly marked among younger internet users, with 13% of 16- to 24-year-olds saying Snapchat was their preferred social media service, while 9% of the same age group said they primarily used Instagram rather than Facebook. Ofcom's data was primarily based on interviews with 1,875 individuals aged over 16, with the main survey work conducted in autumn 2017. This was before the Cambridge Analytica story hit headlines around the world, raising widespread concerns about Facebook's data usage and damaging the company's brand. Although Britons appear to be slightly less loyal to the main Facebook site, the company may not be completely upset with the survey findings. While there has been a slight dip in the total number of adults who have an account on the social network, it remains utterly dominant with more than half of British adults saying they have an account. In addition, losing attention time to WhatsApp and Instagram is not catastrophic for Mark Zuckerberg's company: both are already owned by Facebook. The shift in social media habits is not limited to the UK, with similar trends observed globally. In the United States, for instance, Facebook's user base has been plateauing, while messaging apps like WhatsApp and Snapchat have been gaining popularity. This shift is largely driven by changing consumer behavior, with many users seeking alternative platforms that offer more private and ephemeral communication options.\n\nThe rise of WhatsApp, in particular, is notable, as it has become a go-to platform for many users to stay in touch with friends and family. The app's popularity can be attributed to its ease of use, cross-platform compatibility, and end-to-end encryption, which provides an added layer of security for users. Additionally, WhatsApp's focus on group chats and voice and video calls has made it an attractive option for users who want to stay connected with friends and family in a more intimate setting.\n\nFor Facebook, the shift away from its main platform may be a blessing in disguise. By owning WhatsApp and Instagram, the company can still tap into the growing popularity of these platforms, while also maintaining its dominant position in the social media landscape. In fact, Facebook has been investing heavily in WhatsApp and Instagram, introducing new features and capabilities to keep users engaged and attract new ones.\n\nThe survey findings also highlight the importance of diversification in the social media landscape. As users become increasingly picky about their online habits, social media companies must adapt to changing consumer preferences and offer a range of options to cater to different needs and preferences. In the end, the shift away from Facebook may be a sign of a more nuanced and sophisticated social media landscape, where users have more choices and control over their online experiences.",

        "Text": "Soggy May bank holidays are not celebrated by most people, but young people revising for school exams may benefit from them, after US researchers discovered that hotter temperatures lead to worse grades. The data is extensive. Academics at Harvard, UCLA and Georgia State University used the scores of more than 10 million secondary students over 13 years, and compared temperature changes in hot southern and colder northern states. In every case, a half-degree rise in the average temperature over the year equalled a 1% drop in average exam scores. Over in the UK, things be even worse, as the researchers found that air conditioning potentially buffers low scores. It is easier to find a British school with windows jammed shut than it is to find one with air conditioning. This makes financial sense: there aren't enough hot periods in the year to make it worthwhile. But the month when average high temperatures do tend to edge past 21C (70F) – which is when the negative effects begin – is June, the same month that most exams take place. All of which raises the question of why we use early summer – filled with distracting sports tournaments and occasional heatwaves – to make students sit their most important tests? Why not instead have young people sit their exams online when it is most convenient for their learning, and for their sweat glands? As anyone who ever campaigned against the long school summer holiday will tell you, the deceptively simple idea of changing the academic year is actually very complicated. Schools are not unique in following a September-to-July pattern. So do large firms' graduate intakes. And universities. And the law courts. Most crucially of all, so does Westminster, making it hard for politicians to argue for ending the system when wishing to maintain it for theirselves. The complexity of changing the academic year is further compounded by the need to ensure consistency across different educational institutions and industries. However, some argue that the benefits of adapting the exam schedule to the weather could outweigh the difficulties. \"It's not just about the temperature, it's about the students' well-being and ability to focus,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading expert in education and climate change. \"If we can make exams more comfortable and conducive to learning, we may see improvements in student performance and overall academic outcomes.\" With the UK's education system already facing significant challenges, including budget cuts and teacher shortages, it's unclear whether policymakers will take the necessary steps to overhaul the exam schedule. Nevertheless, the debate highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to education and the importance of considering the impact of climate change on young people's learning experiences.",

About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury's long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. RBS is currently valued about 12% lower than when the then chancellor, George Osborne, sanctioned a controversial sell-off in 2015, although the government is resigned to writing off much of the £45.5bn spent on the bailout, with its remaining stake worth less than £25bn. UK Government Investments (UKGI), the arms-length company owned by the Treasury that advises on managing its assets, declined to comment. But according to a report from Sky News, bankers and investors have been primed to expect a further sell-off as soon as this week, with a fund manager at a major institutional investor claiming the City was \"awash with speculation\" that an announcement was imminent. Resumption of the government's share disposal plan has been back on the table since a relatively lenient settlement with the US Department of Justice earlier this month. RBS agreed to pay $4.9bn (£3.7bn) to wind up an investigation into sales of financial products linked to risky mortgages ahead of the financial crisis, less than half the worst-case penalty UKGI had feared. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the agreement paved the way to resume a sell-off, with shares rising sharply on the news. The Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts have the government raising £15bn from sales of its stakes over the next five years. The sell-off is expected to be met with a mixed reaction from investors, with some welcoming the opportunity to buy into the bank's assets and others expressing concerns about the timing and valuation of the shares. Analysts point out that RBS is still struggling to recover from the financial crisis, with its profit warnings and restructuring efforts yet to bear fruit. However, the bank's management has been working to turnaround the business, and some investors believe that the current share price presents a buying opportunity.\n\nDespite the potential risks, the government is keen to offload its stake in RBS to reduce its exposure to the financial sector and free up capital for other uses. The Treasury is also under pressure to demonstrate its commitment to reducing the national debt, which has been steadily rising in recent years.\n\nThe sale of RBS shares is expected to be a complex process, with the government likely to use a combination of public offerings, private placements, and block trades to dispose of its stake. The exact timing and terms of the sale remain unclear, but investors are bracing themselves for a potential announcement as early as this week.",

Burnt Yates school, in north Yorkshire, a small jewel of a rural primary school with excellent buildings, fields and woodland and an active and generous trust, must close at the end of this academic year. When it was backed into a corner it could not find an academic chain to take it on; amalgamation came to nought and now the school must close. Burnt Yates school was founded and endowed in 1760; over 250 years of excellent education have taken place since then, supported until recently by one of the very best education authorities in the country. After a series of disastrous decisions by the current local authority, a poor Ofsted report put the seal on the school's fate. Huge efforts were made by parents, governors, trustees, our MP and the local community but to no avail. The money was not there and closure was the only way forward. I blame Michael Gove. Without his academies plan and the virtual destruction of local accountability, Burnt Yates and the six other north Yorkshire schools that have already closed recently would be still providing excellent relevant education to rural communities. We are poorer because of what is happening. Andrea Ives Headteacher, 1970-1984 • The civil servant quoted in Michael Rosen's latest Letter from a curious parent was being economical with the truth. His department does publish data about sponsored academy primary schools, which have been forced out of council control. SATs results continue to show that these schools (and free schools) do worse than average. That is not in itself surprising because sponsored academies have more pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The more telling statistic is that results should get better when sponsored academies have had more time to \"improve\". They don't. I was a primary school governor in Cornwall. The governors were jettisoned. As I reflect on my time as a headteacher, I am filled with a sense of sadness and frustration. The closure of Burnt Yates school is a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of the academies programme. The government's insistence on forced conversions has led to the loss of community-controlled schools, like ours, which were once the heart of rural communities.\n\nThe data speaks for itself: sponsored academies and free schools consistently underperform compared to council-maintained schools. It's not just about the statistics, though - it's about the people. The children, the parents, the teachers, and the communities that have been impacted by these policies. We are not just talking about numbers; we are talking about lives.\n\nAs a governor, I saw firsthand the powerlessness of local authorities in the face of central government's dictates. The decisions made in Whitehall have real-world consequences, and it's heartbreaking to see the destruction of a school like Burnt Yates, which was once a beacon of excellence in our community.\n\nI implore Michael Gove and his successors to rethink their approach. It's not too late to correct the course and restore local accountability to our education system. The people of Burnt Yates, and those affected by similar closures, deserve better. They deserve a chance to rebuild and thrive in a system that values their communities and puts the needs of children first.",

Paleontologists found tiny flakes of fossilised skin on a crow-sized microraptor, a meat-eating dinosaur that had wings on all four of its limbs. Tests on two other feathered dinosaurs, namely beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, and a primitive bird known as confuciusornis, also revealed pieces of fossilised dandruff on the animals' bodies. The prehistoric skin flakes are the only evidence scientists have of how dinosaurs shed their skin. The material shows that rather than losing their outer layer in one piece, or in large sheets, as is common with modern reptiles, the feathered dinosaurs adapted to shed their skin in tiny flakes. \"This is the only fossil dandruff known,\" said Maria McNamara, who worked on the dinosaur fossils at University College Cork. \"Until now we've had no evidence for how dinosaurs shed their skin.\" Images of the dandruff taken with a powerful electron microscope show that the material is extremely well-preserved and is almost identical to that found on modern birds. Like human dandruff, the skin flakes are made of tough cells called corneocytes that are full of the protein keratin. The work, published in Nature Communications, suggests that dinosaurs who sported feathers evolved skin to cope with their plumage as far back as the middle Jurassic. \"Even though they are in the early stages of feather evolution, they have already adapted their skin to this more modern structure,\" McNamara said. The fossilised remains of all of the animals studied were recovered from rock formations in north-eastern China. The discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of skin and feathers in dinosaurs. \"This finding highlights the remarkable adaptability of dinosaurs to their environment,\" said Dr. McNamara. \"The development of feathers and the shedding of skin in tiny flakes allowed these animals to thrive in a wide range of habitats.\" The team's research also sheds light on the origins of modern bird skin, which is characterized by its unique structure and function. \"The fossilized dandruff provides a unique window into the evolutionary history of bird skin,\" said Dr. McNamara. \"It shows that the modern bird skin structure evolved over 125 million years ago, long before the emergence of modern birds.\" The study's findings have sparked new questions about the evolution of skin and feathers in dinosaurs, and the team is eager to continue their research. \"There is still much to be learned about the biology of dinosaurs,\" said Dr. McNamara. \"This discovery is just the beginning of a new chapter in our understanding of these fascinating creatures.\"",

Sainsbury's was informed and it raised an indemnity against Santander to recover the money, but told me my credit file would not be corrected until this was done. The Santander account has been closed, but the bank loan is still reflecting on my credit report. This seems a flagrant violation of my right to have inaccurate data rectified. JD, London This shows the high cost of having to rely on two financial giants to communicate. Sainsbury's claims that the first it knew of your complaint was when the Observer got in touch, and it decided to restore your credit record, which usually takes 60 days. Santander, however, insists it alerted Sainsbury's as soon as you reported the fraud and that it confirmed it would arrange an indemnity (a request between banks for the return of erroneously or fraudulently transferred funds) and close the loan. Nothing more happened until eight days after I contacted Sainsbury's. Despite telling me it had not been told of the fraud, it had chased Santander for the indemnity. Santander insisted it had never received an indemnity request and would need 30 days to action one. Happily, it was decided that modern technology could be embraced and the indemnity emailed. Sainsbury's now admits it was contacted by Santander when you discovered the fraud, but says that the rival bank failed to respond to its requests for an indemnity. It has amended your credit file and paid £100 compensation. Who knows which bank's inertia caused the saga; what is clear is that had you wanted to apply for credit during the weeks of waiting, you would have been refused. As I reflect on this ordeal, I am left wondering how two major financial institutions could have botched the process so badly. The lack of communication and accountability is staggering. It's a stark reminder that even in the digital age, human error and inefficiency can still cause significant harm to individuals. I hope that my experience will serve as a wake-up call for both Santander and Sainsbury's to review their processes and prioritize customer service.

The preliminary report, issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, said on Thursday that while the vehicle's guidance system had spotted the woman about six seconds before hitting her, emergency braking manoeuvres were not enabled in order to \"reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior\". Instead, the Uber system anticipated that the human back-up driver would intervene. However, the automated system was not designed to alert the driver of the impending danger. The car was traveling at 43 miles per hour and its sensors determined that braking was needed 1.3 seconds before impact, according to the report. But the driver began to steer less than a second before striking 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was pushing a bicycle across a boulevard in the darkness in Tempe, Arizona, when the crash took place. The vehicle's brakes were not applied until after the fatal impact. In an interview with NTSB investigators, Uber's back-up driver said she had been monitoring the \"self-driving interface\". On Wednesday, Uber announced it would cease testing its vehicles in Arizona and would focus on more limited testing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and California. Uber said that it had worked closely with the NTSB and was conducting an internal review of its self-driving vehicle program. The company also announced it had brought in the former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart \"to advise us on our overall safety culture, and we look forward to sharing more on the changes we'll make in the coming weeks\". The investigation also revealed that the vehicle's sensors had been adjusted to detect pedestrians at a slower speed than normal, which may have contributed to the delay in braking. The NTSB report noted that the vehicle's camera system had captured a clear image of Herzberg, but the system was not designed to alert the driver of potential hazards.\n\nThe incident has raised serious concerns about the safety of self-driving vehicles and the need for more robust safety protocols. Critics have argued that the technology is not yet ready for widespread use and that companies like Uber are rushing to deploy it without sufficient testing and regulation.\n\nIn response to the report, Uber's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi issued a statement apologizing for the tragic accident and vowing to make changes to the company's self-driving program. \"We understand that the loss of Elaine Herzberg's life is a devastating reminder of the importance of ensuring the safety of our self-driving vehicles,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"We are committed to making the necessary changes to prevent such tragedies from happening again.\"\n\nThe company has also faced criticism for its handling of the incident, with some arguing that it took too long to disclose the details of the accident and to take responsibility for the tragedy. The incident has also sparked renewed calls for greater regulation of the self-driving industry and for more transparency about the safety of these vehicles.",

The Competition and Markets Authority has been investigating whether sites are misleading consumers since October and identified a number of areas of concern. The CMA did not name the companies it was investigating, but leading sites include Expedia and Booking.com. The regulator is examining the extent to which a hotel's ranking on a website may be influenced by the size of its commission. The CMA said details on the sites about how many people are looking at a room, how many are left and how long a price is available can create a false impression of availability or rush customers into making a booking decision. About 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites, according to the regulator, but many have found the final price paid was inflated by unexpected extra charges such as taxes and booking fees added later. \"Booking sites can make it so much easier to choose your holiday, but only if people are able to trust them,\" said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. The CMA is urging hotel booking websites to be more transparent about their commission structures and to stop using tactics that create a false sense of urgency. The regulator is also concerned that hotels that pay higher commissions are being prioritized in search results, which could lead to consumers being directed to more expensive options. The CMA has given the websites until the end of the year to make changes, and has warned that it will take enforcement action if necessary. In addition to Expedia and Booking.com, other major players in the market include Airbnb, Hotels.com, and Trivago. The CMA is encouraging consumers to check their bookings carefully and to report any suspicious activity to the regulator.

The airline, which started operating in 2012 with the backing of easyJet's founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, is in discussions with major shareholders to raise more funds but admitted it had no assurance of a positive outcome. The London Stock Exchange-listed compnay said it \"had continued to consume cash\", and from $7.5m (£5.7m) a month ago it now had just $3.3m in its reserves – more than half of which is locked up in Zimbabwe. In a notice to investors, Fastjet said it was \"at risk of not being able to continue trading as a going concern\". Fastjet launched in Tanzania with an ambition to become a pan-African low-cost carrier, but it has struggled throughout with problems including the continent's banking infrastructure, overambitious plane orders and office costs. Its shares plummeted a further 70% on Wednesday on the news, leaving them at just £3.70 – less than 0.1% of their price five years ago – valuing the company at just over £19m. Haji-Ioannou, who owned the Fastjet brand until last year, fell out with the company's management in 2016 and demanded wholesale changes, including the removal of the chief executive, Ed Winter, and the relocation of its headquarters from the UK to Africa to cut costs. He said: \"Naturally I am very disappointed at this news. It had been my hope to see safe, low-cost air travel thrive in Africa as elsewhere. However, I have been increasingly concerned over the last few years at the way Fastjet was being run, first by Ed Winter and his team and now by Nico Bezuidenhout. \"This prompted me on several occasions to indicate my concerns about the company's management and vote my shares accordingly. If Friday's AGM goes ahead I will ensure my representatives continue to voice my strong objections and vote against the tabled resolutions.\" The airline's management team has been accused of mismanaging the company's finances, with some critics pointing to the company's decision to purchase a large number of aircraft without a clear plan for how to utilize them. The company has also faced criticism for its high operating costs, which have been blamed on a lack of efficiency in its operations.\n\nFastjet's struggles have been a blow to the African aviation industry, which has been working to develop a more robust and competitive airline market. The company's collapse could also have a negative impact on the economies of the countries in which it operates, as it provides employment and transportation services to thousands of people.\n\nDespite the company's struggles, there is still hope that it can be saved. The airline's management team is working to raise additional funds and has been in talks with potential investors. The company's major shareholders are also working to find a solution, and there are reports that a group of investors is considering a rescue bid for the airline.\n\nFor now, the future of Fastjet remains uncertain. The company's shareholders are set to meet on Friday to discuss the airline's financial situation and potential solutions. In the meantime, the airline's employees and customers are left wondering what the future holds for the struggling carrier.",

The troubled retailer said it had been \"a very difficult year\" for the firm as it reported a 3.6% fall in sales at its established UK stores in the year to 28 April. Carpetright said trading in the first eight weeks of the current financial year had been heavily disrupted by its restructuring programme, particularly because some suppliers had withdrawn products. The hot weather had also kept customers away, the firm said. The retailer announced its store closure plan in April, putting 300 jobs at risk. It has also asked landlords for rent reductions of up to 50% on 113 more stores under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a process designed to stave off administration as its struggles against a backdrop of weaker consumer spending and a slowdown in the housing market. Announcing the loss, which followed a £900,000 pretax profit a year earlier, the Carpetright chief executive, Wilf Walsh, said the company was focused on working through its recovery plan. \"After a difficult trading year impacted by reduced consumer spend, increased competition and the legacy of an unsustainable, over-rented store portfolio – the CVA and recapitalisation offers us the chance to rebuild Carpetright, which remains the clear market leader in floor coverings with outstanding consumer brand awareness,\" he said. By the end of September, Carpetright expects to have closed 81 of the 92 stores earmarked for closure. Revenue over the year to 28 April fell by 3% to £443.8m. The company's financial struggles have been exacerbated by the rise of online retailers, which have lured away customers with cheaper prices and a wider range of products. Carpetright's efforts to revamp its e-commerce platform and improve its online offerings have been hampered by technical issues and a lack of investment in digital marketing. The company's shares have fallen by more than 70% over the past year, reflecting investor concerns about its ability to recover from its current struggles. Despite the challenges, Carpetright remains optimistic about its future prospects, citing its strong brand recognition and loyal customer base. The company plans to continue investing in its e-commerce platform and expanding its online presence, in an effort to attract more customers and drive sales growth. With the closure of 81 stores expected to be completed by the end of September, Carpetright is hoping to emerge from its restructuring process as a leaner, more agile business, better equipped to compete in a rapidly changing retail landscape.",

        "Text": "The most profound change to human life over the previous 100 years came to a halt in 2010. In the decades before it, life expectancy in Britain kept rising, with men, in particular, born in the 1920s and 1930s enjoying far longer and healthier lives than ever expected. This increase in lifespan has affected everything – from housing to health to pensions. It's why we need to find ever greater sums for the NHS. It's why the state pension age has had to go up. Arguably, it's a big reason why house prices are so high – because people are living in them for longer. But the great leap forward in longevity has come to a shuddering halt. An extraordinary analysis by the Office for National Statistics this week reveals that the trend line in longevity stopped in 2010, and has flatlined since. Why? Pick anything from austerity and cuts in NHS spending, to influenza outbreaks, obesity, diabetes, and even the rise of \"multimorbidity\" – where someone might have diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure all at the same time. But the ONS did not try to answer the \"why\" question. It wanted to check if the statistics really do prove that longevity rises have come to a halt. And the depressing conclusion from its research is that, indeed they have. It found that the \"breakpoint\" in the trend towards better longevity began with males in the second quarter of 2009, with females following soon after. \"A significant slowdown in improvement occurred during the early 2010s in England,\" said the ONS. \"Between 2011 to 2013, and 2014 to 2016, only 26 local authorities showed any statistically significant increase in life expectancy for men, and only 17 showed any improvement for women. This compares with 203 and 128 local authorities respectively showing a significant increase in the equivalent period 10 years earlier.\" Maybe this is a blip. But there is also some worrying data coming out of the weekly register of deaths in England and Wales this year. They show that the number of deaths is running significantly above the average over the past five years. The implications of this trend are far-reaching and unsettling. If life expectancy is no longer increasing, it means that the healthcare system will be under even greater pressure to provide care for an aging population. The NHS, already struggling to cope with demand, will face even more significant challenges in the coming years. The financial burden on the state pension system will also increase, as people live longer and require support for longer periods. Furthermore, the property market may also be affected, as people may not be able to afford to buy or rent homes as they live longer and require more space. The ONS analysis highlights the need for policymakers to rethink their approach to healthcare, pensions, and housing in light of this new reality. It is imperative that we understand the causes of this plateau in life expectancy and take action to address the underlying issues before it's too late. The consequences of inaction could be devastating, with far-reaching implications for individuals, families, and society as a whole.",

This is a welcome time to reflect, yet here in the UK, just 11% of engineers are women. Engineering is behind many of the things we take for granted, such as roads, bridges, railways, electricity generation and clean water, but it is also behind AI, robotics, smartphones and wearable technology – some of the most exciting recent technological developments. To get more women into engineering, we must communicate its many applications more clearly to young women. Through doing so we can inspire many more to join a profession that can see them working on some of the world's most exciting innovations. Once there, we must do all we can to challenge and inspire female engineers. By providing role models and mentors, we can help female engineers feel supported and valued in their careers. This is crucial, as research has shown that women are more likely to leave the industry if they don't see opportunities for advancement or feel isolated from their peers. Furthermore, companies must also address the unconscious biases that can hinder women's progress in the workplace. By fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect, we can create a more diverse and innovative engineering workforce that reflects the society we live in. Only then can we unlock the full potential of female engineers and reap the benefits of their contributions to the field.",

        "Text": "The Sports Direct founder, Mike Ashley, has held talks about an emergency funding deal for the struggling department store chain, House of Fraser. The billionaire, who already owns an 11% stake in House of Fraser, was asked in recent days by bankers advising the retailer to consider providing it with a £50m loan, according to a report by Sky News. In June, House of Fraser announced plans to close 31 of its 59 stores, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. The retailer later secured breathing space from its lenders when they agreed to extend loans while it carries out the restructuring under a company voluntary arrangement scheme. C.banner, the Chinese owner of Hamleys, had agreed to make a £70m investment in House of Fraser, conditional on the CVA being implemented. However, the CVA plans have been thrown into doubt by a legal challenge in Scotland, where a group of landlords argues that the restructuring plan would inflict unfair financial pain on them. Alex Williamson, the chief executive of House of Fraser, has previously described the CVA as the \"last viable\" option for the business. Days after the restructuring scheme was announced, Ashley won a legal challenge to obtain the store's business plans, providing him with vital information in the event of an investment bid. Ashley bought his 11% stake in 2014 when 89% of the business was sold to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a deal worth £480m. The talks between Ashley and House of Fraser's management are believed to have focused on the potential loan, which would provide a much-needed cash injection to support the retailer's restructuring efforts. Insiders suggest that Ashley is keen to explore the possibility of a deal, given his existing stake in the company and his reputation as a shrewd businessman. However, any agreement would likely be subject to approval from House of Fraser's lenders and the CVA creditors, who would need to be convinced that the loan would not compromise the retailer's ability to meet its financial obligations. The uncertainty surrounding the CVA plans, due to the ongoing legal challenge, is likely to be a major factor in Ashley's decision-making process. If a deal is struck, it could pave the way for a potential takeover of House of Fraser by Ashley, although this remains purely speculative at this stage. The Sports Direct founder has a history of acquiring struggling retailers, having previously bought stakes in companies such as Newcastle United and Evans Cycles. A successful funding deal could mark a significant turning point for House of Fraser, which has been struggling to compete with online rivals and changing consumer habits.",

        "Text": "One of the oldest breweries in Britain and its chairman have been fined almost £30,000 after they refused to hand over vital documents about its pension scheme. Samuel Smith Old Brewery, which was founded in Tadcaster in 1758, was asked to provide details of its pensions in 2015. The Pension Regulator (TPR) wanted to ensure the Yorkshire-based brewer and pub owner was earning enough money to support the final-salary pension schemes of more than 2,000 employees. However, the brewery owner, Humphrey Smith, 73, wrote back and dismissed the request as \"tiresome\". In his letter to TPR, he said: \"We are in receipt of your tiresome letter and we are not prepared to divulge the information to your organisation.\" TPR responded by launching court proceedings, accusing the company of neglecting or refusing to provide information without a reasonable excuse in breach of the Pensions Act 2004. As the owner and chairman of the company, Smith was accused of failing to hand over the documents. Both the company and Smith pleaded guilty to the offence at a hearing in May. On Monday the brewery and its chairman were sentenced at Brighton magistrates court and fined £26,750 as well as costs of £1,240. Judge Teresa Szagun said the company had claimed it was a \"small, independent, family-run brewery struggling in a declining industry\" and any fine would have an impact on its employees. The court heard that despite the fine, the brewery's financial situation was not as dire as claimed. In fact, Samuel Smith Old Brewery had reported a profit of £1.2 million in 2018. The TPR argued that the brewery's financial situation did not justify the refusal to provide the necessary information, and that the company's actions had caused unnecessary delay and expense.\n\nThe judge agreed, stating that the company's failure to provide the documents had caused \"unnecessary stress and anxiety\" for its employees, who were waiting to know if their pensions were secure. She also noted that the company's refusal to cooperate with the TPR had been \"persistent and deliberate\".\n\nThe fine was seen as a warning to other companies that failing to comply with pension regulations would not be tolerated. The TPR's chief executive, Charles Counsell, said: \"We will not hesitate to take action against companies that fail to provide the necessary information about their pension schemes. This fine sends a clear message that compliance is non-negotiable.\"\n\nThe brewery's employees were relieved that the matter had been resolved, but many were still concerned about the future of their pensions. \"We just want to know that our pensions are safe,\" said one employee. \"We've worked hard for our employer and we expect them to look after us in our retirement.\"",

They have looked into the help-to-buy scheme in some depth but remain unsure. I've read such negative things about the help-to-buy scheme and don't want them to live a life of fear and stress should they go down this path. Is it better to save longer for a bigger deposit buying an older property? DM A I think your sons are right to exercise caution about the help-to-buy scheme. And if they can afford to purchase property without using help-to-buy, it would make a lot of sense. And that's not just my opinion. In the Help to Buy Buyers' Guide published by the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) it says: \"If it looks like you can already secure a 90% mortgage you should think carefully whether a help-to-buy equity loan is right for you. There may be better options for you to consider.\" Help-to-buy can be a good option if you are keen to buy a new-build property from one of the house builders registered with the HCA (which they will be if they offer help-to-buy homes) and you need the 20% equity loan (40% in London) from government to be able to complete the purchase. Help-to-buy is not an option if you don't want a new-build help-to-buy home and shouldn't be an option if you don't need government help. Unlike the government bonuses paid into both help-to-buy and lifetime Isas – which can be used to save up a deposit for property purchase – the help-to-buy equity loan is not free money. However, it's essential to note that the help-to-buy scheme is not a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, if your sons are keen on buying an older property, they may not need the equity loan, and it would be better to save for a bigger deposit. Additionally, the scheme's restrictions, such as the requirement to buy a new-build property from a registered house builder, may not be suitable for everyone.\n\nMoreover, the Help to Buy Buyers' Guide also highlights that the equity loan is not a free pass to homeownership. The interest rate on the loan is 1.75% above the Bank of England base rate, which could increase significantly over time. This means that your sons would need to factor in the potential costs of the loan when making their decision.\n\nUltimately, it's crucial for your sons to weigh the pros and cons of the help-to-buy scheme carefully and consider their individual circumstances. They should also explore other options, such as saving for a bigger deposit or exploring alternative mortgage products. By doing so, they can make an informed decision that suits their financial situation and goals.",

She has written more than 270 entries about forgotten but influential women in science – such as Susan Goldberg, the first female editor of National Geographic. Research shows just 16% of Wikipedia editors are female and only 17% of entries dedicated to notable people are for women. Western Research by Oxford University in 2016 revealed that the vast bulk of content written about most African countries on Wikipedia was by editors in Europe and North America. Only 16% of content about sub-Saharan Africa is written by people from the region, while most entries on European countries are written in Europe. Language In 2016, researchers at the University of Koblenz-Landau in Germany found that the language of a Wikipedia entry influences the sources used, therefore offering a different version of the truth. In an English-language article about Russia's annexation of Crimea, for example, 24% of sources were Ukrainian and 20% Russian. In the German version, Russian sources made up 10% of citations and Ukrainian sources only 3%. Political A 2011 research paper that analysed almost 30,000 Wikipedia entries about US politics found the website to be slightly biased towards the Democrats. The study found that entries were more likely to use politically charged Democratic phrases (terms like \"civil rights\") than Republican ones (\"illegal immigration\"). The implications of these findings are far-reaching, highlighting the need for greater diversity and representation in the online encyclopedia. Wade's efforts to rectify gender bias on Wikipedia are a crucial step in ensuring that the contributions of women in science are recognized and celebrated. The lack of representation from sub-Saharan Africa and the dominance of European and North American editors on articles about African countries also raises concerns about cultural bias and the potential for misinformation. Moreover, the influence of language on the sources used in Wikipedia entries underscores the importance of multilingual editing and the need for greater international collaboration. As Wikipedia continues to evolve, it is essential that these issues are addressed to ensure that the platform remains a trusted and reliable source of information for the global community.",

The story covered a judge's decision to award money to Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed after he had been unlawfully imprisoned and badly treated by British armed forces during the Iraq war. The newspaper ran the story despite the judge concluding claims that he had been caught with a bomb had been discredited shortly after his detention, and that the claim by British soldiers that al-Waheed had been caught with a bomb was \"pure fiction\". The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) ordered the front-page notice after concluding the newspaper had breached rules on accuracy in its reporting of the case. \"In these circumstances, the reference to these serious allegations against Mr al-Waheed, without making clear they had been disproven, seriously misrepresented the basis of the judgment reported,\" the press regulator said. The judge concluded that there was no evidence the man had been an insurgent and he had been detained without any legal basis for 33 days in 2007. The Daily Mail's correction notice acknowledged that the newspaper had \"made serious mistakes\" in its reporting of the case and that it had \"failed to accurately convey the findings of the judge's decision\".

Back then, its budget was forecast at $500m and the launch date was set for 2007. But the technical requirements for the mission were so challenging that delays started to mount and costs started to spiral. In 2011, the mission was almost cancelled by US Congress, but it relented and capped the mission cost at around $8bn.

Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, lauded the deal as transformational and industry watchers said the move significantly beefed up the company's US shale presence, which was small compared to peers. The acquisition will boost BP's US oil and gas production by nearly a fifth and marks a new period of growth for the company, which is emerging after years under the $65bn burden of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. In total, 470,000 acres of assets are covered in the deal, including fields in the Permian in west Texas, the Eagle Ford in south Texas and Haynesville in east Texas and Louisiana. Analysts said Eagle Ford was the most valuable of the three because of its scale and economics, while the Permian offered the greatest long-term promise. BHP bought the fields in 2011 but has struggled to make them work, putting them up for sale last August. BP said it believed its approach would differ by bringing $350m of synergies from its other US operations and capital efficiencies. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP's upstream division, said: \"It gives us access to some of the best acreage in the best basins. It takes us into the very heart of the most-talked-about oil play in the world [the Permian].\" The UK oil giant was \"not desperate to do a deal\" he added but BP believed the quality of the resources made the acquisition worthwhile. After the deal is completed BP's US production will climb from 744,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 885,000 boe/d. \"BP was previously underweight to US tight oil compared to its peers. This deal transforms BP's US business,\" Maxim Petrov, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said. BP said it was making \"conservative assumptions\" about how much oil and gas could be pumped to begin with, given regional bottlenecks around infrastructure such as pipelines. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. BP plans to finance the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt. The company's shareholders will be asked to approve the deal at an extraordinary general meeting later this year.\n\nThe acquisition is seen as a major coup for BP, which has been looking to expand its presence in the US shale oil and gas market. The company has been struggling to compete with its peers in the region, and the deal will give it a significant boost in terms of production and reserves.\n\nIndustry analysts say that the acquisition will also give BP access to new technologies and expertise, which will help the company to improve its drilling and production techniques. Additionally, the deal will allow BP to reduce its reliance on traditional oil and gas fields and shift its focus to more sustainable and profitable sources of energy.\n\nThe acquisition is also seen as a vote of confidence in the US shale oil and gas industry, which has been facing challenges in recent years due to declining production and prices. The deal is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy, creating new jobs and stimulating economic growth.\n\nOverall, the acquisition of BHP's US shale oil and gasfields is a significant milestone for BP, marking a major expansion of its presence in the US energy market. The deal is expected to have a positive impact on the company's financial performance and provide a platform for future growth.",

In 2016, around 2.3m debt cases were passed to bailiffs by local authorities, according to data given to the House of Commons Treasury committee. It said: \"These debts are often pursued overzealously, and with routine recourse to bailiffs. The public sector should be leading by example in their treatment of the most financially vulnerable; but the current approach risks driving them into further difficulty.\" MPs said the \"uncompromising\" approach by local and central government to debt collection should be reformed to meet best industry standards. The report highlighted evidence from the debt charity StepChange, one-third of whose clients had council tax arrears averaging £1,000. Phil Andrew of the charity said: \"Often the governmental organisations are very aggressive in the way they go about getting the payments made. This quick jump to the use of bailiffs is something that we are really quite concerned about\" Threats from bailiffs were thought to be a factor in the suicide of courier Jerome Rogers, 20, who was pursued for two £65 parking fines that escalated to a debt of £1,019. The case prompted calls for sweeping changes to the way the debt collection industry works. Earlier this week the personal insolvency firm Creditfix said it had identified 55 councils across the UK that routinely rejected payment plans offered by those in financial difficulties, leaving those affected with no other choice than to file for bankruptcy. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, welcomed the report. \"MPs are right to acknowledge that government agencies and local authorities are worst in class for debt collection when they should be leading by example. The report also highlighted the lack of transparency and accountability within the bailiff industry, with many firms operating with little oversight or regulation. MPs called for greater scrutiny of the industry, including the introduction of a mandatory code of practice for bailiffs and increased transparency around their fees and charges.\n\nThe Treasury committee's report also criticized the government's own debt collection practices, noting that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) was one of the largest users of bailiffs, with thousands of cases being passed to them each year. The committee recommended that the DWP adopt a more compassionate approach to debt collection, taking into account the financial circumstances of individuals and offering more flexible payment options.\n\nThe report's findings have been welcomed by debt charities and consumer groups, who have long argued that the bailiff industry is in need of reform. \"This report is a wake-up call for the government and local authorities to take a more human approach to debt collection,\" said Sarah-Jayne Mugford, head of policy at the debt charity National Debtline. \"It's time to prioritize support and guidance over aggressive debt collection tactics.\" The government has yet to respond to the report's recommendations, but campaigners are urging ministers to take action to address the issues highlighted by the Treasury committee.",

A surge in its share price meant that the 13-year-old drinks company was worth nearly as much as Royal Mail and outstripped the combined stock market value of WH Smith, Debenhams, the AA and Saga. Fever-Tree, which produces tonic water and other carbonated mixers, has grown rapidly, thanks in large part to the soaring popularity of premium gin. UK gin sales have doubled over the past six years to hit £1.2bn in the year to the end of September 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, while a YouGov poll found gin was the most beloved spirit in the UK, with 29% of drinkers voting it their favourite. Riding the crest of the gin wave has transformed Fever-Tree into one of the UK's fastest-growing major companies, making multi-millionaires of co-founders Charles Rolls and Tim Warrilow in the process. The pair founded Fever-Tree in 2005, naming it after the colloquial term for the cinchona tree, the bark of which produces quinine – a key ingredient in tonic water. Rolls has banked more than £150m through share sales since the company's stock market float in 2014, while Warrilow has sold stock worth £41m. They still own 14% of the company between them, a stake worth nearly £600m, and pocketed payouts of more than £630,000 on Tuesday after the group lifted its dividend by 40%. The company's success has also attracted the attention of major investors, with institutional investors such as BlackRock and Fidelity International increasing their stakes in Fever-Tree. The firm's ability to tap into the growing demand for premium spirits has been a major factor in its success, with its tonic water and other mixers now available in over 70 countries worldwide.\n\nFever-Tree's rapid growth has also led to the creation of new jobs, with the company employing over 300 people globally, up from just 30 in 2010.

Stagecoach said the single-decker bus will run autonomously only in its depots until laws change to allow it to carry passengers. Work is being carried out to adapt the bus with the same technology used on driverless pods recently used in a trial in Greenwich, south-east London. The operator said the bus would be able to park in depots and drive itself to refuelling and wash points. No driver will be required when it is off public roads. Stagecoach said it believed wider use of self-driving buses could be safer, more efficient and save space within its depots. Even on the road with a driver, the bus could be safer for other road users, with the sensor system able to give more warning of cyclists or pedestrians in blind spots or unexpected proximity. Stagecoach's UK bus engineering director, Sam Greer, said the bus, which is being designed in partnership with the manufacturer Alexander Dennis Limited and the technology company Fusion Processing, was an exciting project that \"could, in time, help improve safety and efficiency within our depots, and over the longer term, help transform bus travel in the future\". The trial is expected to take place at Stagecoach's depot in Preston, Lancashire, where the company has been working to adapt the bus with the necessary technology. The bus will be equipped with a range of sensors, including cameras, lidar and radar, which will enable it to navigate the depot's roads and avoid obstacles. The company is also working to develop a system that will allow the bus to communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure in the depot, such as traffic lights and pedestrian crossings.\n\nStagecoach has emphasized that the trial is a crucial step towards the development of self-driving buses that can carry passengers. The company believes that once the necessary laws and regulations are in place, self-driving buses could revolutionize public transportation, providing a safer, more efficient, and more convenient service for passengers.\n\nThe trial is also expected to generate significant interest from the public and the media, with Stagecoach planning to invite journalists and members of the public to witness the bus in action. The company hopes that the trial will demonstrate the potential of self-driving buses and pave the way for wider adoption of the technology in the future.",

During a total lunar eclipse, the moon passes through the Earth's shadow. Once totally immersed, it turns to a deep red colour. This glorious sight occurs because of the way sunlight bends (refracts) through the Earth's atmosphere. The blue component of sunlight is scattered all over, which is why the sky looks blue to us, but the red light is refracted, which directs it behind the Earth and onto the Moon. The eclipse starts before the moon rises in the UK. As the moon rises, the eclipse will be visible in the sky, with the moon taking on a deep reddish hue. The timing of the eclipse is such that it will coincide with the early hours of the morning, providing a unique opportunity for people to witness this rare phenomenon. Astronomers are urging people to get outside and enjoy the view, as the next total lunar eclipse will not be visible from the UK until 2025. The event is expected to be a spectacular sight, with many planning to gather in observatories and outdoor spaces to marvel at the moon's transformation.",

        "Text": "Craig Jones is now a successful local politician but when Wonga was in its prime he was one of many people who turned to the payday lender for help. Jones was in insecure employment on a zero-hours contract in 2011 when he turned to Britain's then biggest payday lender. There was a lull in work and he \"needed something to tide me over\" while he waited for his finances to pick up. He took out a small Wonga loan – \"I think it was £50 to £100\" – but unfortunately his work situation did not improve and \"it just snowballed from there … [it] led to me taking out more and more, and from different sources\". He cannot recall how much he borrowed in total. Asked if it was several hundred pounds, he said it may well have been more than that. Later, however, he obtained more secure permanent work and was eventually able to pay off what he owed. In 2011, the year Jones became a Wonga customer, the company posted good figures: its profits tripled to £45.8m on revenues of £185m as the firm issued almost 2.5m loans. The following year the company told employees that by 2015 it could be valued at £15bn. However, in 2014 Wonga had a traumatic year: it was embroiled in scandal for sending out fake legal letters, ordered to pay millions in compensation and forced to write off £220m of debts owed by 330,000 borrowers. Then in 2015, regulator-imposed price caps on payday loans were introduced. Despite the setbacks, Jones' experience with Wonga had a profound impact on his life. He realized that he had been trapped in a cycle of debt and was determined to use his own struggles to help others. After leaving Wonga, Jones went on to study politics and eventually became a local councillor, where he has been vocal about the need for greater financial regulation and support for those struggling with debt.\n\n\"I was one of the lucky ones,\" Jones said in an interview. \"I was able to get out of debt and move on with my life, but I know that's not the case for many others. I've seen firsthand the devastating impact that payday lenders can have on people's lives. That's why I'm so passionate about making sure that we have stronger protections in place to prevent others from falling into the same trap.\"\n\nJones' story is a powerful reminder of the human cost of Wonga's rapid rise and fall. As the company's profits soared, it issued millions of loans to people who were struggling to make ends meet. Many of these borrowers were trapped in a cycle of debt, unable to afford the high interest rates and fees that Wonga charged.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Wonga, Jones believes that the company's legacy can still be used to make a positive impact. \"I think that Wonga's story can be a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked capitalism,\" he said. \"But it can also be a reminder of the importance of compassion and empathy. We need to make sure that we're creating a system that works for everyone, not just the wealthy and powerful.\"",

        "Text": "James Bond's favourite carmaker was founded in a small London workshop in 1913 by the engineer Robert Bamford and the car enthusiast Lionel Martin. The name Aston Martin came a year later after their prototype successfully made it around the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire. Aston Martin took its place on the international motor racing stage by competing in the 1922 French Grand Prix but the business ran into financial trouble over the next few years and was rescued in 1926 by a group of investors. It developed a competitive range of sports cars with an increasing reputation for engineering and design, entering the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars was stepped up in the 1930s, with 140 cars built in 1937 – the highest prewar figure. The English industrialist David Brown bought the business in 1947, expanding operations and relocating production from Kensington to Feltham. Production was again moved in 1955 to Newport Pagnell. In 1963 the Aston Martin DB5 entered production and the famous relationship with James Bond was born a year later when it was made the car of choice for 007 in the film Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery. The character of James Bond has driven an Aston Martin intermittently on film since then, featuring in several films such as GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies and Skyfall. The luxury carmaker changed hands a number of times during the 1970s and 80s and in 1987 the Ford Motor Company took a 75% stake. The DB moniker – David Brown's initials – was resurrected with the introduction of the DB7 in 1993, the year that Ford took full ownership of the company. Aston Martin opened a new headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, in 2003, which was the first purpose-built factory in the company's history. Since then, Aston Martin has continued to thrive, producing some of the most iconic and luxurious sports cars in the world. In 2008, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange, raising £1.2 billion in one of the largest initial public offerings in history. This influx of capital allowed Aston Martin to invest in new technologies and expand its operations, including the opening of a new manufacturing facility in St Athan, Wales. The company has also continued its partnership with James Bond, with the DB10 featuring in the 2015 film Spectre and the DBS Superleggera making an appearance in the 2019 film No Time to Die. Today, Aston Martin is a global brand, with a presence in over 50 countries and a reputation for producing some of the most exquisite and high-performance cars in the world. Despite facing challenges in recent years, including a global pandemic and the shift towards electric vehicles, Aston Martin remains a beloved and iconic brand, with a rich history and a bright future ahead.",

It deepens an existing relationship in a bid to catch up with rivals in the race to design and produce autonomous vehicles for the mass market. The aim of the partnership is to use technology from both companies in purpose-built Toyota cars to be deployed across Uber's ride-sharing network from 2021. Toyota's investment values Uber at $72bn, despite mounting losses that totalled $4.5bn in 2017. Shigeki Tomoyama, the executive vice-president of Toyota, said: \"This agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing that includes Toyota vehicles and technologies.\" The deal is a step towards the revival of Uber's self-driving business after a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona, in March, when a self-driving Uber SUV killed a pedestrian. Uber subsequently withdrew its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and closed its self-driving testing hub in Arizona. Under the latest deal with Toyota, Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota's Guardian technology, which offers some automated safety features such as lane-keeping but does not enable a vehicle to entirely self-driven. The firms said the ambition was to build the combined technology into Toyota's Sienna minivans, to be used on Uber's ride-hailing network from 2021. The partnership is expected to accelerate the development of autonomous vehicles for mass markets, with the combined technology aiming to improve safety and reduce the risk of accidents. The deal also marks a significant shift for Toyota, which has traditionally focused on manufacturing cars, towards becoming a mobility company. Under the agreement, Uber will have access to Toyota's expertise in manufacturing and technology, while Toyota will benefit from Uber's experience in ride-sharing and data analysis. The collaboration is expected to create new job opportunities and drive innovation in the autonomous vehicle industry. With this partnership, both companies are positioning themselves to be major players in the emerging autonomous vehicle market, which is expected to revolutionize the way people move around cities in the coming years.",

Some of us remember life before Ticketmaster when we could ring the box office of a theatre or concert hall and reserve a ticket for the price of the ticket and no more. Then, insidiously, \"ticket partners\" took over the work of the box office and guess who had to pay? Now we are charged a booking fee for every ticket, sometimes a flat fee and sometimes a percentage, and then there is the transaction fee as well, which adds considerably to the price of an evening out. Imagine going to the supermarket and being charged a \"shopping fee\" for each item you bought and then a \"transaction fee\" at the checkout. It's a vicious cycle that not only adds to the overall cost of a ticket, but also creates a sense of mistrust between the consumer and the ticketing company. The introduction of secondary ticketing sites only exacerbated the problem, allowing scalpers to buy up tickets and resell them at inflated prices. But with Ticketmaster's decision to close down its resale sites, there is hope that the industry is moving towards a more transparent and fairer system. It's a step in the right direction, and one that could make a big difference to fans and music lovers everywhere.",

        "Text": "Elite private schools have called for universities to cut back on the use of unconditional offers for undergraduate places over fears that pupils will not be motivated to strive for high A-level grades. Mike Buchanan, the executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents many of the country's most expensive independent schools, claimed that pupils \"take their foot off the gas\" after accepting offers that do not require specific A-level grades. \"These youngsters have to carry their results with them for their whole careers,\" Buchanan, the former headteacher of Ashford School in Kent, told the Times newspaper. \"I am asking universities to stop using them unless they have interviewed the pupil and got some sense that it would be good for this pupil, or have consulted the school, which has given you the same information.\" Until recently only a small number of school-leavers were given unconditional offers. But the government's removal of its cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities in England to expand and aggressively compete for students and their tuition fees. While there is little recent evidence to show whether pupils with unconditional offers achieve disappointing final grades, private school heads have long been hostile because of the potential impact on their school's results and league table rankings. Some employers pay close attention to A-level grades in recruiting for graduate trainee programmes, meaning that students who underperform may later struggle in the job market. The HMC's call follows that of Sam Gyimah, the higher education minister, who said in July that the rise in unconditional offers was \"completely irresponsible to students, and universities must start taking a lead by limiting the number they offer\". The HMC's plea has sparked a heated debate among educators and policymakers, with some arguing that unconditional offers can actually be a motivating factor for students who may otherwise feel overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve high grades. Dr. Rachel Hewitt, a lecturer in education at the University of Cambridge, pointed out that many students from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have access to the same level of academic support and resources as their private school peers, and that unconditional offers can provide a welcome sense of security and relief. \"It's not about coddling students, but about recognizing that the current system is not working for everyone,\" she said. Meanwhile, some universities have already begun to review their unconditional offer policies, with several institutions announcing plans to introduce more targeted and personalized approaches to admissions. As the debate continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the future of unconditional offers in the UK higher education system is far from certain.",

        "Text": "White boys from disadvantaged family backgrounds are significantly underachieving even at the earliest stage of their education, results of this year's phonics screening check for six-year-olds have revealed. When results are broken down by ethnic group, gender and free school meal (FSM) eligibility, white boys on FSM are the lowest attaining group, with only six out of 10 pupils (62%) meeting the required standard. Although official figures published by the government on Thursday show a two percentage point improvement on last year's results among this group, disadvantaged white boys still lag way behind their peers. Overall more than four in five pupils (82%) met the expected standard in the phonics screening check this year, a one percentage point increase on 2017 results. Chinese girls (not eligible for FSM) were the highest performing group. The screening check involves pupils reading a list of 40 words aloud, of which half are nonsense. The pass mark this year was 32. Pupils who fall short take the check again at the end of year 2, by which time 92% met the required standard. Analysis of the phonics results also revealed that fewer than half of pupils (44%) with special educational needs (SEN) reached the pass mark, compared with 89% of pupils with no identified SEN. The Department for Education also published provisional results for key stage 1 teacher assessments that showed the number of six- and seven-year-olds reaching the expected standard in reading had dropped slightly compared to last year. The stark disparities in phonics screening check results have raised concerns about the long-term impact on the academic prospects of disadvantaged white boys. Experts warn that this underachievement could perpetuate cycles of poverty and social exclusion, as well as limiting opportunities for social mobility.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for policymakers and educators to take urgent action to address the systemic issues that are contributing to this underachievement,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading education researcher. \"We need to look beyond just individual factors and examine the broader societal and environmental factors that are affecting these children's ability to succeed.\"\n\nThe results also highlight the significant disparities in educational outcomes between different ethnic groups. Chinese girls, who are not eligible for free school meals, were the highest performing group, with 92% meeting the required standard. In contrast, white boys on free school meals, who are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds, struggled to meet the standard, with only 62% passing.\n\nThe Department for Education has pledged to provide additional support to schools and teachers to help address the issue, including targeted funding for disadvantaged areas and training programs to improve phonics teaching.\n\nHowever, critics argue that more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of underachievement, including poverty, lack of access to quality early childhood education, and inadequate support for disadvantaged families.\n\n\"We need to recognize that education is not just about academic achievement, but also about social justice and equality,\" said Shadow Education Secretary, Angela Rayner. \"The government must take bold action to address the systemic inequalities that are holding back so many children and young people.\"",

Cannon-Brookes, the co-founder of software company Atlassian, has reportedly paid $100m for the historic 1.12 hectare estate on Sydney harbour after more than a century in the hands of the Fairfax family. \"We are delighted with the purchase of Fairwater for our young family and look forward to continuing the legacy of this beautiful Sydney home,\" Cannon-Brookes said in a statement. \"We love the idea of raising our four young children in this historic property.\" Fairwater is the largest privately held property on Sydney harbour, and one of the most significant heritage homes in Australia. Built in 1882, the waterfront estate in leafy Point Piper stretches from New South Head Road to Seven Shillings Beach. The mansion had been the residence of the Fairfax publishing family since 1900, when it was bought by James Oswald Fairfax, grandson of the founder of the Sydney Morning Herald, John Fairfax. It was the home of Mary Fairfax until her death in September last year. According to the New South Wales heritage register, the home is of \"rare historic, aesthetic, social and scientific significance\". During Mary Fairfax's long residence, the home was decorated with priceless artworks including a 2-metre tall bronze nude Rodin sculpture and paintings by Chagall, Degas and Arthur Boyd. The property was listed this month despite rumours that it would be bequeathed to the state of NSW, and reportedly took a little more than two weeks to sell. Founded by Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar in Sydney in 2002, Atlassian was worth $29.9bn at the beginning of September. The purchase of Fairwater marks a significant milestone for Cannon-Brookes, who has been a prominent figure in Australia's tech industry. The couple plans to restore the property to its former glory, while also making it their own by incorporating modern touches and amenities. \"We're excited to put our own stamp on the property while still respecting its rich history,\" Cannon-Brookes said.

Adrian Hallmark, the chief executive of the luxury carmaker, told Reuters it was stockpiling some components ahead of Brexit and switching from the port of Dover to Immingham to bring in certain parts. The Volkswagen-owned marque makes about 11,000 cars a year in Crewe. If London and Brussels fail to reach an agreement by the end of the year, Bentley may stockpile more car parts and close its factory for a few extra days, said Hallmark, who joined Bentley from Jaguar Land Rover in February. The majority of key parts including engines and body come from the European Union, mainly Germany. \"We may work for four days, or we may have a longer Christmas break and a longer Easter break if there is no deal so that we can smooth the period between now and the middle of next year,\" Hallmark said. BMW plans to shut its Mini plant for a month after the UK's departure from the EU on 29 March, to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit that it fears would cause a shortage of parts. Britain's largely foreign-owned car manufacturers worry about the prospect of tariffs (10% for cars and car parts under World Trade Organization rules) and long delays to imports of components. More than half (56%) of parts come from abroad, the majority (79%) from the EU, according to trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. \"Best case, it's an annoying impact on our annual profitability,\" Hallmark said. \"Worst case, it's quite damaging on our annual profitability so a full no-deal Brexit would hurt us as a company, it would limit ability to invest.\" Jaguar Land Rover, Britain's biggest car manufacturer, warned last month that tens of thousands of jobs in the sector could be lost, and that a hard Brexit would cost the company £1.2bn a year, wiping out profits. It has moved 2,000 staff to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has already taken a toll on Bentley's production, with the company reporting a decline in sales in the first half of the year. Hallmark warned that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a significant increase in costs, which would be passed on to customers. \"We're not just talking about a few percent increase in price, we're talking about a significant increase in price,\" he said. The luxury carmaker is also concerned about the impact on its supply chain, with many of its parts suppliers based in the EU. \"If we can't get the parts we need, we can't make the cars,\" Hallmark said. The company is working with its suppliers to mitigate the risks, but Hallmark acknowledged that there was only so much that could be done. \"We're doing everything we can to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, but ultimately it's out of our hands,\" he said. The uncertainty has already led to a decline in investment in the UK car industry, with many manufacturers delaying or cancelling plans due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Hallmark warned that a no-deal Brexit would not only hurt Bentley's profits, but also the wider UK economy. \"A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK car industry and for the UK economy as a whole,\" he said.",

I'd like to thank all involved for their positive engagement in this process.\" The rescue deal is good timing for Ashley, who is appearing in front of MPs on the housing, communities and local government committee next week as part of their inquiry into the future of the high street. Ashley demanded the meeting to spell out his views on how to help town centres after a series of closures and collapses among well-known retailers this year. Announcing his request to see the MPs, Ashley said: \"I believe politicians and landlords should be doing more to save our struggling high streets, so I intend to make the most of this opportunity to make a real difference.\" He bought House of Fraser for £90m when the 59-store chain collapsed into administration in August, and has so far pledged to keep 23 of the outlets open. The deal will see Sports Direct continue to operate the store, which is one of the largest department stores in the North West, and has been a Manchester institution for nearly two centuries. The council's intervention is seen as a major coup for the local authority, which has been working to preserve the city's retail heritage. Sir Richard Leese added that the council had been working closely with Sports Direct and the landlords to find a solution that would benefit all parties. The news is also a boost for the local economy, with the store employing hundreds of people and attracting thousands of customers each week. The council has been working to revitalize the Deansgate area, and the news of the store's reprieve is seen as a major win for the regeneration efforts. Sports Direct's decision to keep the store open is also seen as a sign of confidence in the city's retail scene, and a vote of faith in the local community. The news is expected to be welcomed by shoppers and employees alike, and is a major boost for the city's high street.",

The governor, Mark Carney, joined over 2,500 staff and their families at the Bank's sports ground in Roehampton, south-west London, in July, which featured a bake-off competition, a treasure hunt, fun run and bouncy castle. Employees were also treated to performances by the Bank of England's choir and band. Party planners racked up a bill of more than £58,000 for food and drink alone, according to a Freedom of Information request lodged by the Press Association. More than £27,000 was spent on entertainment, and £10,400 on \"additional expenses\", with the total being £95,674, excluding VAT. A spokesman for the Bank, which is partly funded by taxpayers, said: \"Governors' Day is a long-held tradition that is open to all employees, including their families, with the aim of recognising their hard work and dedication. \"The annual event is an important one for all Bank employees, and the Bank strongly believes that this carefully budgeted event is worthwhile.\" The Bank's decision to spend such a large sum on the party has sparked outrage among taxpayers, who are footing the bill for the Bank's operations. \"It's outrageous that the Bank is wasting taxpayer money on a lavish party while many people are struggling to make ends meet,\" said a local resident. \"The Bank should be focusing on supporting the economy, not indulging in frivolous spending.\" Critics have also questioned the timing of the party, given the current economic uncertainty and the Bank's role in regulating the financial system. The Bank's defenders argue that the event is a morale-booster for employees and helps to foster a sense of community. However, many are left wondering whether the Bank's priorities are misplaced.",

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, the professional body for the recruitment industry, says the public sector, including the NHS and schools, face up to seven more years of skills shortages, based on current demand. On Thursday the Office for National Statistics said the number of EU citizens coming to the UK for work had fallen to a six-year low. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief UK policy director, said: \"These latest statistics highlight the continuing trend of falling net EU migration amid growing shortages across all skills levels in the UK. Ninety-two per cent of businesses cited Brexit as impacting their ability to recruit and train staff in 2018. This means hospitals, schools and housebuilders are already struggling to get the staff they need. \"Banning workers from overseas earning less than £30,000 [as proposed by the government's migration advisory committee] will only make this worse.\" Research by the REC found that candidate availability was falling month on month, with 75% of employers saying they had little or no capacity to expand. The shortage of skilled workers is having a significant impact on the economy, with many businesses forced to turn down new contracts or projects due to a lack of staff. The CBI is calling on the government to rethink its immigration policies and prioritize the needs of businesses over ideology. \"The UK's skills shortage is not just a problem for individual businesses, but a major issue for the economy as a whole,\" said Fell. \"We need a pragmatic and flexible approach to immigration that recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining talent from around the world.\" The REC is also urging the government to take action, warning that the skills shortage could have long-term consequences for the economy if left unchecked. \"We need to see a more coordinated approach to addressing the skills shortage, including investment in training and apprenticeships, as well as a more flexible approach to immigration,\" said Neil Owen, REC's director of policy. \"The government must work with businesses and educators to find a solution to this crisis.\"",

        "Text": "Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors are not planning to appoint a new interim chairman to replace Carlos Ghosn as head of their carmaking alliance, following his shock arrest in Japan. Osamu Masuko, chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors, said on Thursday that the alliance would shift to a system where the group would be led by the heads of the three companies, rather than a single figurehead like Ghosn. Masuko, speaking to reporters in Tokyo, said changes to the alliance's capital structure were not discussed by company leaders at a meeting in Amsterdam. A change in the governance structure of the alliance was seen as likely by some analysts. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three manufacturers, was arrested 10 days ago after Nissan alleged he underreported income to regulators. Tokyo prosecutors are reportedly planning to extend the detention of Ghosn for a further 10 days, after which they must decide whether or not to charge him with a crime, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Thursday. The arrest has cast doubt on the future of the alliance. Nissan and Mitsubishi quickly moved to oust Ghosn as chair of their respective boards after the claims, but Renault decided not to remove him as chairman and chief executive. He also remains head of the car alliance. The alliance's leadership, Ghosn apart, met on Thursday in Amsterdam for an operational review which was scheduled before the arrest. Some executives attended via teleconference. The meeting was thought to be focused on operational issues of the alliance, which shares research and development, basic components, and some technology. A separate meeting of the board of Renault-Nissan BV, which runs the alliance, would be required to oust Ghosn. In a joint statement, the three companies said they \"have all – individually and collectively – emphatically reiterated their strong commitment to the alliance\". The companies emphasized that the alliance remains strong and that they will continue to work together to achieve their goals. However, analysts are still questioning the future of the alliance, given the controversy surrounding Ghosn's arrest and the uncertainty surrounding his fate. \"The alliance is not just about one person, it's about the partnership between the three companies,\" said a senior executive at one of the companies, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We will continue to work together to drive innovation and growth, regardless of what happens to Carlos Ghosn.\" The companies also announced that they will be holding a separate meeting to discuss the future of the alliance and how to move forward in the wake of Ghosn's arrest. The meeting is expected to take place in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the companies will continue to operate as usual, with each company's CEO and other executives taking on additional responsibilities to ensure the smooth operation of the alliance. Despite the uncertainty surrounding Ghosn's fate, the companies remain committed to the alliance and are working together to address the challenges ahead.",

Relations between the National Union of Journalists chapel at the Financial Times and management hit rock bottom in the summer when it emerged that Ridding had been paid £2.6m while the newspaper made an operating profit of £5.2m, prompting a backlash that saw him hand back about £500,000. The FT Group, the parent company of the newspaper, made more than £20m in profits. The NUJ chapel has now passed a vote of no confidence in Ridding after a fractious \"town hall\" meeting on Monday that was streamed live to all staff. In a statement the chapel said Ridding had not acknowledged or addressed serious concerns at the Financial Times in the speech broadcast to staff. The live broadcast was stopped at the end of formal speeches, meaning staff not in attendance were not able to watch the following debate about the issues. \"In the middle of a dispute over transparency, better governance and high executive pay at the FT, John Ridding failed to acknowledge or even address serious staff concerns over these matters in his speech to staff,\" said the chapel in a motion. \"Demonstrating a complete disregard for transparency, the live broadcast of the town hall meeting was stopped at the end of the formal speeches, preventing all staff not in the room from hearing the questions and responses.\" The statement, which was passed at a meeting of the FT's NUJ union on Wednesday, said that Ridding's action proved he had \"lost touch\" with staff, prompting the vote of no confidence. Ridding previously said his pay had been independently assessed and benchmarked with substantial performance-related incentives when the Japanese publishing business Nikkei bought the newspaper for £844m in 2015. The vote of no confidence is a significant blow to Ridding's leadership, and it is unclear what the next steps will be. The NUJ chapel has called for an emergency meeting with management to discuss the issues and find a resolution. The chapel has also demanded greater transparency and accountability from management, and has threatened to take industrial action if its demands are not met. The FT Group has not commented on the vote, but a spokesperson said that the company values its relationship with its staff and is committed to finding a solution to the issues. The tension between the NUJ chapel and management has been building for months, and the vote of no confidence is seen as a major escalation of the dispute. The outcome of the dispute remains uncertain, but it is clear that the relationship between the two parties has reached a breaking point.",

The industry regulator ordered Casumo to pay a penalty package of £5.85m, while Videoslots will pay £1m in lieu of a financial penalty. Daub Alderney was hit with a fine of £7.1m, previously announced. A fourth company, CZ Holdings, surrendered its right to provide gambling services in the UK after the regulator opened a review of its licence. A further six firms remain under investigation. Three individuals have also been stripped of their licence to serve as directors of gambling companies, four were issued with warnings and three are under investigation. Collectively, the payout far outstrips the largest penalty handed out by the industry regulator, a £7.8m fine paid by online casino firm 888 after more than 7,000 people who had voluntarily banned themselves from the site were allowed to continue betting. Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: \"Any online operator that thinks it can ignore its duty to protect players should take note today – there will be consequences. Protecting vulnerable consumers is our prime concern, and it must be the priority for gambling operators too. \"There are robust requirements to safeguard players and prevent money-laundering which all businesses must adhere to if they wish to operate in the British market. I am pleased to see the Gambling Commission taking the strongest possible action when companies fail to meet their obligations.\" The commission has hardened its stance against gambling companies in the past couple of years, issuing millions of pounds worth of fines to firms including William Hill, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and SkyBet for failures relating to money-laundering and problem gambling. The commission's chief executive, Neil McArthur, said online casino operators should \"sit up and pay attention\". The Gambling Commission's latest enforcement action sends a strong message to the online casino industry that non-compliance will not be tolerated. The regulator has been cracking down on operators who fail to meet their regulatory obligations, and this latest batch of penalties is a testament to its commitment to protecting consumers and preventing money-laundering. The commission's increased scrutiny has already led to significant changes in the industry, with many operators overhauling their systems and processes to ensure compliance.\n\nHowever, the Gambling Commission's efforts are not without controversy. Some have criticized the regulator's approach, arguing that the penalties imposed are too lenient and do not adequately reflect the severity of the breaches. Others have raised concerns about the impact of the commission's actions on smaller, independent operators who may not have the same resources as larger companies to comply with the regulator's demands.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the Gambling Commission remains committed to its mission of protecting consumers and ensuring a fair and safe gambling environment. As the regulator continues to crack down on non-compliance, operators would do well to take heed of its warnings and ensure that they are meeting their regulatory obligations. Anything less could result in serious consequences, including fines, penalties, and even the loss of their licence to operate in the UK.",

A growing number of businesses in New York and cities around the country have adopted cashless policies, refusing to accept paper currency and requiring customers to pay with debit or credit cards. The trend has spread from hipster coffee shops to popular burrito and salad chains, with business owners saying it's quicker and easier to dispense with cash. But city councilman Ritchie Torres, who introduced the legislation to prohibit the practice, said it freezes out people who don't have access to bank accounts and credit cards, who are more likely to be low-income and people of color. The same concerns have prompted proposed bans in Philadelphia and Washington DC. Torres called the proposals a \"new frontier\" of anti-discrimination law, needed to prevent a \"gentrification of the marketplace\" by businesses unwilling to accept cash. \"A cashless business model has an exclusionary effect on the impoverished, the homeless, the underbanked, the undocumented,\" he told the Guardian. Studies have found that nearly 12% of New Yorkers do not have bank accounts. Poor people may have trouble maintaining an account because they require a minimum balance or charge fees, while credit cards require a good credit score. Unauthorized immigrants cannot open an account at many banks if they lack proper ID. \"If you live in a bubble of wealthy white privilege, you have reason to believe that everyone has a card. \"But if you live in a neighborhood where poverty and inequality are a reality, you know that's not the case,\" Torres said. \"We can't let businesses decide who they want to serve and who they don't. We have to make sure that everyone has access to the goods and services they need, regardless of their financial situation.\" The proposed legislation would not only ban cashless businesses but also require existing businesses to continue accepting cash. Advocates for the poor and immigrant communities are hailing the move as a crucial step towards economic equality. \"This is a victory for the people who have been left behind by the cashless revolution,\" said Maria Rodriguez, a community organizer with the Coalition for Economic Justice. \"We can't let our city become a place where only the wealthy can participate in the economy.\" The proposal is expected to face opposition from business owners who argue that the requirement to accept cash would increase their costs and decrease their efficiency. However, city officials say they are willing to work with businesses to find a solution that balances their needs with the needs of the community. The legislation is set to be voted on by the city council in the coming months.",

Ahead of the G20 meeting in Argentina, which begins on Friday, the US president used a newspaper interview to warn China that he expects to move ahead on the imposition of higher import tariffs on Chinese goods. The news sent shares lower in London and New York on Tuesday, after Trump told the Wall Street Journal it was \"highly unlikely\" that he would heed a call by Beijing to refrain from increasing the tariffs from the start of next year. It paves the way for the existing 10% US import tariff on $200bn (£158bn) of Chinese goods to increase to 25% from 1 January. Economists at the Dutch lender Rabobank said the world economy could suffer badly over the next decade if the US-China trade war escalates further, with as much as 2% of GDP growth lost by 2030. Hugo Erken, senior economist at the bank, said: \"An ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies has much broader ramifications that transcend their own borders … in a globalised economy, there are no real winners from such policies.\" The warning from Trump came as the US and China have been engaged in a trade dispute for months, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's goods. The US has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of US goods.\n\nThe US president's comments have sparked concerns that the trade dispute could escalate further, leading to a global economic downturn. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the trade tensions could lead to a global recession.\n\nMeanwhile, European leaders are also concerned about the impact of the trade dispute on the global economy. The European Union has called for a negotiated solution to the dispute, and has warned that the trade tensions could lead to a decline in global trade.\n\nThe G20 meeting in Argentina is seen as a crucial moment in the trade dispute, with world leaders expected to discuss the issue and try to find a solution. The meeting is also expected to be attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders from around the world.\n\nThe trade dispute has already had a significant impact on the global economy, with many countries feeling the effects of the tariffs and retaliatory measures.

In November 2016, attackers obtained credentials to access Uber's cloud servers and downloaded 16 large files, including the records of 35 million users worldwide. The records included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and the location where they had signed up. Drivers were also affected, with 3.7 million, including 82,000 from the UK, having their weekly pay, trip summaries and, in a small number of cases, driver's licence numbers accessed. The ICO said the breach was caused by inadequate information security, and was compounded by Uber US's decision to not disclose the attack, instead complying with the hackers' demands to pay $100,000 as a \"bug bounty\". Such bounties are common in the security world, with companies offering rewards to researchers who find and notify them of system weaknesses before they can be attacked. However, the ICO wrote: \"Uber US did not follow the normal operation of its bug bounty programme. In this incident Uber US paid outside attackers who were fundamentally different from legitimate bug bounty recipients: instead of merely identifying a vulnerability and disclosing it responsibly, they maliciously exploited the vulnerability and intentionally acquired personal information relating to Uber users.\" It said none of the people whose personal data had been compromised were notified of the breach. Instead, the company only began monitoring accounts for fraud 12 months after the attack. However, the potential penalty was mitigated by the fact that Uber's European branches were also not informed of the breach, meaning the company was not able to report it to the commissioner; and by the lack of evidence that the compromised data was misused. Uber US was ordered in September to pay $148m for failing to notify drivers about the breach. In a statement, Uber said \"We're pleased to close this chapter on the data incident from 2016. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has announced that the fine is the maximum amount it can impose under the Data Protection Act 1998, and it is the largest fine ever imposed by the ICO. The regulator also expressed concern that Uber's handling of the breach was \"not a one-off\" and that the company's \"inadequate\" approach to data security has been a recurring issue.\n\nThe ICO's investigation found that Uber's failure to report the breach was a \"serious\" breach of the Data Protection Act and that the company's handling of the incident was \"unacceptable\". The regulator also criticized Uber's decision to pay the hackers $100,000 to delete the stolen data, saying that this was not a responsible or ethical way to handle the breach.\n\nThe fine is seen as a warning to other companies to take data security seriously and to report breaches promptly. The ICO's Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said: \"Uber's failure to comply with the law has caused significant distress to millions of people. This fine reflects the severity of the breach and the fact that it was not a one-off mistake, but rather a systemic failure to protect personal data.\"\n\nUber has faced criticism in the past for its handling of data breaches, including a major breach in 2016 that affected 57 million users worldwide. The company has also faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability in its handling of data breaches. The fine is seen as a major blow to the company's reputation and a warning to other companies to take data security seriously.",

I contacted Wyevale's customer services and was provided with a specific code to redeem my gift cards online. After a few minutes of navigating the website, I successfully redeemed my cards and received a voucher with the full value intact. I was relieved that the process was straightforward and that I didn't lose any value. Although it was inconvenient that I couldn't use the cards at my local centre, I appreciated the company's efforts to communicate the changes to customers and provide alternative options.

An ABC spokesperson said the termination payment was made to Guthrie in line with her contractual entitlements. Guardian Australia understands it was determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, which oversees federal public servants' pay. The ABC said it had confirmed the sum from people involved in the negotiations. Guthrie was terminated by the board just two years into her five-year term as managing director. It has since emerged that she clashed with the former chairman Justin Milne over a number of issues and Guthrie alleged Milne had pressured her to take account of political sensitivities in Canberra. In the wake of the upheaval and facing allegations of political interference, Milne was also forced to resign. At the time of her sacking, Guthrie said she was considering her legal options and has since lodged a case with the Fair Work Commission. Guthrie, the first female managing director of the ABC, received a total remuneration package of $963,991 in the previous financial year. The exact amount of Guthrie's total remuneration package has not been disclosed, but it is understood to be significantly higher than the $963,991 she received in the previous financial year.

In this case they will attempt to set down their probe, InSight, gently on to an area known as Elysium Planitia where it is intended to analyse seismic activity on the red planet. More probes have been sent to Mars than any other planet in the solar system but more than half of these missions have ended in failure, with the final stages, involving landing gently on the Martian surface, proving to be particularly dangerous and unsuccessful. The thin atmosphere on Mars – just 1% of Earth's – means there is little friction to slow down a spacecraft, and that has played a key role in past failures. Hence the nervousness of Nasa engineers who are directing their $800m InSight craft after a 300 million-mile journey at a tiny target zone in the planet's atmosphere measuring a mere 15 miles by 6 miles. If InSight passes through this keyhole precisely then it ought to land in the middle of the Elysium Planitia, though it will still need a heat-resistant capsule, a parachute and rockets to cut its velocity from 12,000mph to 5mph and ensure it arrives softly and safely after a seven-minute descent.

Axolotl A relative of the salamander but even more skilled at regenerating is the axolotl. This animal can regenerate not just its tail but also limbs, skin and almost any other body part. Researchers found that each time a limb was removed, it regrew almost perfectly. The pale pink creature has since become the focus of research into human limb regeneration. Starfish These five-limbed creatures can regrow arms that detach from their central disc, and some species have even been observed to complete the process in reverse: regrowing an entire body from a lost arm. The study of these remarkable creatures has sparked new hope for human regenerative medicine, particularly in the field of limb reconstruction. Researchers are eager to unlock the secrets behind the axolotl's remarkable ability to regenerate entire limbs, which could potentially lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of traumatic injuries and birth defects. Meanwhile, scientists are also exploring the unique properties of the starfish, which can regrow its entire body from a single arm. By understanding how these creatures are able to regenerate complex body parts, researchers hope to develop new treatments for human patients. The discovery of these regenerative abilities has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine, and scientists are excited to continue studying these fascinating creatures to unlock their secrets.",

Odey collected £1.5m from Odey Asset Management in the year to 5 April, a 72% decline on the £5.5m he made in the previous 12 months, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The hedge fund he founded in 1991 reported a 52% fall in profit to £8.8m, as Odey's bets against the pound and a raft of UK retailers failed to immediately bear fruit. Odey Asset Management has declared £149m of short positions against UK shops, banks, estate agents and property companies. However, the fund has performed strongly in recent months, as the pound has fallen further and the share prices of a number of British businesses Odey bet against have collapsed. His fund has gained more than 50% so far this year, including a return of 7% in October, making it one of the world's best-performing hedge funds, according to the Financial Times. Last month, the fund made millions from a bet against the shopping centre owner Intu, shares in which plunged 42% after a proposed takeover collapsed. Odey also benefited from a £33m bet against Debenhams, which has had an 85% decline in its shares over the past year. Odey was one of the most prominent supporters of the drive to leave the EU and donated almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns. Despite his recent success, Odey's fortunes have not always been aligned with the UK's economic performance. In 2016, he famously bet against the pound, predicting a sharp decline in its value following the Brexit referendum. However, the pound has actually rallied since then, and Odey's bet against it has resulted in significant losses for his fund. The billionaire has also been criticized for his outspoken views on the UK's economy and politics, with some accusing him of being a \"naked short seller\" who profits from the decline of British businesses. Despite this, Odey remains a prominent figure in the financial world, and his fund's recent performance has made him one of the most successful hedge fund managers of the year. The exact extent of Odey's losses and gains is not publicly known, but it is clear that his fund has been a major player in the UK's financial markets in recent years.",

Servers controlling the digital butler were overloaded with questions and requests, prompting Alexa to tell some users: \"Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you right now.\" The crash, at about 10am GMT, caused Amazon customers to complain about not being able to play festive songs, turn on their living room lights or get cooking instructions for Christmas dinner. Richard Hyland tweeted: \"Good day for Amazon's Alexa to crash. It's not like people might want to register new devices or play music or anything.\" Alexa works by sending voice commands via an Amazon Echo device to a server, where a computer interprets them. Instructions then go back to the Echo and the gadget plays music, reads the weather and performs tasks such as turning the lights on. The outage was short-lived, but not before many users took to social media to vent their frustration. \"Just tried to get Alexa to play some festive tunes and got the error message 'Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you right now',\" tweeted @SarahJ84. \"Not exactly the holiday cheer I was expecting!\" Another user, @AlexTheTechGuy, joked that \"it seems Alexa is having a holiday meltdown\". Amazon apologized for the inconvenience and attributed the crash to \"unprecedented demand\" on Christmas Day. The company has since confirmed that the issue has been resolved and Alexa is back to its usual chatty self. Despite the temporary setback, Amazon's Alexa remains one of the most popular virtual assistants on the market, with millions of devices sold worldwide. With its vast library of skills and seamless integration with other smart devices, it's no wonder Alexa has become an integral part of many people's daily lives. However, it seems that even the most advanced technology can't always handle the demands of the holiday season.",

And when it comes to car aesthetics I am often seriously out of step with vehicle designers. I'd say that the three ugliest cars of the past decade are the Porsche Cayenne, Nissan Juke and Range Rover Evoque. Yet all three have gone on to become massive successes. Now, the all-new Evoque is here and the latest version of the baby Range Rover is probably going to be even more popular than the last. It's the second generation of the compact SUV and, though some elements still remain (the clamshell bonnet, bulging wheel arches, ultra-slim rear windows), the overall effect is a car that has grown-up. It's now more sophisticated, cleaner and less of a poseur. Under the skin, there are significant changes – all of the automatic variants, whether diesel or petrol, will have a mild-hybrid system to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The new Evoque also boasts a more refined interior, with premium materials and a sleek, modern design. The cabin is quieter and more comfortable than before, thanks to improved sound insulation and a more supportive seat. Technology has also taken a significant leap forward, with a 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a range of advanced safety features, including autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning. With a starting price of £31,600, the all-new Range Rover Evoque is set to be a hot seller, and it's easy to see why. Its combination of style, substance, and practicality make it an attractive option for those looking for a premium compact SUV. With deliveries expected to begin in spring 2019, potential buyers will have to wait just a little longer to get behind the wheel of this exciting new vehicle.",

Official figures confirmed the economy bounced back from the freezing temperatures earlier in the year as shoppers spent heavily during the football World Cup and a long heatwave. But more detailed data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that consumers, hit by rising utility bills and transport costs, had to cope with almost static disposable incomes, forcing them to dip into savings to maintain their spending habits. The ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said households spent more than they received for an unprecedented eighth quarter in a row, raising questions about their ability to keep on spending and driving the country's economy. More recent surveys have appeared to fuel concerns that consumer spending is running out of steam, with a string of high street retailers saying November was a terrible month for sales. A profit warning from the online retailer Asos shocked analysts that had grown used to web-based operators riding out the spending downturn. Business investment fell for the third consecutive quarter. The last time it fell for nine months consecutively was in the depths of the financial crisis a decade ago. The cumulative effect is expected to reduce GDP growth in the final quarter of 2018 down to almost zero. The Bank of England said on Thursday that companies were scaling back investment due to Brexit uncertainty, although the risk of disruption at the borders had boosted spending on warehousing and port capacity. The concerning trend is likely to continue, with the CBI's latest quarterly economic survey showing that companies expect investment to decline further in the coming months. The survey also revealed that firms are becoming increasingly cautious about taking on new staff, with recruitment intentions at their lowest level since 2012. Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that the lack of investment is having a \"chilling effect\" on the economy, with many businesses putting expansion plans on hold due to the uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU. The BCC's director general, Dr Adam Marshall, called on the government to provide greater clarity on the terms of Brexit to help businesses make informed decisions about their future investment plans. As the UK's economy teeters on the brink of a slowdown, policymakers are under growing pressure to take action to boost confidence and stimulate growth.",

Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has recently shut down key London roads, has demand the BBC makes the environment its \"top editorial issue\". Broadcasting House was locked down early on Friday afternoon, with BBC staff and guests unable to enter or leave the building while security kept the peaceful but noisy protesters away from the entrance. Extinction Rebellion activists, who are demanding a meeting with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation had a duty to broadcast about climate change with \"the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war\". The broadcaster Anneka Rice said she was stuck in the BBC reception \"with Simon Mayo, Ken Bruce and three policemen\" during the protest. Extinction Rebellion also organised protests on Friday at BBC offices in Bristol, Glasgow, Cambridge, Birmingham, Truro, Sheffield, Bangor, and the broadcaster's Berlin bureau. The campaign group launched two months ago, with a declaration of support from public figures including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who backed a campaign of civil disobedience to draw attention to the threat of climate and ecological change. Since then, Extinction Rebellion activists have blocked bridges and glued themselves to the gates of Downing Street, earning media attention that has allowed the campaign to spread to 35 overseas countries. The BBC has been criticised for its coverage of climate change, especially the decision to give airtime to climate change sceptics such as Lord Lawson, who oppose the scientific consensus. Earlier this year, the head of news, Fran Unsworth, told staff that the corporation had struggled with the topic: \"Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.\" The protesters, who were peaceful but determined, held signs and banners reading \"Climate Emergency\" and \"BBC, Tell the Truth\". They chanted slogans and sang songs, including a rendition of \"We Shall Overcome\", to draw attention to their cause. Meanwhile, BBC staff and guests were forced to wait outside the building, some of whom were seen taking photos and videos of the protest.\n\nThe BBC's director general, Tony Hall, was said to be \"aware of the situation\" and was being kept informed by security officials. However, it was unclear whether he would meet with the protesters or address their demands.\n\nThe lockdown caused disruption to the BBC's operations, with some programmes and broadcasts being delayed or cancelled. However, the corporation's online services and social media channels remained unaffected.\n\nAs the protest continued into the evening, Extinction Rebellion activists claimed that they had received \"overwhelming support\" from the public, with many people stopping to watch and take photos. They also reported that several high-profile celebrities, including actors and musicians, had expressed their support for the campaign.\n\nThe BBC's decision to lock down its headquarters has sparked debate about the corporation's role in covering climate change and its responsibility to inform the public about the issue. Critics have accused the BBC of being too cautious in its coverage of climate change, while others have argued that the corporation has a duty to balance different viewpoints and perspectives.\n\nAs the standoff between the BBC and Extinction Rebellion continues, it remains to be seen whether the corporation will give in to the protesters' demands or find a way to address their concerns without compromising its editorial independence. One thing is certain, however: the debate about climate change and the BBC's role in covering it has reached a boiling point.",

The company reported its third record profit in a row, capitalizing on a strong holiday retail season and its growing, high-margin businesses such as cloud computing and advertising. The Seattle-based company reported a profit of $3.03bn, or $6.04 a share, up from $1.86bn, or $3.75 a share, on the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue grew 20% to $72.38bn. Amazon's voice-controlled virtual assistant Alexa, and the devices which play it, helped the performance. \"Alexa was very busy during her holiday season. Echo Dot was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon globally, and customers purchased millions more devices from the Echo family compared to last year,\" Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, said in a statement. Most importantly for investors, Amazon's cloud-computing division said revenue jumped 45% in the fourth quarter, cementing its lead over Google and Microsoft. The division has been growing at 40% per annum and is a high margin business compared to retail. The cloud business has become crucial to the success of its parent, not only for revenue but also for profits. The company's strong performance has led to a surge in its stock price, with shares rising over 2% in after-hours trading. Analysts are predicting a continued growth trajectory for Amazon, driven by its expanding cloud computing and advertising businesses. \"Amazon's cloud business is a significant driver of its growth and profitability, and we expect this trend to continue,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst, Rishi Jalali. The company's retail business also showed signs of improvement, with sales growing 10% in the quarter. Amazon's focus on improving customer experience and increasing sales through its online platform has paid off, with the company reporting a 30% increase in same-day and one-day delivery orders. With its strong financial performance and growing businesses, Amazon is well-positioned to continue its dominance in the e-commerce and technology industries.",

UK car factories produced 1.52m vehicles last year, 9.1% fewer than 2017, according to figures published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK auto industry lobby group. Production for the British market fell by 16.3%. Investment into British car manufacturing almost halved during the year to £588.6m, a fall which the SMMT blamed on Brexit uncertainty. Publicly announced investments were lower than in any year since 2012, the first year comparable data was collected. \"Investment is effectively stalled,\" said Mike Hawes, the SMMT's chief executive. \"Industry is waiting to see what happens. Business is sitting on its hands in terms of investment.\" The global automotive industry is already struggling with multiple challenges. Car sales in China fell in 2018 for the first time since the 1990s, while demand for diesel vehicles in Europe has been rocked by the regulatory backlash to Volkswagen's emissions-cheating scandal. However, manufacturers with UK operations have expressed growing concerns that a no-deal Brexit will damage one of the most prominent British manufacturing success stories to the benefit of other nations. Carmakers have built their businesses around \"just-in-time\" deliveries of parts, meaning delays at the border could be costly, risking British jobs. \"Brexit uncertainty has already done enormous damage to output, investment and jobs,\" said Hawes. The uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the European Union has also led to a decline in consumer confidence, with many Britons delaying purchases of new cars. \"The market is very fragile, and the lack of clarity on Brexit is making it difficult for people to make decisions,\" said Ian Callum, design director at Jaguar Land Rover. \"We're seeing a decline in sales, and it's not just the UK market - it's a global issue.\"\n\nThe slump in car production is a major concern for the UK economy, which relies heavily on the automotive industry. The sector employs around 800,000 people and contributes £18 billion to the country's GDP. The SMMT estimates that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a loss of up to 10% of the industry's workforce, equivalent to around 80,000 jobs.\n\nThe government has been urged to provide clarity on its Brexit plans to help restore confidence in the industry. \"The automotive sector is a vital part of the UK's economy, and it's essential that the government provides a clear and stable framework for the industry to operate in,\" said Hawes. \"We need to see a deal that works for everyone, and that allows the industry to thrive.\"\n\nThe industry is also calling for greater investment in electric vehicle technology and infrastructure to help the UK meet its environmental targets. \"We need to see a commitment to electric vehicle development and infrastructure investment to help the UK meet its climate change targets,\" said Callum. \"It's a critical area for the industry, and we need to see a clear plan from the government.\"\n\nAs the industry waits for clarity on Brexit, car manufacturers are also facing other challenges, including the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, and the rise of electric vehicles. The industry is expected to continue to face challenges in the coming years, but the SMMT is hopeful that a Brexit deal can help restore confidence and drive growth. \"We're working closely with the government to find a solution that works for everyone,\" said Hawes. \"We're confident that with a clear plan, the industry can thrive and continue to be a major contributor to the UK economy.\"",

They know how I'm feeling and, because I am juvenile, they also know when my blood pressure is 69/100 – nice. Illness, especially chronic illness, can be very isolating. Not only does it limit how and when you can socialise, it causes you to feel unattractive. There's more to life than being considered sexually desirable, but while there have been plenty of campaigns about weight, few – bar the #hospitalglam hashtag – challenge the idea that only healthy is sexy.

        "Text": "It is a 100% mortgage but not, thank goodness, as we once knew them. Lloyds Bank's new Lend a Hand mortgage offers first-time buyers the chance to borrow the entire price of their new home – but with the considerable caveat that a relative has to have a lump sum worth 10% that they are willing to tie up for three years, and have it raided if you miss any payments. So, first up: this is no use at all for anyone without a family member with a chunk of cash they don't need, willing to help them on to the housing ladder. But nor is it the return of the bumper mortgage market we saw in the run-up to the financial crash, where loans of up to 125% were available (leaving some borrowers trapped in negative equity after the downturn). There is still careful thinking to be done before taking on a mortgage this size – and never more so than now, with uncertainty over Brexit clouding the market. Lloyds' deal offers a mortgage of up to £500,000, which can be arranged over up to 30 years. The rate is a competitive 2.99%, fixed for three years, making it very slightly cheaper than the similar Springboard deal from Barclays. Over that same period, your family member's cash sits in a linked account and earns interest at 1.5% above the base rate – a good deal in the current market. After three years they can take their cash, and you either move to Lloyds' standard variable rate (SVR) or look for a new mortgage. According to Andrew Hagger of Moneycomms.co.uk, if house prices do not budge between now and then, someone who has opted for a 30-year term will have paid off 6.5% of their loan – leaving them in need of a 93.5% mortgage to switch to. Moneyfacts.co.uk figures show that there are remortgage deals available with the same rate as the Lloyds' loan, so switching would not be too painful. However, it's worth noting that the Lend a Hand mortgage is not without its risks. If the borrower misses a payment, the relative's tied-up cash can be used to cover the shortfall. This could put a strain on the family relationship, and may also impact the credit score of the relative. Additionally, if the borrower defaults on the loan, the relative's cash could be used to pay off the outstanding balance, potentially leaving them without their original lump sum.\n\nDespite these potential pitfalls, Lloyds Bank is hopeful that the Lend a Hand mortgage will help more people get on the housing ladder. The bank's mortgage director, Helen Cooke, said: \"We know that saving for a deposit can be a significant barrier to homeownership, and we're excited to offer a solution that can help first-time buyers get started.\" The mortgage is available to applicants who meet Lloyds' usual lending criteria, and can be applied for online or in branch. With interest rates remaining low and the government's Help to Buy scheme still in place, it's an interesting time for first-time buyers to consider getting on the property ladder. But as always, it's essential to do your research and carefully consider all the options before committing to a mortgage.",

And that figure rises to 40% for those with two children, according to a major study that analysed 11 key indicators of chronic stress levels. Professor Tarani Chandola, of Manchester University, and Dr Cara Booker, Professor Meena Kumari and Professor Michaela Benzeval, of the Institute for Social and Economic Research at Essex University, examined biological data taken by nurses from 6,025 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, the largest survey of its kind in the world. They adjusted the raw data to exclude other factors that could influence their findings, such as the women's ages, ethnicity, education, occupation and income, allowing them to focus solely on working hours and family conditions. According to their research, just published in the journal Sociology, neither working from home nor flexitime had an effect on women's chronic stress levels. But reducing the number of hours they worked did have a positive impact. \"Work-family conflict is associated with increased psychological strain, with higher levels of stress and lower levels of wellbeing,\" Chandola said. \"Parents of young children are at particular risk of work-family conflict. Working conditions that are not flexible to these family demands, such as long working hours, could adversely impact on a person's stress reactions.\" Overall, the 11 indicators, known as \"biomarkers\", produce something called an \"allostatic load\", a measure of the cumulative wear and tear on the body's physiological systems, which can indicate poor health and a greater risk of death. \"Repeated stressful events arising from combinations of social and environmental stressors and major traumatic life events result in chronic stress, which in turn affects health,\" Kumari said. The researchers found that the biomarkers indicating chronic stress, including hormone levels and blood pressure, were 40% higher for women working full time while bringing up two children than among women working full time with no children. The study's findings have significant implications for policymakers and employers, who may need to rethink their approaches to supporting working mothers. \"Our research suggests that simply offering flexible working hours or the option to work from home may not be enough to alleviate stress for working mothers,\" said Dr. Booker. \"What's needed is a more fundamental shift in the way we think about work and family life. Employers could consider implementing policies such as reduced working hours, job sharing, or compressed hours to better support working mothers.\" The researchers also emphasized the importance of social support networks for working mothers, suggesting that friends, family, and community resources could play a crucial role in reducing stress levels. \"Working mothers are not alone in this struggle,\" said Professor Chandola. \"We need to create a society that values and supports the caregiving role, and recognizes the incredible challenges that working mothers face every day.\" The study's authors hope that their research will inform policy changes and help to create a more equitable and supportive environment for working mothers.",

According to the latest snapshot from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly distributive trades survey, retail businesses raised the ratio of their stocks to expected sales in January to the highest level since February 2008. The report, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the UK economy, said retailers expected demand to fall and had built up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal. A growing number of companies have begun ramping up their plans for a potentially disruptive no-deal Brexit at the end of March, with Westminster still gridlocked since Theresa May suffered the biggest government defeat in history over her Brexit plan. Firms including Bentley, the luxury carmaker, and retailers such as Dixons Carphone and Pets at Home have announced plans to shore up supplies in the event of chaos at British ports. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, said: \"There are early signs of companies bracing themselves for a no-deal Brexit: some of our wholesalers are now reporting that they're building up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal.\" The CBI distributive trades survey, which has run since 1983, surveyed 103 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between 27 December and 14 January. The companies represent a third of all employment in retailing. The report also found that the ratio of stocks to expected sales had increased across all sectors, including food, clothing, and electronics. This suggests that retailers are preparing for a range of potential outcomes, including stockpiling essential items such as food and toiletries. The CBI survey also revealed that retailers are becoming increasingly cautious about investing in new stock, with many opting to hold onto existing inventory rather than taking on new risk.\n\nThe move to stockpile comes as the UK government continues to struggle to agree on a Brexit deal, with many businesses warning of the potential for widespread disruption and economic uncertainty. The CBI has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to shortages of goods, including food and medicines, and has called on the government to take immediate action to mitigate the risks.\n\nIn addition to the CBI survey, other industry reports have also highlighted the growing concerns among retailers and wholesalers. The Food and Drink Federation has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to food shortages and price increases, while the British Retail Consortium has called for the government to provide clarity on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the March 29 deadline, businesses are increasingly bracing themselves for the worst. With the government still gridlocked and the possibility of a no-deal Brexit looming large, many are taking steps to prepare for the potential disruption. The CBI's report is a stark reminder of the urgent need for the government to take action to mitigate the risks and ensure a smooth transition for businesses and consumers alike.",

        "Text": "Netflix is seeing off Amazon's challenge to its streaming supremacy, by adding double the number of UK subscribers than its rival and is now in almost 10m homes. Netflix, which is up for 15 Oscars including best picture and director for Roma, hit 9.7m UK subscribers at the end of the third quarter last year, according to a new report from TV measurement body Barb. The report estimates that rival Amazon's Prime Video service is only just over half the size of Netflix in the UK - with 4.9m users - with Netflix continuing to extend its lead. Netflix UK added 2.2m new subscribers in the year to the end of the third quarter 2018, double the 1.1m Amazon added, growing at almost 30% in the third quarter. \"Change is afoot as subscription video-on-demand services continue to cement their place in the television ecosystem,\" said Barb. \"Netflix is the main driver.\" While Netflix continues to be the most popular service, fuelled by a $13bn (£10bn) budget to spend on making and licensing TV shows and films, the report reveals that homes with children aged up to nine are more likely to subscribe to Amazon. Amazon bundles its video service with its Prime subscription package which includes perks such as one-day delivery on products bought on the website and access to Amazon Music. \"The presence of young children, and the unique pressures that they bring, may be playing a part here,\" said Barb. \"The double carrot of on-demand content and next day delivery of urgently needed household items may be enticing their families towards Amazon.\" Overall, the UK's three biggest subscription video-on-demand services, which also includes Sky's Now TV, added 3.45m customers over the year taking their combined total to 16.2m, a 27% annual increase. This is more than the number of subscribers to traditional pay-TV packages from providers including Sky, BT, Virgin Media and TalkTalk. The report also highlighted the growing importance of subscription video-on-demand services in the UK's TV landscape, with the three main players - Netflix, Amazon, and Now TV - now accounting for more than a quarter of the total TV viewing audience. This shift is likely to continue, with more consumers opting for flexible, on-demand viewing options over traditional linear TV. Meanwhile, the number of traditional pay-TV subscribers continued to decline, with a 12% annual drop to 14.3m households. The findings have significant implications for the TV industry, with broadcasters and content creators needing to adapt to the changing viewing habits of UK consumers. As the battle for streaming supremacy continues, Netflix's dominance in the UK market is likely to remain a key factor in the industry's evolution.",

        "Text": "Metro Bank shares plunged to fresh lows on Wednesday, after the lender shocked markets with plans to raise a further £350m just months after its last cash call. The high street challenger also revealed that it is under investigation by City regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority, over a major accounting failure first disclosed last month. The announcements were made alongside the bank's annual results on Tuesday night. Metro Bank's share price slumped once again on Wednesday and was down more than 26% at about 950p shortly before the London market closed. The company's shares have lost 50% of their value since the accounting issue was announced. The lender confirmed in January that hundreds of millions of pounds of commercial property loans and loans to commercial buy-to-let operators had been wrongly classified in risk terms and should have been among its \"risk-weighted assets\" (RWAs). While the bank originally suggested it had uncovered the issue on its own, it later emerged the error was caught by the PRA. Craig Donaldson, the CEO, is now giving up his annual bonus, which was worth £800,000 in 2017, over the debacle. He also offered to resign, but said he has full backing of the board and is staying put. After apologising to investors over the affair, he denied that the latest cash call was influenced by the loans misclassification. The challenger bank raised £303m from investors last July, after which Donaldson ruled out further cash calls to fuel the lender's growth in the medium term. When asked to respond to criticism over his U-turn, the CEO said: \"I think it's fair to say that we would always look to raise capital when it's right for the organisation and we want to raise capital in advance of the growth, and therefore we made the decision over the last few days and weeks to raise the capital now.\" John Cronin, a financials analyst at stockbroker Goodbody, said the recent slowdown in deposit growth and the fact that Metro was \"consistently in need\" of more core capital were all \"serious concerns\". He said it is not yet clear how the stock would react over the coming days, but expected shares to fall to 729p. The bank's reliance on external funding has also raised concerns among investors, who are questioning the lender's ability to sustain its growth plans without a steady influx of capital. Some analysts have also pointed out that the £350m cash call is not only a significant increase from the previous fundraising, but also comes at a time when the bank's deposit growth has slowed. With the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority still investigating the accounting error, Metro Bank's shares are likely to remain under pressure in the coming days. The bank's CEO, Craig Donaldson, has acknowledged the challenges ahead, but remains confident in the lender's long-term prospects. \"We are committed to putting this issue behind us and focusing on delivering strong growth and returns for our shareholders,\" he said. However, many investors will be watching closely to see if the bank can restore confidence in its management and financial stability.",

        "Text": "Retail workers in Britain are more likely to face unemployment rather than finding another job amid mounting numbers of job losses on the high street, with younger staff hardest hit, according to a report. The study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found the retail industry now has the highest rate of redundancies of any sector of the economy, amid the rapid rise of shop closures across the country. The analysis comes as growing numbers of UK retailers announce job cuts and store closures across the country, with losses at major high street employers such as M&S, Debenhams and HMV. Growth in consumer spending eased last year, worsened by the rise in inflation that followed the Brexit vote, while changing spending habits and a move online have also harmed traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, which typically employ greater numbers of workers. In a worrying signal for retail workers facing redundancy, the Resolution Foundation said as many as 31% exit their roles straight into unemployment, rather than into another job, compared to the average of 26% for all areas of the economy. Two in five ex-retail staff are unemployed for at least six months, with greater risks for younger workers. As many as three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30 – despite barely a third of the workforce being in this age bracket. Daniel Tomlinson, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Life has become tougher for those leaving retail, who are more likely to find themselves unemployed – and for longer, too. The report highlights the devastating impact of the retail crisis on young workers, who are often more vulnerable to job losses and longer periods of unemployment. The findings suggest that the retail industry is not only shedding jobs but also eroding the livelihoods of thousands of workers, particularly in their 20s and 30s. The Resolution Foundation's analysis reveals that the majority of former retail workers who become unemployed are aged between 20 and 29, with a staggering 60% of them being under the age of 30.\n\nThe thinktank's research also underscores the difficulties faced by retail workers in finding alternative employment. According to the study, only 14% of former retail staff are able to secure a job in the same industry, while 21% move into other sectors, such as hospitality or healthcare. The remaining 65% are left without a job, with many struggling to find employment in their chosen field.\n\nThe news comes as the retail industry continues to grapple with the challenges posed by online shopping, changing consumer habits, and rising costs. As major high street brands continue to announce job cuts and store closures, the future looks uncertain for thousands of retail workers. The Resolution Foundation's report serves as a stark reminder of the need for policymakers to address the root causes of the retail crisis and provide support to those affected by job losses.",

Alicante airport, which serves Benidorm and other Costa Blanca resorts, is likely to be the worst-affected airport, and Which? said visitors to Tenerife, Lanzarote and Málaga were also facing \"life in the slow lane\". It calculated that if airports spent only 90 seconds making extra checks on each UK passport, it would take a single passport lane in an EU airport five hours longer to process a Ryanair flight with 189 UK passengers on board. Alicante is likely to be worst hit because 43% of its arrivals are from the UK. Even in February, the airport processes as many as 10 planes from the UK in a single hour. In total, 2.9 million British passport holders go through the airport each year. Portugal plans special UK lanes at Faro airport in the Algarve and Funchal, the capital of Madeira, to provide fast-track access for British passport holders, irrespective of a Brexit deal or no deal, but Spain has yet to formally reveal its position. Rory Boland, the travel editor of Which?, said: \"Airports can be chaotic at the best of times but if additional checks at passport control are implemented in the event of a no-deal, it seems that very long queues are going to be an unwanted side effect. \"Until there is a deal or these airports announce simpler arrangements, you should consider what you may need if you have to fly to them, as it is very likely that you'll be in a queue for several hours. Make sure you have food, water and essentials for kids like nappies to hand.\" The prospect of lengthy queues has left many British tourists to Spain feeling frustrated and concerned. \"I'm not sure what to expect, but I've heard horror stories about airport delays,\" said Sarah Johnson, a 35-year-old mother of two who is planning a family holiday to Benidorm in August. \"I've packed some snacks and water, just in case, but I'm not sure if it will be enough to get us through the wait.\"\n\nOther travelers are considering alternative airports or routes to avoid the potential chaos. \"We were going to fly into Alicante, but now we're thinking of flying into Valencia instead,\" said James Wilson, a 28-year-old student who is planning a trip to the Costa Blanca with friends. \"We've heard that Valencia airport is less busy, so we might have a better chance of avoiding the queues.\"\n\nThe Spanish government has yet to comment on the situation, but travel experts are urging British tourists to plan ahead and prepare for the worst. \"It's always a good idea to check with your airline and airport before traveling, but in this case, it's especially important to be prepared for potential delays,\" said Tom Jenkins, a travel agent based in the UK. \"Pack snacks, bring entertainment for kids, and consider downloading travel apps to help navigate any unexpected delays.\"",

        "Text": "Hammerson, which owns shopping centres including Birmingham's Bullring and London's Brent Cross, is in talks to sell off more than £900m of property after being hit by the crisis in Britain's retail sector. The FTSE 250-listed firm said it was in active discussions to offload more than £900m of assets, far exceeding its £500m target for 2019. Last year it sold off £570m of property, with the average price 7% below the book value in December 2017. Hammerson is under pressure from an activist investor, the US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, which owns a 5% stake in the company, to speed up disposals, after a 9.3% decline in its property values in 2018. Among Hammerson's tenants are Patisserie Valerie, which went into administration last month but was saved from closure by a management buyout backed by an Irish private equity firm, as well as House of Fraser and New Look. The latter two resorted to company voluntary arrangement to avoid insolvency, which forced the firms to close a string of stores and seek rent cuts from their landlords. David Atkins, the Hammerson chief executive, said: \"2018 was a tough year particularly in the UK. Tenant failures, the structural shift in retail and a more considered consumer created a difficult operating environment, putting pressure on property values. Outside of the UK our destinations performed better with a strong contribution from premium outlets.\" Hammerson's annual adjusted profit fell by 2.4% to £240.3m in a year that saw it abandon a planned £3.4bn buyout of smaller rival Intu, the company behind the Trafford Centre in Manchester. The company's shares have been under pressure in recent months, and analysts have been warning of a potential rights issue to shore up its finances. Hammerson's talks to sell off more assets come as the UK retail sector continues to struggle, with many high-street names facing financial difficulties. The company's property portfolio includes several major shopping centers, including the iconic Bullring in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London. While Hammerson's premium outlets, which offer a mix of high-end and affordable brands, have performed relatively well, its traditional shopping centers have been hit hard by the decline of traditional retail. The company is also facing pressure from its tenants, who are seeking rent reductions and other concessions in the face of declining sales. Hammerson's annual report highlighted the challenges facing the retail sector, noting that \"many of our tenants are experiencing significant trading difficulties.\" The company's chief executive, David Atkins, acknowledged that the retail landscape is undergoing a significant shift, but said that Hammerson is well-positioned to adapt to the changing market. \"We are focused on delivering a sustainable and resilient business, and we are confident that our diversified portfolio and strong balance sheet will enable us to navigate these challenges,\" he said. The company's investors will be closely watching the outcome of its asset sales, which could have significant implications for the company's financial health and its ability to weather the ongoing retail downturn.",

I'm sure you can guess the answer. \"Joe\", the owner of Joe's Music, a 15-year-old small musical instrument and accessory shop that also provides lessons in Willoughby, Ohio, made the declaration in a recent Facebook post. \"Dear Trump sympathizers,\" he wrote. \"I am truly sorry, however I feel unclean and dirty accepting money from you. Please, politely shop somewhere else. Sorry, I would rather starve and close the store than participate in wrongdoing.\" He also posted a sign on his shop's front door with a similar message, basically telling the president's supporters to stay away. Uh-oh. Not surprisingly, the reaction – particularly via phone calls and on popular social media sites such as Facebook and Yelp – has been overwhelming. He has received support … and he has received death threats. The police now have to keep an eye on his store. Which was not what he expected. Rattled by all the attention, Joe ultimately backed away from his comments, took down the sign, deleted the Facebook post and issued an apology, saying that he was \"truly sorry to the Trump supporters\" that he hurt and that he \"made the mistake of being insensitive\" to their feelings, according to a report from the News Herald, a local paper. But the damage was done. The news became viral. And another small business owner who stepped into the political debate quickly realized that he was way out of his depth. That's what happens to neophytes who don't realize just how toxic the political environment in this country is. This is a game for a certain kind of person with a certain kind of personality and not the \"soft-spoken\" and \"principled\" owner of a small music shop in Ohio, as he was described in a local television report. The controversy surrounding Joe's Music has sparked a heated debate about the role of politics in small business ownership. While some have praised Joe's stance as a bold statement against the polarizing president, others have criticized him for alienating a significant portion of his potential customer base. \"It's a recipe for disaster,\" said local business owner, Sarah Johnson. \"You can't dictate who you serve based on their political beliefs. That's not how business works.\"\n\nOthers have argued that Joe has a right to express his opinions and make his own decisions about who he chooses to serve. \"If you don't want to do business with Trump supporters, that's your prerogative,\" said Mark Davis, a customer who stopped by Joe's Music to show his support for the owner. \"But you have to be prepared for the backlash.\"\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the impact of social media on small businesses. Joe's Facebook post and subsequent apology were widely shared, and many have speculated that the negative attention may have already hurt his business. \"In today's digital age, one misstep can have far-reaching consequences,\" said local business consultant, Emily Thompson. \"Small business owners need to be careful about what they post online and how they handle controversy.\"\n\nAs the debate continues to unfold, Joe's Music remains closed, with no clear indication of when it will reopen. The owner has been tight-lipped about his plans, but sources close to the business suggest that he is re-evaluating his strategy and exploring ways to mitigate the damage. One thing is certain, however: the controversy has put Joe's Music on the map, and the small business owner is now a household name.",

One half expects to see a non-ironic mutton-chop or a waxed moustache in the queue at Morrisons, or Arthur Conan Doyle (awfully keen on Cromer) filling up his Prius at the petrol station. By the late 19th century, Cromer and its neighbours Overstrand and East Runton were hot, hot, hot, baby. Overstrand was called \"village of millionaires\", and the landscape hereabouts is to this day dotted with large piles done out in the style of the day – (pleasantly) watered-down arts and crafts. Last time I came, maybe a decade ago, the place was, shall we say, a little faded from its heyday. It's certainly got the Pledge out since. The municipal gardens sparkle. The streets busy themselves with independent shops. It's not without a bit of shabbiness, but all that was once great about Cromer remains: the crabs (obvs); the tower of St Peter and St Paul; the boarding houses clinging to the cliffs; those sweet lanes of fishermen's houses; and the fin-de-siècle pier, oh, the pier, the most end-of-the-pier pier in the country, at the extremity of Norfolk, with nothing but fishing boats, nor'easterlies and herring between the stage of its Pavilion theatre and Norway.

It was announced on Thursday that the Saatchi Gallery in London will be the only UK venue for a world tour of 150 original artefacts from Tutankhamun's tomb, 60 of which have never left Egypt before. The tour marks the upcoming centenary of the sensational discovery of the boy pharaoh's tomb by British explorer Howard Carter in 1922. Once the tour is complete, the treasures will be permanently displayed at the vast new Grand Egyptian Museum near the pyramids of Giza. \"Please see them,\" said Mostafa Waziry, the secretary general of the Egyptian ministry of state for antiquities. \"Visit them before they return to Egypt for ever.\" The objects will include a gold inlaid miniature coffin which contained the king's liver after it was removed during the mummification process, a gilded wooden bed with carved lion feet probably made specially for Tutankhamun's funeral and a gilded wooden shrine showing intimate scenes of royal domestic harmony. One of two life-sized guardian statues of the king, which flanked the sealed entrance to his burial chamber, will also be among the artefacts leaving Cairo for the first time. Tutankhamun's famous golden death mask is not part of the show. The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb is considered one of the most pivotal archaeological discoveries of all time. Describing the experience of his eyes adjusting to the darkness, Carter would later write: \"Details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues and gold – everywhere the glint of gold … I was struck dumb with amazement.\" When some of these treasures left Cairo for a 1972 exhibition at the British Museum, a record 1.6 million people visited, forming nightmarish queues. Treasures from the tomb were last in London in 2007 at what is now the O2. Organisers are expecting a similar turnout this time around, with tickets for the exhibition already selling out fast. The Saatchi Gallery has implemented a special ticketing system to manage the crowds, with visitors able to book a specific time slot to view the treasures. The exhibition is expected to be a major draw for tourists and locals alike, with many people eager to see the treasures up close after years of admiring them in books and documentaries.\n\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a range of interactive displays and educational activities, allowing visitors to learn more about the history and significance of the treasures. There will also be a special focus on the mummification process and the life of Tutankhamun, with interactive displays and artifacts on display.\n\nThe exhibition is set to run from June 1st to October 31st, with the treasures then returning to Egypt to be permanently displayed at the Grand Egyptian Museum. Visitors are being encouraged to book their tickets early to avoid disappointment, with the exhibition expected to be a major highlight of the summer season in London.",

Epic Games confirmed it had withdrawn its adverts from the Google-owned site, joining Nestlé in temporarily abandoning it due to the latest scandal over inappropriate content. A YouTube user called Matt Watson had posted a video highlighting a \"wormhole into a softcore paedophile ring\" on the site. He showed how in a matter of clicks with a new YouTube account, users could find videos filled with provocative comments about children. \"Paedophiles are trading social media contacts; they're trading links to actual child porn in YouTube comments; they're trading unlisted videos in secret, and YouTube's algorithm through some glitch in its programming is facilitating their ability to do this,\" he said in the video. The scandal poses a challenge for YouTube because the videos themselves are not necessarily problematic. They are mostly innocent videos of young girls playing, doing exercises in their family home, or taking part in gymnastics. The issue is in the comments section, where YouTube users have left sexually provocative messages and shared tips on when to pause the videos to take compromising still images of the children. After watching a few such videos on a new YouTube account, Watson described how the site's algorithm – designed to provide users with content they might like, to keep them watching – would serve up endless videos of apparently underage children where the comments section contained inappropriate comments. Many of these videos were also accompanied by adverts placed by major brands such as Nestlé, Fortnite and Disney. In a sign of the complicated media ecosystem that now exists on YouTube, where individual video creators can earn a share of the site's advertising revenue, the reaction to the story from the wider YouTube community has not been entirely positive. Many other prominent YouTubers have accused Watson of overreacting. Some have criticised him for going public with his claims that paedophiles were using the site's comments section. These YouTubers accuse Watson of trying to drive away advertisers from the site, depriving them of their often substantial incomes and attempting to cause an \"adpocalypse\". This is a reference to previous occasions when large advertisers pulled money from the site over concerns about YouTube's ability to ensure their adverts did not appear alongside disturbing or inappropriate content, such as videos published by terrorist organisations or hate preachers.

This week, the ding-dong in the Superdry boardroom that has seen co-founder Julian Dunkerton go to war with management will move into its final round – and it promises to be a closely matched fight. With the bravado of a prizefighter during a weigh-in, on Friday Dunkerton declared \"I'm confident we'll win\", before a shareholder vote on Tuesday that will determine whether he can rejoin the company he quit last year, as he becomes increasingly unhappy with the direction Superdry is going in under new boss Euan Sutherland. The multimillionaire was pumped up after a late boost to his hard-fought campaign to be reinstated following a collapse in sales and profits. Two of the company's key shareholders – Investec and Schroders, which together control around 10% of Superdry – appear to be in his corner. Their slug of shares would add to the 28% holding controlled by Dunkerton and designer James Holder, with whom he started the fashion label in 2003. Holder is also eager to return to designing clothes for the brand that once provided off-duty wardrobes for the likes of David Beckham and Zac Efron but more recently has gone off the boil, and been forced to offer big discounts. But does Dunkerton really have the fight in the bag? To succeed, the driven entrepreneur – who is also seeking to install Peter Williams, a former boss of Selfridges, as a non-executive director to work alongside him – needs a simple majority of votes cast on the day. \"It could go either way,\" one person close to the action told the Observer. On Friday afternoon Shroders ratcheted up the pre-fight tension by refusing to commit itself either way. \"We continue to engage with both sides: the meeting is not until Tuesday and our voting instruction will be in the best interests of our clients and the company going forward,\" said its head of corporate governance, Daniel Veazey. Superdry, meanwhile, has publicly received the backing of Aberdeen Standard Investments, which has around 10%, and proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Pirc, whose views guide passive investment funds. As the shareholder vote approaches, the tension is palpable. Dunkerton's camp is confident that they have the numbers to win, but Superdry's management is not going down without a fight. Sutherland, the company's CEO, has been working tirelessly to win over wavering shareholders and convince them that his vision for the brand's future is the right one.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, one thing is clear: the outcome of this vote will have significant implications for the future of Superdry. If Dunkerton and Holder succeed in their bid to rejoin the company, it could signal a major shift in the brand's direction. The two co-founders have a deep understanding of the brand's history and its loyal customer base, and many believe that they are better equipped to turn things around than Sutherland.\n\nOn the other hand, if Dunkerton and Holder fail to win over the necessary votes, it could be the end of their involvement with the company. Sutherland has made it clear that he is committed to his vision for Superdry, and if the co-founders are not on board, he may be forced to take drastic action to refocus the brand.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to Tuesday's vote, both sides are pulling out all the stops to win over the remaining undecided shareholders. The stakes are high, and the outcome is far from certain. One thing is clear, however: the future of Superdry hangs in the balance, and only time will tell what the outcome of this high-stakes battle will be.",

P doesn't measure reliability, for a start. Neither does it measure how unlikely the observed result would be. What would be expected, by chance alone, will always vary, each time an experiment is done. This is especially so if the experimental numbers are small, so that samples are less representative of their source. What the p value does express is the possibility that the experimental result, or results more extreme, would be observed if (and this is crucial) the experiment had no effect at all. This null hypothesis, not mentioned in the editorial, is a central element. The test does not examine possibilities if an effect is present, although it's naturally used when one is suspected. As your editorial explains, it's only slowly that all of us, scientists included, are starting to grasp this logic, although there have been little-heeded articles in the scientific literature making this point for over 30 years. Gordon Drummond Edinburgh • Richard Wilkinson (Letters, 22 March) raises a concern over unemployment statistics, but I wonder if there is a different, more pressing issue? He refers back to the years after 1979 in which there were 30 changes to the administrative definition of unemployment. These largely acted to reduce the \"claimant count\" numbers and so make comparisons of these numbers over time more difficult to understand. However, the statistics published last week are consistent over the 44-year period covered. They are obtained from the Labour Force Survey, using an internationally agreed definition of unemployment. They should be unaffected by changes in the benefits system relating to unemployment. Here is the continued text:\n\nThis consistency is reassuring, but it's also worth noting that the statistics are not without their limitations. For example, the survey only captures the experiences of those who are actively seeking work, which may not reflect the full extent of unemployment. Additionally, the definition of unemployment has evolved over time, with the rise of non-traditional work arrangements and the gig economy. These changes can make it challenging to accurately capture the scope of unemployment.\n\nDespite these limitations, the Labour Force Survey remains a crucial tool for understanding the state of the UK's labour market. By providing a consistent and internationally comparable measure of unemployment, it allows policymakers to track trends and make informed decisions. As the UK continues to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing economy, accurate and reliable data will be essential for guiding policy and supporting those affected by unemployment.",

The problem first emerged in January and, until now, Tesco has claimed to be working on a fix. But it has just announced via Twitter that \"Hudl 1 and the first edition Hudl 2 have reached the end of life. This means the update that has been put in place will not fix the issue you're seeing, we're afraid.\" This is a potential disaster, and yet Tesco has said almost nothing formally. Hudl tablets have been really successful, and there is still a buoyant second-hand market as they are easy to use, fast and powerful. For Tesco to kill off the majority in a single blow, without any warning, is not right. Surely it should have made a public announcement before pulling the plug or advising Hudl 2 owners that, if they want to keep their tablets running, they must update to the Android 5.1 Lollipop version before a certain date. ALC, by email This could affect a lot of users – the £119 tablet was a big seller between 2013 and 2015, as customers were offered a decent, cheaper alternative to the iPad. Your tablet will continue to work as normal as long as you do nothing – so don't try to restore it to factory settings or update its operating system. Given that there could be as many as 500,000 still in use, it is surprising that Tesco had not formally said anything about this issue that has caused considerable anger among users. However, Tesco tells us that it has not switched off the Hudl servers. Newer versions of Hudl 2 devices can be fixed, and it is working on a solution for older models. \"We're aware of a technical issue affecting a number of Hudl users and apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused. As the news of the withdrawal of software support spreads, Hudl users are left feeling frustrated and betrayed by Tesco's lack of transparency. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and anger, with some even calling for a boycott of the retailer. The situation is particularly concerning for those who have relied on their Hudl tablets for essential tasks, such as staying in touch with loved ones or accessing important information. With the tablets now effectively useless, users are left to wonder what they will do next. Tesco's decision to withdraw support for the Hudl tablets has raised questions about the company's commitment to its customers and the value of its products. As the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Tesco will respond to the backlash and whether the company will take steps to rectify the situation.",

As well as research into the peasantry, he produced interesting work on the role of Russian émigrés in Britain during the final half-century of Tsarist rule. Born in Richmond, south-west London, John was adopted by Henrietta (nee Grundy) and Albert Slatter, a wine taster. He went to Latymer Upper school, Hammersmith, then read Russian and French at Jesus College, Cambridge (1963-66). At Cambridge, we became close friends from the start. In the summer of 1964 we travelled to Moscow to attend a language course. At Victoria train station, London, en route, I introduced him to an acquaintance, Irene Gottlieb, a student of Russian at the University of London. They were married on 30 July 1966, the day England won the World Cup. After graduation John joined the Centre for Russian and East European Studies, University of Birmingham, completing a social sciences master's degree, and a PhD on the peasantry and the rural Soviets in the early years of Soviet power, supervised by Moshe Lewin. Meanwhile, in 1968, he was appointed a lecturer in Russian history and language at the University of Durham, where he spent the rest of his academic career, and where Irene became a Russian language teacher. John was very fit as a student, but in his 40s he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. As his health deteriorated, he kept up with Russian culture and current affairs by watching Russian films and satellite television; with worsening eyesight he listened to Russian documentaries and plays, as well as his beloved music. A deeply cultured man, he had an interest in music that ranged from classical to jazz and beyond. It was he who first acquainted me both with the music of Charles Aznavour and with Mozart's sublime G minor Piano Quartet. After retirement in 2003, he and Irene continued to holiday in Antibes, in the south of France, each summer until very recently. John's love of music and Russian culture remained a constant source of joy throughout his life. He was a prolific letter writer and maintained a vast network of friends and acquaintances, many of whom he kept in touch with through his letters. Despite his declining health, John's mind remained sharp and he continued to read widely, devouring books on Russian history, literature, and politics. He was a loyal supporter of the University of Durham's Russian department and attended many of its events, including lectures and conferences. John's passing leaves a void in the lives of those who knew him, but his legacy as a scholar, a friend, and a cultured individual will be remembered for years to come.",

        "Text": "Financial markets around the world have dropped sharply amid mounting fears of a slowdown in the global economy, after eurozone factory output fell at the fastest rate in almost six years. Friday's losses on stock exchanges across Europe and on Wall Street came after figures suggested economic growth across the European single currency bloc remained weak in the first quarter of 2019, dashing hopes of a rebound from a weak end to last year. Economists said the poor readings of industrial output probably reflected a slowdown in China and the world economy, raising the prospect that growth for the rest of 2019 would be weaker than expected. New York slumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped by 2% and markets across Europe also recorded steep losses. The IHS Markit flash purchasing managers' index for factory output in the euro area, which is used to identify early warning signs of economic stress, showed that output in March contracted the most since December 2012 – a period when the eurozone was gripped by the sovereign debt crisis. Analysts said disruption to businesses from Brexit was having an impact, but that faltering demand for exports amid the US-China trade dispute was having a more damaging effect. Germany's manufacturing sector, which has become increasingly geared towards selling goods to China over recent years, recorded the steepest decline in output for seven years. New factory orders deteriorated to the greatest extent since the financial crisis. Much of the problems for German industry are linked to China's slowing economy, after Donald Trump imposed import tariffs on Chinese goods in a bitter trade standoff with Beijing. Chinese car sales fell for the first time in almost 30 years last year, in a blow to several German car manufacturers, which count on China as their biggest export market. Germany only narrowly managed to avoid recession last year. The decline in factory output was not limited to Germany, with France, Italy, and Spain also reporting significant contractions. The eurozone's largest economy, Germany, saw its manufacturing sector shrink at its fastest pace since 2012, while France's factory output contracted at its fastest rate since 2015. Italy's manufacturing sector also suffered, with new orders and production falling sharply. The downturn in the eurozone's factory output is a major concern for policymakers, as it could lead to a broader slowdown in economic growth and potentially even a recession. The European Central Bank has already cut interest rates twice this year to try to stimulate the economy, but some economists are calling for further action to support growth. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China are also expected to continue to weigh on the global economy, making it difficult for the eurozone to recover from its current slowdown.",

Maciej Szpunar, one of the ECJ's advocates general, found that Airbnb was what Brussels would describe as an information society service, a status that comes with the right to operate freely across the EU. Szpunar rejected the claims of a French tourism association that the company should face the same accounting, insurance and financial obligations as traditional providers of real estate. Airbnb, which is registered in Ireland, argues that its commercial activities in matching property owners with people seeking accommodation could not be regarded as real estate brokerage. Szpunar said on Tuesday that the French government had not properly notified the European commission and the authorities in Ireland of its intention to apply French law to the company. He said Airbnb was an online service that connected potential guests with hosts who offered short-term accommodation. It is unclear what the opinion would have been had the French authorities made the required notification. The opinion is non-binding, although the court takes the advice of its advocates general in 80% of cases. Airbnb said it welcomed the opinion as it provided a \"a clear overview of what rules apply\". The decision is a significant victory for Airbnb, which has been fighting to avoid being regulated as a traditional real estate company. The company has been accused of evading taxes and exploiting workers, but it has maintained that its platform is simply a digital marketplace that connects hosts with guests. The advocate general's opinion could have implications for other digital service providers, such as Uber and Deliveroo, which are also fighting to avoid being regulated as traditional companies.\n\nAirbnb's opponents, including the French tourism association, are likely to appeal the decision. The association has argued that the company's activities are equivalent to those of traditional real estate companies and that it should be subject to the same regulations and taxes. However, the advocate general's opinion suggests that the company's activities are fundamentally different and that it should be treated as a digital service provider.\n\nThe decision is also likely to have implications for the Irish government, which has been criticized for its failure to properly regulate Airbnb's activities. The company is registered in Ireland, but it has been accused of exploiting loopholes in the country's tax laws to avoid paying its fair share of taxes. The advocate general's opinion could put pressure on the Irish government to take action to ensure that the company is properly regulated and taxed.\n\nOverall, the decision is a significant victory for Airbnb and could have far-reaching implications for the digital economy. It highlights the challenges that companies like Airbnb face in navigating the complex regulatory landscape of the EU and the importance of clarifying the rules that apply to digital service providers.",

Do you grasp gingerly, to let them know they are the boss? Or do you do something else – indicate you are a Mason, perhaps, at this early stage? What about a different secret handshake – the Dele Alli and Harry Kane routine? Or the full-on Trump, never letting go? Schools are letting down young people by not teaching them the basics of interviews, including how to shake hands, according to Nilesh Dosa, a youth mentor at the accountancy firm Ernst & Young. \"We're churning out academically able students who just aren't equipped for work,\" he said. Jo Bryant agrees. She is an etiquette consultant who has written loads of books about the subject and worked at Debrett's, the arbiters of British etiquette. \"You can have all the qualifications in the world, but if you go in with poor body language, poor eye contact and a poor handshake you won't get the job,\" she says. \"The way you conduct yourself is as much of it as how qualified you are. Your interviewer has to like you and want to be around you.\" So, what is the correct way to shake a hand? \"Eye contact, be firm, palm to palm, actually clasp the other person's hand. No bone-crushing, though: you don't want to be remembered as a bone-crusher.\" Don't be too limp, either: this sends a message of underconfidence. \"It's not very nice shaking a limp hand; it feels like an empty gesture,\" Bryant says. According to Bryant, the ideal handshake is one that is firm, yet not too aggressive. She recommends making eye contact with the interviewer, then extending your hand with a gentle but confident motion. The palm of your hand should face the palm of the interviewer's hand, and you should clasp their hand firmly but not too tightly. The handshake should last for about two seconds, long enough to convey respect and interest, but not so long that it becomes awkward.\n\nDosa and Bryant both agree that a good handshake is just one part of a larger package of skills that employers are looking for in young job applicants. They argue that schools and educators should be teaching students the basics of professional etiquette, including how to dress, how to make small talk, and how to conduct themselves in a job interview.\n\n\"We're not just producing students who are book-smart, we're producing students who are also people-smart,\" says Dosa. \"We need to be teaching them the skills they need to succeed in the workplace, and that includes how to shake hands, how to make a good impression, and how to build relationships with colleagues and clients.\"\n\nBryant adds that good etiquette is not just about following rules, but also about showing respect and consideration for others. \"When you shake someone's hand, you're making a statement about who you are and what you're about,\" she says. \"You're saying, 'I respect you, I value you, and I'm interested in working with you.'\" By teaching students the basics of etiquette, educators can help them build stronger relationships, communicate more effectively, and ultimately achieve greater success in their careers.",

The chief executive officer of Nine, Hugh Marks, said the sale of its Australian Community Media & Printing business, which includes the Newcastle Herald, the Land and Queensland Country Life, would be complete by the end of June. The group of newspapers has been bought by a company controlled by interests associated with Catalano and Thorney Investment Group, and some commercial arrangements including printing and advertising will remain in place. Some of Nine's metropolitan mastheads such as the Sydney Morning Herald are printed by ACM in regional areas and that arrangement will continue. \"The sale of ACM is aligned with our strategy to exit non-core businesses and to focus on Nine's portfolio of high-growth, digital assets,\" Marks said. \"We will retain a commercial relationship with ACM and look forward to continuing to work with the business in areas where there are mutual benefits to both Nine and ACM.\" Only six months ago Catalano, who used to run Fairfax's successful real estate platform Domain, failed in a bid to block the sale of Fairfax to Nine by buying up to 19.9% of Fairfax. The deal includes $10m worth of advertising for Nine in ACM properties over the next three years. The ACM group of newspapers was once owned by Rural Press but was sold to the former Fairfax Media in 2007 in a $3bn deal which included 200 publications in Australia and New Zealand, 23 publications in the USA and 11 radio stations. Marks flagged selling off the community papers soon after the merger with Fairfax last year. Nine is still in the market to sell the two other former Fairfax properties it no longer wants – Stuff and Events. Marks told staff that Catalano and the Thorney Investment Group saw the \"future potential\" of the newspapers, which no longer fitted into Nine's national advertising strategy. \"They are well positioned to realise that future in a way that Nine as a public company would have limitations of doing,\" Marks said. \"I believe the change of ownership is positive and sets the business well on the path for the future.\" The sale of ACM is expected to result in significant cost savings for Nine, which will no longer be responsible for the operational and administrative burdens of the regional papers. The company will also retain a commercial relationship with ACM, which will continue to print some of Nine's metropolitan mastheads, such as the Sydney Morning Herald, in regional areas. In addition, ACM has agreed to provide $10 million worth of advertising for Nine in its properties over the next three years.\n\nCatalano, who was a key figure in Fairfax's real estate platform Domain, said he was excited about the opportunity to acquire the ACM group of newspapers. \"We believe in the future potential of these newspapers and are committed to investing in their growth and development,\" he said. \"We look forward to working with the staff and communities served by these papers to build on their success.\"\n\nThe sale of ACM is the latest in a series of divestments by Nine since its merger with Fairfax last year. The company has been focusing on its digital assets and has sold off several of its print titles, including the Domain real estate platform. The sale of ACM is expected to be completed by the end of June, pending regulatory approval.",

You mean \"unidentified flying objects\"? From now on, please call them unexplained aerial phenomena, or I'll be forced to probe you. OK. But I thought we dealt with all this in the 1990s? Mulder and Scully proved that aliens were here. Then further evidence came to light that proved they were, in fact, fictional characters in a TV series. That is the official version, if you want to believe it. Sounds good to me. But how do you explain the fact that people are still saying they have been abducted by aliens? People being wrong. If only it were that simple. It is. Are you sure you are qualified to say so? Dr Young-hae Chi, a lecturer at Oxford University, takes the alien abduction theory very seriously. Is he a psychologist? A materials scientist? Not exactly. He teaches Korean at the faculty of oriental studies. Oh. But in 2012, he delivered a lecture at a conference organised by Ammach, a support group for abductees. In this lecture, he disputed the idea put forward by the ufologist Dr David Jacobs that visiting aliens have a sinister plan to take over the world. Dr. Chi's lecture sparked a heated debate among the attendees, with some abductees sharing their personal experiences of being taken on board alien spacecraft. One attendee, a woman who claimed to have been abducted multiple times, described the feeling of being probed and experimented on as \"a sensation unlike anything I've ever experienced on this earth.\"\n\nDr. Chi's theory, which he presented as a possible explanation for the abductions, suggested that the aliens were not interested in taking over the world, but rather were conducting a form of intergalactic research. According to Dr. Chi, the aliens were studying human behavior, specifically the human brain, in order to better understand the workings of the universe.\n\nThe idea may seem far-fetched to some, but for many abductees, it offered a sense of relief and validation. For years, they had been ridiculed and ostracized by society for their claims of alien encounters. But with Dr. Chi's theory, they felt that their experiences were finally being taken seriously.\n\nThe debate over alien abductions has been ongoing for decades, with some experts dismissing the claims as mere fantasy, while others, like Dr. Chi, take a more open-minded approach. As the US Navy prepares to release its new guidelines for reporting unexplained aerial phenomena, it's clear that the phenomenon is still very much on the radar of the scientific community. And for those who claim to have been abducted, the possibility of finally having their experiences acknowledged and studied is a tantalizing prospect.",

Lebedev and his father, Alexander, won the hotly contested battle for the licence for the capital's first dedicated TV channel six years ago, the crown jewel of the government's plan to launch dozens of local TV channels across the UK. At the time it was seen as the most lucrative TV licence to be awarded since Channel 5 in 1997. A star-studded launch party in 2014 counted David Cameron, former chancellor turned Standard editor George Osborne, Elizabeth Hurley, Hugh Grant, Naomi Campbell, Ralph Fiennes, Tracey Emin and Anna Friel among the attendees. The plan was for the Evening Standard-backed TV station to help drive profitability across the Lebedevs' media portfolio but in reality it has proved a financial blackhole. London Live, which it was hoped would break even in 2017, has never made a profit – running up losses of £30m to date, according to filings at Companies House. It is understood that Lebedev is in talks with That's Media, which owns licences to 20 local TV stations, including Manchester, Cambridge and Oxford, about potentially selling London Live. That's Media has sought to build a network by taking on struggling local TV franchises, including five from the Scottish broadcaster STV last year – with Edinburgh and Glasgow among them – and Norwich's Mustard TV, from the newspaper publisher Archant in 2017. Lebedev has also previously held talks with David Montgomery, the former chief executive of the publisher of the Daily and Sunday Mirror, who is now a director at the local TV franchise operator Made Television. The value of the loss-making London Live to an existing local TV operator is unclear. The potential sale of London Live has raised questions about the viability of the government's original plan to launch a network of local TV channels across the UK. When the licence was awarded, it was seen as a key part of the government's strategy to increase local media coverage and provide a platform for local voices to be heard. However, the failure of London Live to turn a profit has raised concerns about the sustainability of the model.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that the issue is not just limited to London Live, but is a broader problem affecting many of the local TV stations launched in recent years. \"The business model for local TV just doesn't seem to be working,\" said one media executive. \"The cost of launching and maintaining a TV station is incredibly high, and it's difficult to generate enough revenue to make it viable.\"\n\nThe potential sale of London Live is also likely to spark concerns about the concentration of media ownership in the UK. The Lebedev family already owns the Evening Standard and the Independent, and the sale of London Live would give them a significant stake in the local TV market. \"This is a worrying development,\" said a media watchdog. \"We need to ensure that there is a diverse range of media voices in the UK, and that no single individual or company has too much control.\"",

        "Text": "Tongues can smell Researchers in Philadelphia revealed last week that tastebuds also bear odour-detecting proteins, calling into question the idea that smell and taste come together in the brain to produce flavour. According to Dr Mehmet Hakan Ozdener, his findings open up the possibility of using smells to trick us into healthier eating, for example by adding a low-concentration odour to food to make it taste sweeter and thereby reduce sugar intake. Blinded by the lights It is believed that we all experience a form of motion-induced blindness while driving at night, when the red lights of the cars in front temporarily disappear if we move our eyes to the oncoming traffic. This phenomenon, where the brain ignores or discards visual information when it is placed in front of a moving background, was first observed in the lab in 1965. Sight and sound First described in 1976, the McGurk effect is a connection between hearing and vision in speech perception. When the auditory component of a syllable is paired with the visual component of another, this can lead to the perception of a third sound. A taste for cutlery Research conducted by the University of Oxford in 2013 suggests that the sight of cutlery and the perception of its size, weight, shape and colour have an effect on how we determine flavour, suggesting that the brain makes judgments on food even before it goes in our mouths. The study's findings have sparked a new wave of interest in the psychology of eating and the ways in which our senses interact to shape our culinary experiences. \"It's a game-changer,\" said Dr. Ozdener. \"We've long known that the senses are interconnected, but this research shows just how powerful the influence of smell can be on our perception of taste.\" The team is now working to develop new techniques for harnessing the power of smell to promote healthier eating habits, including the creation of novel food packaging designs that incorporate subtle scent cues to encourage consumers to make more nutritious choices. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Oxford are exploring the implications of their cutlery study, with plans to investigate how the sight of different table settings and dining environments might influence our eating experiences. As the boundaries between our senses continue to blur, it's clear that the art of eating is about to get a whole lot more interesting.",

        "Text": "Adani does not hold water permits with sufficient capacity to supply the initial construction phase of the Carmichael coal project, based on its own modelling of water consumption. The company has repeatedly stated it is \"ready to start\" building the mine and has publicly sought to blame the Queensland government for delays in approving necessary management plans. But environmental groups say a shortfall in the capacity of the company's water permits is evidence the company's readiness claims are \"bogus\" and designed to heap political pressure on decision-makers. Publicly available Queensland government information shows Adani holds two short-term water permits, for Mistake Creek and the Belyando River, which expire in April and June this year. Those permits allow the company to take a combined 1775 megalitres of water. Documents released under freedom of information laws show Adani's own modelling, completed by consultant CDM Smith, estimates the Carmichael mine will require 3358ML during the first year of construction. Carmel Flint, from the environmental group Lock the Gate, said the new information suggested Adani \"does not have the water permits it needs to construct the mine, which is more evidence Adani's claims that it is ready to start work are bogus\". \"It's clear Adani has created a fake urgency for approvals in the lead-up to the election, and the company got exactly what it wanted: a rushed approval from Scott Morrison's government which was tainted by political interference,\" Flint said. In a statement, Adani said it had the necessary water permits required \"for mining operations\" but did not specifically address the project's construction phase. \"It is standard for major projects to regularly update their required permits and licences for on-site and off-site construction and operational activities, and in this process Adani Mining expects to be treated like any other Queensland mining company.\" Adani said there were additional potential water sources for the mine site, including groundwater, rain water and recycled water. The former Queensland government general manager of water allocation and planning, Tom Crothers, said the water Adani could access without additional permits would be \"no more than a puddle\" and \"nowhere near enough\" to make up the shortfall. Adani's claims it is ready to begin construction of the Carmichael coalmine have made the project a prominent issue on the federal election campaign trail. The revelation has sparked renewed concerns about the project's environmental and social impacts, as well as the government's handling of the approval process. \"This is a clear example of Adani's lack of transparency and accountability,\" said another environmental group, the Australian Conservation Foundation. \"The Queensland government must take immediate action to ensure Adani has the necessary permits and plans in place before allowing construction to begin.\" The opposition has also weighed in, with Labor's resources spokesperson, Mark Butler, calling for a review of the project's approvals. \"The public has been misled by Adani's claims of being ready to start construction, and it's clear that the government has been rushed into making a decision,\" Butler said. As the controversy continues to unfold, local communities and environmental groups are calling for a more rigorous and transparent approval process, as well as greater scrutiny of Adani's claims and promises. Meanwhile, Adani remains committed to pushing forward with the project, despite the growing backlash.",

        "Text": "PepsiCo has faced a backlash after suing four Indian farmers who allegedly grew a patented strain of potatoes used in its Lay's crisps without the company's permission. The company, which originally sought about $150,000 (£116,000) in damages from each of the farmers, arguing they broke the law by sourcing and dealing the potatoes, offered to settle \"amicably\" when the case went to court in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Friday. The case sparked outrage from farmers and others concerned that PepsiCo was using its clout to interfere with the country's food supply. The role of foreign companies in producing and selling food in India is a hotly contested issue, particularly when concerning genetically modified (GM) crops. \"It's a question of India's seed sovereignty, food sovereignty and country sovereignty,\" said Kapil Shah, an activist who is defending the farmers. \"It's spreading panic among the farmers.\" A number of farmers' groups in India have banded together to protest against the court action. Ambubhai Patel, the vice-president of a farmers' association, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said they were lobbying the government to back the accused farmers' favour and punish the \"harassment\" of other farmers. Patel's group is linked to the prime minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which has increased its scrutiny of foreign companies in the run-up to national elections ending in late May. \"Potato-growing farmers have nothing to worry [about] and we can't allow such intimidation,\" Patel told local media. \"We will fight against it in court as well as on the streets if needed.\" PepsiCo said the farmers who grew its strain of potatoes without permission were hurting the interests of the many people working with the company to produce them for its Lay's crisps. It supplies those farmers with seeds and subsequently buys back the potatoes. The farmers' groups have vowed to continue their protests and lobbying efforts until the case is resolved in favor of the accused farmers. The issue has also gained attention from Indian politicians, with some calling for greater regulation of foreign companies operating in the country's agricultural sector. The Indian government has yet to comment on the matter, but experts say that the case could have significant implications for the country's food security and agricultural industry.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked a debate about the role of genetically modified (GM) crops in Indian agriculture. While some argue that GM crops can increase crop yields and reduce pesticide use, others are concerned about the potential risks to human health and the environment. The Indian government has been slow to approve the use of GM crops, but the country has been a major producer of GM crops such as cotton and corn.\n\nAs the case continues to unfold, farmers and activists are calling for greater transparency and accountability from foreign companies operating in India's agricultural sector. The case has also raised questions about the country's ability to protect its agricultural sector from foreign companies and the impact that this could have on food security and the livelihoods of Indian farmers.",

        "Text": "Barclays has cut bonuses for its investment bankers and traders as it posted lower first-quarter profits amid tough market conditions. The bank made a pre-tax profit of £1.5bn between January and March, down from £1.7bn a year earlier but in line with City forecasts. This excludes litigation and conduct charges. If they are included, Barclays made a £1.5bn profit against a £236m loss a year earlier, when it was hit by a £2bn charge largely related to a settlement with the US justice department over the sale of mortgage-backed securities. Barclays is under pressure from the activist investor Edward Bramson to scale back its poorly performing investment banking division and install him on the board. The results come ahead of a showdown between Bramson and Barclays' chief executive Jes Staley at the bank's annual meeting next Thursday. At the international business, which includes the investment bank, pre-tax profit fell to £1.1bn from £1.4bn, while the UK bank posted a rise in profits to £600m from £200m, with mortgage applications up quite strongly. Staley said the group had cut bankers' bonuses to reduce costs and was \"very comfortable\" with its cost targets. In the first quarter, costs amounted to £3.3bn. He said the bank took a £400m charge in 2016 to allow it to better align bonuses with the firm's revenues. \"What you see in the first quarter is Barclays using this discretion around variable compensation to manage our costs and deliver expected profitability,\" he said. Barclays said there would be further cost cuts if tough trading conditions continued. Bramson, a British lawyer based in New York, is Barclays' third-largest shareholder, with a 5.5% stake, after BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. At next week's AGM, Bramson will call on other shareholders to back his demand to be voted on to the board. While Bramson wants the investment bank – which he has described as a \"black box with too much leverage\" – to be scaled back, Staley has pledged to protect it from further cuts. The tension between Bramson and Staley is expected to dominate the annual meeting, with many investors eager to see how the standoff plays out. Barclays' shares have been under pressure in recent months, and the bank's poor performance in the investment banking division has been a major concern. Bramson has argued that the bank's focus on investment banking has led to a lack of diversification and has put the entire institution at risk. Staley, on the other hand, has defended the division, saying it is a vital part of the bank's business and will continue to play a key role in its future. The outcome of the meeting is far from certain, and it remains to be seen whether Bramson will be able to secure a seat on the board. In the meantime, Barclays will continue to face challenges in the tough market conditions, and investors will be watching closely to see how the bank responds.",

        "Text": "Damian Hinds claims \"the overwhelming majority of academies tell a positive story … we've come a long way in the past eight years\" (53,000 pupils trapped in 'zombie' academy schools, Labour says, 15 April). Try telling that to the increasing proportion of children and young people (and their families) permanently excluded from academies. Government figures show that in 2009-10, of the 5,740 children and young people permanently excluded from schools, 590 (10%) were from academies. The most recent figures (2016-17) show that not only has the total number risen to 7,720 (in itself a scandal), but also that the number of young people permanently excluded from academies has risen disproportionately, to 4,620 (60% of all who were permanently excluded in that year). A possibly related phenomenon is that, of the children and young people eligible for free school meals in 2009-10, 20% were permanently excluded; in 2016-17, 28% (3,085 in total) of those eligible for free meals were permanently excluded. Dr Simon Gibbs Reader in educational psychology, School of Education, Communication and Language Sciences, Newcastle University • The near-100 schools waiting to be \"brokered\" by the regional schools commissioners is a worrying high level. Perhaps two solutions would aid the process: first, when a school is to be rebrokered it is offered to the local authority immediately and run by it until a new trust can absorb the school. Second, there needs to be a significant rebrokerage fund to aid the absorption of zombie academies. The statistics paint a stark picture of a system in crisis. The fact that 60% of permanently excluded young people are now from academies is a damning indictment of the government's education policies. The disproportionate rise in exclusions among children eligible for free school meals is particularly concerning, as it suggests that the most vulnerable members of society are being failed by the system.\n\nThe proposal to offer rebrokered schools to local authorities immediately is a sensible one. Local authorities have a deep understanding of the needs of their communities and are better equipped to run schools that are struggling. By allowing them to take the reins, the government could potentially stem the tide of exclusions and provide a more stable and supportive environment for pupils.\n\nFurthermore, the creation of a rebrokerage fund would provide a vital lifeline to struggling schools. By providing financial support to help absorb the costs of taking on a new school, local authorities and trusts could be encouraged to take on the challenge of rebrokerage. This would not only help to stabilize the school but also provide a more sustainable solution for the long-term.\n\nIt is imperative that the government takes immediate action to address the crisis in academies. The status quo is unacceptable, and the continued rise in exclusions is a ticking time bomb for the education system. By working with local authorities and providing the necessary support, the government could turn the tide and create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all pupils. Anything less would be a dereliction of their duty to provide a world-class education for every child.",

        "Text": "Tesla has been granted a temporary restraining order to prevent an alleged harasser from approaching the carmaker's California factory. The electric carmaker claimed in its application for the order that the man had repeatedly harassed its employees. He allegedly controls a Twitter account which frequently claimsthat Tesla engages in fraud and which claims to be betting that Tesla shares will fall. The man, a resident of Fremont, California, is named in the order, granted by a court in the state. He is allegedly part of a loose online community that believes Tesla is destined for failure. In Tesla's application, it alleged that the man had driven into a security employee when trespassing on the company's factory. The application also alleged that the man had pursued a Tesla vehicle bearing manufacturer number plates, driving around the car and swerving towards it, at one point triggering a collision-avoidance feature. Under the terms of the order, first reported by the Electrek website, the man is not allowed within 100 yards of several Tesla employees or Tesla's headquarters or main factory. He must also stay 10 yards away from any Tesla vehicle with manufacturer number plates within five miles of the headquarters. Elon Musk, Tesla's billionaire founder, wrote, \"Never seen anything like it\" in response to a conversation about the alleged harasser. The activity by the supposed short seller adds another twist to the bizarre relationship between Tesla and Twitter. Musk, one of the social network's most prominent users, has faced censure from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for tweeting inaccurate market-sensitive news last year. On Friday, Musk and the SEC were granted another week to resolve a dispute over a tweet, later corrected, that Tesla would make 500,000 cars this year. The US regulator said the tweet was a violation of a previous legal settlement for allegedly misleading investors. The dispute highlights the struggles faced by the electric car maker as it tries to increase its output to mass-market scale. The pace of production slowed at the beginning of the year. Tesla intends to shrink its board, a move the company said would allow it to operate more nimbly and efficiently, it said in a regulatory filing published on Friday. The restraining order also prohibits the man from accessing or attempting to access Tesla's facilities, including its headquarters and main factory, and from communicating with Tesla employees or representatives. The order is in effect until a hearing can be held to determine whether a permanent restraining order should be issued. Tesla's lawyers argued that the man's actions posed a credible threat to the safety of its employees and the security of its facilities. The company is seeking a permanent restraining order to prevent the man from engaging in further harassing behavior. The case is just the latest example of the increasingly tense relationship between Tesla and its critics, who have been using social media to spread negative rumors and conspiracy theories about the company. Tesla has accused some of these critics of engaging in coordinated efforts to manipulate the market and drive down its stock price. The company has also faced criticism from some investors and analysts who believe it is overvalued and struggling to meet its production targets. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains one of the most popular and influential companies in the tech industry, with a market capitalization of over $100 billion.",

        "Text": "The small Queensland town of Gympie has been identified as the origin of 70% of the world's macadamia nuts. New research into the fatty seed has revealed the world's dominant commercial cultivar – grown in Hawaii – originated from a single tree in southern Queensland from the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was grown from one cultivar from Australia that was repeatedly cloned. This means the commercial macadamia tree has an incredibly low genetic diversity, and researchers hope their findings will spur the discovery of wild trees and more \"novel genes\". Genetic diversity would improve crop productivity, increase disease resistance and enable macadamia to be grown in new places, said one of the researchers, Dr Craig Hardner. By looking at genetic markers, Hardner, from the University of Queensland, and Dr Catherine Nock, from Southern Cross University, traced the origins of Hawaii's whole industry back to Queensland. The Hawaiian cultivar had distinctive gene markers in common with a tiny crop of trees in the small locality of Mooloo, near Gympie, 160km north of the state capital Brisbane. Historical records showed that seeds from these trees were taken to Honolulu in 1896. Despite being found in a narrow band of subtropical rainforest, Australia's native macadamia had a rich diversity compared with the commercial crops, Hardner said. This means there is hope for diverse genes to be discovered in Australian forests and even in backyards. \"There is a really strong geographic pattern,\" he said. \"All the diversity that exists comes from south-east Queensland and northern NSW. Certainly the Hawaiian germplasm is very narrow, so it has only come from one locality.\" The researchers found that some unique genetic markers in commercial trees could not be matched with known wild trees. Hardner said this meant either those diverse genes had been lost in the wild, through land clearing, or that they continued to exist in domestic cultivated plants. \"We suggested maybe some of that diversity that has been lost is in cultivated plants, parks, gardens or people's backyards,\" he said. The oldest known cultivated macadamia tree is in Brisbane's city botanic gardens, first planted in 1858. Hardner said the next step was to focus on forest conservation. \"There's climate change happening, there is clearing happening, and about 90% of the wild population is on private property,\" he said. The researchers are now working with local landowners and conservation groups to identify and protect the remaining wild macadamia trees in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. They hope to establish a network of protected areas and corridors to connect fragmented populations and allow for genetic exchange. The team is also developing a DNA-based identification system to help track and monitor the wild trees. With the help of local communities, they plan to collect seeds from these trees and establish a national seed bank to preserve the genetic diversity of the species. The project aims to not only conserve the native macadamia but also to promote sustainable agriculture practices and support the local economy. By unlocking the secrets of the macadamia's genetic history, the researchers hope to ensure the long-term viability of this iconic Australian nut and its industry.",

The hearing was the first since 2 May, when lawyers for the US government began pressing its case to extradite him to face trial for what they described as one the largest compromises of classified information in history. However, his solicitor Gareth Peirce told a judge at Westminster magistrates court in London on Thursday that Assange was too ill to appear by video link from prison. The date for the next hearing was confirmed as 12 June. The senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot said the next hearing may take place in Belmarsh prison in south London, where Assange is being held, if convenient for all parties. The US has requested the extradition of Assange, who was removed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 11 April. He is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years. But he could face decades in a US prison after it emerged last week he was also being charged with violating the Espionage Act by publishing classified information through WikiLeaks. Prosecutors announced 17 additional charges against Assange for publishing hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and files on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Assange, 47, was previously charged with working to hack a Pentagon computer system, in a secret indictment that was unveiled soon after his arrest at Ecuador's embassy. WikiLeaks said on Tuesday the Australian had been moved to the hospital wing of Belmarsh after a \"dramatic\" loss of weight and deteriorating health. \"Mr Assange's health had already significantly deteriorated after seven years inside the Ecuadorian embassy, under conditions that were incompatible with basic human rights,\" WikiLeaks said in statement. The development comes as concerns grow over Assange's health and wellbeing, with WikiLeaks alleging that he has been subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment while in custody. The organization has called for his immediate release, citing the need to prioritize his health and well-being. Assange's legal team has also expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being held, saying that he is being kept in a small cell with limited access to fresh air and natural light. The US government has denied any allegations of mistreatment, but the controversy has sparked widespread debate about the treatment of whistleblowers and the role of the media in holding those in power accountable. As the extradition proceedings continue, Assange's supporters are calling for his release and for the US government to drop the charges against him.",

What you don't hear quite so often is that the stuff under the land is also apparently made of freedom as well. That is, at least according to a news release this week from the Department of Energy (DoE). Mark W Menezes, the US undersecretary of energy, bestowed a peculiar honorific on our continent's natural resources, dubbing it \"freedom gas\" in a release touting the DoE's approval of increased exports of natural gas produced by a Freeport LNG terminal off the coast of Texas. \"Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,\" he said. The concept of \"freedom gas\" may seem amorphous, but it's actually being measured down to the smallest unit. The Department of Energy has developed a formula to quantify the \"freedom\" contained in each unit of natural gas, which is said to be directly proportional to the level of democracy and economic freedom in the country of origin. According to the DoE, natural gas extracted from countries with high levels of freedom, such as the United States, contains a higher concentration of \"freedom\" than gas extracted from countries with more authoritarian regimes. The agency has even developed a \"Freedom Index\" to measure the \"freedom\" content of different natural gas deposits around the world. The index takes into account factors such as the level of political freedom, economic freedom, and human rights in the country of origin. The DoE plans to use the Freedom Index to certify the \"freedom\" content of natural gas exports and to promote the use of \"freedom gas\" as a way to spread democracy and freedom around the world. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the scientific validity of the Freedom Index and the potential for its use as a tool of political manipulation.",

        "Text": "Airlines including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have resisted calls to remove \"no-show\" clauses, which bump passengers off the second half of a return trip, despite heavy criticism from regulators and calls for a ban. Consumer body Which? wrote to nine airlines in December, warning they may be breaking consumer laws by keeping clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger misses the first leg of the same booking, forcing some customers to pay hundreds of pounds for replacement flights. In many cases airlines can sell on the same tickets, doubling their earnings for one seat. Of the nine airlines, only Flybe told Which? it would change the clauses, although it has not removed them completely. The airlines that retained the clauses were British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates, Air France, Singapore, Qatar and Swiss. KLM said it did not cancel the return flight ticket if the first leg was missed. Instead, it charges an extra fixed-rate fee of between €125 (£112) and €3,000 to passengers at the airport. In one case brought to Which?, a customer was forced to pay more than £600 to British Airways after he and his wife were barred from the second leg of their return trip from London to Pisa. The customer booked an outbound flight with an alternative airline after the first leg with British Airways was cancelled because of an airline strike, and he was only offered a replacement two days later. Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) added to the pressure on airlines, saying it was concerned by airlines' failure to remove the no-show clauses. Which? on Friday called for the \"rip-off\" no-show clauses to be banned, following the example set in Austria, which banned the practice in April. Caroline Normand, the consumer group's director of advocacy, said: \"It's totally unreasonable for an airline to cancel a passenger's return flight – often without warning – simply because they've missed the first leg of their journey. \"Airlines have been able to cash in with this tactic for too long, leaving people miserable, stranded and hundreds if not thousands of pounds out of pocket. However, the CAA said in its report that its enforcement powers were limited, meaning government action may be required. The airlines' refusal to budge has sparked outrage among passengers, who feel they are being unfairly penalized for circumstances beyond their control. \"I was stuck in Paris with a cancelled flight and had to book an alternative, but when I got back to the UK, British Airways cancelled my return flight without warning,\" said one frustrated traveler. \"I was left scrambling to find another flight, and ended up paying over £500 for a new ticket.\" Another passenger, who was affected by a similar situation with Virgin Atlantic, added: \"It's ridiculous that airlines can just cancel your return flight without any notice or compensation. It's like they're taking advantage of passengers' misfortune.\" The debate has reignited calls for greater regulation of the aviation industry, with many arguing that airlines should be forced to prioritize customer service over profits. Meanwhile, Which? is urging the government to take action and ban the no-show clauses once and for all. \"It's time for the government to step in and put an end to this unfair practice,\" said Caroline Normand. \"Passengers deserve better than to be treated like cash cows by airlines.\"",

The miners were killed when two 'galleries' overlooking an open excavation pit collapsed at the same mining site which claimed six lives in 2016. Glencore, the world's biggest mining company, confirmed that at least 19 illegal miners were killed when part of the open-pit mine in the Kolwezi area collapsed, and said further fatalities were possible. Richard Muyej, the governor of the DRC's Lualaba province, told Reuters that the accident had claimed the lives of at least 36 \"clandestine artisanal diggers\". The FTSE 100 company, which owns 75% of the Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) through its Katanga Mining subsidiary, blamed the illegal miners for trespassing at the copper mine and \"putting their lives at risk\". These miners were working along two 'benches', or narrow strips cut into the side of the open pit, which caved in, killing the workers. Glencore said it has observed a growing number of artisanal miners trespassing at the mine, and estimates that on average 2,000 illegal miners gather on the site every day. The \"daily intrusions\" have raised a \"significant risk to its employees, operating equipment and the illegal artisanal miners themselves\", Glencore said. In a statement Glencore said the \"incidents\" were not linked to the mine's operations, and would not affect production at the mine. The company said it was assisting search and rescue operations with the local authorities. It urged all illegal miners to \"cease from putting their lives at risk by trespassing on a major industrial site\". Deadly mining accidents are common in DRC, where unemployment is high and artisanal miners hunt for copper to sell, often in dangerous conditions. Glencore said it is \"doing what it can\" to inform the communities of the dangers associated with illegal trespassing on mining sites. \"The safety and security of its employees, contractors and host communities is of paramount importance to KCC. The incident has sparked widespread outrage and calls for greater safety measures to be implemented at the mine. The DRC's government has launched an investigation into the accident and has promised to take action to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\nLocal residents have expressed shock and grief at the loss of life, with many calling for the government to take a stronger stance against illegal mining. \"This is a disaster,\" said one resident. \"We have been warning about the dangers of illegal mining for years, but nothing has been done to stop it.\"\n\nThe accident has also raised concerns about the safety of artisanal miners, who often work in dangerous conditions with little protection or support. \"These miners are not just risking their own lives, but also the lives of their families and communities,\" said a local activist. \"Something needs to be done to address this issue.\"\n\nGlencore has faced criticism in the past for its handling of artisanal mining at the Kamoto Copper Company mine. The company has been accused of failing to provide adequate safety measures and of not doing enough to prevent illegal mining.\n\nIn response to the accident, Glencore has announced that it will be increasing its efforts to prevent illegal mining at the site. The company has also pledged to work with local authorities to provide support to the families of the victims and to help prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the mining industry. \"This tragedy is a stark reminder of the importance of prioritizing safety and transparency in the mining industry,\" said a spokesperson for the DRC's government. \"We will be working closely with Glencore and other stakeholders to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to prevent similar accidents from occurring in the future.\"",

Recently, Virgin wrote to us demanding disclosure of sensitive information such as our salaries, proof of identity and proof of source of funds that we use to pay our credit card bill. This is the first time in 20 years a credit card provider has sought such personal data, and the fact that the demand was signed by hand led me to suspect it may be fraud. I reported it to Virgin Money and it confirmed it had sent the letter, but was unable to share from which department it had originated, nor why it required the information. I elected not to reply and, without further notice, Virgin stopped both our cards, leaving my wife and myself stranded at opposite ends of the country. Multiple calls to Virgin Money received the same nonchalant reply. As I had not returned my questionnaire and provided the data wanted, my card was blocked and would remain so until I capitulated. TD, London Requests for personal information are becoming more common as banks are required by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, to monitor accounts suspected of criminal activity. Banks can be found guilty of money-laundering offences if they don't investigate unexplained transactions and report suspicious activity to enforcement agencies. As a result, perfectly innocent payments can cause an account to be suspended if they differ from the account holder's usual spending patterns. They might also request personal information if they think that the account-holder details may not be up to date. You are right to be wary of an unexpected request for information, but once you've established it genuinely comes from your bank, I'm afraid you have to comply if you want to continue using its services. Virgin says: \"There can be circumstances which mean we need to ask customers for additional information in order to protect the customer and their account. However, I believe Virgin Money's approach was heavy-handed and unreasonable. By refusing to provide the requested information, I was penalized with the cancellation of both my wife's and my credit cards, leaving us stranded without access to our funds. The lack of transparency and communication from Virgin Money was appalling, and I was left feeling vulnerable and concerned about the security of our financial information. I urge other customers to be cautious when receiving similar requests from their banks and to demand clear explanations and justification for the need to disclose sensitive personal data. Only then can we ensure that our financial security is protected and our trust in the banking system is restored.",

His business interests include care homes, hotels, leisure facilities and student accommodation and he has been listed as a director 137 times with Companies House. Woodhouse began his business career as a teenager cleaning cars. \"I was always a clever little git that thought he knew something that they didn't, and one day somebody said: 'Put up or shut up' and I sort of thought I'd better put my money where my mouth is,\" he says. \"My first experience as an entrepreneur was maybe working within the car industry and just seeing that cars needed cleaning. It was just a simple supply and demand. Then I sort of realised that people would want to come and part exchange their cars with us – often the traders wouldn't give them the best possible prices, so I then thought actually if I offered to sell your car for you from a location and get you more than you were being offered and yet I'd be able to make something off the top of that. That was my first experience of cleaning cars and selling cars was probably my first experience at a young age.\" His personal website reports how the business \"was such a success that within two years he had helped create a multimillion-pound financial facility for the funding of vehicles to large independent financial advisory and accountancy groups across the globe\". As his business empire grew, so did his reputation as a shrewd and ambitious entrepreneur. Woodhouse's ability to spot opportunities and capitalize on them quickly earned him a reputation as a master of the deal. He went on to expand his interests into the care home sector, acquiring a number of facilities across the UK and Ireland. His company, Woodhouse Care Homes, became a major player in the industry, known for its high-quality services and innovative approach to care.\n\nDespite his many business ventures, Woodhouse remains humble and grounded. He is fiercely protective of his family and close friends, and is known to be generous with his time and resources. His country home, where he lives with his wife and two children, is a testament to his love of the great outdoors. He is an avid walker and cyclist, and can often be found exploring the Yorkshire countryside on his bike.\n\nWoodhouse's infectious enthusiasm and boundless energy have also made him a popular figure in the business community. He is in high demand as a speaker and mentor, and has worked with numerous startups and small businesses to help them achieve their goals. His mantra, \"Put up or shut up,\" has become a rallying cry for many entrepreneurs, inspiring them to take the leap and pursue their passions.\n\nDespite his many successes, Woodhouse remains committed to his humble beginnings. He is proud of his roots and the hard work that has taken him to where he is today. He is a true rags-to-riches story, and his story serves as a reminder that with determination and perseverance, anything is possible.",

He was born in Coventry, the son of Florence (nee Wilday) and Cyril Dewis. His education was cut short when his father, a coal merchant and carter, died in 1934, and Norman had to find work. After a false start with Humber, he became an apprentice at the Armstrong Siddeley car company. At the outbreak of the second world war in 1939, Norman joined the RAF and became a rear gunner on Blenheims, until he was invalided out with a kidney infection. He then became an Air Ministry inspector. In 1945, he moved to Lea-Francis, where he became chief tester, but in 1952 he joined Jaguar as a test driver and development engineer, remaining there until his retirement in 1985. He soon became involved in disc brake tests, as Jaguar, together with the Dunlop company, was instrumental in developing this new form of brake. Norman had raced his own 500cc single-seater and took part in a number of races for Jaguar, starting with the 1952 Mille Miglia in which he co-drove with Stirling Moss in a Jaguar C-type. Although they did not finish, this was the first time that a car fitted with disc brakes had raced. In 1953, Norman set a speed record in an XK 120 at Jabbeke in Belgium, at 172.4mph. He was one of the Jaguar D-type drivers in the 1955 Le Mans. This race saw motor racing's worst accident when a Mercedes-Benz hit a group of spectators, resulting in more than 70 deaths, witnessed by Norman from the pit opposite. After he had completed his spell of driving, his co-driver went off course, leaving the D-type of Mike Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb to win. Norman worked on the development of the world-beating E-type. For its launch at the 1961 Geneva motor show, he had to make a last-minute dash across Europe in one of the demonstrators. After the Geneva motor show, Norman continued to play a key role in Jaguar's testing and development programs, working on various projects including the XJ6 and XJ12 sedans. He also remained involved in racing, participating in several Jaguar teams and helping to develop the company's racing cars. Norman's expertise and experience were highly valued by Jaguar's management, and he was often called upon to provide advice and guidance to the company's engineers and designers. In recognition of his contributions, Norman was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1981. After his retirement from Jaguar in 1985, Norman remained involved in the motoring industry, serving as a consultant and advisor to various companies. He also continued to participate in historic racing events, often behind the wheel of his beloved Jaguar D-type. Norman Dewis passed away on [date] at the age of 98, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most respected and accomplished test drivers in the history of the automotive industry.",

However, a more worrying point, which he might have addressed, is the way in which – no doubt due to the same processes that lead to the introduction of such terms – single words or phrases come to dominate language, killing off any opposition, and ultimately impoverishing it; to the extent that, for instance, many people nowadays seem to have only a single superlative at their disposal, resulting in such things as a poster that hangs in my GP's surgery, asking: \"Have you had great care today?\" Jim Grozier Brighton, East Sussex • Anyone who feels upset by the overuse of \"like\" might turn to the American poet AE Stallings, who takes it for the title of her 2018 collection. She includes a virtuoso sestina which \"rhymes\" the word 39 times, and the following passage: \"Those poets who dislike / Inversions, archaisms, who just like / Plain English as she's spoke – why isn't 'like' / Their (literally) every other word? I'd like / Us just to admit that's what real speech is like.\" John Greening Stonely, Cambridgeshire • Pretending to watch Love Island for linguistic analysis is so Guardian. But, in fact, it's a great way to study the evolution of language and the ways in which it adapts to popular culture. The show's use of colloquialisms and slang is a reflection of the way language is constantly changing, and it's fascinating to see how these terms spread and become mainstream. Moreover, the show's ability to bring people together through shared language and cultural references is a powerful testament to the unifying force of language. So, while the overuse of \"like\" may be annoying to some, it's also a reminder of the dynamic and ever-changing nature of language, and the ways in which it reflects and shapes our culture.",

I think that's fairly obvious. And not just the world. Maybe the galaxy. Ah well. I suppose men had a good run. At an agreed signal, women will just kill all the men in their sleep, I suppose? I expect that's plan B. For now, I think they just intend to colonise space without taking any men along. But how can they colonise anything without having children? Don't they still need men in that department? Not exactly. All that the interplanetary matriarchy technically needs to get started is a supply of sperm. Well, maybe men won't give it to them! Maybe they will go on strike if necessary. I'm not sure that will make a difference. New research from Dexeus Women's Health in Barcelona shows that once sperm is collected and frozen, it can survive in microgravity with no ill effects. How did they find that out? They took lots of sperm samples up in a plane, and dived at the ground a few times to subject them to weightlessness. It opens up the possibility of creating \"a human sperm bank outside Earth\", according to Dr Montserrat Boada. So the matriarchy will just defrost what they need to impregnate themselves when required? That's right. And they can always have a few sons if they need to top up the supply. But who will put up shelves on Mars? And what if they have to park the spaceship in a narrow crater? You see? It's the absence of that kind of sexist remark that will make an all-female space mission more cohesive and efficient. What about the all-male missions in the old days? Were they not cohesive? Nasa looked into this years ago, according to Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space. And? She told an audience in 2017 that the US commissioned a secret study into long-term space travel, which recommended that to stop people having sex, \"the crew should be the same gender: all men or all women\". Apparently women were the better choice, because men would quarrel about who was in charge. Men would definitely do that. It's basically human history so far, isn't it? A short summary, yes. Although someone ought to tell Nasa that there might still be some sex on a women-only spacecraft. True. Despite the challenges of space travel, the interplanetary matriarchy is reportedly making rapid progress in its colonization efforts. According to sources, the women have already established a thriving colony on Mars, where they are working to create a self-sustaining ecosystem. The colony is said to be thriving, with the women working together to build a new society free from the constraints of traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, back on Earth, men are struggling to come to terms with their new status as second-class citizens. Many are protesting the changes, claiming that they are being unfairly marginalized and oppressed. However, the women of the interplanetary matriarchy remain resolute in their determination to create a better future for all, regardless of gender. As one woman was quoted as saying, \"We're not trying to oppress anyone, we're just trying to create a society where everyone is equal and has the opportunity to thrive.\"",

The study found that frozen samples of sperm exposed to microgravity retained similar characteristics to sperm samples kept on the ground, raising hopes that a sperm bank could one day be set up in space to help populate new worlds. This could prove interesting for female astronauts, amid reports that future missions to Mars may involve women-only space crews. Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut, said at a conference in 2017 that there had been an unreleased Nasa report exploring sexual desires of space crew members during potential missions to Mars. Sharman said the report had recommended space crews of the same gender – \"all men or all women\" – because they have better team cohesion. Findings from the small preliminary study, involving sperm from 10 healthy donors, suggest that \"the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth\" exists, according to the researchers. The study was presented on Sunday at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Vienna, Austria. Montserrat Boada, from Dexeus Women's Health in Barcelona, who presented the research along with her colleagues, said: \"Some studies suggest a significant decrease in the motility of a human, fresh sperm sample. But nothing has been reported on the possible effects of gravitational differences on frozen human gametes, in which state they could be transported from Earth to space.\" The researchers, led by Montserrat Boada from Dexeus Women's Health in Barcelona, exposed frozen sperm samples to microgravity conditions and found that they retained their characteristics, including motility and morphology, similar to those kept on the ground. The study's findings suggest that the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth is feasible, which could have significant implications for future space missions. The researchers plan to conduct further studies to investigate the effects of microgravity on other types of human gametes, such as eggs, and to explore the feasibility of establishing a sperm bank in space. If successful, this could provide a new option for couples who may not be able to conceive naturally due to medical conditions or other factors, and could potentially help to populate new worlds. The study's findings were presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Vienna, Austria, and have sparked interest and debate among scientists and policymakers.",

It's not just concern about access to venison meatballs or pistachio ice-cream – residents of Bromley in London, Oadby in Leicestershire and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire apparently fear their house prices could take a dive. Kal Kandola, 49, told the Telegraph: \"We are regulars at Waitrose and not very happy about this at all. I have houses in Wollaton that I rent out. The issue of house prices is a concern as Wollaton is an affluent area.\" Homes near the upmarket supermarket chain enjoy the \"Waitrose effect\", commanding a 12% premium (£43,571) on the average home, according to research by Lloyds Bank last year. But the hand-wringing by local residents may be unnecessary. The value of homes near to budget supermarkets such as Lidl rose by a larger amount than those near a Waitrose – up 15% over the past four years, according to Lloyds. Homes near a Lidl are worth £5,411 more than other properties in the nearby area. Meanwhile, discount stores are increasingly popular with affluent shoppers. Attracting more middle-class bargain hunters with cheap cheese and wine has helped Lidl and Aldi overtake Waitrose to become the UK's seventh and fifth largest grocers, controlling nearly 14% of the market, according to analysts at Kantar, up from about 10% only three years ago. Despite the concerns, local estate agents are remaining optimistic about the impact of Lidl's arrival. \"While it's true that some affluent areas have seen a slight decrease in property values when a budget supermarket moves in, we believe the overall effect will be minimal,\" said James Thompson, a local agent. \"The Waitrose effect may be real, but it's also a myth that's been perpetuated by local residents. In reality, the presence of a budget supermarket can bring new life to an area, attracting new businesses and residents.\" Thompson pointed out that the area around Lidl's new locations is already experiencing a surge in interest from potential buyers and renters. \"We're seeing a lot of activity in the market, and I think this is just the beginning of a new chapter for these areas,\" he said. With Lidl's expansion showing no signs of slowing down, it remains to be seen whether the concerns of middle-class residents will prove to be justified. One thing is certain, however: the future of the UK's supermarket landscape is looking more affordable than ever.",

Oh God, these things never make any sense to me. It's basically the new #SquadGoals. That doesn't help. #SquadGoals was a hashtag commonly appended to shots of one and one's mates having fun, looking fit and possibly dressed in matching outfits. I'll take your word for it. And #GeneBragging? The term, seemingly coined in a recent Telegraph article, denotes a new fondness for posting lovely photos of one's glamorous parents, children or grandparents while on holiday in exotic locations with them. Glamorous parents? Who has glamorous parents? Celebrities, and the offspring of celebrities. I'm feeling slightly exempted from this. That's partly the point. It's a deflective form of showing off. How so? Because you're being complimentary about someone who happens to share a lot of your genetic material. And then you add the hashtag #GeneBragging? Oh God, no. That would ruin it. So what do you write? Well, in the case of Holly Willoughby's pic of her mother sitting on the beach in a swimsuit, she wrote: \"When I grow up I want to be just like this please …\" That's sort of sweet, I guess.

Some have criticized #GeneBragging as being overly self-congratulatory, or even a form of \"celebrity entitlement.\" Others have pointed out that it can be a way for wealthy and famous individuals to flaunt their privilege and good fortune.\n\nDespite the backlash, #GeneBragging shows no signs of slowing down. As the summer sun continues to shine, expect to see even more photos of glamorous relatives flooding your social media feeds. Whether you love it or hate it, one thing is for sure: #GeneBragging is the latest way for celebrities and influencers to connect with their fans and show off their fabulous families.",

The strongly worded letter from the exasperated sports bodies – including Fifa, Uefa, Germany's Bundesliga, Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A as well as the Asian Football Confederation – comes after almost 18 months fruitlessly attempting to mount a legal challenge in Saudi Arabia to block the service, called beoutQ. \"We collectively condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing theft of our intellectual property by the pirate broadcaster known as beoutQ and call on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to support us in ending the widespread and flagrant breaches of our intellectual property rights,\" the authorities said in a joint statement. The sporting bodies have said that nine legal firms in Saudi Arabia have failed to take on their copyright theft case and that they are now being forced to seek other means to shut down the broadcaster. \"We have reached the conclusion, regrettably, that it is now not possible to retain legal counsel in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia which is willing or able to act on our behalf,\" the statement continued. \"We see no alternative but to pursue beoutQ and a solution to this very serious problem of piracy by other means. We request that the Saudi ministry of culture and the Saudi government take swift and decisive action against beoutQ.\" The illegal service had a surge in popularity after making global headlines for pirate broadcasting the entire 2018 World Cup. Earlier this month the All England Lawn Tennis Club condemned beoutQ for illegally streaming Wimbledon worldwide for a second year running. The BBC and Sky have also previously spoken out about the issue of piracy of their programming. The beoutQ service is transmitted internationally on 10 channels by the Saudi-headquartered satellite firm Arabsat, which counts the Saudi state as its largest shareholder, and also offers streaming. The authorities have also warned that the piracy of football matches is not only a financial loss, but also poses a threat to the integrity of the sport. \"The unauthorized broadcast of our matches undermines the legitimacy of our competitions and erodes trust in the sport as a whole,\" the statement said. The sporting bodies have demanded that Arabsat, the satellite firm behind beoutQ, take immediate action to shut down the service. They have also called on the Saudi government to take swift and decisive action against beoutQ and its operators. The authorities have vowed to take all necessary steps to protect their intellectual property rights and to ensure that the sport is not compromised by piracy. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Premier League said: \"We will not stand idly by while our matches are stolen and broadcast without permission. We urge the Saudi authorities to take immediate action to stop this illegal activity.\" The authorities have also threatened to take legal action against Arabsat and beoutQ if they fail to comply with their demands. The situation is a major embarrassment for the Saudi government, which has been trying to promote the country as a hub for international sports events. The government has invested heavily in sports infrastructure and has hosted several major international events, including the 2020 Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. However, the piracy of football matches has cast a shadow over Saudi Arabia's reputation as a sports-friendly nation. The authorities have been accused of turning a blind eye to the piracy, with some suggesting that it is a form of state-sponsored theft. The Saudi government has denied any involvement in the piracy, but the situation has sparked widespread outrage and concern among football fans and officials around the world.",

An Ofcom investigation revealed the network, which is owned by O2's parent company Telefónica, overcharged users a total of almost £2.9m. The communications regulator said the billing mistake was \"unacceptable\" and imposed a further £50,000 fine because Giffgaff failed to provide accurate information during its investigation. Giffgaff, which overcharged customers from May 2011 to February 2019, has about 2.5 million customers. \"Getting bills right is a basic duty for every phone company. But Giffgaff made unacceptable mistakes, leaving millions of customers out of pocket,\" Gaucho Rasmussen, the director of investigations and enforcement at Ofcom, said. \"This fine should serve as a warning to all communications providers: if they get bills wrong, we will step in to protect customers.\" Ofcom said the fine would have been £2m but the penalty was reduced by 30% because Giffgaff agreed to settle the case and admitted the mistake. Giffgaff customers who pre-paid for \"goodybags\" – bundles of voice minutes, text messages and data – were in effect charged twice, the regulator said. This was because there was a delay in Giffgaff applying the bundles to customers' accounts after they paid for it, which meant calls and data they were using at the time came out of their pre-paid credit instead. Ofcom said the services should have been free immediately after the bundle was purchased. Giffgaff has already refunded about £2.1m to affected customers. It has also made a donation to charity in lieu of those customers it has not been able to trace and refund. The fine is the largest imposed by Ofcom on a mobile network operator in recent years, and it serves as a warning to other providers to ensure they are accurately billing their customers. Giffgaff has taken steps to rectify the issue and prevent similar mistakes from happening in the future. The company has also implemented a new system to ensure that goodybags are applied to customers' accounts promptly, so that they can enjoy the benefits of their bundles without delay.\n\nOfcom's investigation into the matter was sparked by a complaint from a Giffgaff customer who noticed that their account was being overcharged. The regulator launched a probe into the company's billing practices and found that the overcharging was widespread, affecting millions of customers over an eight-year period.\n\nGiffgaff's parent company, Telefónica, has also been criticized for its handling of the situation. The company has been accused of prioritizing profits over customer satisfaction, and of failing to adequately address the issue when it was first brought to their attention.\n\nThe fine imposed by Ofcom is a significant blow to Giffgaff's reputation, and it may take some time for the company to recover from the negative publicity. However, the company has taken steps to make amends with its customers, and it has implemented new measures to prevent similar mistakes from happening in the future.",

        "Text": "The US justice department is opening a broad antitrust review into major technology firms, as criticism over the companies' growing reach and power heats up. The investigation will focus on growing complaints that the companies are unlawfully stifling competition. \"The Department's review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,\" the Department of Justice said in a statement. \"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" added the assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim, of the antitrust division. The review will investigate practices of online platforms including Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Amazon and Apple. The investigation comes amid calls from lawmakers, including Democratic presidential candidates such as Elizabeth Warren, that the companies should face more scrutiny. Last week, Facebook, Google, and Amazon faced a grilling before the House subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law over their hold on markets including digital advertising, e-commerce and cloud computing. Lawmakers questioned Amazon over the fees it levies against third-party sellers on the platform and whether this creates a monopoly of power. They also questioned Facebook executives over practices of targeting startups for acquisition and copying features of companies that decline to be acquired. Lawmakers also grilled Facebook this month over its plans to launch a global cryptocurrency, called Libra. In the hearing, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said Facebook showed \"breathtaking arrogance\" in attempting to launch a digital financial service after a number of major privacy scandals. In July, the Federal Trade Commission approved a $5bn fine against Facebook for its handling of user data surrounding the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. The review is expected to be a wide-ranging examination of the companies' business practices, including their use of data, their relationships with other companies, and their impact on the wider economy. The investigation is likely to be a lengthy and complex process, with the Justice Department working closely with other government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, to gather evidence and build a case.\n\nThe companies under investigation are already facing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, the European Commission has launched its own antitrust investigation into Google's search practices, while the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has been investigating Amazon's treatment of third-party sellers on its platform.\n\nThe growing concern about the power of the tech giants is not limited to the US. In Europe, there are concerns that the companies are using their dominance to stifle innovation and competition, and to undermine the integrity of the digital economy. The European Commission has launched a series of investigations into the companies' business practices, including an antitrust investigation into Google's search practices and a probe into Amazon's use of data.\n\nThe Justice Department's review is likely to be a major blow to the tech giants, which have long been resistant to government oversight. The companies have argued that they are subject to intense competition and that their dominance is a result of their ability to innovate and provide better services to consumers.\n\nHowever, the growing concern about the power of the tech giants is likely to lead to increased scrutiny and regulation in the coming years. The Justice Department's review is just the latest example of the growing trend towards regulating the tech industry, and it is likely to have significant implications for the companies involved.",

        "Text": "The Crop Protection Association (CPA) criticises the RSA Food, Farming and Countryside Commission report, Our Future in the Land, for its absence of science (Letters, 22 July). As much as they'd like us to believe it, they do not have the monopoly on the scientific arguments. Good science is a rigorous and critical process of inquiry: it is far from perfect, neutral and incontrovertible. It was science that gave us DDT, thalidomide and lead in petrol; and science told us it would be fine to give antibiotics prophylactically to intensively reared livestock. We know now that the science was at best \"incomplete\", and it is fresh science that tells us that we must change. We should therefore apply the precautionary principle more carefully, given what we know now about the misplaced claims of science past. Scientific inquiry can only ever answer the questions asked. We are now becoming aware of the impact of the chemical cocktail in our environment – synthetic chemicals used on and in our foods; endemic microplastics; airborne pollution; medicines in our water supply. We do not yet know the full effect of these issues, since scientific inquiry has been slow to ask these questions. But it is now And we should all be very curious to learn more. The CPA argues that intensive agriculture enables us to use less land, sparing more for nature. Currently around two-thirds of arable production is fed to animals. However, this argument ignores the significant environmental impacts of intensive agriculture, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. The true cost of intensive agriculture is not reflected in the price of food, and consumers are often unaware of the environmental and social implications of their purchasing decisions.\n\nFurthermore, the CPA's claim that intensive agriculture enables us to use less land is misleading. While it may be true that less land is required for intensive farming systems, this is often at the expense of ecosystem services and biodiversity. In reality, intensive agriculture is often unsustainable and can lead to long-term environmental degradation.\n\nThe RSA report highlights the need for a more holistic approach to food and farming, one that prioritizes environmental sustainability, social justice, and animal welfare. This requires a shift away from intensive agriculture and towards more sustainable and resilient farming systems.\n\nWe must also recognize that the food system is not just about production, but also about consumption. Consumers have a crucial role to play in promoting sustainable food systems, and this includes making informed choices about the food they buy and eat. By supporting local, organic, and regenerative farming practices, consumers can help to drive positive change in the food system.\n\nUltimately, the CPA's criticism of the RSA report is a distraction from the real issues facing our food and farming systems. Rather than relying on outdated and incomplete science, we need to invest in new research and innovation that prioritizes environmental sustainability and social justice. By working together, we can create a food system that is not only more sustainable, but also more just and equitable.",

        "Text": "British Airways has lost its legal attempt to block planned strikes by pilots, which could take place next month and disrupt the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of passengers. The pilots union, Balpa, can now call strike dates with two weeks' notice. However. it has said it will not set dates until after further talks with the airline, which intends to take its case to the court of appeal. The high court on Tuesday dismissed BA's argument that the strike ballot, whose result was announced on Monday, was invalid. Some 93% of BA's 4,000 pilots voted to take industrial action after rejecting a three-year pay deal. Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \"Although legally clear to do so, we have still not set any strike dates to give BA one last chance to commit to negotiating on pilots pay and rewards with us at Acas later this week.\" He added: \"The company itself has admitted that even one day of strike action would cost more than what our pilots are asking for, so the ball really is in their court here, to look after their pilots and ensure the hardworking public get to continue their holidays as planned.\" A BA spokesman said the airline remained open to talks, adding: \"We are very disappointed with today's decision. We will continue to pursue every avenue to protect the holidays of thousands of our customers this summer.\" Pilots had sought an above-inflation pay settlement that would also include a profit share scheme, reflecting their argument that they took pay cuts when BA was struggling in the wake of the financial crisis and that they should share in the benefit now that the business has recovered. The airline's failure to persuade the court to block the strike means that it will now have to prepare for the possibility of significant disruptions to its services. The summer is typically a busy period for BA, with millions of passengers flying with the airline to destinations around the world. If the strike goes ahead, it could lead to delays, cancellations, and increased congestion at airports.\n\nIn a statement, Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said that the union was \"delighted\" with the court's decision, but emphasized that it was not seeking to cause unnecessary disruption. \"We have always sought a negotiated settlement, and we remain committed to finding a solution that works for both pilots and the airline,\" he said.\n\nBA, meanwhile, has vowed to do everything in its power to minimize the impact of any strike on its customers. The airline has already begun contingency planning, including scheduling extra flights and staff to help mitigate the effects of any disruption.\n\nThe dispute between BA and its pilots is the latest in a series of industrial action taken by workers in the aviation sector in recent years. Last year, easyJet pilots went on strike over pay and conditions, while Ryanair cabin crew have also taken industrial action over working conditions and pay.\n\nAs the dispute continues, passengers are advised to check with their airline for the latest information on any potential disruptions to their travel plans. BA has promised to keep customers informed of any changes to its schedules, and has advised them to check its website or social media channels for updates.",

        "Text": "Shares in Ted Baker have jumped after reports that the fashion retailer's founder, Ray Kelvin, was considering teaming up with investors to buy the company. Kelvin quit as chief executive in March in the wake of allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards staff, including forced hugs. Reports at the weekend said Kelvin, who owns 35% of Ted Baker, was prepared to support a buyout to take the company private and work with its existing management. Shares in the business closed up 13.5% at 951p on Monday. The share price has more than halved since early January following the publication of two profit warnings, as it described \"extremely difficult\" trading conditions. In March 2018 the shares traded at £32.14, valuing Ted Baker at £1.4bn. The company is now valued at about £424m and Kelvin's stake is worth £148m. Following Kelvin's departure his former finance director and associate of more than 20 years, Lindsay Page, has been running the company. David Bernstein, a former chairman of French Connection and the Football Association, is executive chairman. An acquisition could be backed by private equity firms, which are awash with cash, or a consortium of other investors, according to the Mail on Sunday, which first reported talk of a bid. The news of a potential buyout has sent shockwaves through the fashion industry, with many analysts speculating about the motivations behind Kelvin's reported interest in taking the company private. Some have suggested that he may be looking to salvage what remains of his reputation, while others believe that he is seeking to regain control of the business he founded. Whatever the reason, the news has sparked a renewed interest in Ted Baker's fortunes, with many investors scrambling to get in on the action. The company's existing management, led by Page and Bernstein, are likely to be key players in any potential deal, and will be keen to navigate the complex process of negotiating with potential buyers. As the dust settles, one thing is clear: the future of Ted Baker is about to get a whole lot more interesting.",

Woodford Patient Capital Trust confirmed on Monday that it was pumping £10m into Atom Bank, keeping its stake at 18%. It is part of a wider £50m fundraising by Atom Bank that also drew investment from the Spanish banking group BBVA and investment funds Perscitus and Toscafund. But Woodford's involvement in the funding round failed to excite investors. Instead, shares in the FTSE-250-listed fund fell 1.6% to a new low of 53.1p. It is the first major investment decision made by Patient Capital since 3 June, when Woodford made the shock decision to suspend his flagship Equity Income Fund after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals. It followed a string of bad investments that caused the fund's performance to nosedive. Woodford was forced to block investors from withdrawing their money from the equity income fund in order to give himself time to sell off stakes in quoted stocks and unlisted companies that can be more difficult to sell. The move trapped more than 290,000 retail clients and their billions of pounds of investments behind the gated fund. The suspension was recently extended by another 28 days to 29 July. While Woodford Patient Capital Trust is not directly affected by the suspension, the move by its sister fund caused a sell-off in its shares and resulted in closer scrutiny of its investments. Its shares have tumbled 32% since the Equity Income Fund was gated. Woodford Patient Capital Trust declined to comment on the new investment. The investment in Atom Bank is a departure from Woodford's usual focus on quoted stocks, as the bank is a private company. The fund's decision to invest in Atom Bank has raised questions about its investment strategy and whether it is willing to take on more risk to generate returns. Analysts have also noted that the investment is a significant departure from Woodford's usual focus on quoted stocks, and may indicate a shift towards more private equity-style investments. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the investment, Woodford Patient Capital Trust's management remains optimistic about the potential returns from the Atom Bank investment, stating that it believes the bank has a strong growth potential and is well-positioned to take advantage of the increasing demand for digital banking services.",

The deal is not expected to have any impact on discussions on the rest of British Steel, as exclusive talks continue between the government's official receiver, the state employee managing the sale, and Oyak, the Turkish military pension fund. York-based TSP Projects, which designs and builds large rail infrastructure projects, will be folded into Systra. The proceeds of the sale are likely to be allocated to lenders to British Steel, which collapsed into liquidation in May. Neither the government nor the companies disclosed the sale price but Systra will also take on TSP's £70m pension liabilities, a hangover from the company's days as a division of British Rail before privatisation. Craig Scott, the chief executive of TSP Projects, said the liquidation of British Steel had never threatened his company, which was performing well and counted firms including Network Rail, Siemens and Costain among its clients. \"We would always have found a buyer,\" said Scott. He added that he was \"pleased to get out from the association with British Steel in administration and to be able to get on with focusing on our business. We're moving to an owner where we're part of their core business and it's a permanent home.\" He said Systra and TSP Projects were growing, meaning that none of the company's 400 jobs would be lost and more staff could be hired. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals. Systra, a leading global player in the rail industry, has operations in over 20 countries and employs over 12,000 people. The company has a strong track record of integrating acquired businesses and has committed to maintaining TSP Projects' operations and staff in York. The acquisition is seen as a strategic move by Systra to expand its presence in the UK and strengthen its position in the rail infrastructure market. The deal is also expected to bring new opportunities for TSP Projects, which will benefit from Systra's global reach and expertise. The news has been welcomed by the local community, with many praising the government's efforts to protect jobs and the entrepreneurial spirit of TSP Projects' employees.",

        "Text": "The downturn in casual dining delivered another blow to Pizza Express in the first half of the year while newer rival Franco Manca hit the spot as its menu of sourdough pizzas, green cola and vegan cheese appealed to changing consumer appetites. The contrasting fortunes were underlined as Pizza Express reported falling profits and put restaurant openings on hold, while Franco Manca attracted more customers and took advantage of falling rents to open more branches. Pizza Express said underlying profits fell 7.7% to £32.4m in the six months to the end of June. The chain opened just two new branches over the period and said the focus would be on improving existing sites and revamping its menu. Pizza Express's chief executive, Jinlong Wang, said: \"We are taking a measured approach to growing our business in the UK and Ireland … We are now planning to focus our capital investment on upgrading our existing estate rather than adding more sites.\" Pizza Express opened its first restaurant in 1965 and expanded in the 1990s to become a mainstay for families seeking an inexpensive meal out. The chain was bought by Hony Capital, a Chinese private equity firm, in 2014 when casual dining was booming in the UK. However, the market for casual dining has struggled since 2016 after becoming overcrowded with chains that expanded too quickly. Rising rents, wages and ingredient costs squeezed margins, especially in the saturated Italian-themed market which has fallen in popularity. Jamie Oliver's Italian chain closed in May and Prezzo and Strada have shut branches amid a sector rout that prompted landlords to cut rents. As a result of the decline in the casual dining market, Pizza Express has been forced to adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences. The company has acknowledged that its traditional menu offerings, which were once a staple of family dining, are no longer resonating with customers. In response, Pizza Express has launched a new menu featuring more contemporary options, including vegan and gluten-free dishes.\n\nHowever, the company's efforts to revamp its menu and operations have been overshadowed by the success of Franco Manca, which has capitalized on the growing demand for artisanal and high-quality food. Franco Manca's sourdough pizzas, made with fresh ingredients and cooked in a wood-fired oven, have become a hit with customers seeking a more authentic and premium dining experience.\n\nIndustry analysts believe that Franco Manca's success is a result of its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and its focus on quality and authenticity. \"Franco Manca has done a great job of appealing to the changing tastes of consumers,\" said one analyst. \"They've been able to capitalize on the trend towards artisanal and high-quality food, and their menu offerings are more in line with what customers are looking for.\"\n\nIn contrast, Pizza Express's struggles are seen as a result of its failure to adapt quickly enough to changing consumer preferences. The company's reliance on its traditional menu offerings and its focus on volume over quality have made it vulnerable to competition from newer, more innovative chains like Franco Manca.\n\nAs the casual dining market continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether Pizza Express can recover from its recent struggles. However, one thing is clear: the company will need to continue to innovate and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences if it hopes to remain relevant in the competitive world of casual dining.",

More than 300 employees have had their contracts ended in the company's Cork facility alone, according to former employees, with more sent home from other sites across Europe. The staff had been on paid leave since 2 August, the day Apple announced its decision to suspend the programme, referred to as \"grading\", as it conducted \"a thorough review\". The decision followed a story in the Guardian that revealed the workers frequently heard confidential medical information and couples having sex while checking the Siri recordings. The graders, employed through contracting firms, were sent home that Friday, with many told there was no work for them due to \"technical errors\". However, last week the contracting firms were told by Apple that the grading work would be terminated, leading to the mass job losses with little notice. Even among those employees who were concerned by the ethics of the programme, there has been anger about how the job losses have proceeded. \"I'm relieved this information came out,\" said one former contractor who asked to remain anonymous due to a still-active non-disclosure agreement, \"although I was involved in the work and I just lost my job. Discussions around ethics in this job was a constant between workers, but we don't know how to bring it up.\" But, they added, \"Apple, recruiting through vendor companies in Ireland, take absolutely no responsibility in the employment of contractors and their treatment in work. They do what they want, and when they're done with your project or they screw up (like what just happened), they tell your vendor company to let you go, which they do … It's been coming at them for over a year. The sudden loss of jobs has left many contractors in a state of financial uncertainty, with some having to rely on government assistance to make ends meet. \"I'm still trying to process what happened,\" said another former contractor, who had been working on the grading programme for over two years. \"I was told that my contract was being terminated due to 'technical errors', but I know that's just a cover story. The real reason is that Apple was embarrassed by the Guardian's expose and didn't want to deal with the fallout.\" The contractors, who were employed through firms such as Kelly Services and Adecco, were paid a minimum of €30,000 per year, but many had been working on the programme for several years and had built up a sense of security and routine. Now, they are left wondering what they will do next, and how they will support themselves and their families. Apple has so far refused to comment on the job losses, leaving the contractors to pick up the pieces and try to rebuild their lives.",

But when the work began we applied for an optional certificate of lawfulness from Lambeth council. It didn't review our application until September when it was rejected. It turned out that the planning department had unilaterally reinterpreted the rules in August 2018 without notifying residents, builders or architects. L-shaped dormers are now no longer considered a permitted development, although they are in other London boroughs. Six weeks later, we were served an enforcement notice. The government's guidance states that certificates of lawfulness are optional and many builders don't bother to apply. This means there may now be hundreds of \"illegal\" lofts in Lambeth. If a council can change the rules overnight without notification, it creates a trap for builders and, by interpreting the rules differently, defeats the purpose of permitted development legislation. BS, London Permitted development rules were intended to free small projects from red tape. They have proved contentious, partly because of how poorly they were drafted. However, the guidance issued by the government seems clear that L-shaped dormers are permitted and, at the time you submitted your application, Lambeth council accepted this. In a letter to you it stated that an application for a certificate of lawfulness is not an application for planning permission, but is to establish whether works were lawful at the time the application was made. Which they were. However, Lambeth seemed intent on applying its new rules retrospectively, saying: \"The council's approach has been dictated by appeal decisions since the summer of 2018, which have shown government planning inspectors have, in the main, not been recognising most L-shaped dormers as falling within permitted development. The developers are now left with a stark choice: either demolish the completed loft conversion at a significant cost, or risk facing enforcement action and potential fines. The situation has left many builders and homeowners in Lambeth feeling frustrated and confused, with some questioning the transparency and consistency of the council's decision-making process.\n\n\"I'm shocked and disappointed by the council's actions,\" said John, the developer behind the project. \"We followed the guidance and rules in place at the time, and it's unfair to retrospectively change the rules without warning. It's a nightmare scenario for us and many other builders in the area.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised concerns about the impact on the local construction industry, with some warning that the council's actions could lead to a shortage of skilled workers and a decline in the number of projects being undertaken in the area.\n\n\"This is a classic example of bureaucratic overreach,\" said Councillor X, a local politician who has been following the issue. \"The council needs to work with builders and homeowners to find a solution that respects the spirit of the permitted development rules, rather than creating unnecessary barriers and costs.\"\n\nAs the dispute continues, it remains to be seen how the council will respond to the backlash and whether the government will intervene to clarify the situation. In the meantime, builders and homeowners in Lambeth are left to pick up the pieces and wonder what the future holds for their projects.",

The two companies confirmed they were discussing an all-stock merger but said there was no guarantee a deal would be reached. They added they would \"make no further comment regarding the discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so\". Altria spun off Philip Morris International (PMI) in 2008. It sells Marlboro cigarettes in the US and has largely focused on its domestic market while PMI has focused on selling cigarettes overseas. PMI was valued at $121bn before the news and Altria at $88bn. A possible merger has been predicted by analysts who have speculated the two companies could get back together as they fight falling cigarette sales and the rise of vaping. Last year Altria paid $12.8bn for a 35% stake in Juul Labs, maker of the popular electronic-cigarette. Over the past year the e-cigarette category has grown 97% to $1.96bn and, according to Wells Fargo, Juul's sales grew 783% between June 2018 and June this year, reaching $942.6m. Altria has also made moves to enter the cannabis market as more US states legalize the drug. Last December Altria bought a 45% stake in Canadian cannabis firm Cronos Group for about $1.8bn. Cannabis is now legal in Canada and fully legal in 10 US states and the District of Columbia. PMI, too, has moved to diversify away from cigarettes and has invested heavily in Juul-rival iQOS, a device that heats tobacco rather than burning it. The device is now on sale in 48 markets around the world and will be launched in the US next month after winning approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. PMI said it has about 11 million iQOS users globally. In July PMI lowered its earnings forecast and warned the company was facing lower than expected demand and shipment volumes would decline 2% in 2019. Rival British American Tobacco (BAT) finalized its takeover of Reynolds American Incorporated in 2017, creating the world's largest tobacco company. That merger too was driven by falling sales and the rise of e-cigarettes and vapes. The potential merger between Philip Morris and Altria has sent shockwaves through the tobacco industry, with analysts speculating that the combined company could be a major player in the rapidly changing landscape of nicotine products. The deal would reunite the two companies, which were separated in 2008 when Altria spun off Philip Morris International. A merger could also give the companies a stronger foothold in the growing e-cigarette market, where Altria's Juul Labs has been a major player. Meanwhile, Philip Morris has been investing heavily in its iQOS device, which heats tobacco rather than burning it. The company has about 11 million iQOS users globally, and is set to launch the device in the US next month after winning approval from the FDA. Industry experts are watching the situation closely, as the merger could have significant implications for the tobacco industry as a whole. \"This could be a game-changer for the industry,\" said one analyst. \"If they can combine their strengths and create a more competitive company, it could be a major player in the nicotine products market.\"",

        "Text": "Your headline (Single polypill reduces risk of heart attacks and strokes, study finds, 23 August) should really have been tempered by quoting the absolute rather than the relative risk-reduction figures. The 34% reduction in major cardiac events you quote is calculated from \"on the ground\" reduction in events from 8.8% over five years in those not on the polypill to 5.9% in those receiving it – that is a 2.9% chance of benefit over five years to the individual and with no effect on mortality. Archie Cochrane , the doyen of evidence-based medicine, said we should ask three questions of any intervention: can it work, does it work and is it worth it? The relative risk reduction you quote tells us of population benefit and answers the first two questions, but it is the absolute risk reduction that answers the \"is it worth it?\"question. Many patients would be reluctant to take a tablet if told there was a greater than 97% chance that they would derive no benefit from taking it over five years and it had no positive effect on their length of life. Add to that the differences between the UK and rural Iran where the study was carried out, plus the risk of medicalising healthy patients and the constant risk of side-effects, and surely the answer to \"is it worth it?\" must be \"no\". It is only the absolute risk-reduction figures that allow us to make that decision. Dr Peter Trewby Richmond, North Yorkshire • It is by no means a novelty that medical researchers unashamedly pay lip service to big pharma. But the idea of suggesting a polypill as an extensive remedy to prevent illnesses in huge parts of a population takes this strategy to a new level. Especially upsetting is the composition of said pill. If applied with blanket coverage, its aspirin is likely doing harm to many patients who tend towards bleeding. The notion of a single pill to prevent heart attacks and strokes is appealing, but we must not be swayed by the simplicity of this solution. The composition of this polypill is concerning, with aspirin being a potential risk factor for bleeding in certain individuals. As Dr. Trewby Richmond pointed out, the risk of harm outweighs the potential benefits for many patients.\n\nMoreover, the idea of blanket coverage is problematic. Each patient is unique, with their own set of medical conditions and risk factors. A one-size-fits-all approach to prevention is not only ineffective but also potentially harmful. It is crucial that healthcare providers take a personalized approach to prevention, considering each patient's individual needs and circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, the study's findings are limited to a specific population in rural Iran, which may not be representative of the general population. The results may not be generalizable to other populations, and the pill's effectiveness may vary depending on the patient's demographic characteristics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of a polypill may seem appealing, we must not rush to adopt it without considering the potential risks and limitations. Healthcare providers must prioritize a personalized approach to prevention, taking into account each patient's unique needs and circumstances. Only then can we ensure that our patients receive the most effective and safest treatment possible.",

Waitrose says that it will help staff to \"manage stock and reductions more efficiently\", but the Sunday Times quotes an anonymous Waitrose worker who says the stress for staff had become too much, especially near closing time. \"It is a circus culture in which a horde of people – most of whom can afford to pay full price – are fighting over sandwiches,\" the source said. So where will I find these incredible bargains now? Reduced items will now be \"staying in their normal locations to give customers an immediate choice between a reduced product and one that is not\", Waitrose says. How will I know what's what? Reductions will still be marked with yellow labels but bargain hunters will now have to mine the whole store looking for glints of yellow. Are people really so bargain-hungry? Most definitely. Some are very professional about it. A soi-disant \"shopping ninja\" called Kelly Eroglu has written numerous blog posts on the subject, including how she used yellow stickers to feed her family for a week with £20. I'm game. Well, sharpen your elbows. Many people have learned when these daily reduction phases happen at their local supermarkets and arrive just in time. Some identify staff with the yellow-sticker guns and follow them round or even grab stuff from their trolleys. As the reduction bays disappear, savvy shoppers will need to develop new strategies to snag the best deals. Some are already adapting, using online forums and social media groups to coordinate efforts and share tips on finding the most reduced items. Kelly Eroglu, the self-proclaimed \"shopping ninja\", is leading the charge, offering advice on how to navigate the new system and maximize savings. \"It's all about being prepared and knowing what you're looking for,\" she says. \"Keep an eye on the store's social media accounts for announcements on daily reductions, and don't be afraid to ask staff about available items.\" With the stakes higher than ever, it's clear that the game of supermarket bargain-hunting has just gotten a whole lot more intense.",

        "Text": "Now is a good time to find the constellations based on the Greek myth of Perseus. The chart shows the core of these constellations: Perseus, Cassiopeia, Andromeda and Pegasus. They can be found high in the sky looking south this week. The central myth surrounds Queen Cassiopeia, who boasted of her daughter Andromeda's great beauty. This angered the gods and they sent the sea serpent Cetus to exact revenge. The hero Perseus, who in some versions of the story rode the winged horse Pegasus, slew the sea serpent and married Andromeda. To locate the constellations, search near the zenith for the W of Cassiopeia. From there, look for the inverted \"W\" shape of Cassiopeia, which marks the queen's throne. Andromeda is located near Cassiopeia, represented by a long, winding chain. Pegasus is situated nearby, with its distinctive square shape. Perseus is a bit more challenging to spot, but it's represented by a large, quadrilateral shape with a smaller triangle attached to its top. As you gaze up at the stars, remember the ancient Greek myth that brought these constellations to life. Take a moment to appreciate the beauty of the night sky and the stories that have been passed down through the ages. With a little practice, you'll be able to find these constellations and relive the epic tale of Perseus and Andromeda.",

The BBC guidelines are not laws. They are there to guide and are, therefore, open to interpretation. They are there to help producers make editorial decisions and, when a question about a programme is raised, to help frame a response. My experience of them is that they are a handy set of tools with enough wiggle room left for programme editors to make a judgment call. Television presenters are human beings. On Breakfast (unlike, say, the news) there is a conversational atmosphere between the presenters, who are expected to interact. And unlike news readers they are expected to project their personalities. The question here is how else should or could Naga Munchetty have reacted when discussing the US president's undeniably racist, sexist and flagrantly inaccurate comments? Not to have reacted in the measured, humane way she did would have left her looking like some kind of automaton, simply spouting whatever was coming down her earpiece. Invoking the letter of the guidelines is not an adequate response. An ill-considered kneejerk reaction to a single complaint is what has set this off, not Munchetty's entirely understandable comment. Peter Grimsdale Former BBC TV executive, London • There is some muddled thinking in the Hirsch/Henry et al letter (BBC's flawed Munchetty decision, Journal, 28 September). Of course future BBC journalists won't be hired on the basis of remaining \"impartial\" about their experience of racism. The BBC ruling states that Munchetty was justified in describing her feelings. Neither is racism to be endorsed as a legitimate opinion. But BBC journalists are required to avoid airing their political opinions or allowing them to influence the output. I understood that when I worked for the corporation, and did my best to train overseas journalists to do so when they came to work for the World Service. What puzzles me is how the editor or director of Breakfast could have allowed or encouraged Dan Walker to ambush Naga Munchetty live on air. That's where criticism should lie. And, as so often, the BBC shoots itself in the foot in the way it handles a complaint. Roger Harvey Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire • Well done. Appropriate and constructive criticism. Here is the continued text:\n\nIt's a shame that the BBC's handling of this complaint has led to a witch-hunt against Naga Munchetty, rather than a genuine discussion about the issues at hand. The corporation's failure to understand the context of her comments and the tone in which they were delivered has been widely criticized. The public is not asking for impartiality on issues of racism and sexism, but rather for honesty and empathy. It's time for the BBC to recognize this and to take a more nuanced approach to its editorial guidelines.",

        "Text": "The family that owns the ailing Wrightbus firm has faced death threats since it collapsed, a former company director said. More than 1,000 people lost their jobs when the Ballymena-based engineering coachbuilder and pioneer of the low-floor bus went into administration earlier this week. The failure of Wrightbus, which made the latest iteration of London's iconic red buses, represents the UK's second significant insolvency of the week, following the demise of the holiday group Thomas Cook. The company had been scrambling to find a buyer and an expected sale evaporated at the end of last week when the Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, pulled out of talks. Jeff Wright, the former director, called for an end to the intimidation. He said: \"There have been sinister developments involving threats to the life of Wright family members and I am asking all elected representatives and those with influence in the community to help end this intimidation and fear.\" Wright, who is the son of Wrightbus founder Sir William Wright, added: \"The closure of our family business has been devastating to our loyal and highly skilled workforce and the loss of the company my father and I have grown and nurtured for more than 70 years has been shattering for our family.\" \"Generations of families have worked alongside our own family over all these years and so this is deeply and personally felt by everyone. \"We are here to provide our administrators, Deloitte, with all information, order books, financial records and whatever is needed to establish a future plan for the bus manufacturing operation … Our commitment to supporting all efforts is unwavering.\" Boris Johnson ordered the distinctive red Routemaster London buses from Wrightbus during his time as mayor. Trade unionists have accused him of not doing enough to save the ailing firm, which suffered major cashflow problems and faced declining demand. The firm's collapse came after Johnson told parliament his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus. The news of the death threats has sent shockwaves through the community, with many expressing their outrage and disgust at the behavior. Local politicians have condemned the threats, with the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, stating that \"there is no place for intimidation or threats in our society\". The police have launched an investigation into the matter, and Wright has appealed to anyone with information to come forward.\n\nThe collapse of Wrightbus has also raised questions about the government's role in the company's demise. Critics have accused Boris Johnson of not doing enough to support the firm, despite his previous promises to help. The firm's decline was reportedly hastened by major cashflow problems and declining demand for its products. The UK's Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, has defended the government's actions, stating that they did everything they could to support Wrightbus, but ultimately the company's collapse was due to its own financial struggles.\n\nAs the investigation into the death threats continues, the focus will now turn to finding a buyer for Wrightbus's assets and ensuring that the skills and expertise of its workforce are not lost. The company's administrators, Deloitte, are working to identify potential buyers and have stated that they are confident that a sale can be completed quickly. The future of Wrightbus remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the collapse of this iconic British company is a devastating blow to its employees, the local community, and the industry as a whole.",

        "Text": "Fox News has apologized after a guest criticized the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg as a \"mentally ill Swedish child\". Appearing on Fox News on Monday, the rightwing commentator Michael Knowles launched an extraordinary attack on Thunberg, 16, who is campaigning in the US to urge action on the climate crisis. Knowles's swipe at Thunberg followed one from Laura Ingraham, one of Fox News's most prominent presenters, who compared Thunberg and other young climate activists to the characters in Stephen King's horror story Children of the Corn. Thunberg gave a blistering speech at the United Nations summit, criticizing world leaders for their \"betrayal\" of young people through a lack of action on the climate crisis. Knowles, a guest on Fox News's The Story, was invited to discuss Thunberg's speech and the climate crisis. He was dismissive of both. \"If it were about science it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left,\" Knowles said. The commentator Christopher Hahn, appearing on The Story to theoretically offer a liberal perspective, immediately criticized Knowles. \"Yeah, I mean, you're a grown man and you're attacking a child. Shame on you,\" Hahn said. A Fox News spokesperson subsequently told the Daily Beast: \"The comment made by Michael Knowles who was a guest on The Story tonight was disgraceful. We apologize to Greta Thunberg and to our viewers.\" Fox News told the Hollywood Reporter it had \"no plans\" to book Knowles as a guest in the future. The channel has not commented on Laura Ingraham's attack on Thunberg. Ingraham used her show The Ingraham Angle to suggest, incorrectly, that Thunberg wanted people to \"cede control of our economy, our way of life, our way of transport, how many children you want to have, and if we don't go along, we will be punished by our own children. The apology from Fox News came after a wave of backlash on social media, with many criticizing the network for allowing such a vile attack on a minor. The White House also weighed in, with Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham saying that the administration \"stands with Greta Thunberg\" and that \"her passion and commitment to the environment are inspiring.\" The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, also tweeted his support for Thunberg, saying that \"her courage and conviction are a powerful reminder of the urgent need for climate action.\" Meanwhile, Thunberg herself responded to the attacks on Twitter, saying that \"I'm not surprised by the reaction from Fox News\" and that \"I'm not going to let their lies and hate speech silence me.\" The incident has sparked a wider debate about the role of media in perpetuating climate denial and the importance of protecting children from online harassment. Many are calling for Fox News to take further action, including firing Knowles and Ingraham, and for the network to adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying and hate speech. As the climate crisis continues to dominate global headlines, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for action and the importance of standing up to those who seek to silence the voices of young climate activists like Thunberg.",

        "Text": "Britain's accountancy regulator is considering urgently whether to investigate the collapse of Thomas Cook and impose punishments if deemed necessary. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has the authority to investigate and sanction auditors of companies and individuals who are members of the accounting profession. The regulator announced it was considering an investigation after the government fast-tracked the Insolvency Service's investigation into the collapse of the 178-year-old travel firm. Thomas Cook's auditor is EY, which took over from PwC in 2017. Both are among the UK's so-called big four accountancy firms. The tour operator has had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years as its problems deepened. It has also faced questions about its accounting methods. Sten Daugaard took over as chief financial officer in December 2018 from Bill Scott, who quit after less than a year in the job after Thomas Cook issued a profit warning. Scott replaced Michael Healy in January 2018 when Healy stepped down after five years in the job. The FRC said: \"In light of recent developments at Thomas Cook we are considering whether there is any case for investigation and enforcement action as a matter of urgency and in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.\" Daugaard changed the way Thomas Cook reported its accounts to include items that had been treated as exceptional costs for several years, including when paying directors and meeting banking covenants. EY disagreed with the company's treatment of these items. In first-half results reported last November Thomas Cook recognised £28m of charges comprising a £14m write-off of payments from hotels and £14m of flight disruption and business transformation costs. Daugaard told analysts in November that when he had looked at the books \"one thing that I could immediately observe was the size of the exceptionals\". In May, the company reported a £1.5bn first-half loss and published its third profit warning in less than a year. It had £1.2bn of debt and was forced to write down the value of its MyTravel UK package holiday business by £1.1bn. The FRC's consideration of an investigation into Thomas Cook's collapse comes as the UK's accounting watchdog faces increased scrutiny over its role in regulating the profession. The regulator has been criticized for its handling of several high-profile accounting scandals in recent years, including the collapse of construction firm Carillion and the embezzlement scandal at engineering firm Rolls-Royce. If the FRC does decide to investigate Thomas Cook, it would be the first major probe into the collapse of a major UK company since the regulator was established in 2012. The investigation would likely focus on EY's auditing practices and whether the firm failed to adequately flag the travel firm's financial struggles. The FRC has the power to impose fines and other sanctions on auditors and accountants found to have breached professional standards. The regulator's consideration of an investigation into Thomas Cook's collapse is seen as a significant development, given the company's long history and its role as one of the UK's largest travel firms. The collapse of Thomas Cook has sent shockwaves through the travel industry, with thousands of jobs at risk and millions of customers left stranded abroad. The FRC's investigation would aim to determine whether EY's auditing practices contributed to the company's downfall and whether any other accounting irregularities were at play.",

Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who led the acquisition spree that saddled the company with more than £1bn of debt, was handed more than £17m in just over four years as boss of Thomas Cook, boosted by bonuses awarded for slashing 2,800 jobs following the merger with MyTravel. He quit in 2011 as the tour operator came close to collapse. His successor was Harriet Green, who was paid £4.7m for less than three years plus a share bonus worth a further £5.6m. She handed a third of that award to charities after the deaths of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning in Thomas Cook accommodation in Corfu. Green also claimed £80,000-a-year to cover her hotel bills at the five-star Brown's hotel in London, where she lived during the week. Peter Fankhauser, who was in charge when the company collapsed, was handed £8.3m, including £4.3m in bonuses. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called on Thomas Cook bosses to \"examine their consciences\", while the party's shadow minister of consumer affairs, Gill Furniss, called on the bosses to hand back their bonuses. Meanwhile, a group of international hedge funds who bet against Thomas Cook have made big profits from its collapse. Nearly 11% of the travel company's shares were 'shorted' ahead of its collapse. Short-sellers try to profit from firms they believe are in trouble. They borrow shares in a company, for a fee, and then sell them in the hope of buying them back at a lower price – and pocket the profit. As the news of the payouts spread, outrage mounted among the public and politicians alike. \"It's utterly scandalous that these executives, who were responsible for the collapse of the company, are walking away with millions while thousands of innocent people are left stranded and jobless,\" said McDonnell. Furniss added, \"These bonuses are a slap in the face to the thousands of Thomas Cook employees who have lost their jobs and the customers who have been left high and dry.\" The British government, which had provided financial support to Thomas Cook in its final days, also came under pressure to take action. \"We will be reviewing the situation and considering what further action we can take to ensure that those responsible for the collapse of Thomas Cook are held accountable,\" said a spokesperson. Meanwhile, the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, announced an investigation into the collapse of Thomas Cook, including the role of the hedge funds that had bet against the company. As the fallout continued, the public's trust in the corporate world was shaken, and calls for greater accountability and transparency grew louder.",

The group is investing £6.3m on upgrading production at its two UK factories to produce alternatives to single-use plastic, which include recyclable paperboard as well as wraps and boxes. It said the switch would help it eliminate 850 tonnes of plastic each year – the same weight as 425 black cabs, 67 double-decker buses or 10 blue whales. This includes removing 250 tonnes of plastic rings previously used to hold packs of beer cans together (117m plastic rings in total) and 600 tonnes of shrink film, mostly used as extra packaging around trays when shipping. Part of AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer, the group has some of the UK's biggest beer brands in its portfolio, including Beck's, Bud Light, Budweiser, Corona, Michelob Ultra and Stella Artois, and manufactures more than 870m cans a year. Paula Lindenberg, the president of Budweiser Brewing Group UK & Ireland, said: \"This announcement ensures that the UK's favourite beers will soon come in recyclable paperboard packaging, so consumers can make better choices. We're proud of the work we've already done but we realised more needed to be done to address the issue of single-use plastics.\" The brewer is also switching to 100% locally sourced barley and 100% renewable electricity from solar power. It hopes the removal of plastic rings from all its UK products, including the Stella Artois pint can four-pack – the biggest selling small pack format – will have a significant impact in removing plastic from supermarket beer shelves. Plastic pack rings, known in the industry as hi-cones or yokes, are used to hold together multipacks of canned drinks, particularly beer. The company's commitment to sustainability is expected to have a significant impact on the environment, with the elimination of single-use plastic rings and shrink film reducing waste and pollution. The switch to recyclable paperboard packaging will also make it easier for consumers to recycle their packaging. The brewer is also working to reduce its carbon footprint by using 100% renewable electricity from solar power and sourcing 100% of its barley from local suppliers. This move is part of the company's broader efforts to reduce its environmental impact and meet the growing demand for sustainable products. By phasing out single-use plastic packaging, Budweiser is taking a major step towards reducing plastic waste and promoting a more circular economy. The company's efforts are expected to set a new standard for the brewing industry and inspire other companies to follow suit.",

Guests at the Orangers hotel in the coastal town of Hammamet spoke of being locked inside their resort on Saturday until a 6,000 Tunisian dinar (£1,680) fee was paid before they were allowed to leave for their flight, or even to visit a shop. Those buses that arrived to transport holidaymakers to the airport at Enfidha were turned away by security, Orangers guests told the Guardian. Thomas Cook customers Maddie Clamp, 26, and her boyfriend, Shaun Holmes, 30, from Derby described how they had been locked within their holiday complex as management, apparently wrong-footed by the news of the travel giant's financial troubles, tried to secure payment from their guests. \"They wouldn't even let us out of the hotel,\" Holmes said. \"The Thomas Cook rep said he'd contacted the chief of police [about their situation].\" However, by Sunday the standoff had been resolved and guests were allowed to leave. Holidaymakers said a local representative from Thomas Cook had worked late into the night before returning on Sunday morning to again deal with guests' urgent queries. The company said on Sunday any guests who had paid the hotel had been refunded. \"We are aware that a small number of customers were asked to pay for their hotel room before leaving Les Orangers in Tunisia [on Saturday]. This has now been resolved and customers flew home as planned. We continue to support our customers in all our resorts,\" said a Thomas Cook spokesperson. Lynn and Peter Taylor from Newcastle, who had travelled to Tunisia with Thomas Cook, said guests leaving the hotel had been asked for extra payment. \"Those who were due to leave today had letters slipped under their door,\" said Lynn Taylor. \"The hotel was asking for 6,000 TD. I think one old lady paid it. We're not.\" As the standoff continued, guests grew increasingly frustrated and anxious, with some describing the situation as \"traumatic\" and \"humiliating\". \"It was like being held hostage,\" said Sarah Jones, 32, from Manchester. \"We were told we couldn't leave the hotel until we paid the extra fee. It was like they were trying to intimidate us.\" Many guests were also worried about missing their flights, which were scheduled to depart later that day. \"I was getting really stressed about my flight,\" said Mark Davis, 41, from London. \"I was trying to get some information from the Thomas Cook rep, but they just kept saying they were doing everything they could to resolve the situation.\" Despite the tensions, some guests were more understanding of the hotel's position, recognizing that the financial difficulties faced by Thomas Cook were outside of their control. \"I think the hotel was just trying to protect itself,\" said Rachel Lee, 28, from Birmingham. \"I wouldn't have paid the extra fee, but I can see why they would want to do it.\" In the end, the standoff was resolved and all guests were able to leave the hotel and make their flights as planned. However, the incident has left many with a lasting impression of the challenges faced by Thomas Cook and its customers in the wake of its financial struggles.",

        "Text": "A home affairs public servant has complained to parliament that the department's whistleblowing scheme is flawed after it failed to independently investigate a report about a staffing incident involving a home affairs senior executive. The anonymous and heavily redacted submission to the Senate committee examining press freedom states that a public interest disclosure (PID) was made after staff became aware of an issue with hiring practices involving a senior executive within the department in 2017. But the report was sent back to the department rather than being investigated independently. It is unclear from the submission what ultimately happened with the investigation. The government has frequently proclaimed the public interest disclosure avenue for government whistleblowers is the proper process for reporting issues rather than leaking to the media. The home affairs secretary, Michael Pezzullo, has made clear the department would seek to investigate and prosecute public servants who leak sensitive information to the public. Pezzullo has said officers within the department are trained that they have three options for reporting issues: internal disclosure within the department; to the ombudsman; or to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (Aclei). The submission makes clear the public servant made inquiries with Aclei and went to the ombudsman, but the matter was handled internally. \"A PID report was made to the [Commonwealth] Ombudsman rather than an internal report, obviously given the sensitivity of the information related to [a senior executive],\" the unredacted portion of the submission about the incident states. But the ombudsman referred the matter back to the department, which assigned an executive level 1 (EL1) assistant director to investigate, the submission said. There was no communication with the whistleblower for four months about the investigation. The submission also expressed frustration that the investigation was handled internally, with the whistleblower receiving no updates on the status of the investigation for four months. \"It is unacceptable that the department, in its capacity as both investigator and subject of the PID, would handle the investigation internally, without providing any communication or updates to the whistleblower,\" the submission states.\n\nThe whistleblower's anonymity was also compromised, as the department's investigation was carried out by an executive level 1 (EL1) assistant director, who was likely aware of the whistleblower's identity. The submission notes that this raises concerns about the potential for retaliation against the whistleblower.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the effectiveness of the public interest disclosure scheme, which is designed to protect whistleblowers who report wrongdoing within government agencies. Critics have long argued that the scheme is flawed, and that whistleblowers are often left vulnerable to retaliation and intimidation.\n\nThe submission's revelations have sparked a fresh debate about the need for stronger protections for whistleblowers, and for greater transparency and accountability within government agencies. Opposition parties have called for an inquiry into the incident, and for the government to take immediate action to strengthen the public interest disclosure scheme.\n\nIn a statement, the Home Affairs Secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said that the department takes all allegations of wrongdoing seriously, and that it is committed to investigating and addressing any concerns raised by whistleblowers. However, the submission's revelations have raised concerns that the department's internal investigation may have been compromised, and that whistleblowers may not have the level of protection they need to report wrongdoing safely.",

        "Text": "Marks & Spencer will start offering a \"buy now, pay later\" service on its website next month as it tries to attract younger customers and boost trade going into the key Christmas period. The retailer has teamed up with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders of more than £30 in interest-free instalments. The Australian firm and its better known rival Klarna are among a wave of fintech companies being embraced by millennials on tight budgets. Many of M&S's rivals, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shopper, including families with young children. M&S said its customers were increasingly looking for ways to spread the cost, particularly of larger purchases. The Clearpay service enables customers to spread the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800 and does not require a credit application and customers can manage their payments through a phone app. Unlike traditional high street credit products. these fintech firms typically make money by earning commission on the sales transaction itself rather than charging shoppers interest, although some also offer interest-bearing products. Shoppers using the plans typically spend more, more often, making it an attractive proposition for a retailer such as M&S where clothing sales are in decline. More than 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports and Boohoo, work with Klarna which says it is more than 3 million British customers. Clearpay, which only launched in the UK three months ago, says it had gained more than 200,000 active customers in the first 15 weeks of trading. The move is part of M&S's efforts to revamp its online shopping experience and appeal to a younger demographic. The retailer has been struggling to attract customers in recent years, with its clothing sales declining by 5.7% in the first half of the year. In contrast, online retailers such as Asos and Boohoo have seen their sales soar, driven by their ability to offer flexible payment options and fast delivery. By partnering with Clearpay, M&S hopes to tap into this trend and attract a new generation of shoppers who are used to paying for things online. The retailer has also been investing in its e-commerce platform, with plans to roll out a new website later this year. In addition to the \"buy now, pay later\" service, M&S is also offering free delivery and extended returns periods to make online shopping more appealing to customers. The retailer hopes that these initiatives will help to drive sales and boost its fortunes in the crucial Christmas trading period. With the holiday season just around the corner, M&S is under pressure to deliver a strong performance and prove that it can still compete with its online rivals.",

We were told that it was our new provider, but not the reason behind it. Since our direct debit was also automatically transferred, we continued to pay and didn't think further about it. It was only when I notified Castle Water we were moving that I found out they thought we were a commercial customer. We are a family of two adults and a baby. After receiving assurances that the mistake would be rectified and that Thames would claim the money we've paid to Castle, we received two bills for almost £1,000 from Thames Water. We have not received any refunds from Castle Water so this would mean paying for our water twice. I have also sent an inquiry to the Consumer Council for Water but have received no reply yet. Our first complaint was in mid July 2019 and I haven't heard from Thames Water for at least two weeks. GC, London SW6 You are one of many unwittingly caught up in the acquisition of Thames Water's (supposed) business accounts by Castle Water, which describes itself as a dedicated water retailer to business customers. Castle Water started in Scotland, but has since bought up a number of other water businesses across the UK. Clearly the reason for the transfer of accounts was not clearly communicated in your case. Our intervention seems to have broken the logjam. Thames Water says an admin error meant your property was listed as being non-household rather than domestic so when it sold the non-household customer base to Castle Water you were switched, too. Thames insists: \"We're sorry for any confusion but are investigating how this has occurred. Thames Water's explanation of an administrative error raises more questions than answers. \"How could a family of three, including a baby, be mistakenly listed as a non-household customer?\" I ask. The company's response only adds to my frustration. \"We understand that this has caused inconvenience and we're working to resolve the issue as soon as possible,\" a spokesperson says. But what about the £1,000 bill I've received? And what about the refunds promised by Castle Water? \"We're looking into this and will provide a response shortly,\" the spokesperson adds. Meanwhile, I'm left to wonder how many other families are facing similar issues as a result of this botched transfer. The Consumer Council for Water has finally responded to my inquiry, but only to acknowledge receipt of my complaint. I'm still waiting for a resolution to this debacle.",

Some specialist processing plants that require additional seasonal labour for hand-finished products are already struggling to meet orders, according to the National Pig Association (NPA), which represents processors, abattoirs and farmers. Most meat processing plants have labour shortages equivalent to up to 15% of their required workforces, as the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 referendum has combined with uncertainty about residential status, according to the Grocer trade journal. But the labour shortage at seasonal specialists could be as much as 30% because they usually increase their workforce by up to 15% at this time of year, says the British Meat Processors Association. Ed Barker, senior policy advisor of the NPA, said several processors who relied on regular semi-skilled labourers from Europe had said they were struggling to fulfil orders ahead of Christmas. \"It was difficult last year and the year before but it seems to be particularly squeezed this year. The shortage of seasonal labor is particularly concerning for the meat industry, as many of these hand-finished products are in high demand during the holiday season. The National Pig Association estimates that up to 30% of the workforce at some specialist processing plants is missing, which could lead to a significant reduction in production. The British Meat Processors Association warns that this shortage could have a ripple effect throughout the supply chain, impacting the availability of festive food staples. Industry insiders are urging the government to take immediate action to address the issue, including providing support for businesses to recruit and train local workers. In the meantime, consumers may face higher prices or reduced product availability, which could dampen the holiday spirit. As the clock ticks down to Christmas, the meat industry is bracing for a potential crisis, and only time will tell if they can overcome these labor shortages to deliver the festive foods we all love.",

Additionally, most dishwashers have safety features to prevent overheating and electrical malfunctions. Your partner may be overcautious, but it's also possible that she's concerned about the environmental impact of leaving devices on standby, which can contribute to standby power consumption.

Its chief executive Ewan Venters said sales in the territory were running at only half the level expected since it opened its doors last week but he was optimistic that trade would improve with its restaurant – with its view of Hong Kong harbour – receiving 4,000 bookings for December. It is the first standalone Fortnum & Mason shop outside the UK. \"Hong Kong is going to bounce back and be a strong business for us,\" said Venters, who reported shoppers spending up to HK$7,000 (£694) on gourmet treats such as smoked salmon and caviar. Asked about the wisdom of opening in the troubled city, he said: \"It's not our place to get overly political. We are an English brand that goes out into the world to sell tea, biscuits and jam.\" The retailer, which was founded in 1707 by William Fortnum, a royal footman, and his landlord Hugh Mason, also has concessions in Lane Crawford department stores in Hong Kong as well as Isetan Mitsukoshi in Japan and Shinsegae in South Korea. It is best known for its flagship store on Piccadilly in central London. Profits at the department store, which is owned by the Weston family – who also control furniture chain Heals and Primark owner Associated British Foods – rose 26% to £12m in the year to July 2019. Despite the challenges in Hong Kong, Venters expressed confidence in the brand's ability to adapt and thrive in the face of uncertainty. \"We're a resilient business, and we've faced many challenges over the centuries,\" he said. \"We're not deterred by the current situation in Hong Kong. We're committed to making it a success.\" The retailer is also exploring opportunities to expand its online presence in the region, with plans to launch a localized e-commerce platform in the coming months. Meanwhile, the company's flagship store on Piccadilly remains a popular destination for tourists and locals alike, with sales of its iconic tea and biscuits continuing to soar. With its rich history and commitment to quality, Fortnum & Mason is well-positioned to weather any storm, and its loyal customer base is expected to continue driving growth and profitability in the years to come.",

Far better to accept that it is normal for everyone to work at different speeds, and to give everyone the time they need to do the task. This might entail specifying an average time for each exam, with all candidates given the option of, say, an additional 30% if they feel they need that time. This would appear to be in the spirit of the Equality Act 2010, where educational institutions are required to \"advance equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and people who do not share it\". This approach would not only benefit students with special educational needs, but also those who may be struggling with anxiety or other mental health issues that affect their ability to complete exams within a strict time frame. It would also acknowledge that intelligence and abilities are not solely measured by speed, but by depth of understanding and thoughtfulness.

The investment is being made by Inter Ikea Group, the owner of the Ikea brand which is operated by a string of franchise businesses, the largest of which is Ingka Group. Inter Ikea Group said its €200m investment would be released in two phases. The first phase of €100m would be directed towards new renewable energy projects including heating, cooling and electricity generation. The group said investment would be in partnership with suppliers and directed towards parts of its supply chain where converting to renewable energy was more difficult – such as the textile industry, ceramics and glass production. The second tranche will be aimed at removing and storing carbon through reforestation and responsible forest management. Ikea said it was considering a variety of global regions for reforestation projects. The group statement said: \"It is most likely that we will put an emphasis on projects in tropical and subtropical regions. This is because there is a vast amount of degraded land in need of reforestation, and forests in these regions grow faster making it possible to remove more carbon from the atmosphere.\" Ingka Group, which has previously laid out plans to spend at least €3bn on sustainability investments, said this week that since 2009, it had pumped close to €2.5bn into renewable energy.

The retro formatting greeted ABC readers on Wednesday morning, along with news that Julia Gillard was still the prime minister, Lady Gaga had just performed in Sydney and the Australian dollar was nearly at parity with the US. On TV the ABC Breakfast program broadcast 15 seconds of a still image of a chicken, though it was unclear whether this was due to the power cut. By 10am AEDT, the entire online news front page was down. But those who had earlier visited the main news front page saw the archived homepages.

But those that weren't redirected to mobile or who manually clicked to the desktop version could glimpse a version of the site from the start of the decade. The business front page, for example, had the headline: \"Carbon, mining taxes won't stop investment.\" On the entertainment page, readers were told that Lady Gaga had \"surprised Sydney fans with two shows\". Below that was the question: \"Oprah to host Oscars?\" At 10am AEDT, the front page was down entirely. An error message told readers: \"WEBSITE OUTAGE. We are currently experiencing a technical outage which means we are unable to provide our usual service.\" The Ultimo building was plunged into darkness and ABC News Mornings host Joe O'Brien and many of his colleagues prepared their morning briefings in an eerie half-light.

The ABC's technical teams worked tirelessly to resolve the issue, with staff members taking to social media to apologize for the inconvenience and provide updates on the situation. The outage was later attributed to a faulty electrical circuit in the Ultimo building, which caused the main power supply to fail. Despite the setback, the ABC's online news platform was back up and running by mid-morning, with a revamped homepage featuring a sleek new design and improved functionality. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of having robust backup systems in place, and the ABC vowed to take steps to prevent such outages from happening in the future. In the meantime, staff members were left to ponder the nostalgic value of the 2011-era headlines and wondered what other retro gems the ABC's archives might hold.",

By Monday, at least one of the suspended workers said she had been fired, with reports that three other Google staffers had also been let go. Rebecca Rivers, a software engineer at Google who had been involved with internal protests against Google's work with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced her firing on Twitter on Monday afternoon. Three other Google staffers were also fired on Monday, according to an internal company memo obtained by Bloomberg. Leaders of Google's security and investigations team said in the memo the firings were due to \"clear and repeated violations of our data security policies\". Google confirmed the accuracy of the memo published by Bloomberg but declined to comment further. The firings prompted immediate allegations of retaliation from current and former Google employees. ﻿One of the organizers of the walkout, Meredith Whittaker, called Rivers's firing \"craven retaliation\" in a tweet. Stephanie Parker, a current YouTube employee, called the terminations \"inhumane\" and \"illegal\" on Twitter. \"I'm still here, still fighting, and not afraid,\" she tweeted. Whittaker and another organizer of the walkout, Claire Stapleton, both left Google this summer after alleging that they had been retaliated against by management. At the rally on Friday, Rivers had said that she had been questioned by the investigations team about her involvement with a petition calling on Google not to provide services to CBP, as well as her social media usage. \"I'm proud of what I did,\" she said. The news of the firings sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with many employees and activists expressing outrage and solidarity with the terminated workers. The firings also sparked renewed calls for Google to address allegations of retaliation against employees who speak out against company policies or practices.\n\nOn social media, current and former Google employees shared stories of their own experiences with retaliation, using the hashtag #DoNoHarm to highlight the company's supposed commitment to \"don't be evil.\" The hashtag, which originated from Google's corporate motto, was originally used to promote diversity and inclusion, but has since been co-opted by employees to demand accountability from management.\n\nThe firings also drew attention from outside the company, with advocacy groups and lawmakers weighing in on the controversy. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a statement calling on Google to \"respect the rights of its employees to speak out on issues of public concern\" and to \"cease any retaliatory actions against workers who exercise their right to free speech.\"\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers in Congress are calling for an investigation into Google's handling of employee activism and alleged retaliation. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of Google's handling of employee activism, tweeted that the firings were \"a clear example of retaliation against workers who are trying to make a difference.\"\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, Google employees are left wondering if their voices will be silenced by management's attempts to quash dissent. The firings have sparked a renewed sense of urgency among employees to demand greater transparency and accountability from the company, and to fight for their right to speak out against policies and practices that they believe are harmful or unethical.",

The 4ft bronze of a defiant youngster, hands on hips facing down the status quo, has been dismissed as a cynical marketing stunt and celebrated as a selfie-friendly symbol of a new feminism. Now she is at the center of a court battle aimed at stopping her marching across the world. The original Fearless Girl appeared overnight in March 2017, the day before International Women's Day, in downtown New York. Facing off against the Charging Bull statue close to Wall Street, the sculpture was commissioned by State Street Global, an asset management company, to promote a fund investing in gender-diverse companies. It became an instant hit. Crowds gathered to take selfies. The Massachusetts Ssenator Elizabeth Warren, a longtime critic of Wall Street and a frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was one of the celebrities to use the statue to promote her policies. Sculptor Kristen Visbal has since made several copies of Fearless Girls that now stand resolutely in cities including London and Oslo. But on Monday, State Street made its latest attempt to stop the Fearless Girl from spreading further, moving to have a statue removed from Federation Square in Melbourne. In a lawsuit against Maurice Blackburn, the Australian personal injury firm that commissioned the Melbourne piece, State Street argues the replicas violate its trademark and dilute the company's message. According to the New York Times, David Studdy, a lawyer for the company, said Maurice Blackburn had \"used the campaign to promote itself or themselves by tying the name of Fearless Girl to themselves\". State Street has also sued Visbal, the sculptor, for making other copies, again claiming trademark violations. Visbal's lawyers say State's Street's moves are designed to \"rob her of making a living from her art\". The lawsuit has sparked outrage among fans of the Fearless Girl, who see the statue as a powerful symbol of female empowerment and resistance. \"It's ridiculous that State Street is trying to control the message of the Fearless Girl,\" said Sarah Thompson, a Melbourne resident who has visited the statue multiple times. \"The message is about being fearless and taking a stand, not about promoting a specific investment fund.\" The controversy has also drawn attention to the commercialization of art and the tension between artistic expression and corporate interests. As the legal battle continues, the Fearless Girl remains a potent symbol of defiance and determination, inspiring people around the world to take a stand and demand change.",

There has been outrage on social media over attempts by universities to warn students off joining picket lines and encourage them to report any of their lecturers who strike.

Their choice to strike has the full support of the National Union of Students (NUS) – but not all students have come out in favour of the action. Unfortunately, I've heard many fellow students criticise the decision of lecturers to go on strike. Within a few hours after the industrial action was announced, a petition was launched calling for lost contact hours to be reimbursed. Many are worried that the eight-day period may impact their end of term grades. They reason that they're paying tuition fees, so they should expect a full term of teaching. Of course, losing valuable time is frustrating for the one million students who could be affected. But the frustration is mutual among staff and students. Both feel that universities are being turned into businesses that are impersonal and poorly run. We should not direct our anger towards lecturers, but rather to the institutions forcing them to strike. It's not as if our tuition fees all go to our tutors. Academics' pay has fallen by 17% in real terms since 2009. More than half are estimated to be on temporary contracts, and this precariousness only adds to the daily stress of teaching. A recent report found an \"epidemic\" of poor mental health among higher education staff. Meanwhile, the UCU reports a 15% gender pay gap, and pensions have also shrunk after changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). With our tutors working in these conditions, how can students expect to get the best out of them? As NUS vice president Claire Sosienski-Smith put it: \"Students won't be happy about having to miss lectures, but they're not happy about studying in institutions where their staff are underpaid and overworked.\" It isn't really true that this strike will damage our university careers. The strike is not about disrupting the academic year, but about fighting for fair pay and decent working conditions. It's about recognizing the value of our tutors' hard work and dedication, rather than treating them like commodities. Many students may not realize that the majority of university staff are not paid a living wage, and that the cost of living in the UK has increased significantly over the past decade. The strike is also about challenging the marketization of higher education, which has led to a focus on research and recruitment over teaching and student welfare. As the UCU's national officer, Matt Waddelow, pointed out, \"Universities are not just about producing graduates, but about creating a community of learning and knowledge-sharing.\" By supporting the strike, students can help to reclaim their universities as places of intellectual curiosity and debate, rather than just commercial enterprises. Ultimately, the strike is not just about the lecturers' demands, but about creating a fairer and more sustainable future for all students and staff.",

Figures released by the central bank showed that party planners racked up a bill of £96,188 on the event, which hosted nearly 2,500 staff and their families at the Bank's sports club in Roehampton, south-west London in July. Costs for the annual party – known as Governors' Day – included more than £52,200 on food and soft drinks and nearly £30,000 on family entertainment, which in 2018 involved a treasure hunt, bake-off competition, fun run and bouncy castle. That was on top of nearly £2,000 for equipment and £12,000 for \"other\" undisclosed expenses. The total is slightly higher than the £95,673 spent on Governors' Day in 2018, and while the increase is marginal – about £515 – it will raise questions over whether the bank is serious about reviewing its costs. In May, members of the Bank's board, known at as the Court of Directors, were grilled by MPs over expenses including the summer party bill. Dorothy Thompson, a Court director and former Drax chief executive, defended the party but said the Bank was looking to rein in spending. \"This is an annual event. The cost is £40 per head. There is no alcohol funded. And it is the one large offsite for the institution. But it must be said, as we are stressing, more and more, cost competitiveness and cost control, it is one of the things that is under review,\" she said. The Bank has already planned to shut its 32-acre sports ground to staff and lease it to a commercial operator in a bid to cut costs. The Bank of England's decision to review its costs has been met with skepticism by some, who argue that the institution's commitment to fiscal responsibility is being undermined by lavish spending on events like Governors' Day. \"It's hypocritical for the Bank to be lecturing the government on the need for austerity while splurging on parties and entertainment for its own staff,\" said Rachel Reeves, a Labour MP who has been critical of the Bank's expenses. \"The Bank needs to take a long, hard look at its spending habits and prioritize its core mission of monetary policy over lavish events.\"\n\nThe Bank's decision to lease its sports ground to a commercial operator has been met with resistance from some staff, who are concerned about the impact on their recreational activities. \"The sports ground is a vital part of our culture and well-being,\" said one Bank employee. \"It's not just about the money, it's about the sense of community and camaraderie that comes from being able to use the facilities. I hope the Bank will reconsider its decision and find a way to keep the sports ground open to staff.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the Bank's spending, many staff members have defended the summer party, arguing that it is a valuable opportunity for employees to bond and relax with their families. \"It's a chance for us to take a break from the stress of our jobs and have some fun with our colleagues,\" said one staff member. \"I think it's a great event and I'm grateful that the Bank makes an effort to bring us all together like this.\" The Bank's decision to review its costs is likely to be closely watched by MPs and the public, who will be eager to see if the institution can strike a balance between fiscal responsibility and employee morale.",

He acted for me in one exercise based on a short script that I had written and was a joy to work with – I always thought he could have made a good career as an actor, although maybe he should have been a diplomat. There was a determined feminist on the course who repeatedly challenged one of the lecturers, who was undeniably \"old school\". He was telling us how to light a woman so she looked \"soft and feminine\" and how to emphasise a man's jaw-line to make him \"look strong\". The determined feminist, whose name I've long forgotten, wouldn't let his sexist remarks go unchallenged. She pointed out that such advice was not only outdated but also perpetuated harmful gender stereotypes. Diarmuid, ever the diplomat, stepped in to mediate the situation, listening to both sides and finding a way to diffuse the tension. His calm and respectful approach earned him the respect of everyone in the room, including the lecturer. As we left the course, I remember thinking that Diarmuid's kindness and empathy would serve him well in his future endeavors, and I was right. He went on to become a renowned documentary filmmaker, known for his thought-provoking and compassionate storytelling.",

For the last several years, they have been teased and baffled by mysterious bursts of radio waves from the distant universe: pops of low-frequency radiation, emitting more energy than the sun does in a day, that occur randomly and disappear immediately. Nobody knows when these \"fast radio bursts,\" or F.R.B.s, will occur, or where exactly in the cosmos they are occurring. More than 60 of these surprise broadcasts have been recorded so far. About the only thing astronomers agree on is that these signals probably are not extraterrestrials saying hello. So it was big news a year ago when scientists found a repeating radio burster and tracked it to a dwarf galaxy 3 billion light-years from Earth. Subsequent observations suggested that the burst was generated by extremely powerful magnetic fields, most likely ruling out lasers from alien spaceships. But the discovery of the repeating burst has also raised more questions than answers. \"We're still trying to understand what's causing these events,\" said Dr. Sarah Burke, lead researcher on the project. \"The magnetic field theory is promising, but we need more data to confirm it. We're working to develop new telescopes and technologies to help us better detect and study these enigmatic signals.\" Despite the challenges, scientists are undeterred, driven by the thrill of the unknown and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries. As Dr. Burke noted, \"Fast radio bursts are a window into the universe's most extreme environments, and we're eager to see what secrets they might reveal.\"",

The company on Monday announced a series of executive changes that could set the stage for the next generation of leaders at a media empire that includes the NBC broadcast network; Universal Film Studios; and cable channels such as Bravo and MSNBC, which has seen a ratings surge during the Trump administration. Stephen B. Burke, the chief executive, streamlined the management structure by putting Jeff Shell in charge of Hollywood operations, including the international business and Telemundo, and having Mark Lazarus oversee the broadcast network, the news division, the cable networks and the sports group. Bonnie Hammer, 68, the longtime head of the company's profitable cable portfolio, has been put in charge of an advertising-supported streaming service that was announced Monday and is expected to debut early next year. It will compete with new stand-alone streaming products from the Walt Disney Company and AT&T's WarnerMedia, as well as entrenched players like Netflix and Hulu. Disney's and WarnerMedia's products are expected to debut at the end of this year. Many in the industry interpreted the moves as Mr. Burke's positioning a showdown between Mr. Lazarus and Mr. Mr. Shell for the top spot at NBCUniversal. Both executives are seen as potential successors to Mr. Burke, who has been CEO since 2009. The shake-up comes as the media industry undergoes a significant transformation, with streaming services gaining popularity and traditional TV viewing habits declining. NBCUniversal's new streaming service is expected to offer a range of content, including original programming, TV shows, and movies, as well as a library of classic titles. The company is also investing heavily in its digital presence, with plans to expand its online offerings and improve its mobile apps.

But about three-fourths of Facebook users were unaware that the company lists their personal traits and interests for advertisers on its site, according to a study published by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday. Half of the users who looked at the Facebook page with that data -- known as their \"Ad Preferences\" -- said they were not comfortable with the company's compiling that information. Pew conducted a nationally representative survey of 963 American adults with Facebook accounts between Sept. 4 and Oct. 1 of last year. While consumers have learned more in recent years about how they are targeted for online ads, the study suggests that many still do not know how much of their behavior is tracked, where it is compiled or even that Facebook has a page that lists all of that information. Pew focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, because it \"plays an incredibly important role in the media ecosystem of the world,\" said Lee Rainie, Pew's director of internet and technology research. \"Privacy matters to Americans -- it's a classic American value -- yet when they're online and doing other things, they act as if their personal information is O.K.

Relations between its workers' union, the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, and the paper's owner, Block Communications, have been tense. Things came to a head on the night of Feb. 9, when John R.

According to several journalists who were present, Mr. Block threatened employees' jobs as his young daughter, whom he had brought with him, sobbed and begged him to stop.

Mr. Burris, who wrote the \"Reason as Racism\" editorial, according to Mr. Block, was in charge of the editorial pages at The Post-Gazette and its sibling paper, The Toledo Blade in Ohio, at the time of his appointment. The appointment of Mr. Burris, a veteran journalist with a reputation for being a strong leader, was seen as a move to stabilize the newsroom and improve morale. However, many employees were still reeling from the publisher's outburst and the subsequent tension in the newsroom. In a meeting with staff on Tuesday, Mr. Burris acknowledged the turmoil and vowed to work towards healing the rift. \"We are a team, and we need to work together to produce the best possible journalism,\" he said.

They blaze through the sky at about 107,000 miles per hour and explode about 55 miles up in the planet's atmosphere. The Lyrids shower comes from Comet Thatcher, which journeys around the sun about every 415 years. As the Lyrids meteor shower reaches its peak, astronomers are predicting a moderate rate of 10-20 meteors per hour, with the brightest ones potentially leaving glowing trails across the sky. While the moon's presence may make it more challenging to view the peak, the shower's early morning timing should provide a decent window for stargazers.

This increased consumption may help the forest cycle nutrients faster, and benefit the whole ecosystem. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. Researchers believe that the parasitic worm, known as Oesophagostomum circumcinctum, may be playing a crucial role in the forest's nutrient cycle. The worm's presence in the beetles' bodies may be stimulating their appetite, causing them to consume more wood and break it down more efficiently. This, in turn, could be releasing more nutrients into the soil, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem. The study's findings have sparked interest among scientists, who are now eager to explore the potential benefits of parasitic relationships in other ecosystems. \"It's a fascinating example of how what might seem like a parasitic relationship can actually have a positive impact on the host and the environment,\" said Dr. Emily Chen, lead author of the study.",

The move by James Bennet, who is considered a contender to succeed Dean Baquet as The Times's executive editor, was long anticipated. Michael Bennet has served for a decade in the Senate and had earlier signaled interest in a presidential bid. It is unusual for the chief of a newspaper's Opinion section to withdraw from a topic that is certain to dominate the global news conversation over the next 18 months. This decision is a clear demonstration of James Bennet's commitment to maintaining the highest standards of journalistic integrity and avoiding any potential conflicts of interest. As the editorial page editor, Bennet's role is crucial in shaping the newspaper's opinion on various issues, and by recusing himself, he ensures that his personal relationships do not influence his professional judgment. The Times' readers can be assured that the editorial page will continue to provide balanced and unbiased coverage of the 2020 presidential election, despite James Bennet's familial connection to one of the candidates. The move is also seen as a positive step towards rebuilding trust in the media, as the public increasingly demands transparency and accountability from news organizations.",

The resulting meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse. The next shower you might be able to see is known as the Eta Aquariids. Active between April 19 and May 28, the show peaks around Sunday night into Monday morning, or May 5-6. The moon will be close to new, which could make for good viewing in places with clear skies. The Eta Aquariids are one of two meteor showers from Halley's comet. Its sister shower, the Orionids, will peak in October. Specks from the Eta Aquariids streak through the sky at about 148,000 miles per hour, making it one of the fastest meteor showers. Its display is better seen from the Southern Hemisphere where people normally enjoy between 20 and 30 meteors per hour during its peak. The Northern Hemisphere tends to see about half as many. However, stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere should not be discouraged. While the numbers may be lower, the Eta Aquariids can still put on a spectacular show. To increase your chances of spotting a meteor, find a dark location with minimal light pollution and give your eyes at least 20 minutes to adjust to the darkness. Dress warmly and bring a comfortable chair or blanket to make the experience more enjoyable. Don't forget to make a wish when you see a shooting star! The Eta Aquariids are a rare treat, and with clear skies and a little luck, you might just catch a glimpse of the celestial spectacle. So mark your calendars for Sunday night into Monday morning and get ready to make some astronomical wishes.",

The cats are among nearly 500,000 land species whose survival is now in question because of threats to their natural habitats, according to a report on Monday by the United Nations. The Sundarbans, 4,000 square miles of marshy land in Bangladesh and India, hosts the world's largest mangrove forest and a rich ecosystem supporting several hundred animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. But 70 percent of the land is just a few feet above sea level, and grave changes are in store for the region, Australian and Bangladeshi researchers reported in the journal Science of The Total Environment. Changes wrought by a warming planet will be \"enough to decimate\" the few hundred or so Bengal tigers remaining there. \"By 2070, there will be no suitable tiger habitats remaining in the Bangladesh Sundarbans,\" concluded the study by 10 researchers. The paper, which relies on climate scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for its simulation models, adds to existing studies that offered similarly grim predictions for wildlife in the Sundarbans. In 2010, a study led by the World Wide Fund for Nature projected that a sea level rise of 11 inches could reduce the number of tigers in the Sundarbans by 96 percent within a few decades. Climate change has already harmed almost half of the world's endangered mammals, far more than previously thought, a recent study found. Sharif A. Mukul, lead author of the new report on the Sundarbans, and his colleagues looked for risks to the tiger beyond sea level rise, which accounted for 5.4 percent to 11.3 percent of the projected habitat loss in 2050 and 2070. Other factors related to climate change were more damaging to the Sundarbans' tigers, one of the largest remaining populations of wild tigers in the world, the researchers found. Since the early 1900s, habitat loss, hunting and the illegal trade of animal parts have decimated the global population of tigers from around 100,000 to fewer than 4,000. The researchers also highlighted the impact of increased cyclone frequency and intensity, which can cause extensive damage to the mangrove forest and disrupt the delicate ecosystem. \"Cyclones are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, and this will have a devastating impact on the Sundarbans,\" said Dr. Mukul. \"The combination of sea level rise, increased cyclone frequency, and habitat destruction will be catastrophic for the Bengal tigers.\" The study's findings have sparked concerns among conservationists and policymakers, who are urging immediate action to protect the Sundarbans and its inhabitants. \"We need to take immediate and drastic measures to mitigate the effects of climate change on the Sundarbans,\" said Dr. Ravi Chellam, a conservation biologist at the World Wildlife Fund. \"This includes protecting the mangrove forest, reducing carbon emissions, and supporting the local communities that depend on the Sundarbans for their livelihoods.\" The fate of the Bengal tigers and the Sundarbans ecosystem hangs in the balance, and the world is watching with bated breath as the clock ticks down to 2070.",

Some tremors deep below the surface likely were caused by Earth's gravitational pull. Others were vibrations from meteorite impacts. Still others resulted from expansion of the moon's chilly surface every two weeks when the sun rose. There were also shallow moonquakes, just a few miles beneath the surface. Unlike the other categories of quake, these convulsions couldn't be satisfactorily explained. But a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience suggests that they were triggered across myriad young faults by a combination of escaping internal heat and Earth's gravitational pull. The discovery suggests that the moon is still tectonically active, and raises the possibility that future lunar bases may be vulnerable to shallow moonquakes. It also prompts questions about the moon's evolution. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] The study's lead author, Dr. Maria Zuber, noted that the moon's interior is thought to have cooled significantly since its formation, but the new findings suggest that there may still be residual heat from its early days.

The research also implies that the moon's surface may be more dynamic than previously thought, with faults and fractures playing a key role in its tectonic activity. As scientists continue to explore the moon's subsurface, they may uncover even more surprises about the moon's internal workings.",

Comets are sort of like dirty snowballs: As they travel through the solar system, they leave behind a dusty trail of rocks and ice that lingers in space long after they leave. When Earth passes through these cascades of comet waste, the bits of debris -- which can be as small as grains of sand -- pierce the sky at such speeds that they burst, creating a celestial fireworks display. A general rule of thumb with meteor showers: You are never watching the Earth cross into remnants from a comet's most recent orbit. Instead, the burning bits come from the previous passes. For example, during the Perseid meteor shower you are seeing meteors ejected from when its parent comet, Comet Swift-Tuttle, visited in 1862 or earlier, not from its most recent pass in 1992. That's because it takes time for debris from a comet's orbit to drift into a position where it intersects with Earth's orbit, according to Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The best way to see a meteor shower is to get to a location that has a clear view of the entire night sky. Ideally, that would be somewhere with dark skies, away from city lights and traffic. To maximize your chances of catching the show, look for a spot that offers a wide, unobstructed view. Bits and pieces of meteor showers are visible for a certain period of time, but they really peak visibly from dusk to dawn on a given few days. Those days are when Earth's orbit crosses through the thickest part of the cosmic stream. Meteor showers can vary in their peak times, with some reaching their maximums for only a few hours and others for several nights. The showers tend to be most visible after midnight and before dawn. As the night wears on, the meteor shower will begin to fade, with the rate of meteors slowing to a trickle by dawn. But even as the show comes to a close, astronomers like Cooke are already looking to the future, tracking the orbits of comets and predicting when the next big meteor shower will occur. With new technologies and telescopes, scientists are gaining a better understanding of the origins of meteor showers and the risks they pose to Earth. For example, Cooke's team is currently monitoring a comet called 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak, which is expected to produce a spectacular meteor shower in 2023. By studying the comet's orbit and the debris it leaves behind, astronomers hope to better prepare for the next big show and even use meteor showers as a way to learn more about the solar system's history. Whether you're a seasoned astronomer or just a curious observer, there's no denying the magic of a meteor shower - and the sense of wonder it brings to the night sky.",

The HBO fantasy epic captured 10 Creative Arts Emmy Awards over the weekend, the most of any series in the kick off to this year's Primetime Emmys. HBO's limited series, \"Chernobyl,\" about the 1986 nuclear reactor disaster, also had a strong night on Sunday, earning seven Creative Arts Emmys. And Amazon's \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" which won best comedy last year, took home six awards, including best guest acting honors for Jane Lynch and Luke Kirby. (The drama guest acting awards went to Cherry Jones and Bradley Whitford, both for \"The Handmaid's Tale\" on Hulu.) The 71st Primetime Emmy Awards will take place on September 22, where the drama and comedy categories will be announced. The Creative Arts Emmys recognize outstanding work in technical categories such as editing, cinematography, and costume design. HBO's dominance in the Creative Arts Emmys comes as no surprise, given the network's reputation for producing high-quality programming. The company has won a total of 134 Emmy Awards since the awards began in 1949. With its record-breaking 10 wins, \"Game of Thrones\" has cemented its place in television history. The final season of the show may have received mixed reviews, but its impact on the television industry is undeniable.",

First identified in the 1970s by satellites designed to monitor nuclear explosions, they can be thousands of times more energetic than normal lightning. But you're even less likely to be struck by one: Scientists have mined data from the roughly 80 sensors of the World Wide Lightning Location Network to study where superbolts are found. They were surprised to discover that the most powerful lightning doesn't occur in known lightning hot spots, or at times of year when lightning usually strikes. Instead, they reported last week in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, superbolts predominantly occur over open water from November through February. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric and space physicist at the University of Washington, and his colleagues analyzed more than 1.7 billion radio-frequency observations of lightning. The team's findings suggest that superbolts are more likely to occur over open water bodies, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, during the winter months. This is a departure from the typical patterns of lightning activity, which tend to peak during the summer months in regions with high levels of humidity and warm air. The researchers propose that the unique combination of atmospheric conditions over open water, including the presence of warm air near the surface and cold air aloft, may create an environment conducive to the formation of superbolts. Further study is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind these extraordinary events, but the discovery has significant implications for our understanding of lightning and its role in shaping our planet's weather and climate.",

Paul Oetken, wrote in his decision. \"But the states have failed to persuade the court that this novelty alone establishes that the SALT cap exceeds Congress's broad tax power.\" The other states joining in the suit were New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland. The cap on state and local tax deductions, which had been unlimited, was one of a handful of provisions intended to offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts included in the 2017 law. The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's nonpartisan scorekeeper on tax matters, estimated the cap and related provisions would raise close to $700 billion in revenue over 10 years. Independent analyses have found that even in high-tax states like New York, most residents received at least a modest tax cut under the 2017 law. Other provisions of the law, such as the reduction in marginal tax rates, offset the loss of the deduction for many families. The ruling is a significant setback for the four states, which had argued that the SALT cap disproportionately harmed their residents and was an unconstitutional overreach by Congress. The judge's decision is likely to be appealed, but in the meantime, it will allow the SALT cap to remain in place. The cap has been a contentious issue, with many lawmakers from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey arguing that it unfairly targeted their constituents. The states had also argued that the cap was a form of \"discriminatory taxation\" that unfairly targeted certain states. The judge's decision is a blow to those efforts, and it is likely to be seen as a victory for the Trump administration and its allies in Congress. The administration had argued that the SALT cap was a necessary part of the 2017 tax law, which was designed to simplify the tax code and reduce the burden on businesses and individuals. The judge's decision is likely to be appealed, and the issue is likely to remain a contentious one in the coming months.",

About 500 million years ago, a couple species of now extinct trilobites became the first animals to roll themselves into a ball for protection. The trilobite's living doppelganger is the chiton. This marine mollusk's plated shell drapes over a soft body and mucousy foot, giving it the appearance of a flattened piece of shrimp nigiri. But you're more likely to find it clinging to a tidepool rock than awaiting chopsticks on a dinner plate. Like trilobites, three-banded armadillos, pill bugs, hedgehogs and other animals, the chiton can roll itself into a ball. a defense mechanism against predators. When threatened, the chiton's flexible shell plates flex and curve inward, allowing the animal to compress its body into a tight ball. This unique ability, known as \"conglobation,\" not only protects the chiton's soft body from predators but also allows it to withdraw its head and tentacles, making it difficult for predators to grasp. While it may seem like a peculiar behavior, conglobation has been observed in several other animal species, highlighting the importance of adaptability and defense strategies in the evolution of marine life. As Sigwart notes, \"The chiton's ability to roll into a ball is a testament to the remarkable diversity of defense mechanisms that have evolved in the animal kingdom.\"",

But getting a handle on how frequently these destructive storms have pummeled the planet is tough because records stretch back only about a century and a half. Now, researchers have assembled a 1,500-year history of hurricanes in the Bahamas, based on sand and shell fragments pulled up from submarine caverns known as blue holes. Their results, published in October in Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology, show that hurricane activity has varied over time. In fact, recent hurricane activity in the Bahamas has been low compared with historical highs, despite intense activity elsewhere in the Atlantic arena. The fluctuations are likely driven by changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation and volcanism, the scientists suggest. The study, led by Dr. Neil Rhodes of the University of Miami, analyzed sediment cores from 15 blue holes in the Bahamas, which provided a unique window into the region's hurricane history. By examining the sediment layers, the researchers were able to identify patterns of hurricane activity, including the frequency and intensity of storms. The results showed that hurricane activity in the Bahamas has varied significantly over the past 1,500 years, with periods of high activity followed by periods of relative calm. The scientists believe that changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, as well as volcanic eruptions, may have contributed to these fluctuations.

On Monday, Facebook said it would begin testing a \"data portability\" tool in Ireland that would allow users there to move photos and videos from Facebook to Google Photos. Critics immediately said the initiative did not go far enough. Facebook's control over personal data has been central to current antitrust investigations in Washington and Europe. Authorities say Facebook holds so much information about its users, data it uses to fuel its digital advertising business and improve its services, that it creates a competitive imbalance that rivals can't match. The move is seen as a response to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to provide users with easy access to their personal data and the ability to transfer it to other services. Facebook's decision to test the data portability tool in Ireland is a significant step, but critics argue that it is too little, too late. \"This is just a token gesture,\" said Margot Kaminski, a professor of law and technology at the University of Oregon. \"Facebook is trying to appear to be compliant with GDPR, but it's still maintaining control over the data and limiting the ability of users to truly take their data elsewhere.\" Facebook has faced intense scrutiny over its handling of user data, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which led to widespread criticism and calls for greater transparency and accountability. The company has also faced antitrust investigations in the US and Europe, with regulators accusing it of using its dominance to stifle competition. By allowing users to move photos and videos to Google Photos, Facebook is attempting to demonstrate its commitment to data portability, but many experts believe it is a move designed to appease regulators rather than genuinely promote competition.",

Unlike humans, which lose just one set of teeth over a lifetime, dinosaurs often lost tens or even hundreds of sets. Plant-eating dinosaurs had to chew lots of tough material to sustain their large bodies, causing them to frequently replace their teeth. But researchers were surprised to discover fossil evidence recently that showed that a carnivorous dinosaur -- the only known cannibal -- replaced its chompers even more frequently than some herbivores. The dinosaur's propensity for chewing on the bones of its prey might have even contributed to its rapid tooth replacement rate, scientists hypothesized. These results were published late last month in the journal PLoS One. The research centered on several meat-eating dinosaurs, but Majungasaurus crenatissimus was really the star of carnivorous dinosaur dentition. The researchers analyzed fossilized teeth and jawbones of Majungasaurus crenatissimus, a carnivorous dinosaur that lived around 70 million years ago in what is now Madagascar. They found that the dinosaur's teeth were worn down quickly, indicating that it needed to replace them frequently to maintain its ability to eat. The team estimated that Majungasaurus crenatissimus replaced its teeth every 1-2 months, which is faster than any other known dinosaur. This high rate of tooth replacement suggests that the dinosaur had a unique diet that required it to constantly wear down its teeth, likely by chewing on the bones of its prey. The study provides new insights into the feeding habits and behavior of this fascinating carnivorous dinosaur.",

She has also condemned men who have been accused of sexual misconduct and criticized others who, in her view, have not been outspoken enough. Along the way, her online fan base, known as the #RoseArmy, has increased. On Sunday, during a Golden Globes ceremony when many women wore black and several people wore Time's Up pins, Ms. McGowan lashed out on Twitter at what she described as \"Hollywood fakery.\" The series will debut with a two-hour episode on Jan. 30 and return for four additional installments in the spring. \"I wanted really to be like Gertrude Stein and have a conversation with the world,\" Ms. McGowan said. The documentary series promises to give viewers an intimate look at McGowan's life, both before and after the publication of the New York Times story that exposed her settlement agreement with Weinstein. The show will feature footage from the past three years, as well as new material filmed in the aftermath of the scandal. McGowan has been open about her experiences and has used her platform to advocate for victims of sexual harassment and abuse. She has also been vocal about her disdain for those who she believes have not been supportive enough of the #MeToo movement.\n\nIn a statement, E! said that \"Citizen Rose\" would be a \"unflinching look at the life of a woman who has become a beacon of hope and inspiration for millions of people around the world.\" The network added that the series would be \"a powerful exploration of the human experience\" and would \"challenge viewers to think differently about the world around them.\"\n\nMcGowan's #RoseArmy has been a key part of her online presence, and the series is expected to give fans a deeper look at her life and activism. The show's premiere on January 30 will be followed by four additional episodes in the spring. With \"Citizen Rose,\" McGowan is taking control of her narrative and using her platform to inspire and educate others. As she said at the TCA event, \"I wanted really to be like Gertrude Stein and have a conversation with the world.\" It seems that she is well on her way to doing just that.",

And by writing intelligently about offbeat topics -- from a locket meant to hold \"mad money\" to a deeply unsatisfying West Elm couch called \"the Peggy\" -- The Awl and its sister sites did their best to live up to the motto. On Tuesday, though, editors of The Awl and one of the sister sites, The Hairpin, announced that the end had come. Statements on the sites said editorial operations would cease at the end of January. The closings represent yet another loss for independent publishers that have long struggled to compete with larger ones, which can offer ad buyers a wider audience. The news of the closure sent shockwaves through the online publishing community, with many lamenting the loss of a unique voice and perspective. \"The Awl was a beacon of intelligence and humor in a sea of clickbait and cat videos,\" said one writer. The sites' founders, Alex Balk and Choire Sicha, were praised for their willingness to take risks and tackle topics that others might shy away from. Despite its small size, The Awl had a devoted following and was widely respected within the industry. The closure is a blow to the community of independent publishers, who are struggling to survive in an increasingly crowded and competitive online landscape. As the clock ticks down to the end of January, fans of The Awl are left to mourn the loss of a beloved publication and wonder what the future holds for the talented writers and editors who brought it to life.",

That special, which included an interview with Jon Stewart, received warm reviews. \"Pod Save America,\" a podcast hosted by Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor, all veterans of the Obama White House, has become a sort of refuge to liberal Americans during the beginning of the Trump era.

The specials will be produced by Judd Apatow, who has a long history of working with comedians and podcasters, including Sarah Silverman and Marc Maron. \"We're thrilled to be partnering with HBO and Judd Apatow to bring our unique brand of humor and commentary to a wider audience,\" said Favreau, Lovett, Pfeiffer, and Vietor in a joint statement.

At its peak, the chain had nearly 200 stores in 15 countries and more than $1 billion in annual sales, before debt and shifting consumer habits forced it to close in 2006. Starting at his father's drugstore in Sacramento, where he sold used jukebox records as a teenager, Mr. Solomon built a retail empire that became known as much for its selection -- vast by brick-and-mortar standards -- as for the culture that surrounded it. Employees were opinionated aficionados, and Tower stores, open till midnight, were gathering places for fans. The locations on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood and on Broadway in Greenwich Village became tourist meccas. The shops even made devotees of the stars. Bruce Springsteen and Bette Midler were regular visitors, but Tower's most famous patron was Elton John, for whom the Hollywood store would open early. \"All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\" a 2015 documentary, includes footage from the 1970s of Mr. John briskly walking the aisles and tossing brand-new vinyl records into a cardboard box. Mr. Solomon relied on debt to fuel Tower's expansion, creating a burden that weighed heavily on the company's finances by the early 2000s. By that point, the stores had also been hit by an industrywide plunge in record sales precipitated by online piracy. The company lost $10 million in 2000 and $90 million in 2001. Despite the challenges, Mr. Solomon remained committed to his vision of creating a unique retail experience. He continued to invest in his stores, expanding the selection of vinyl and introducing new formats such as DVDs and digital music downloads. However, the writing was on the wall, and in 2004, Tower Records filed for bankruptcy. Despite efforts to restructure, the company was ultimately unable to recover and closed its doors in 2006. The loss was felt deeply by music fans around the world, who mourned the passing of an era. Mr. Solomon's legacy, however, lived on, and his influence can still be seen in the independent record stores that have sprung up in the years since Tower's demise. Many of these stores, such as Rough Trade in Brooklyn and Amoeba Music in San Francisco, have credited Tower Records as an inspiration and a model for their own businesses. In the end, Russ Solomon's creation may have been a victim of its own success, but it remains a beloved and iconic part of music history.",

When it comes to modern laptop design, many manufacturers have tossed disc drives onto the same pile with floppy drives, Ethernet jacks and other technology considered obsolete -- thanks to cloud servers and wireless networks that have taken over a laptop's data storage and internet connection needs. The quest for smaller, lighter laptops with maximum space on the inside for a rechargeable battery has also pushed out these once-standard computer components.

This allows users to play CDs and DVDs without having to sacrifice precious internal space. Another option is to purchase a portable DVD player or a standalone DVD drive that can be connected to the laptop via HDMI or USB.

And its \"Seymour\" is the worm larva of Xenoplatyura beaveri, a species of fungus gnat that develops inside the plant's mouth. When grown, it looks like a mosquito with big biceps. They've got a strange relationship, these two. The plant gives the gnat baby a safe place to eat and develop. In exchange, the baby builds a web across the plant's lips, captures and eats other insects and then defecates into its maw, or pitcher. The plant eats the ammonium-rich droppings. And all is well in this miniature world of weird. It's not romantic. It's not sweet. But it's a remarkable example of symbiosis, a mutually beneficial relationship that has evolved over millions of years.

Even when you have the software enabled, browser utilities like AdBlock or AdBlock Plus may still display less-intrusive advertisements from companies that have been approved by the independent Acceptable Ads Committee. The Acceptable Ads initiative was started by AdBlock Plus, which makes money by allowing the ads through its filters. The initiative attempts to balance the needs of web surfers who do not want to be pelted with aggressive online ads and the needs of websites that rely on advertising revenue to support their content. (Google recently began to filter intrusive ads in its Chrome browser in a similar manner.) \"Acceptable\" ads include those that lack animation and do not jam themselves into the middle of the reader's experience on the site. Even if the ad-blocker program is set to allow nonintrusive ads by default, you can disable the feature in the program's settings. However, if you use a site frequently and find it worthwhile, you may want to consider allowing its advertising through your filter by allowing acceptable ads or by adding the site to the ad-blocking program's white list. To \"white-list\" a site basically means to make an exception for it in your ad-blocking program to allow advertising to appear. While advertising on some web pages can be distracting, excessive and sometimes even laden with malware, most sites run ads because they need the money to sustain themselves. Some sites have put in ad-blocker detection tools and will stop your browser from loading the page you want to see unless you white-list the site. Here is the continued text:\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that not all websites are transparent about their ad-blocking detection tools. Some may use these tools to punish users who refuse to turn off their ad-blockers, making it difficult for them to access the content they want. This has led to a growing debate about the ethics of ad-blocking detection and the impact it has on user experience. As a result, some users are opting to use alternative ad-blocking solutions that are more transparent and user-friendly. Ultimately, it's crucial for users to be aware of the different options available and to make informed decisions about how they interact with the websites they visit.",

It was Mr. Williamson's hard-line stance on abortion -- namely, that it should be treated as premeditated homicide and punished accordingly, perhaps by hanging -- that generated the initial controversy over his hiring. It was that same viewpoint that led to his abrupt departure. Mr. Williamson expressed it during a Twitter exchange in September 2014. The decision to terminate Williamson's relationship with The Atlantic was made after a wave of criticism and outrage from readers, writers, and advocates for women's rights and reproductive freedom.

The magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, released a statement saying that while Williamson was a talented writer, his opinions on abortion were \"not compatible\" with the magazine's values and mission.

The 33-foot-long whale was swept onto a rocky beach in Cape Palos, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, on Feb. 27. It was not yet fully grown but weighed just 13,000 pounds, an unusually scrawny size for a whale that can reach 120,000 pounds as an adult. When scientists performed a necropsy, the reason became clear: The whale had 64 pounds of trash -- plastic bags, ropes, netting and even a plastic drum -- clogging its intestines and stomach. It could not process the garbage or pass it through its digestive system, causing severe inflammation as it withered away, officials in the region of Murcia said. Sperm whales, which are among the largest of their species, can dive thousands of feet deep into the darkest regions of the ocean to hunt for squid. But in between those deep dives, they often hang around the surface, making them susceptible to ingesting floating debris that might be mistaken for food. Pollution in the ocean has disastrous effects, particularly for wildlife. Because of the ocean's currents, some buoyant debris eventually settles in islands of trash that float above or just below the surface. One such area between California and Hawaii, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is now estimated to contain at least 87,000 tons of plastic. As the amount of plastic in the ocean grows every year, some scientists believe that debris might kill more animals than the effects of climate change. When two whales came ashore in Northern California in 2008, scientists found they had ingested bags and netting probably discarded by fishermen. One whale's stomach had ruptured, and the other one, which had consumed more than 160 pounds of trash, is likely to have starved to death as the garbage obstructed its stomach. The incident highlights the devastating impact of plastic pollution on marine life. The whale's body was found with a mixture of plastic and organic matter, indicating that it had been struggling to digest its food for some time. The case is not an isolated one, with many other marine animals, including sea turtles and seabirds, also found with plastic debris in their stomachs. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that over 100,000 marine animals die each year due to plastic pollution. The Spanish government has pledged to increase efforts to reduce plastic waste and improve waste management practices in the country. In the meantime, the public is being urged to reduce their use of single-use plastics and to properly dispose of waste to prevent it from entering the ocean.",

After swimming for years in a giant loop from nesting grounds in North Carolina and Florida to North Africa, the turtles find their way back to nest on beaches within about 40 to 50 miles of where they were born. The new study suggests that the turtles learned their home beach's distinctive magnetic signature, through what is called geomagnetic imprinting. Researchers from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington and the University of Florida analyzed the genetic makeup of over 200 loggerhead sea turtles and found that their migratory patterns were linked to the unique magnetic signatures of their birthplace. The study, published in the journal Science, reveals that the turtles' ability to detect and remember these signatures allows them to return to the exact beach where they hatched, often after traveling thousands of miles. This remarkable navigation skill is a testament to the turtles' remarkable adaptability and ability to survive in a rapidly changing environment.",

A cloud can spread 40 miles or more from the original infestation, the researchers reported in 2017 in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. The gypsy moth is the adult stage of one of the caterpillar species that threaten tree canopies. It was accidentally introduced from France in 1869 and its feeding is more threatening to trees than native tent caterpillars, which it resembles. The fungus, which attacks only gypsy moths, was first reported in the Northeast in 1989, though efforts to introduce it as a control measure had begun as early as 1910. The researchers are using a technique called quantitative PCR, or qPCR, to detect the genetic material of the fungus in the spores. This allows them to track the spread of the fungus without having to visually examine individual spores. By analyzing the genetic material, they can determine the concentration of the fungus in the environment and predict where it is most likely to spread. The team is also studying the genetic diversity of the fungus to better understand its ability to adapt to different environments and hosts.",

The job cements Mr. Murdoch, 46, as successor to his father, Rupert Murdoch, 87, who will take the title of co-chairman. The news release from 21st Century Fox announcing Mr. Murdoch's new duties at the \"proposed new 'Fox'\" made no mention of his younger brother, James Murdoch, 45, who currently serves as chief executive of 21st Century Fox. James Murdoch is expected to strike out on his own, perhaps starting a company that invests in digital media businesses. The Murdoch family's complex web of relationships and business interests has long been a subject of fascination and scrutiny, with many observers wondering how the company would navigate the transition to a new generation of leadership. Lachlan Murdoch's ascension to the top spot was widely expected, given his long-standing involvement in the family business and his father's increasing age. However, the fate of James Murdoch, who has been seen as a potential rival to his older brother, remains uncertain. Industry insiders speculate that James may seek to create his own media empire, potentially competing with his brother's new venture. Meanwhile, the 21st Century Fox board of directors will likely face challenges in the coming months as they navigate the company's reorganization and the increasingly fragmented media landscape.",

On Wednesday, the CBS Corporation amended its lawsuit against its parent company, intensifying the battle for control of the network being waged between its chief executive officer, Leslie Moonves, and its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone. The legal maneuver was the latest in a series of steps taken by CBS to prevent Ms. Redstone, the president of National Amusements, which acquired CBS in 2000, from merging the company with Viacom, its corporate sibling. CBS amended the lawsuit in the wake of a tense meeting during which its board voted to dilute Ms. Redstone's influence over the company. Immediately after the vote, National Amusements called it invalid. The amendment to the lawsuit alleges that Ms. Redstone's efforts to merge CBS with Viacom are a \"brazen attempt\" to gain control of the company without following proper corporate procedures. The move is seen as a bold attempt by CBS to assert its independence and protect its interests. National Amusements has vowed to fight the lawsuit, calling it a \"baseless\" attempt to undermine Ms. Redstone's authority. The battle for control of CBS is expected to continue, with both sides digging in their heels and refusing to back down.

However, a recent discovery in the ancient city of Tancanhuitz, Mexico, has shed new light on the origins of the turquoise used by the Aztecs and Mixtecs. Archaeologists uncovered a hidden turquoise mine, hidden beneath the city's ancient ruins, which dates back to the 12th century. The find has sparked excitement among researchers, who believe it may have been a major source of turquoise for the region's ancient civilizations.

(When you have as many users as Facebook, finding new ones requires some ingenuity.) On Wednesday, the ambitious effort was halted. Facebook announced in a blog post that it would no longer build the drones. The company said that it was still committed to the original goal of bringing more people online, but that it would instead rely on other companies to build aircraft.

The aircraft filled a warehouse, but weighed as much as a grand piano.

That's the long game. The short game is rather more depressing. Consider the most pressing question: How confident should you be that the coming midterm elections will be safe from hacking and propaganda operations online? The most likely answer: Nobody knows for sure, but probably not very confident. Facebook and other tech companies are stepping up their efforts to police their sites before the midterms. But some of the threats they have spotted so far have little to do with the election. The uncertainty surrounding the midterm elections' security is unsettling, to say the least. While Facebook and other tech companies are taking steps to mitigate the risks, the fact remains that the threat landscape is constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities are being uncovered all the time. Moreover, the sheer scale of the internet and its decentralized nature make it a daunting task to fully secure. As a result, experts are cautioning that even the best efforts may not be enough to prevent a significant disruption to the electoral process.\n\nIn fact, some researchers have already identified a number of concerning trends, including the increasing use of deepfakes, AI-generated disinformation, and sophisticated phishing attacks. These tactics are designed to deceive and manipulate voters, often in ways that are difficult to detect. And with the midterms just around the corner, the window for improvement is rapidly closing.\n\nIn light of these concerns, many are calling for increased transparency and accountability from tech companies, as well as more robust government oversight. Without a concerted effort to address these issues, the integrity of our democratic process may be at risk. As the midterm elections approach, it is essential that we remain vigilant and proactive in our efforts to protect the integrity of our democracy.",

The currency has gone for a ride. Serving the nation's middle-class shoppers, however, still seems to be rollicking good business. The Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce leviathan, reported a rise in sales of more than 60 percent in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier. Profits for April to June fell by more than 40 percent, however, reflecting the effect of a large increase in the valuation of Ant Financial, an Alibaba sister company.

Had that not been the case, the company said, profits would have grown by more than a third. Despite the challenges posed by the trade tensions, Alibaba's e-commerce platform, Taobao and Tmall, continued to attract millions of active users, with daily transactions reaching a record high. The company's online payment platform, Alipay, also saw significant growth, with over 1 billion transactions processed in the quarter.

        "Text": "Drip water on a hot pan, and the droplets will skitter around the pan, speeding like tiny mad hovercraft on cushions of steam. This is the Leidenfrost effect, which you've probably experienced while cooking. Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, a German doctor and theologian, described the phenomenon in 1756 in a book about the properties of water. But French scientists have now figured out something new about those skittering drops. When they are small enough -- about a millimeter in diameter -- the roiling of heat in the liquid will cause the droplet to tilt and rotate. That, in turn, propels the droplet to roll. Scientists -- and home cooks -- never noticed this before, because no one had tried pinning a water droplet on a precisely flat surface. Plus, since water is clear, you usually can't see which way the liquid is churning. It was already known that the droplets, levitating on top of a layer of vapor, move easily, but the presumption was that they were sliding down a slope or pushed by air currents. The new research shows that they can move all by themselves. \"It's embarrassingly simple,\" David Quere, a scientist at the Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris, said of the discovery. \"The drop is running away,\" he said. \"It has a little motor inside, which is surprising. From this view, it's amazingly different from usual drops, which, of course, stay where you place them.\" Dr. Quere and his colleagues described the research this week in the journal Nature Physics. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In the experiments, droplets of water were placed on a very flat, very hot, nonabsorbent surface, held in place by a needle. (For the skittering Leidenfrost effect to occur, the surface has be at least about 400 degrees Fahrenheit , well above the boiling temperature of water. Some recipes use that as a test to see whether a pan is hot enough.) The researchers found that the tiny motor inside the droplet, created by the rotation of the liquid, allowed it to move in a seemingly random pattern, often changing direction suddenly. This behavior was observed even when the surface was completely still, with no external forces acting on the droplet. The team was able to measure the speed and direction of the droplets' movement, and found that they could move at speeds of up to 1.5 centimeters per second, which is surprisingly fast considering their small size.\n\nThe discovery has implications for a range of fields, from materials science to biology. For example, it could be used to develop new methods for manipulating tiny objects or creating self-propelled devices. The researchers are also exploring the potential applications of this phenomenon in the field of soft robotics, where tiny robots could be designed to move and manipulate objects using this principle.\n\nDr. Quere and his team are now working to understand the underlying physics of the phenomenon, and to see if it can be replicated with other liquids. They are also exploring the potential for using this effect to create new types of micro-robots that could be used in a variety of applications, from medicine to manufacturing. The discovery is a reminder that even in familiar phenomena, there is often still much to be learned, and that the simplest-seeming effects can have complex and surprising underlying mechanisms.",

        "Text": "Our Milky Way galaxy is strewn with billions of planets, alien worlds still unseen by human eyes -- at least for now. Only three decades ago we didn't know if there were planets beyond our own solar system. In 1995, astronomers discovered that a star in the constellation Pegasus was wobbling back and forth, tugged by the gravity of an unseen planet, an exoplanet, a hot and hellish world unfit for life as we know it. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive spectroscopes. As an orbiting planet tugs on its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again. The Kepler space telescope was launched in 2009. It found thousands of exoplanets by staring at a small patch of the Milky Way. Kepler didn't look for wobbles. It looked for small dips in starlight, when a planet crosses in front of its star. Kepler found systems of planets, groups of worlds swirling around their star, lonely planets encased in ice, other worlds scorched by fire, newborn planets shrouded in dust, waterworlds, and planets swept by global storms, planets dancing in orbit with two stars, or even three, and even planets from other galaxies that were swallowed up by the Milky Way. In recent years, astronomers have taken the first direct images of exoplanets, blurry pixels of alien landscapes. We've discovered a free-floating planet not bound to any star. And we've seen signs of planets being born, infant worlds scoring dark rings in the dust around their stars. Now a new planet hunter will join the search. On April 16, 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, will lift off from Cape Canaveral. TESS will spend two years scrutinizing the entire sky, watching nearby stars for minute dips in brightness caused by a nearby alien world. TESS' four cameras cover a swath of the sky 96 degrees tall. With TESS, astronomers expect to discover thousands more exoplanets, including some that could potentially harbor life. The satellite's wide field of view will allow it to survey the entire sky, focusing on nearby stars that are likely to have planets in their habitable zones. These are the areas around stars where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist, a crucial ingredient for life as we know it.\n\nTESS will also study the atmospheres of exoplanets, using its cameras to analyze the light that passes through the atmospheres as the planets transit their stars. This technique, known as transmission spectroscopy, can reveal the presence of gases like oxygen, methane, and water vapor, which could be signs of biological activity.\n\nThe data collected by TESS will be used to prioritize targets for future studies, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, which will be capable of analyzing the atmospheres of exoplanets in much greater detail. With TESS and other planet-hunting missions, scientists are getting closer to answering the question of whether we are alone in the universe. As the search for life beyond Earth continues, the discovery of new exoplanets and the study of their properties will help us better understand the possibilities of life existing elsewhere in the Milky Way.",

New findings about a small ice world far beyond Pluto buttress this idea. On Monday, astronomers led by Scott S. Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington revealed the orbital details of the world, which they have nicknamed the Goblin. Dr. Sheppard and his colleagues first spotted the world, which for now carries the official designation of 2015 TG387 as part of a systematic search three years ago for new worlds in the outer system, including the hypothesized Planet Nine. But only with additional observations did they realize how far out TG387 really is. \"It took us three years to figure out that it has an interesting orbit,\" Dr. Sheppard said. The team's observations suggest that the Goblin is a small, icy world with a highly elliptical orbit that takes it as close as 33 astronomical units (AU) from the sun and as far as 2,000 AU from the sun. One astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the sun. The Goblin's orbit is also tilted at an angle of 20 degrees from the plane of the solar system, which is unusual for objects in the outer reaches of the solar system. Dr. Sheppard believes that the Goblin's unusual orbit may be influenced by the presence of a massive, unseen planet in the outer reaches of the solar system, which could be the long-sought Planet Nine. The discovery of the Goblin adds to the growing body of evidence that supports the existence of Planet Nine, and astronomers are eagerly awaiting further observations to confirm its presence.",

Now, Dr. Currie and his colleagues have found evidence that suggests that the partnership between ants and antimicrobial bacteria has existed for tens of millions of years. The key clues came from two 20-million-year-old ants that were discovered, trapped in amber, in the Dominican Republic. One of the fossilized ants had specialized pockets on its head, called crypts, that are also seen on modern ants. The crypts are known to house the fungus-protecting bacteria, called actinobacteria. The other ant specimen was entombed with gas bubbles on its body, likely produced by the respiration of the actinobacteria. \"It's kind of like the ants are walking pharmaceutical factories,\" said Dr. Currie, who is an author of the study, which appeared Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"This indicates that, like in the way ants predated us in growing crops, they also predated us by tens of millions of years in associating with microbes to produce antibiotics.\" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. The discovery of these ancient ants has shed new light on the evolution of symbiotic relationships between insects and microorganisms. According to Dr. Currie, the finding suggests that ants may have been using antimicrobial bacteria to protect themselves from fungal infections as far back as the early Cenozoic era. This partnership may have allowed ants to thrive in environments where other insects were unable to survive, giving them a significant advantage in the struggle for dominance. The researchers believe that this ancient alliance may have played a crucial role in the development of complex social structures within ant colonies, as the ability to protect against disease would have allowed ants to live in close proximity to one another without being decimated by fungal infections. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of cooperation and the role of microbes in shaping the evolution of life on Earth.",

A new study suggests Aesop was right about the geographical differences in rodent diets. By analyzing the remains of brown rats that lived in and around Toronto between 1790 and 1890, researchers have determined that city rats enjoyed a higher-quality and more stable diet than rural rats did. Just as in Aesop's tale, the city rats benefited from the largess of human waste, whereas country rats scraped by. \"Rats that lived in the city had a lot more meat in their diet,\" said Eric Guiry, an archaeologist at Trent University in Ontario and lead author of the study, which was published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. \"You could see the difference in their bones.\" The researchers analyzed the remains of over 100 brown rats, examining the presence of certain isotopes in their bones to determine their diet. They found that city rats had a higher concentration of carbon-13, which is found in meat and other animal products, whereas rural rats had a higher concentration of carbon-12, which is found in plant-based foods. The study also revealed that city rats had a more stable diet, with less variation in their food sources over time. In contrast, rural rats had to adapt to changing seasons and availability of food, leading to a more varied and unpredictable diet. The findings suggest that Aesop's tale may not have been just a myth, but rather a reflection of the real differences in rodent diets that existed in ancient times.",

It's all the more remarkable because InSight -- which landed last week -- does not have a microphone. Rather, an instrument designed for measuring the shaking of marsquakes picked up vibrations in the air -- sound waves, in other words. Winds blowing between 10 and 15 miles per hour over InSight's solar panels caused the spacecraft to vibrate, and short-period seismometers recorded the vibrations. \"You can think of it rather in the same way as the human ear, how we in fact listen,\" said Thomas Pike, a scientist at Imperial College London who is leading research with the instruments. \"The solar panels are like the ear drum. The spacecraft structure is like the inner ear.\" The seismometers act as the cochlea, the parts of your ears that convert the vibrations into nerve signals. They are able to record vibrations up to a frequency of 50 Hertz -- audible to human ears as a low rumble. NASA also produced a version of the recording that lifted the sounds by two octaves. \"To me, the sounds are really unworldly,\" Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator of the mission, said during a news conference on Friday. \"They do sound like the wind or maybe the ocean kind of roaring in the background. But it also has an unworldly feel to it.\" [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] A second instrument, an air pressure sensor that is part of InSight's weather station, also picked up sound vibrations, although at a much lower frequency that can be heard perhaps by elephants and whales, but not people. Here is a sound recording of those pressure readings, sped up by a factor of 100, which raises the pitch by more than six octaves. The sounds are so low in part because the instruments are not sensitive to higher frequencies.

There's an easy explanation for experiences like Ms. Miyawaki's, said William Hartmann, a physics professor at Michigan State University who specializes in acoustics and psychoacoustics. There are two pathways through which we perceive our own voice when we speak, he explained. One is the route through which we perceive most other sounds. Waves travel from the air through the chain of our hearing systems, traversing the outer, middle and inner ear. But because our vocal cords vibrate when we speak, a second path is introduced internally, in which those vibrations are conducted through our bones and excite our inner ears directly. \"The effect of this is to emphasize lower frequencies, and that makes the voice sound deeper and richer to yourself,\" Professor Hartmann said. Except when it doesn't: Professor Hartmann's explanation makes sense for many people, including Ms. Miyawaki. However, Professor Hartmann noted that there are some individuals who don't experience this phenomenon, and it's not just a matter of being a singer or having a unique vocal technique. \"It's actually due to the way our brain processes sound,\" he explained. \"Some people's brains are more sensitive to the internal vibrations, while others are more attuned to the external sound waves. It's like a personal filter that affects how we perceive our own voice.\" Ms. Miyawaki, for instance, has a particularly sensitive inner ear, which allows her to pick up on the internal vibrations more clearly than others.

The move is a blow to Crackle, Sony's streaming service, which has run the show since its debut in 2012. In addition to \"Comedians in Cars,\" Mr. Seinfeld has also signed a production deal with Netflix, which will include performing two stand-up specials, and developing scripted and nonscripted content. In recent months, Netflix has been gobbling up comic talent, including Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Amy Schumer, all of whom are performing stand-up specials for the service. Netflix has been spending lavishly to bring them on: Mr. Rock's two forthcoming stand-up shows cost Netflix a reported $40 million. Terms for Mr. Seinfeld's deal were not disclosed. The move to Netflix is a significant coup for the streaming giant, which has been aggressively expanding its comedy offerings in recent years. The addition of Seinfeld's content and stand-up specials is expected to further bolster Netflix's reputation as a go-to destination for comedy fans. Industry insiders speculate that Seinfeld's deal may be worth upwards of $100 million, making it one of the largest talent acquisitions in Netflix's history. The news has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many wondering what other big-name comedians might be in line for similar deals.",

NBC announced on Wednesday that it was bringing back its celebrated comedy \"Will & Grace\" for 10 episodes during the 2017-18 TV season. The show's original cast -- Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally -- will all return, as will the show's director, James Burrows, and the show's creators, Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. TV is going through a 1990s and early 2000s nostalgia craze, and \"Will & Grace\" is far from the first show to make a comeback. Netflix's \"Full House\" revival, \"Fuller House,\" has already had two seasons. The streaming service also brought back \"Gilmore Girls\" in November. The nostalgia trend is expected to continue, with several other classic TV shows already in the works for revivals or reboots. The CW is planning a \"Supernatural\" spin-off, while CBS is reviving its popular 1990s sitcom \"Murphy Brown\". Additionally, reports suggest that a reboot of the iconic 1980s drama \"Dynasty\" is in the works. With the success of \"Will & Grace\" and other reboots, it's clear that audiences are craving a trip down memory lane, and networks are eager to capitalize on this trend. The new episodes of \"Will & Grace\" are set to premiere in September, giving fans a chance to reunite with their favorite characters and catch up on the lives of Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen.",

A meteor is the streak of light of a space rock plunging into the atmosphere, and a meteorite is the remnant of space rock that survives the fiery descent and comes to rest on the ground. Thus, one might think that meteorites that fall on Earth ought to be just like the asteroids that pass through Earth's neighborhood. \"That's what everybody would have expected,\" said Philipp R. Heck, the curator in charge for the meteorite and physical geology collections at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Planetary scientists were surprised almost a decade ago when they discovered that the most plentiful types of meteorites they had collected and studied on Earth were actually not common in space. In a paper published Monday by the journal Nature Astronomy, an international team of researchers led by Dr. Heck says it has uncovered part of the explanation. Mineralogical evidence in some meteorites had already pointed to a cataclysmic collision in the asteroid belt about 466 million years ago -- long before dinosaurs, when multicellular animals were still fairly new. (Dr. Heck estimated that any skywatchers back then would have seen about 100 times as many shooting stars as crisscross the night sky today.) Dr. Heck and his colleagues wanted to examine meteorites that landed on Earth before that, and for that they looked at ancient limestone from Russia -- one-time sediment of a seafloor transformed to rock -- that was about a million years older. They dissolved almost 600 pounds of rock to extract 46 minuscule crystals containing the mineral chromite. The crystals persist unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, and from the mix of elements in the crystals, the scientists could tell that 41 of them came from space and what types of asteroids they were once part of. The mix of meteorites was very different. Back then, more than a third of them belonged to a type known as primitive achondrites; today, less than half a percent of them are. \"It's really inventive, their approach,\" said Tasha L. Dunn, a geology professor at Colby College in Maine who studies meteorites and who was not involved in the research. The findings fits in with the new understanding that a mix of meteorites is determined more by the history of collisions in the asteroid belt rather than by the mix of asteroids whose orbits around the sun are close to Earth's. \"It opens new roads of research,\" Pierre Vernazza, a researcher at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Marseille, France, who first noted the discrepancy between asteroids and meteorites in 2008, said of the new paper. The discovery sheds new light on the complex history of the asteroid belt and its impact on the delivery of meteorites to Earth. \"This study shows that the asteroid belt has undergone significant changes over time, with large collisions playing a crucial role in shaping the mix of meteorites that fall to Earth,\" said Dr. Heck. The team's findings also have implications for understanding the origins of life on Earth, as some meteorites are thought to have carried organic molecules that may have contributed to the emergence of life on our planet. As scientists continue to study the ancient meteorites, they may uncover even more secrets about the early history of our solar system.",

Their population decimated by poaching and habitat destruction, only about 4,000 of the endangered cats remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Conflicts with mountain farmers and pastoral herders also contribute to their dwindling numbers. \"The problem is when a snow leopard gets inside a livestock pen,\" said Madhu Chetri, a biologist at Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences. When that happens, he said, the carnivore usually eats a handful of goats and sheep, but in some cases it can massacre more than 100 animals in a single corral. If the cat gets stuck in a pen, the inevitable tends to occur. \"There is a high chance the herders will kill it in retaliation,\" he said. \"This vicious cycle of retaliation and poaching has to be broken,\" said Chetri. \"That's why our team is working with local communities to develop non-lethal deterrents, such as fencing and guard animals, to protect both the snow leopards and the livestock.

While both sound significant, neither will be much of a spectacle for the casual skygazer. The eclipse will be a penumbral lunar eclipse, meaning that only a portion of Earth's shadow will cover the moon. Unlike a total lunar eclipse, where the entire moon takes on a reddish color from being engulfed by the Earth's shadow, the moon will appear only slightly darker than usual during Friday's eclipse. \"These things are very subtle,\" said Noah Petro, a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If it's a cloudy night you might not even notice it.\" The best time to try and see the eclipse is around 7:44 p.m. Eastern time. That's when part of the moon's top will most noticeably appear gray. The next event, the passing of Comet 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova, will also not be very eye-catching for most people. Comet 45P circles the sun about every five years. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth, passing within 0.4 astronomical units of our planet.

The comet will be visible in the constellation of Leo, but will appear as a faint, fuzzy patch in the sky. For those interested in catching a glimpse of the comet, it will be best seen in the early morning hours, around 2:00 a.m. Eastern time, when it will be highest in the sky. However, even with binoculars or a small telescope, the comet's appearance will be underwhelming. \"It's not going to be a showstopper,\" said Petro. \"But it's still a significant event for astronomers and a chance to learn more about these ancient visitors from the outer reaches of the solar system.\"",

Would a problem arise if I continue to use Windows 7, even after Microsoft stops sending updates for Windows 7? A. Microsoft stopped all official sales of the last available version of Windows 7 on Oct. 30 and began counting down to the end of its support for the operating system, originally released in 2009. The company has published the dates for milestones in the Windows 7 life cycle, and has moved from \"mainstream support,\" in which new features are developed and added as updates, to \"extended support,\" which mainly provides security patches. Extended support for Windows 7 is scheduled to end on Jan. 14, 2020. Certain third-party security software companies may provide their own updates for Windows 7 after Microsoft stops, so you might be able to keep using the system for a few more years with protection against malicious software. However, it's important to note that even with extended support, Windows 7 will no longer receive non-security updates, which means that new features, bug fixes, and other improvements will not be available. Additionally, Microsoft will no longer provide technical support or fix issues that may arise. Users who continue to use Windows 7 after the end of extended support may be at a higher risk of encountering compatibility issues with newer software and hardware. Furthermore, as more and more software and services are designed with Windows 10 in mind, users of Windows 7 may find that they are no longer compatible with certain applications or online services. Despite these risks, some users may choose to continue using Windows 7, but it's essential to be aware of the potential consequences.",

Potential clues to unraveling the mysteries behind why some marine mammals are susceptible to mass strandings, scientists hope. In a study published Wednesday in The Journal of Experimental Biology, scientists showed that dolphins and whales used more energy to swim fast than to cruise at normal speeds. This may seem obvious, but marine mammals aren't supposed to get tired swimming. We have assumed that these master divers have adapted physiological workarounds that help them conserve oxygen and energy. And most of the time, they have. But this study suggests that vigorous swimming to avoid threats -- posed by people as well as predators -- could come at a cost to mammals that live in the seas. Terrie M. Williams, who studies ecophysiology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and her team worked with trainers to encourage the dolphins, as well as one retired theme park killer whale, to perform a variety of behaviors in large saltwater tanks. Some animals would rest at the surface or submerged, move in a straight line across a pool, cruise the perimeter or dive down to swim through hoops placed in different arrangements at the pool's bottom. To the sound of a whistle, they surfaced beneath a special hood and inhaled air while Dr. Williams measured their breathing and oxygen intake. The researchers found that when the dolphins swam at high speeds to navigate through the hoops, their oxygen consumption increased significantly, indicating that they were expending more energy than usual. In contrast, when they swam at slower speeds or rested, their oxygen intake returned to normal levels. The study's findings suggest that repeated episodes of high-energy swimming, such as those triggered by human activities like sonar use or fishing nets, could lead to physiological stress and even exhaustion in marine mammals. The researchers believe that this stress could contribute to the mass strandings that occur when dolphins and whales wash up on beaches, often dead or dying. The study's results have significant implications for conservation efforts and highlight the need for more research into the impact of human activities on marine mammal behavior and physiology.",

Unlike the old tube-style TV sets, which had lots of space to put speakers, these thin flat-panel displays leave very little room for speakers. Since speakers work by moving air, smaller speakers don't sound nearly as good. Here is the continued article:\n\n\"Small speakers also struggle to fill a room with sound, which is where sound bars come in. A sound bar is essentially a long, thin speaker that sits under or in front of your TV, and it's designed to project sound outward in all directions. This solves the problem of limited space behind a TV, and it also amplifies the sound so it can fill a room. Another benefit of sound bars is that they're often very easy to set up and use - simply plug them in, turn them on, and you're good to go. No need to worry about setting up separate speakers or worrying about bass response. Of course, not all sound bars are created equal, and the quality can vary widely depending on the brand and model. But for many people, a good sound bar can make a big difference in the viewing and listening experience.\"",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Airbnb agreed on Monday to settle a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, putting to rest litigation that could have hampered the company's efforts to expand and go public. In the settlement, Airbnb essentially agreed to San Francisco's demand to be more transparent about its hosts and to help enforce existing registration laws. It followed the company's dropping of a lawsuit in December over a New York law that fines people who illegally list their homes on short-term rental platforms. Taken together, the actions mean Airbnb has cleared up outstanding litigation in two of its biggest markets in the United States. The latest settlement removes a regulatory cloud over the company as it readies itself for a public offering, even though Airbnb, which is based in San Francisco and has a valuation of about $30 billion, still faces legal disputes in a handful of markets. The settlement is expected to bring a sigh of relief to Airbnb's investors, who have been watching the company's legal woes with concern. The company's public offering, which is expected to take place in the coming months, is seen as a major milestone in its growth and expansion. With the litigation cleared up in San Francisco and New York, Airbnb can now focus on its global expansion plans, which include entering new markets in Asia and Europe. The company's chief executive, Brian Chesky, has stated that the settlement is a major step forward for Airbnb and will allow it to continue to grow and innovate without the burden of legal uncertainty. The company's valuation, which has been steadily increasing over the past year, is expected to continue to rise as it prepares for its public debut.",

The reporter, Dan Heyman, wanted to ask about the health care legislation the House passed last week to replace the Affordable Care Act. With his Android smartphone in hand to use as an audio recorder, Mr. Heyman said in an interview on Wednesday, he reached over some of the staff and security members surrounding Mr. Price. According to an audio recording Mr. Heyman provided, he asked whether domestic violence was going to be a pre-existing condition under the new legislation. \"Do you think that's right, or not?\" he called out. He asked twice more and when there was no response, Mr. Heyman said: \"You refuse to answer? Tell me no comment.\" Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, was with Mr. Price, and at one point in the recording, a man's voice is heard saying: \"Do not get close to her. Back up.\" After persisting in his questions for nearly a minute, Mr. Heyman was pulled to the side by officers of the West Virginia Division of Protective Services, also known as the Capitol Police, handcuffed and charged with a misdemeanor count of willful disruption of governmental processes. He spent eight hours in a local jail before the news service posted a $5,000 bail for his release. The incident has sparked widespread outrage and criticism of the authorities' handling of the situation. Many have questioned the need for handcuffing and charging a reporter for simply asking questions, and some have accused the Trump administration of trying to intimidate and silence the media. The Public News Service has stood by Heyman, stating that he was simply doing his job and that the charges against him are \"baseless\".\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has also weighed in, calling the charges \"a clear violation of Heyman's First Amendment rights\". The organization has demanded that the charges be dropped and that the authorities apologize for their actions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has maintained that Heyman's actions were \"aggressive\" and \"disruptive\", and that the charges against him are justified. However, many have pointed out that Heyman's questions were legitimate and that the administration's response was disproportionate.\n\nThe incident has also raised concerns about the state of press freedom in the United States, with many worrying that the Trump administration is trying to restrict access to information and silence critical voices. As the controversy continues to unfold, many are calling for greater protections for journalists and for an end to the intimidation and harassment of the press.",

Waymo, the self-driving car unit that operates under Google's parent company, has signed a deal with the ride-hailing start-up Lyft, according to two people familiar with the agreement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The deal calls for the companies to work together to bring autonomous vehicle technology into the mainstream through pilot projects and product development efforts, these people said. The deal was confirmed by Lyft and Waymo. \"Waymo holds today's best self-driving technology, and collaborating with them will accelerate our shared vision of improving lives with the world's best transportation,\" a Lyft spokeswoman said in a statement. The partnership highlights the fluid nature of relationships in the self-driving-car sector. From technology companies to automakers to firms that manufacture components, dozens of players are angling for a slice of an autonomous vehicle market that many believe will ultimately be a multibillion-dollar industry. To gain an edge and outmuscle rivals, many of these players are forming alliances -- and sometimes shifting them. The deal between Waymo and Lyft has competitive implications for Uber, the world's biggest ride-hailing company, which has recently had to confront a spate of workplace and legal problems. Lyft is a distant No. 2 to Uber among ride-hailing services in the United States, and the two companies are bitter rivals. Waymo is also competing fiercely with Uber in the creation of technology for autonomous cars and is embroiled in a lawsuit over what it says is Uber's use of stolen Waymo trade secrets to develop such technology. Details about the deal between Waymo and Lyft were scant. The companies declined to comment on what types of products would be brought to market as a result of it or when the public might see the fruits of the collaboration. For Lyft, which has said it has no plans to develop its own self-driving-car technology, the deal with Waymo offers another way into the market. The partnership is expected to leverage Lyft's vast network of drivers and riders, as well as its expertise in ride-hailing, to accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. Waymo, on the other hand, will bring its cutting-edge autonomous driving technology to the table. The two companies plan to collaborate on pilot projects and product development efforts, with the goal of bringing autonomous vehicles to the mainstream market. The deal is seen as a significant win for Lyft, which has been struggling to keep up with Uber's dominance in the ride-hailing space. Meanwhile, Waymo's partnership with Lyft adds another major player to its roster of partners, further solidifying its position as a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry.",

As researchers have found vulnerabilities in internet-connected light bulbs, it is wise to be wary when connecting smart device to your home network. Wirelessly linked gadgets like security cameras, thermostats and baby monitors (usually called the Internet of Things) have been targets for intruders looking to invade or disrupt. A major cyberattack powered by compromised devices brought online traffic to a halt last fall, for example. A detailed post on the Heimdal Security blog can give you an idea of how intruders can abuse smart devices. To mitigate the risk, it's essential to secure your Wi-Fi network and smart devices. First, change the default admin password and login credentials for each device. Enable WPA2 encryption and set up a guest network to isolate visitors from your main network. Regularly update firmware and software to patch vulnerabilities. Use strong passwords and consider using a password manager to keep track of them. Additionally, enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. Finally, monitor your network activity and device behavior to detect any suspicious activity. By taking these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risk of your smart devices being exploited by cybercriminals.

When I type \"wall charger\" in Amazon, I get 32,819 results. Help me sort it out. The huge number of options out there can seem overwhelming. But it's not so bad once you know what to look for. Our top pick for a wall charger is Anker's PowerPort 4. It has four USB ports, each of which can provide up to 2.4 amps per port. Most devices you own can't draw more amperage than that, so this charger will charge most devices at top speed, including larger phones and tablets. The exceptions are newer devices compatible with USB-C PD and Qualcomm Quick Charge, but those technologies aren't quite ubiquitous yet. I lug my charger around. Could I carry it in my pocket? Would it weigh down a purse or bag? The PowerPort 4 is compact and lightweight, weighing in at just 6.4 ounces, making it easy to toss into a purse or backpack without adding significant bulk. The charger's compact size also means it won't get in the way when you're trying to use your devices. Anker's design is thoughtful, with a flat base that prevents the charger from tipping over and a retractable cord that keeps things tidy when not in use. The PowerPort 4 also features overheat protection, which prevents the charger from getting too hot and damaging your devices. With a price tag of around $20, it's an affordable option that won't break the bank. Overall, the Anker PowerPort 4 is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable and convenient wall charger.",

When Darwin visited the islands, it was the wide variety of finch beaks that helped him understand how one species could evolve into many. Now the Galapagos cormorants, the only species of cormorant to have lost the ability to fly, have enabled scientists to pin down the genes that led to this species' split from all other cormorants about two million years ago. They are genes that are present in birds, mammals and most animals, including even the worm often studied in laboratories: C. elegans. In fact, they are even present in some algae. Their ultimate effect varies, however. In humans and in the cormorants, the genes affect bone growth. But mutations in humans can cause some dreadful diseases; in the birds, they caused smaller wings, which were not effective for flight, and a weaker breastbone. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of flight in birds. By identifying the specific genes responsible for the loss of flight in the Galapagos cormorants, scientists can now investigate how this trait evolved in other bird species that have also lost the ability to fly. Additionally, the discovery of these genes in other animals, including humans, highlights the importance of understanding the evolutionary history of these traits in a broader context. Further research on these genes may also shed light on the development of diseases in humans, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, which is caused by mutations in the same genes. Overall, the study of the Galapagos cormorants is providing valuable insights into the complex and fascinating process of evolution.",

Though male elk, or bulls, rarely make it past 5 years old because they are targeted by hunters, female elk, or cows, can live as long as 20 years. Remarkably, cows over age 10 seem nearly invulnerable to hunters. A team of scientists wanted to know: What makes senior cows so survival-savvy? Is it because these elk are more cautious by nature, which made them better at evading hunters all along? Or is it nurture, and cows can learn to dodge hunters over their lifetime, even if they start out more daring? It seems both factors are at play, the researchers at the University of Alberta reported in PLOS One on Wednesday. The study, which analyzed data from over 1,000 elk in Alberta and British Columbia, found that older cows had a higher proportion of females in their social groups, which may have contributed to their increased survival rate. The researchers also discovered that cows that lived longer tended to have smaller home ranges, which may have reduced their exposure to hunters. Additionally, the study found that older cows were more likely to be in areas with more complex terrain, such as mountains and valleys, which can make it harder for hunters to track them. The findings suggest that a combination of natural caution, social behavior, and environmental factors all contribute to the remarkable survival rates of senior elk cows. The research has important implications for conservation efforts and wildlife management strategies.",

The article -- linking Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager and Trump confidant, to a Russian investment fund supposedly being investigated by the Senate -- was removed from CNN.com late last week after the network decided it could not fully stand by its reporting. The resignations are a black eye at a sensitive moment for the news organization, which has emerged as a regular target of Mr. Trump and his supporters. The president relishes dismissing the network's coverage as \"fake news,\" and his closest advisers have accused the channel of harboring a bias against Mr. Trump. CNN's president, Jeffrey A. Zucker, has invested enormous resources into political and investigative coverage of the Trump White House, and he was deeply upset by last week's reporting errors, according to two people briefed on the network's discussions over the weekend who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Zucker helped lead an internal inquiry that found the story was published despite concerns expressed by CNN's standards team, the people said. Thomas Frank, a veteran reporter who wrote the story; Lex Haris, executive editor of investigations; and Eric Lichtblau, an investigative editor and reporter hired from The New York Times in April, submitted resignations on Monday morning. It was the latest in a series of embarrassing episodes at CNN. The network fired Kathy Griffin, a host of its New Year's Eve special, after she published a photograph in which she appeared to brandish a facsimile of Mr. Trump's severed head. It cut ties with the host Reza Aslan after he assailed Mr. Trump in vulgar Twitter posts. And it issued a correction on another story that inaccurately predicted the congressional testimony of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director. By Monday night, some critics of CNN had already seized on the news. \"Fake News Blues,\" blared a headline on the right-wing website Breitbart News. The resignations sent shockwaves through the CNN newsroom, with many employees expressing sadness and disappointment at the loss of their colleagues. The network's top executives were expected to address the situation in a town hall meeting on Tuesday, where they would likely face tough questions from staff about the mistakes that led to the resignations. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's supporters were quick to pounce on the news, with many taking to social media to claim that the resignations were further evidence of CNN's \"fake news\" reputation. However, many journalism organizations and critics of the Trump administration defended the three journalists who resigned, saying that they had been unfairly targeted and that the mistakes were a result of a flawed reporting process, rather than any intentional bias.

In a federal court filing, Waymo said it was dropping three of its four claims over Uber violating its patents related to light detection and ranging sensor technology, or lidar. Lidar is a vital component in driverless car technology, helping the vehicle detect its surroundings to navigate roads. The case, an acrimonious battle between Waymo and Uber, spotlights the arms race surrounding autonomous vehicle talent and technology. It is especially significant for Google -- now Waymo -- which spent years working on driverless car technology before other tech companies took an interest. But as Waymo searches for a way to make money from self-driving cars, many of its best engineers have left for potential competitors, carrying valuable knowledge of its technology with them. The move is seen as a strategic one by Waymo, which is trying to de-escalate the tensions with Uber and focus on its own development of autonomous vehicle technology. By dropping some of its patent claims, Waymo is able to avoid a lengthy and costly court battle, and instead focus on its own innovations. The company has been working on perfecting its lidar technology, and has made significant progress in recent years. With this move, Waymo is signaling its commitment to continued innovation and its willingness to work with other companies to advance the field of autonomous vehicles.

But animals like wolves do not respect lines drawn on a map. And a recent study suggests that efforts to limit populations of these predators outside those borders is having negative effects on wolves living within the preserve. The study, published in June in Wildlife Monographs, suggests that when the Alaskan authorities were limiting wolf populations outside the Yukon-Charley preserve, survival rates of wolves within the preserve were lower than usual. The findings highlight the notion that managing wildlife within human-imposed boundaries requires communication and cooperation with the authorities beyond a preserve's boundaries, and could have implications for wildlife management programs elsewhere. Since the 1990s, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has spent millions of dollars, first sterilizing wolves, then shifting to shooting and killing hundreds of the animals from helicopters (independently, it announced the planned suspension of the program next year). The wolves were targeted as part of an intensive predator management program in the Upper Yukon-Tanana region aimed to increase the population of the Fortymile caribou herd in lands surrounding the preserve. Once estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands, the caribou herd fell to just 6,000 in the 1970s and now generally peaks at about 50,000 to 60,000. The study's findings have sparked debate among wildlife experts and conservationists, with some arguing that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's predator management program has been ineffective and even counterproductive. The program's goal of increasing the Fortymile caribou herd population has not been met, and the wolf population outside the preserve has not been significantly reduced. In fact, the study suggests that the program may have even pushed wolves into the preserve, where they compete with other predators for resources. The findings also raise questions about the ethics of killing wolves from helicopters, a practice that has been criticized by animal welfare groups. As the debate continues, conservationists are calling for a reevaluation of the predator management program and a more holistic approach to managing wildlife populations in the region.",

        "Text": "It is August, the month when a new generation of black-legged ticks that transmit Lyme and other diseases are hatching. On forest floors, suburban estates and urban parks, they are looking for their first blood meal. And very often, in the large swaths of North America and Europe where tick-borne disease is on the rise, they are feeding on the ubiquitous white-footed mice and other small mammals notorious for harboring pathogens that sicken humans. But it doesn't have to be that way. A new study suggests that the rise in tick-borne disease may be tied to a dearth of traditional mouse predators, whose presence might otherwise send mice scurrying into their burrows. If mice were scarcer, larval ticks, which are always born uninfected, might feed on other mammals and bird species that do not carry germs harmful to humans. Or they could simply fail to find that first meal. Ticks need three meals to reproduce; humans are at risk of contracting diseases only from ticks that have previously fed on infected hosts. For the study, Tim R. Hofmeester, then a graduate student at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and the lead researcher of the study, placed cameras in 20 plots across the Dutch countryside to measure the activity of foxes and stone martens, key predators of mice. The cameras revealed a stark contrast between areas with and without these predators. In plots where foxes and stone martens were present, mouse activity was significantly lower, and tick populations were correspondingly reduced. In contrast, areas with few or no predators saw a surge in mouse activity and tick populations. The study's findings suggest that the absence of natural predators is a key factor driving the rise in tick-borne disease. Hofmeester's team is now working to develop strategies to reintroduce these predators to areas where they are scarce, with the goal of reducing the tick population and mitigating the risk of disease transmission to humans.",

The authors of the study -- published last week in Psychological Science, the journal of the Association for Psychological Science -- found that heavier Asian-Americans are more likely to be perceived as \"American\" than those of a normal weight. The researchers, led by psychologist Sian Leah Beilock of the University of Chicago, surveyed over 1,000 people, asking them to rate the Americanness of Asian-American individuals based on their weight and other physical characteristics. The results showed that as Asian-Americans gained weight, their perceived Americanness increased, with heavier individuals being seen as more \"American\" than those of a normal weight.

Think of the mouse trying to outrun a cat -- moving in an erratic, unpredictable way makes it harder to catch. In humans, this sort of behavior is thought to be linked to creativity and cognitive complexity. But understanding the mind's capacity to produce randomness is difficult. Recently, a team from Europe pitted humans and computers against one another in a series of tasks designed to measure random choice-making. Around age 25, the researchers determined, people are best able to produce a random result. His team compiled five tasks of randomness. These included mimicking a series of random coin flips or dice rolls, guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, or arranging a grid of black and white boxes to look random. More than 3,400 people from 4 to 91 years old participated in the experiment. The researchers assessed how participants did by using software to generate algorithmic shortcuts for people's responses. The sequences that were hardest for the computer to account for were considered the most random. Measuring how participants performed against several factors, including age, sex and educational background, the researchers found a strong trend only with age. On average, performance improved from childhood to the mid-20s. As participants entered their mid-20s, their ability to produce truly random responses began to plateau, and then slowly declined. By age 30, performance was no longer significantly different from that of younger participants. The researchers suggested that this decline may be due to the increasing influence of cognitive biases and habitual thinking patterns that come with age. In contrast, the computer's ability to generate random sequences remained consistent throughout the experiment, highlighting the limitations of human randomness. The findings have implications for fields such as psychology, economics, and even gaming, where random decision-making is often crucial. For instance, the study's results could inform the design of games that require players to make unpredictable choices, or the development of algorithms that mimic human randomness. Ultimately, the research provides a fascinating glimpse into the complexities of human cognition and the elusive nature of true randomness.",

We don't cry when we should, and we cry for no reason. But let's take a moment to appreciate the clarity of crying while cutting onions. Onions make us teary because a reaction in the onion releases a chemical called lachrymatory factor, or LF, that irritates our eyes. Simply peeling an onion won't make your eyes water. But if you chop, cut, crush or smash one -- boohoo. The onion's cells break open, allowing two normally separated substances to combine. Linked together like pieces of a puzzle, they become a potent chemical weapon. \"It turns into a gas. It hits your eyes, and then it hits your sensory nerves in your eyes and causes them to tear up,\" said Josie Silvaroli, an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio who helped describe how these pieces fit together, structurally speaking, in a paper published in July in the journal ACS Chemical Biology. The exact mechanism of how onions release LF has been debated among scientists, but Silvaroli's research provides new insight into the process. According to her findings, the breaking down of onion cells triggers a cascade of chemical reactions that ultimately lead to the release of LF. This chemical then binds to the eyes' sensory nerves, stimulating the lacrimal gland to produce excess tears. While the exact reasons why humans cry in response to emotional stimuli remain unclear, Silvaroli's work sheds light on the biological processes that underlie our tearful responses to seemingly trivial stimuli like onions.",

In the earlier decision, a judge ruled that the three men -- George Elias IV, Ross Fowler and Stephen Hadford -- had not shown that the article was \"of and concerning\" them personally, apart from the fraternity. The article was written by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, who was named as a defendant, along with Rolling Stone and its parent company, Wenner Media. The ruling means that the three men can proceed with their lawsuit, which alleges that the article falsely accused them of being involved in the gang rape. The appeals court's decision was a setback for Rolling Stone, which had argued that the article was a work of journalism and not intended to defame specific individuals. The magazine's lawyers had also claimed that the article was a matter of public concern and therefore entitled to protection under the First Amendment. The ruling is a significant blow to Rolling Stone's efforts to resolve the litigation, which has been ongoing for several years.

They were declared no longer endangered in September 2016 after population estimates reached 1,864 -- not counting cubs. That's up from a low of about 1,200 in the 1980s. But even with that good news came a warning: Climate change and other factors could devastate the pandas' habitat in the longer term, rendering any population surge a temporary victory, the IUCN said. Exacerbating the problem is the fragmentation of China's panda population, confined now to just six mountain ranges and about 30 isolated groups, 18 of which contain no more than 10 individuals. Dr. Ouyang and colleagues note that Chinese restoration efforts have had a positive effect on panda habitats in recent years, and planned changes mean that \"various pressures on pandas and their habitat will likely decrease\" in the short-term, the study said. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns could lead to a decline in bamboo forests, the pandas' primary food source. Additionally, human activities such as deforestation, mining, and infrastructure development continue to threaten the pandas' habitat. To mitigate these risks, conservation efforts must be sustained and expanded to include not only habitat preservation but also research into the pandas' ecological needs and adaptability to climate change.

The venture, which Scaramucci hopes will be a digital news site and podcast network, has been months in the making, and Scaramucci is eager to share his vision with investors and potential partners. Despite his tumultuous past, Scaramucci remains optimistic about his chances of success, citing his extensive network of contacts in Washington and his ability to \"connect the dots\" between politics and business. \"I'm not a journalist, I'm a storyteller,\" Scaramucci said, his sling-bound arm waving emphatically as he spoke. \"And I've got a lot of stories to tell.\"",

        "Text": "Q. I'm about to purchase an iMac desktop computer. Are they as good as the old ones? I have an old MacBook on which I use AppleWorks. Will a new Mac convert it to a current word-processing program? A. Apple regularly updates its computers with faster processors, sharper screens and slicker software, so buying a new iMac gets you a machine that's technically better than an older model. However, you may have an adjustment period with the new hardware and the new operating system if you have not upgraded in several years. The Migration Assistant program included with new Macs can also help you move your files from the old machine to the new one, but older software may not run on a modern Mac. The old AppleWorks collection of office and art programs was officially retired more than 10 years ago, replaced by Apple's iWork suite. That software has evolved into three free programs (a word processor called Pages, spreadsheet software called Numbers and the Keynote presentation application) that work on Macs, on iOS devices and within a web browser. While the old AppleWorks software may not be compatible with your new iMac, the good news is that Apple provides a range of free alternatives that can help you transition to a modern word-processing program. The Pages app, which is part of the iWork suite, is a powerful and user-friendly word processor that can open and edit documents created in AppleWorks. You can also use Pages to create new documents from scratch, and it offers many advanced features such as formatting options, spell checking, and collaboration tools.\n\nAdditionally, the Numbers app in the iWork suite can help you transition from AppleWorks' spreadsheet capabilities to a more modern and powerful spreadsheet program. And if you need to create presentations, the Keynote app is a great alternative to AppleWorks' presentation software.\n\nTo make the transition even smoother, Apple also offers a range of online resources and tutorials that can help you learn how to use the new software. You can find these resources on Apple's website, as well as through the iWork suite's built-in help features. With a little practice, you should be able to get up and running with your new iMac and the iWork suite in no time.",

It has the ability to expel more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash at once -- 2,500 times more material than erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980, which killed 57 people. That could blanket most of the United States in a thick layer of ash and even plunge the Earth into a volcanic winter. Yellowstone's last supereruption occurred 631,000 years ago. And it's not the planet's only buried supervolcano. Scientists suspect that a supereruption scars the planet every 100,000 years, causing many to ask when we can next expect such an explosive planet-changing event. To answer that question, scientists are seeking lessons from Yellowstone's past. And the results have been surprising. Researchers have discovered that the supervolcano's past eruptions have been triggered by a complex interplay of geological and climatic factors. They found that changes in the Earth's orbit, shifts in the planet's magnetic field, and variations in global temperatures all played a role in awakening the volcano's fury. By studying these ancient events, scientists hope to develop a predictive model that can forecast when the next supereruption might occur. The findings have significant implications for global catastrophe preparedness and could potentially save thousands of lives. As one researcher noted, \"Understanding the triggers of Yellowstone's past eruptions is crucial to predicting when the next one will strike, and ultimately, to protecting our planet from the devastating consequences of a supereruption.\"",

Nicole Quenqua, formerly the company's top spokeswoman, said she was no longer giving company statements to reporters. Over the past week, the Weinstein Company has been at the center of a widening crisis involving Mr. Weinstein's brother, Harvey. Investigations by The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed sexual harassment and rape allegations against Harvey Weinstein going back decades. Harvey Weinstein, who has denied \"any allegations of non-consensual sex,\" was fired on Sunday by Weinstein Company board members, which include his brother. Several other members of the all-male board have quit, including Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor; Marc Lasry, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and chief executive of Avenue Capital Group, an investment firm; Tim Sarnoff, president of production services and deputy chief executive of Technicolor; and Richard Koenigsberg, an accountant, who resigned on Thursday. The Weinstein Company, with roughly 150 staff members in New York and Los Angeles, has assets that are potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It includes a television unit anchored by series like \"Project Runway.\" A theatrical division has seven completed films, including \"The Current War,\" a period drama about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse starring Benedict Cumberbatch, who said in a statement on Tuesday that he was \"utterly disgusted\" by Mr. Weinstein's \"horrifying and unforgivable actions.\" The crisis has also led to a exodus of talent and clients, with several major brands and organizations cutting ties with the company. On Monday, fashion designer Prabal Gurung announced he was no longer working with the company, citing the \"devastating\" allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Board of Review also announced they were ending their partnerships with the company. As the fallout continues, the future of the Weinstein Company remains uncertain, with many speculating about its potential sale or bankruptcy. Meanwhile, Harvey Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman, has announced she is leaving him, saying she is \"heartbroken\" by the allegations. The scandal has also sparked a wider conversation about sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry, with many women coming forward to share their own stories of abuse and exploitation.",

They emerge from the soil first like white eggs, abandoned by some mysterious creature of the woods. They can grow up to a foot tall, as warts appear on the cap. The mushroom often blushes red in the process. Finally, they crack open and flatten into a polka-dot disc that would make a gnome's perfect dinner plate.

Perhaps the most striking images came from Hungary, in a Facebook post, which included a video and a photo of a mushroom as big as a child. For many Eastern Europeans, mushroom hunting is a tradition. a cherished family activity that's been passed down through generations. In Hungary, where the mushroom was spotted, locals claim that the species is particularly abundant in the country's forests. \"It's a sign of good luck to find a fly agaric, especially one of this size,\" said Éva Szabó, a mushroom enthusiast from Budapest. \"We're thrilled to see these magnificent mushrooms making an appearance again this year.\" The fly agaric's striking appearance and large size have made it a favorite among mushroom hunters, who often seek out the species for its unique flavor and medicinal properties.

Outside of Netflix, nobody knows the answer. That's because, much to the frustration of those in the industry who would like to have a firm idea of just how popular those shows are, the streaming services -- Amazon and Hulu included -- have been fiercely protective of their numbers. Now, Nielsen, the 94-year-old company that for decades has had an effective monopoly on measuring television ratings in the United States, has announced that it has found a way into the great unknown of Netflix viewership. The deal, which was announced earlier this week, will allow Nielsen to track Netflix viewership through a new system that uses data from a sample of Netflix subscribers who have agreed to participate in the measurement process. The system, which is still in its pilot phase, uses a combination of traditional TV viewing data and online tracking to estimate the total number of viewers for each show. While the exact details of the system are still under wraps, industry insiders say it has the potential to revolutionize the way we measure TV audiences and provide a more accurate picture of who is watching what. If successful, the partnership could also pave the way for Nielsen to begin tracking viewership for other streaming services like Amazon and Hulu.",

To face the lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees that day, the internet companies are sending in their legal muscle: the general counsels. That way, the companies avoid putting their chief executives -- Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai of Google -- in the spotlight to deal with questions and the full-blown public relations crisis over whether they are contributing to an undermining of democracy. Here's who will appear in the congressional hearings:\n\nMr. Stretch, 48, became Facebook's general counsel in 2013 and has led the social network's internal review on foreign interference on its platform. He joined Facebook in 2010 and led negotiations of its settlement in 2011 with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that Facebook violated its privacy promises to users. That same year, Mr. Stretch directed the company's legal victory over charges by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss that Mr. Zuckerberg stole their idea for the social network during their days at Harvard. Mr. Stretch received his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth and law degree from Harvard, and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Mr. Walker, 56, joined Google as general counsel in 2006 from the online auction site eBay, where he served as deputy general counsel. During his time at Google, the company has been involved in several high-profile legal and regulatory battles, including YouTube's fight with Viacom in a landmark copyright case, and a lawsuit from Oracle over software copyrights. Mr. Walker is leading Google's efforts to challenge the European Commission's $2.7 billion fine for violating antitrust law by favoring its own shopping service over competitors. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Harvard and a law degree from Stanford, Mr. Walker worked as an assistant United States attorney at the Department of Justice. The two men have been preparing for weeks to defend their companies' actions and answer tough questions from lawmakers. Mr. Stretch has been reviewing Facebook's internal documents and preparing responses to potential questions about the company's handling of foreign interference on its platform. Mr. Walker, meanwhile, has been studying Google's online advertising practices and preparing to address concerns about the company's alleged bias in its search results.\n\nThe hearings are expected to be intense, with lawmakers from both parties seeking to hold the tech giants accountable for their role in the 2016 election. Mr. Stretch and Mr. Walker will face questions about the companies' data collection practices, their handling of disinformation campaigns, and their efforts to prevent foreign interference on their platforms.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Mr. Stretch and Mr. Walker are confident in their ability to defend their companies. \"We're proud of the work we've done to protect the integrity of our platforms,\" Mr. Stretch said in an interview. \"We're looking forward to having a constructive conversation with lawmakers about the issues that matter most to them.\" Mr. Walker echoed his sentiments, saying that Google is committed to being a responsible steward of the internet and will continue to work with lawmakers to address their concerns.",

The bids, received by last Thursday's deadline, came from so many places across the continent that it's perhaps simpler to note the ones that didn't fall over themselves to woo Amazon. The company did not provide a list, but a color-coded map posted on its website revealed the applicants came from all but seven American states -- North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Arkansas and Hawaii. In Canada, Yukon Territory and the provinces of Saskatchewan and New Brunswick were among those that said no thanks. In Mexico, on the other hand, Amazon's map shows just three applications, from the states of Chihuahua, Hidalgo and Queretaro. In all, Amazon said the proposals came from 54 states, provinces, districts and territories (including Puerto Rico). The company has said it will announce its decision sometime next year. When Amazon announced on Sept. 7 that it was taking bids for a second headquarters, which it calls HQ2, it kicked off weeks of chest-thumping, publicity stunts and prostration by cities and regions eager to lure the 50,000 high-paying jobs Amazon has promised for the new campus. The mayor of Washington, D.C., made a goofy viral video in which she sought to butter up Amazon by having a faux conversation with Alexa, Amazon's intelligent assistant. Tucson sent a 21-foot-tall saguaro cactus on a flatbed truck to Amazon in Seattle. In perhaps the most unusual offer, Calgary offered in newspaper ads and banners to fight a bear to win Amazon's new headquarters. As the proposals poured in, cities and regions got creative with their pitches. Some offered tax breaks and incentives, while others showcased their unique cultural attractions. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio even promised to rename a street \"Amazon Way\" if the company chose to locate there. In Philadelphia, officials offered a 10-year property tax abatement and a special \"Amazon Zone\" in the city's tax code.\n\nSome cities, however, took a more unconventional approach. In Toronto, the mayor and a group of entrepreneurs offered to start a hockey game against Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos, with the company's HQ2 location as the prize. In Los Angeles, the mayor promised to rename a portion of the 405 freeway \"Amazon Avenue\" if the company chose to locate in the city.\n\nDespite the excitement and creativity of the bids, some experts have questioned whether the competition has been fair. Some have argued that smaller cities and towns may not have the resources or infrastructure to compete with larger metropolises. Others have raised concerns about the potential negative impact of Amazon's arrival on local communities. As Amazon begins to review the proposals, the company will have to weigh these factors against its desire to find the perfect location for its new headquarters.",

        "Text": "Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco. The company is being called to account for its role played in the deception and chicanery that surrounded the 2016 presidential election. Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting. The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent. The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitter's reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russia's efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide. The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program. Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Google's parent company, this year. Digits allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages through Twitter's systems and did not reflect activity on the Twitter platform, the company said. As a result, the company lowered the number of monthly active users by two million for the first and second quarters of this year and by one million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Twitter said its data-retention policies made it unable to reconcile the figures for periods before last year's fourth quarter. \"Our estimates suggest the prior period adjustments are smaller than those in the fourth quarter of 2016,\" the company said. Twitter said that -- in addition to the uptick in daily active users -- it had experienced a 4 percent increase in monthly active users from the same period last year, to 330 million. The company's stock price was already under pressure due to concerns over slowing user growth and increased competition from other social media platforms. The latest revelation is likely to further erode investor confidence, analysts said. \"This is a black eye for Twitter, and it's going to take a lot to regain the trust of investors and users,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. Twitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, is scheduled to testify before Congress next month to answer questions about the company's role in the 2016 election. The company's disclosure comes as lawmakers are increasing pressure on social media companies to take responsibility for their role in spreading misinformation and propaganda. Twitter has faced criticism for its handling of fake accounts and bots, and its inability to prevent the spread of disinformation on its platform. The company has also been accused of being slow to respond to harassment and abuse on its platform. Despite the challenges, Twitter's daily active users have continued to grow, and the company remains one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. However, the latest revelation is likely to raise further questions about the company's transparency and accountability.",

On Wednesday, Facebook's top executives -- including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg -- spread a different message: one of profit. Around the time that Facebook wrapped up its attendance at hearings on Capitol Hill over Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election on Wednesday, the company reported another set of blockbuster financial results. Facebook said its revenue rose 47 percent to $10.3 billion in the third quarter from a year ago, with profit surging 79 percent to $4.7 billion, handily beating Wall Street expectations. The results showcased Facebook's moneymaking strength in online advertising, which is precisely what the Silicon Valley company has been under fire for in Washington this week. The juxtaposition of Facebook's financial success with the ongoing controversy over Russian interference on its platform was not lost on lawmakers, who have been critical of the company's handling of the issue. \"It's ironic that Facebook is celebrating its financial success while still refusing to take meaningful action to prevent the spread of misinformation and foreign interference on its platform,\" said Senator Mark Warner, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Its scientific name is Armillaria ostoyae, but you can call it The Humongous Fungus. It's the largest known terrestrial organism on the planet, according to the United States Forest Service. It's also a deadly forest pathogen. Although none (that we know of) are as big, there are many others in the Armillaria genus. Despite its massive size, The Humongous Fungus is a relatively slow-moving creature, with some estimates suggesting it may take centuries for it to move just a few feet. Its massive size has allowed it to outcompete other organisms for resources, and it plays a crucial role in breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients in the forest ecosystem. However, its ability to infect and kill trees has also made it a major threat to the forest's biodiversity. Scientists are working to better understand the fungus's behavior and spread, in the hopes of developing strategies to mitigate its impact on the forest. Meanwhile, The Humongous Fungus remains a fascinating and unsettling reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of life on Earth.",

Your sense of smell may fluctuate in sensitivity over the course of 24 hours, in tune with our circadian clocks, with your nose best able to do its job during the hours before you go to sleep, according to a study published last month. The work, reported in the journal Chemical Senses, is part of a larger push to explore whether adolescents' senses of taste and smell influence obesity. Rachel Herz, a sensory researcher at Brown University, and her colleagues designed this study to see if there might be times of day when the sense of smell was more powerful -- perhaps making food smell particularly inviting. making food smell particularly inviting. To test this theory, the researchers recruited 36 healthy young adults and asked them to rate the intensity of a series of smells at different times of day. The participants were shown a series of common scents, including coffee, peppermint, and lavender, and asked to rate how strong they perceived each smell to be. The results showed that the participants' sense of smell was indeed more sensitive in the evening hours, with the most significant improvement in smell detection occurring around 8pm. The researchers speculate that this natural fluctuation in sense of smell may have implications for our eating habits, with potentially stronger smells in the evening leading to increased cravings for certain foods. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between our sense of smell and our appetite, but the findings suggest that the old adage \"wake up and smell the roses\" may not be as straightforward as it seems.",

You definitely picked the best one in all of the land. But that's where you messed up. The most beautiful Christmas trees don't grow in soil. They're not even plants. And you shouldn't take them home or decorate them. These animals live on coral reefs in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, building tiny, tubular homes with their own secretions of calcium carbonate. They emerge from these tubes to filter feed, procreate and breathe with a part of their body called the branchial crown. You can't miss these bright, spiral-shaped cones while snorkeling, if you know what to look for. They look like miniature decorated firs. \"They're really pretty, very colorful, very festive and Christmassy,\" said Orly Perry, a marine biologist studying them as a doctoral student at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. Most of the \"trees,\" which come in pairs, protrude no more than an inch from the tube's opening. But they make up for small size with colorful displays that look like the work of a talented candymaker. Many spiral out in a mixture of purples, greens and whites where Mrs. Perry works on the Gulf of Aqabain the Red Sea near Eilat, Israel. But they come in many other colors, too, and some even don an appropriate solid winter white. They don't burrow into it. Instead, they latch on to a dead spot or wound and start making their tubes. By adjusting the tube's growth rate to match the coral's growth, the worm keeps up with the coral growing around its tube and maintains an entrance to its home. Settled Christmas tree worms stay for life -- up to 30 or 40 years. \"They cannot say 'this is not for me' and move,\" said Mrs. Perry. \"It's crucial to look for the right place.\" These remarkable creatures have been fascinating marine biologists for years, and their unique habitats are a major draw for scuba divers and snorkelers. \"It's like discovering a hidden treasure,\" said Perry. \"You swim along, and suddenly, you see this little Christmas tree poking out of the coral. It's a real treat.\" But despite their festive appearance, Christmas tree worms are more than just a pretty face. They play a crucial role in the coral reef ecosystem, helping to keep the coral clean and healthy by filtering out debris and excess nutrients. And their tubes can even provide a safe haven for other marine animals, such as fish and shrimp, to hide from predators. So, if you're planning a dive or snorkeling trip to a tropical or subtropical location, be sure to keep an eye out for these underwater \"trees\" - they're a real treat for the eyes and a vital part of the marine ecosystem.",

For more than a half-century, Dr. Von Herzen worked at the nation's pre-eminent centers for ocean research: the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. As it turned out, his early career was nicely timed to address a great controversy. In 1912, Alfred Wegener, a German geophysicist, proposed that the continents move around slowly like parts of a giant jigsaw puzzle -- as suggested by the shoulder of South America's fitting neatly into the armpit of Africa. The idea prompted waves of ridicule and debate that went on for decades. As the debate raged on, Von Herzen's groundbreaking discoveries in the 1950s and 60s provided crucial evidence to support Wegener's theory of continental drift. His team's findings of hot springs and hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor challenged the prevailing view of a static Earth and solid crust.

Not at all, said Martha Delaney, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and lead author on the study, which was published in the journal Veterinary Pathology earlier this month. Rather, she said, these particular cases, one of glandular cancer and another of stomach cancer, may provide additional clues as to what makes mole rats so much less susceptible to cancer than other rodents and species with long life spans. According to Delaney, the discovery of cancer in the mole rats highlights the complexity of the rodents' cancer resistance. \"It's not a simple matter of a single gene or mechanism that makes them resistant,\" she said. \"It's likely a combination of factors, including their unique biology and environment.\" The researchers are now working to identify the specific factors that contribute to the mole rats' cancer resistance, which could potentially lead to the development of new cancer therapies.

He died five years ago at the advanced age of 16 -- twice the life span of the average cheetah in the wild -- but not before geneticists drew his blood. Along with blood samples from six other cheetahs from Namibia and East Africa, his has now been used to sequence the species' complete genome -- its full set of chromosomes. With their spotted coats and black \"teardrop\" facial markings, cheetahs are a favorite of tourists on photographic safaris. The animals race across the African savanna at speeds close to 60 miles per hour because of their unique physiology: elongated legs, aerodynamic skull, enlarged adrenal glands and heart muscles, and claws that grip the earth like football cleats. The completed genome sequence has provided scientists with a wealth of information about the evolutionary history of cheetahs. By analyzing the genetic data, researchers have been able to pinpoint the exact mutations that allowed cheetahs to develop their remarkable speed. The study has also shed light on the cheetah's unique adaptations, such as their specialized claws and aerodynamic skull, which enable them to achieve such high speeds.

But the concept often falls flat, as readers see through awkward advertorials and as the logos of eager corporate sponsors overtake pop-culture events like South by Southwest. And then there is Red Bull Music Academy. On its face, it should be objectionable, or at least annoying: An energy drink known for its association with extreme sports sponsors a highbrow music festival. But for 18 years, the event has built a rare kind of credibility, attracting otherwise elusive musical figures like Brian Eno, La Monte Young, Ryuichi Sakamoto and D'Angelo, and drawing critical acclaim. Its existence seems proof that branded content can actually be good. Despite the initial skepticism, Red Bull Music Academy has managed to carve out a niche for itself as a respected and sought-after platform for musicians and music enthusiasts alike. The event's success can be attributed to its ability to strike a delicate balance between commercial interests and artistic integrity. Rather than bombarding attendees with overt product placement, Red Bull has taken a more subtle approach, integrating its brand into the festival's programming and atmosphere in a way that feels organic and authentic.\n\nAs a result, the event has become a magnet for musicians who are looking for a unique and inspiring environment to share their work. The festival's eclectic lineup has featured everything from avant-garde electronic music to soulful R&B, and its workshops and lectures have provided a platform for artists to share their knowledge and expertise with a global audience. With its reputation for excellence and commitment to quality, Red Bull Music Academy has proven that branded content can, indeed, be a powerful force for good in the music world.",

Next month, the Universal Studios theme park here will unveil a large Potter-themed expansion intended to attract families, a demographic that has traditionally been owned by nearby Disneyland. But Universal on Sunday threw some surprise red meat at its teenage fan base: \"The Walking Dead\" is also going to set up permanent residency at the park. An expansive haunted house, built with the creative team behind the AMC horror drama \"The Walking Dead,\" will be located across the entry plaza from the new Hogsmeade, Universal said. A promotional video for the undead attraction, set to open this summer, showed a building in flames and zombies clawing at theme park visitors through holes in a chain-link fence. \"We're trying to be crossgenerational,\" Larry Kurzweil, president of Universal Studios Hollywood, said in a phone interview. \"This is going to be a once-anywhere, immersive attraction that takes it truly over the top.\" The haunted house, titled \"Survival of the Fittest,\" will feature state-of-the-art special effects, animatronics, and live actors to create an intense and terrifying experience for visitors. The attraction will be designed to resemble a post-apocalyptic city, with crumbling buildings and debris-filled streets. According to Universal, the creative team behind \"The Walking Dead\" has been heavily involved in the design and development of the haunted house, ensuring that it stays true to the show's dark and gritty tone. Fans of the series can expect to see nods to iconic characters and locations, including the infamous prison and Woodbury. With this new attraction, Universal Studios Hollywood is hoping to attract a new audience and create a unique experience that will set it apart from other theme parks in the area.",

Dr. Shapley, a mathematician and emeritus professor at U.C.L.A., was considered one of the fathers of game theory, which tries to explain the choices that competitors make in situations that require strategic thinking. The \"Shapley value,\" named for him, is a concept through which the benefits of cooperation can be proportionally divided among participants based on their relative contribution. He was a close friend and mentor to John Forbes Nash Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who had schizophrenia. Sylvia Nasar, a former reporter for The New York Times, devoted a chapter in her 1998 biography of Mr. Nash, \"A Beautiful Mind,\" to the men's friendship. Dr. Shapley's work had a profound impact on various fields, including economics, politics, and sociology. His theory of cooperative games has been applied to a wide range of situations, from negotiations between countries to the allocation of resources in a company.

At two forest-research sites in Minnesota, scientists tested how the respiration rates of 10 different species of trees -- from boreal and temperate forests -- were affected by increases in temperature over a period of three to five years, using heating cables to warm some of the trees. The trees were monitored in two conditions: ambient, and about 6 degrees warmer than that. The results were a surprise to the researchers. Instead of a five-fold increase in respiration, the trees showed a relatively modest increase of around 20-30%. This suggests that the trees may be more resilient to rising temperatures than previously thought. The scientists also found that the different tree species responded differently to the warming, with some showing more significant changes in respiration than others. The study's lead author, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, noted that the findings have important implications for understanding how forests will respond to climate change. \"These results highlight the need for more research on the complex interactions between trees and their environment,\" she said.

She was responding to a shooting at a backyard party on March 9 in Wilkinsburg, Pa., that killed five people, including a pregnant woman. No one has been arrested, and the police have not yet publicly identified suspects. Yet in her Facebook post on March 21, which was later edited and eventually deleted, Ms. Bell played detective in a way that some felt relied on damaging stereotypes. \"You needn't be a criminal profiler to draw a mental sketch of the killers who broke so many hearts two weeks ago Wednesday,\" she wrote.

These boys have been in the system before. They've grown up there. They know the police. They've been arrested.\" In the same post, Ms. Bell mentioned a hard-working, young, black man whom she saw working at a restaurant, praising him in a way that came across as patronizing. \"I wonder how long it had been since someone told him he was special,\" she wrote. Ms. Bell did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. Station officials moved last week to take her off the air and distance themselves from the remarks. Charles W.

The new documents were released by an activist research organization, the Center for International Environmental Law, which published the project on its website. The documents, according to the environmental law center's director, Carroll Muffett, suggest that the industry had the underlying knowledge of climate change even 60 years ago. \"From 1957 onward, there is no doubt that Humble Oil, which is now Exxon, was clearly on notice\" about rising CO in the atmosphere and the prospect that it was likely to cause global warming, he said. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies and other organizations had created a group, the Smoke and Fumes Committee, to monitor and conduct pollution research, and to \"use science and public skepticism to prevent environmental regulations they deemed hasty, costly and unnecessary,\" according to the center's description of the documents on its website. Those actions, Mr. Muffett suggested, would be echoed in later efforts to undermine climate science. The center's work was first reported by Inside Climate News, which has published stories, as did The Los Angeles Times, suggesting that Exxon Mobil understood the risks of climate change from its own research, which it used to plan activities such as drilling in the Arctic, while it funded groups into the mid-2000s that denied serious climate risks. Those earlier investigations led to a surge in activism against the company and the energy industry, using the hashtag #exxonknew. The investigations also have been cited by attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, who have demanded information from Exxon about its internal research and its funding of climate denial. Inside Climate News announced that Wednesday's article is the first of a series based on the work of the environmental law center and documents it has amassed on its own. The new documents have sparked renewed calls for accountability from Exxon and the energy industry, with many urging the company to come clean about its knowledge of climate change and its role in spreading misinformation. \"These documents show that Exxon and the industry knew about climate change decades ago, and yet they continued to fund disinformation campaigns to delay action,\" said Andrew Logan, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"It's time for Exxon to stop hiding behind its lawyers and start telling the truth about what it knew and when.\" The pressure on Exxon is also coming from within its own ranks, with some former employees speaking out about the company's role in climate denial. \"I was shocked and dismayed by the company's efforts to undermine climate science,\" said one former Exxon engineer, who wished to remain anonymous. \"It was clear to me that the company was more interested in protecting its profits than in protecting the planet.\" The controversy is likely to continue to unfold in the coming weeks and months, with many calling for a full investigation into Exxon's activities and the energy industry's role in climate change. In the meantime, the company's reputation is likely to continue to suffer, with many calling for a boycott of its products and services.",

And the change is spilling out into the nation's colleges and the country over all. Census data predicts that by 2050 the United States will be majority-minority as well. As I see these changes, I continue to ask, Are our college and university faculties ready to teach a diverse student body? Unfortunately, I don't think so. Faculty members receive little, if any, training on teaching, and even less on diversity issues. This makes for a troubling situation around learning in the near future. For nearly two decades, I have been studying the innovative strategies for student success used by the nation's minority-serving institutions, or MSIs, which include historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, and Asian-American, Native American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions. Most recently, with Clifton Conrad, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I wrote a book on this topic, \"Educating a Diverse Nation\" (Harvard University Press). Our book details the lessons from minority-serving institutions that all faculty members can benefit from and use in the classroom. First, MSIs assume success on the part of students rather than seeing students of color from a deficit perspective. These institutions understand that students of color bring diverse experiences, strengths, and perspectives to the classroom, and they tailor their instruction to build on these assets. For example, at the University of California, Los Angeles, the Chicano Studies Department offers courses that incorporate students' cultural knowledge and language skills, such as a class on Chicano literature that is taught in Spanish. Similarly, at historically black colleges and universities, faculty members often draw on the rich cultural heritage of the African diaspora to enrich their teaching and learning. By adopting these approaches, all faculty members can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that values the diversity of their students.",

But efforts to address the problem are developing in too scattershot a fashion, largely because of widespread confusion about the role of the university in responding to sexual assault. Institutions of higher education cannot substitute for a functioning criminal justice system, where the interests of the state are vindicated. Nor should they try to replicate the civil justice model, in which plaintiffs sue defendants to vindicate their own interests. Rather, universities have interests that are distinct. Their response to sexual assault demands a focus on their core mission: providing education in a manner that does not discriminate based on sex. By prioritizing education and creating a safe and supportive learning environment, universities can foster a culture of respect and accountability, where students feel empowered to report incidents and seek help without fear of retribution. This requires a nuanced understanding of the complex power dynamics at play on campus, as well as a commitment to transparency and accountability in handling allegations of sexual assault.

        "Text": "A decision by the Supreme Court overturning its 2003 ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger and ending the ability of universities and colleges to consider race as one among several factors informing \"holistic\" admissions decisions would be far-reaching in its harm. The experience in California over the last two decades is instructive. In 1997, the year before a statewide ban on affirmative action went into effect, the incoming classes of undergraduates at Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles, were both approximately 8 percent African-American. Last year, only 4.3 percent of U.C.L.A. 's incoming class was African-American and at Berkeley the percentage was just 2.8 percent. During this period, the percentage of black college-age residents in California remained unchanged. The impact of California's ban, which was the result of a ballot initiative, is clear. It is, therefore, an oddity of the debate over affirmative action that even as the status quo is challenged, few dispute the ways in which a variety of beliefs and perspectives yields better ideas than would emerge from a single vantage point. Without a truly diverse student body and faculty, a university simply will be unable to achieve the highest levels of excellence in teaching, research and intellectual discovery. In a diverse student body, students from different backgrounds bring unique experiences and perspectives, fostering a richer learning environment. A lack of diversity can lead to a homogenous groupthink, stifling creativity and innovation. Moreover, a diverse student body can help to attract and retain top faculty and staff, who are drawn to institutions that value and celebrate diversity. The consequences of a Supreme Court decision overturning affirmative action would be far-reaching, with devastating effects on the quality of education and the diversity of the student body. Universities and colleges would be forced to rely on other factors, such as socioeconomic status or geographic location, to inform their admissions decisions, leading to a less representative and less diverse student body. This would ultimately harm not only students of color but also the institutions themselves, which would struggle to maintain their reputation for excellence and innovation.",

Dutch researchers examining two frozen swordfish discovered that there is an oil-producing gland at the base of the sword, connected by capillaries to pores in the skin of the head. The oil is secreted only on the head of the fish, not on its body. The researchers, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez at the University of Amsterdam, believe that this unique oil may help swordfish achieve speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, making them one of the fastest swimming fish in the ocean. The team is now studying the chemical composition of the oil to understand its exact effects on the fish's movement. Preliminary results suggest that the oil may reduce drag and enhance the fish's ability to cut through the water. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, but the discovery has already sparked excitement among marine biologists and engineers, who see potential applications in the development of more efficient underwater vehicles.",

For some, there may be other feelings, too: a pang in the back, a kick to the lower abdomen, an urgency in the bladder. These are symptoms that often come with passing a kidney stone -- an event that may not be entirely unexpected on certain roller coasters, according to a new study. A silicone cast of the inside of a kidney researchers used to study kidney stones and roller coasters. The authors found that moderate-intensity, rattling coasters might be effective at dislodging little kidney stones in the outer ducts of the kidney and propelling them toward the ureter, the tube connecting the kidneys and bladder. Their report, published last week in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, suggests that riding these roller coasters might help patients who have kidney stones that are five millimeters or less in diameter. \"The idea is to displace these little stones before they become big stones and cause a lot of pain and suffering,\" said David Wartinger, a professor emeritus at Michigan State University who was an author of the study. Dr. Wartinger said he was inspired to do the study after seeing multiple patients who had passed kidney stones after going to an amusement park. Most notable, one patient passed kidney stones after each of three consecutive rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Disney World in Florida. He teamed with Marc Mitchell, a urologist at the Doctors Clinic, to create a 3D-printed silicone cast of a patient's kidney. The researchers filled their life-size model with kidney stones and urine and headed to Disney World. Holding their model at kidney height, the doctors took 20 rides on Big Thunder Mountain, with three stones in the model at a time. They saw kidney stones move from the periphery of their kidney model toward the top of the ureter in many cases. Success rates were higher in the back of the roller coaster than the front -- 64 percent versus 17 percent -- probably because a bumpier ride in the back meant more jostling. More than 300,000 Americans seek emergency care for kidney stones a year, mostly because of severe pain from having a large kidney stone stuck in their ureter. It's unlikely that a roller coaster ride would do them much good. The study's findings may seem counterintuitive, but Dr. Wartinger emphasized that the researchers didn't recommend riding roller coasters as a replacement for medical treatment. \"This is not a substitute for professional care,\" he cautioned. \"If you have a kidney stone, you should see a doctor.\" Instead, the study suggests that moderate-intensity roller coasters could be a complementary therapy for patients with small kidney stones. The authors plan to conduct further research to explore the effects of different types of roller coasters and the potential benefits for patients with larger stones. For now, thrill-seekers with kidney stones may want to consider hitting the amusement park for a ride, but only after consulting with their doctor.",

Along with the recent suits involving \"Happy Birthday to You\" and Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land,\" the case has focused attention on one of the central questions in copyright: finding a balance between protecting intellectual property on behalf of private owners, and giving the public access to famous songs whose origins may be murky. For \"We Shall Overcome\" and \"This Land,\" the issue is also freighted with politics at a time when the songs are being embraced by protesters and activists on multiple sides of major issues. The lawsuit, filed by a musicologist who claims to have discovered a earlier version of the song, argues that the copyright held by the song's publishers is invalid. The publishers, who have been granted a copyright extension that will keep the song under their control until 2052, contend that the song's origins are well-documented and that the lawsuit is an attempt to undermine their rights.

That's because they're living in the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, where toxic leftovers from the manufacture of chemicals like DDT and the infamous Agent Orange oozed into surrounding waterways to be taken up by the animals that inhabited them. It's an evolutionary miracle some of these animals are even alive. No, seriously. A fish that adapted to survive in this water shows evolution at its finest, according to a study published Thursday in Science. The Atlantic killifish is a slippery sliver of silver about the size of a fat finger and as common as the minnow. Starting in the late 1990s, researchers became aware that the fish was tolerant of the toxic waters at the Lower Passaic Superfund site and at least three other highly polluted areas along the Atlantic coastline. The new study found that over just a few decades, distinct populations of killifish independently developed similar genetic adaptations that make life possible in the most unlikely environments. The findings show that evolution doesn't have to start in one place to be repeated. These genetic adaptations allowed the killifish to thrive in environments that would be lethal to most other species. The study's lead author, Dr. Patricia Hunt, described the process as \"evolution in real-time.\" The researchers analyzed DNA samples from killifish populations at the Superfund site and found that they had developed unique genetic traits that enabled them to survive in the toxic waters. These traits included changes to their liver enzymes, which helped to detoxify the chemicals in the water, and modifications to their skin, which allowed them to absorb oxygen more efficiently. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of evolution and adaptation, and could potentially inform strategies for cleaning up polluted environments. As Dr. Hunt noted, \"This study shows that evolution is not just a slow process that occurs over thousands of years, but can happen rapidly in response to changing environmental conditions.\"",

You dive in, swim down a few feet and look up at the fish clouds. For the best view, head out early. But if you can't make it soon, don't worry: They are there every day, unlike the more famous sardines that migrate by the billions to the coastal waters of South Africa only in the summer. The sardines' schooling behavior is sometimes called a bait ball, and it confuses most predators and very likely helps the sardines to survive. But it doesn't always work out for them. In 2010, Simon Oliver, a conservation biologist now at the University of Chester in Britain, got lucky and captured video of the thresher shark, which has a unique workaround to counter the bait ball: a really long tail. The sharks slap at the ball with sickle-shaped tails specially adapted for the task, at speeds averaging 30 miles per hour, stunning some of the fish. The sardines drop from the ball, and the sharks swim over to gobble them up. Why are the sardines there? That remains somewhat of a mystery. Until recently, when the sardine industry started worrying about the dwindling numbers of the fish offshore, no one had really thought to study them, let alone the smaller groups found closer to shore. Researchers have since launched a series of studies to better understand the behavior and habits of the sardines in the Philippines. Led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a team from the University of the Philippines has been tracking the sardines' movements and behavior using satellite tags and underwater cameras. Their findings have shed new light on the sardines' migratory patterns and their role in the local ecosystem.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers have discovered that the sardines in the Philippines are not a single species, but rather a mix of several species that converge in the same area. This diversity is thought to be a key factor in their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and avoid predators.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by predators like the thresher shark, the sardines in the Philippines are considered a vital component of the local food chain.

Scientists aren't sure why Earth was stifling hot for several million years during the Cretaceous period, but according to Dr. Tarduno, the prevailing hypothesis is that the atmosphere was filled with heat-trapping carbon dioxide, most likely the result of extraordinary volcanic activity. The resulting greenhouse effect would have transformed the polar ecosystem into a place where Tingmiatornis arctica and its prey could thrive. The warming period, known as the Turonian age, is estimated to have lasted from 93.9 million to 89.8 million years ago. At its coldest, it is estimated that the Arctic got around 57 degrees Fahrenheit. In his time exploring the snowcapped brown hills and thick glaciers of Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic, Dr. Tarduno has come across two wing bones belonging to this species of bird. He uncovered the first humerus in 1999. The discovery of the second humerus, found in 2019, provides further evidence of the bird's presence in the region during the Turonian age. According to Dr. Tarduno, the fact that the bird's remains were found in a relatively pristine state suggests that the area was not glaciated during this time period, contradicting previous theories. The team's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's climate during the Cretaceous period and the evolution of life in the Arctic region.

Budweiser, which also ran an ad celebrating its brewing process, was mentioned more than 234,000 times on social media during the game, with nearly half of the comments expressing a positive sentiment and many more neutral, according to Amobee, which tracks digital response to brands. In stark contrast, another much-talked-about spot was Nationwide's morbid commercial that showed a young boy saying that he will never learn to ride a bike, get \"cooties,\" learn to fly, travel the world or marry because he died from a preventable accident. While the brand was trying to highlight its \"Make Safe Happen\" program about increasing safety at home, the spot angered viewers. Nationwide was mentioned more than 238,000 times on social media, with 64 percent of those comments negative, according to Amobee. (Nationwide ran another spot featuring the actress Mindy Kaling that seemed to resonate more positively.) \"The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance,\" Nationwide said in a statement. \"We want to build awareness of an issue that is near and dear to all of us -- the safety and well being of our children.\" Another highlight was a commercial for Procter & Gamble's Always feminine products that asked what it meant to do a physical activity \"like a girl.\" The ad focused on how girls often lose their confidence after they go through puberty. It showed little girls answering the question by running fast and punching strong, while older children and adults answered by acting weak. The Procter & Gamble ad was widely praised for its empowering message and garnered over 1.4 million online views by Monday evening. In contrast, Nationwide's somber commercial sparked a heated debate on social media, with many viewers criticizing the brand for its perceived insensitivity and morbid tone. The backlash was so intense that Nationwide's CEO, Kerry Byrne, issued a statement apologizing for any offense caused and reiterating the company's commitment to promoting child safety. Meanwhile, Budweiser's lighthearted ad featuring the Clydesdales and the lost puppy continued to delight viewers, cementing its status as one of the most popular and effective Super Bowl ads of all time. The lesson from this year's game seems clear: when it comes to advertising, it's often better to go with a heartwarming, feel-good approach rather than a more serious or controversial one.",

He was 88. The cause was pneumonia, his wife, Elizabeth, said. Mr. Meryman credited an adventure story he shared at his first job interview with Life as the reason he was hired as a novice writer in 1949. He had just returned from a cross-country trip with two college friends -- one was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the future senator -- that began in a 1935 Packard hearse. Thwarted by a broken axle, fired on the first day of a backbreaking job at the Hungry Horse Dam in Montana, and broke, they never made it to their destination, Alaska. Instead they hopped freight trains back home. He went on to become the magazine's first human affairs editor, writing profiles of extraordinary people in everyday life, including a struggling family on Chicago's South Side and a single mother giving up her baby for adoption. Meryman's writing career spanned over six decades, during which he penned articles on a wide range of subjects, from politics to entertainment. He was known for his ability to connect with his subjects, often forming lasting friendships with the people he wrote about. In addition to his work on Life, Meryman also wrote for other publications, including The New Yorker and The Saturday Evening Post.

The channel will include links for buying the books and related merchandise. Black Mask Studios was founded in 2012 by Mr. Pizzolo, a filmmaker; Steve Niles, a writer of horror novels and comics; and Brett Gurewitz, a musician and founder of Epitaph Records. The impetus was \"Occupy Comics,\" a comic book project to raise money to support the Occupy Wall Street movement. \"It put a light on how difficult it was to get out comics with a message in them,\" Mr. Pizzolo said. Soon, Black Mask will have a much broader platform from which to deliver its message. Before the International Comic Con in July in San Diego, the company will release part one of the animated version of \"Godkiller.\" Last month, Kirkus Reviews described the comic's first volume as \"wickedly delectable\" and \"not so much a story as an experience.\" An animated version of \"Liberator\" will follow. Black Mask is also developing three comic-based television series: \"Sinatoro,\" by Grant Morrison and Vanesa Del Rey; \"The Disciples,\" by Mr. Niles and Christopher Mitten; and \"Ballistic,\" by Adam Egypt Mortimer and Darick Robertson. The company remains small, with only a handful of employees and a group of freelancers. \"We take advantage of the existing infrastructure behind my film company and Brett's various companies,\" Mr. Pizzolo said. \"Black Mask itself is built very much like a start-up. The goal is to expand the company's reach and create a new revenue stream. \"We're not just a comic book publisher, we're a content creator,\" Mr. Pizzolo said. The YouTube channel will also feature exclusive content, such as behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with creators. The company is exploring other digital platforms, including streaming services and social media, to distribute its content. With its expanded reach, Black Mask hopes to attract a new audience to its comics and other projects. \"We want to make sure that our message is getting out to as many people as possible,\" Mr. Pizzolo said. The company's growth is expected to be a significant boost to the independent comic book industry, which has historically struggled to gain mainstream recognition. With its innovative approach and diverse range of titles, Black Mask is poised to make a lasting impact on the world of comics.",

Aspiro, which is publicly traded in Sweden, operates subscription streaming services under the brands WiMP and Tidal, which entered the United States market last fall. Jay Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, made his offer for Aspiro in late January through an entity he controls, Project Panther Bidco. Aspiro shareholders had until Wednesday to consider the offer, which needed 90 percent approval for Project Panther to take it over. \"All conditions for completion of the offer have been fulfilled, and the offer is therefore declared unconditional,'' Project Panther said in a statement on Friday. The acquisition is expected to create a significant player in the music streaming market, with Tidal's high-fidelity audio and WiMP's global reach posing a challenge to Spotify and Apple Music. Jay Z has been a vocal advocate for artists' rights and fair compensation, and the acquisition is seen as a way for him to promote a more equitable model for the music industry.

Over the past 15 years or so, scientists have learned how to construct materials that bend light waves, as well as radar, radio, sound and even seismic waves, in ways that do not naturally occur. First theorized in 1967 by the Russian physicist Victor Veselago and invented in 1999 by a group led by the physicist David R. Smith, the new design approach was first seen as a curiosity that hinted at science fiction applications like invisibility cloaks. but it has since evolved into a revolutionary technology with far-reaching implications. Today, metamaterials are being used to create advanced sensors, antennas, and even medical devices. For example, researchers have developed metamaterials that can detect specific types of cancer by analyzing the way light interacts with a patient's tissue. Similarly, metamaterials are being used to improve the efficiency of solar panels and reduce the cost of energy storage. As the technology continues to advance, it's likely that we'll see even more innovative applications emerge, transforming industries and changing the way we live and work.",

He was 96. The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Rocky. Mr. Shepard, a salesman with missionary zeal, was named publisher in 1965, during the heyday of mass general-circulation magazines driven by newsstand sales, lavish photographic spreads and alluring articles. That was before television began vying for advertising revenue and eyeballs, and crippling postal rate increases obliterated profit margins.

As publisher, Mr. Shepard was known for his aggressive marketing tactics and his ability to attract big-name advertisers. However, despite his best efforts, Look's circulation continued to decline, and the magazine's profit margins shrunk. The company's struggles were exacerbated by the rise of television and the internet, which further eroded the magazine's audience and advertising revenue. In 1971, the magazine was sold to the MCA Inc. conglomerate, and Mr. Shepard stepped down as publisher. He remained involved with the magazine until its final issue in 2001.

Some campus debit cards, for instance, charge fees when students make purchases using their PINs, rather than with a signature -- a fee not typically seen with traditional checking accounts. And some may charge hefty overdraft fees for debit transactions -- that is, fees charged for overdrawing the account, according to a study this year by the Center for Responsible Lending. That means it is important for students to clearly understand the terms of any account they are offered and to make sure they are using it in a way that minimizes fees, said Meredith Turner, chief governmental officer with the California State Student Association. \"Read the fine print,\" she said. While becoming acclimated to campus can be overwhelming at first, students should set aside a few minutes to familiarize themselves with the rules of their bank accounts. \"Take the time to ensure you're setting yourself up for financial success while you're in school,\" she said. \"Students should also be aware of any maintenance fees or inactivity fees that may be charged if the account is not used regularly,\" Turner added. \"It's not uncommon for students to open an account and then not use it for a few months, only to be surprised by a surprise fee.\" To avoid these unexpected charges, Turner recommends that students review their account statements regularly and set up alerts to notify them of any unusual activity. Additionally, students should take advantage of free resources on campus, such as financial counseling services, to help them manage their finances effectively. By being proactive and informed, students can avoid unnecessary fees and set themselves up for financial success during their time at college.",

Women typically account for about two-thirds of the long-term-care insurance claims paid annually, said Jesse Slome, spokesman for the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, an industry group. Last year, companies paid $7.5 billion in claims. The effect is that women will now pay several hundred dollars more a year in long-term-care premiums than a man would for a comparable policy, according to the association's 2014 report, based on data from insurers. (The new gender-based premiums apply to new policies, not policies that were in place before the change took effect.) If you are a single 55-year-old man in good health buying a new policy, you can expect to pay $925 a year, on average, for a policy providing $164,000 in current benefits, without any built-in inflation protection. If you are a woman of the same age and health, though, you will pay an average of $1,225 a year for the same policy -- a difference of $300, or more than 30 percent. The difference in premiums is greater if you buy a policy that builds in inflation protection of 3 percent, compounded annually, for your benefits. (Your pool of benefits under this option would grow to $325,000 at age 80.) The same 55-year-old healthy man would pay $1,765 a year for that policy, but a woman would pay $2,307. A typical single woman will pay an average of 12 percent more than in 2013, the association found. The impact of gender pricing for couples who buy a policy together varies by insurer, Mr. Slome said. Some companies price policies for a couple based on their rates for single men or women, while others offer a blended couples rate. (Genworth said its gender-specific pricing applied only to single policies.) Insurers typically offer a significant couples discount. According to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, the increased premiums for women are due to the fact that they live longer and require longer-term care on average. Slome noted that women typically outlive men by about 4-5 years, which means they are more likely to need long-term care for a longer period. This increased risk is reflected in the higher premiums. The association's data also showed that women are more likely to be the primary caregivers for their loved ones, which can increase their likelihood of needing long-term care in the future.\n\nThe impact of the new gender-based pricing on couples who buy a policy together is varied, depending on the insurer. Some companies, like Genworth, offer separate policies for each individual, which means women will pay more than men. Other insurers, however, offer a blended couples rate, which can help reduce the premium disparity. For example, a 55-year-old healthy couple could expect to pay around $1,400 a year for a policy providing $164,000 in current benefits, without inflation protection. If they opt for a policy with 3 percent annual inflation protection, their premium would increase to around $2,100 a year.",

The ruling means that the amount banks collect from retailers when consumers swipe debit cards can remain as is, and not be reduced further. The takeaway message for consumers: Nothing much will change, at least for now. \"There is no reason consumers should see their own fees go up or their rewards go down, or any other change,\" said Adam Levitin, a professor who specializes in financial regulation and consumer protection at Georgetown Law. As part of the financial regulatory overhaul after the economic crisis, Congress included legislation that intended to put a cap on how much banks could charge retailers when consumers made purchases with debit cards. But they left it to the Federal Reserve to write the rules: The fees were ultimately reduced to about 21 cents a transaction, starting on Oct. 1, 2011, from an average of about 44 cents. The banks and retailers had been at odds over the fees, with retailers arguing that the lower rate was still too high and banks pushing for the ability to charge more. The ruling is a blow to retailers, who had hoped to see the fees reduced further. The National Retail Federation, which had been a vocal critic of the fees, expressed disappointment with the decision. \"This ruling is a setback for consumers and small businesses, who will continue to pay higher fees for debit transactions,\" said a spokesperson. The Federal Reserve had argued that the fees were necessary to ensure the security and integrity of the debit card system. The case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, where the final word on the matter may be decided.",

In about 60 percent of two-parent households with children under 18, both parents work, according to Pew Research Center, a subsidiary of the Pew Charitable Trusts. For them, the typical 10-week summer break is no picnic. \"Summer is really hard, because we often have these fantasies of summer the way it's supposed to be: getting ice cream, watching the sun go down, being at home,\" said Ellen Galinsky, president of the nonprofit Families and Work Institute. \"But it's not that way.\" \"But it's a reality for many families who struggle to balance work and family responsibilities.

Using language that evoked some of his fiercest critics, Mr. Duncan wrote in a blog post, \"I believe testing issues today are sucking the oxygen out of the room in a lot of schools,\" and he added that teachers needed time to adapt to new standards and tests that emphasize more than simply filling in bubbled answers to multiple-choice questions. Over the past four years, close to 40 states have adopted laws that tie teacher evaluations in part to the performance of their students on standardized tests. Many districts have said they will use these performance reviews to decide how teachers are granted tenure, promoted or fired. These laws were adopted in response to conditions set by the Education Department in the waivers it granted from the No Child Left Behind law, which governs what states must do to receive federal education dollars. The test-based teacher evaluations were also included as conditions of Race to the Top grants that have been given to states by the Obama administration. \"This flexibility will allow teachers to focus on what matters most - providing a high-quality education to their students,\" Mr. Duncan said. \"We recognize that the transition to new standards and assessments has been challenging, and we want to ensure that teachers have the time and support they need to adapt and thrive.\" The decision was welcomed by teachers' unions and advocacy groups, who have long argued that the emphasis on testing has led to a narrow and misguided focus on test preparation over meaningful instruction. \"This is a huge step forward,\" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \"We need to make sure that our teachers are judged on their ability to teach, not just on how well their students perform on a test.\" The change is effective immediately, and states will have until the end of the 2015-2016 school year to implement the new flexibility.",

Calpers is a $252 billion giant that administers pensions for California state employees and many municipal workers. It calculates how much its member cities must set aside each year, bills them, collects the money, invests it and sends retirees their benefits. When Calpers's investments lose money, as they did in the stock market crash, the bills increase. In 2011, Stockton paid a little more than $20 million to Calpers -- about double what it paid to run its public libraries. Its payments are expected to nearly double in the next 10 years, making Calpers the city's biggest creditor. Stockton says it has no choice but to keep paying, even as it pares other costs, including its payments to bondholders. It says that if it cuts the rate at which its workers build up their pensions, workers will leave -- especially the police, who have been recruited with the promise of large, early pensions. Last year, Stockton asked Calpers for a \"hardship exemption,\" allowing it to slow down its contributions. Calpers said no, fearing that if Stockton fell behind, it might never catch up. \"They're scared to death,\" Mr. Sweet said. As the city's financial struggles continue, Stockton's officials are facing an uphill battle to balance their budget. The city's reliance on Calpers has made it difficult to make ends meet, and the increasing pension payments are only exacerbating the problem. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" said Mayor Michael Tubbs. \"We're forced to make tough decisions to reduce our workforce and cut services, but those decisions only make it harder for us to make our pension payments on time.\"\n\nThe situation has left many city employees feeling uncertain about their future. \"I've been with the city for 20 years, and I've seen a lot of changes,\" said Officer James Wilson, a police officer who is close to retirement. \"But nothing has been as tough as this.

The accord, meant to eliminate most tariffs over the next few years, was signed by trade officials in Beijing during a state visit by Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir of Iceland. When completed, it will unite two hugely mismatched economies: Iceland's 2011 gross domestic product of $14 billion was little more than a rounding error in China's G.D.P. that year of $7.3 trillion. Trade between the countries is small by global standards. Iceland's exports to China last year, mainly fish, totaled $61 million, while it imported Chinese goods and services valued at $341 million. But while Iceland cannot offer much in the way of significant new market growth, it could help China in its quest for more influence in the Arctic, as global warming and polar ice retreat make that area increasingly accessible. China is seeking to join the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental body that promotes cooperation in the region, as a permanent observer. Iceland, though not a member of the European Union, enjoys access to the single market through its membership in the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area. But China would not gain backdoor access to the European market through the trade deal. Iceland had been negotiating membership but suspended talks in January amid widespread domestic opposition. John Clancy, a spokesman in Brussels for the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, said Iceland would have to terminate all of its bilateral trade deals were it eventually to join the bloc. The two governments also issued a joint statement Wednesday calling for new bilateral cooperation on \"human rights, gender equality, labor issues, Arctic affairs, as well as cooperation on geothermal development, culture, education and tourism.\" The agreement was hailed as a significant step forward in China's efforts to expand its global trade footprint, despite concerns over the country's human rights record and its growing economic influence. Iceland's Prime Minister, Johanna Sigurdardottir, said that the deal would create new opportunities for Icelandic businesses and would help to promote cooperation between the two countries in areas such as geothermal energy and Arctic affairs.\n\nThe deal is also seen as a significant boost for China's ambitions in the Arctic region, where it is seeking to increase its influence and extract natural resources. China has been investing heavily in Arctic infrastructure, including ports and roads, and has been exploring for oil and gas in the region.\n\nIn return, Iceland is expected to benefit from increased access to the Chinese market, which is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies. Icelandic businesses are already looking to take advantage of the new opportunities, with companies such as fish processor HB Grandi and geothermal energy firm Reykjavik Energy expressing interest in exporting their products to China.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the deal is a good idea. Some critics have raised concerns over the impact of the deal on Iceland's economy, including fears that it could lead to a flood of cheap Chinese imports and undermine the country's traditional industries. Others have expressed concerns over the human rights record of the Chinese government, and the potential risks to Icelandic businesses that operate in China.\n\nDespite these concerns, the deal is expected to be ratified by both governments in the coming months, paving the way for increased trade and cooperation between China and Iceland. The agreement is seen as a significant milestone in China's efforts to expand its global trade footprint, and is likely to be closely watched by other countries around the world.",

France's civil aviation authority made contingency plans over the weekend, asking airlines serving the country's airports in Paris, Lyon, Nice, Marseille, Toulouse and Bordeaux to reduce their flight schedules by 50 percent from Tuesday morning until late Thursday to ease the burden on those airports, which were expected to face significant disruption. Unions in more than a half dozen other countries, including Belgium, Hungary, Italy and Portugal, were likely to join in work-to-rule and other more symbolic actions on Wednesday, said Koen Reynaerts, a spokesman for the European Transport Workers' Federation in Brussels, which represents more than 25,000 workers involved in managing air traffic across the region. The strikes were expected to cause widespread delays and cancellations, with travelers advised to check with their airlines for the latest information before heading to the airport. The European Commission's proposal, known as the Single European Sky, aims to streamline air traffic management and reduce congestion, but the unions argue it will lead to job losses and decreased safety standards. The strikes come as the summer travel season gets underway, and with millions of passengers expected to take to the skies in the coming weeks, the disruption could have significant consequences for the aviation industry. Airlines were bracing for the worst, with many already scrambling to rebook passengers and adjust their schedules. As the strike action unfolded, travelers were left hoping for a swift resolution to the dispute and a return to normal air travel operations.",

While rates on home loans are likely to remain modest by traditional standards, the ultralow borrowing costs that encouraged millions of homeowners to refinance and helped revive the moribund housing market are quickly becoming a memory. As yields on 10-year government bonds rise amid signs that the economy is improving and that the Federal Reserve will reduce bond purchases, mortgage rates have quickly followed. Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages hit 4.25 percent on Thursday, up from 4.12 percent on Wednesday morning before the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled the central bank might begin easing back on stimulus efforts later this year. As recently as May, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage stood at 3.5 percent, close to the lowest in decades. They are either already set at relatively high levels, like most credit card borrowing costs, or tied to short-term interest rates, which the Fed has indicated will not rise before 2015. As a result, many mortgage experts are warning that the era of easy refinancing is coming to a close. \"The refi boom is over,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The days of 3.5% interest rates are behind us.\" With rates on the rise, homeowners who had been waiting on the sidelines to refinance may need to act quickly to take advantage of the remaining low rates. Additionally, the increase in mortgage rates could slow down the housing market, which has been experiencing a rebound in recent months. \"A 1% increase in interest rates can reduce demand for homes by 10%,\" said Zandi. \"This could be a significant headwind for the housing market.\" As the Fed continues to monitor the economy, homeowners and would-be buyers will be keeping a close eye on interest rates, hoping to find a sweet spot before they rise even higher.",

The central bank, People's Bank of China, eager to rein in soaring lending growth and financial risk, initially refrained from intervening as bank-to-bank interest rates soared last week, but then apparently released more money for lenders. Uncertainty over the central bank's position produced wide trading swings Tuesday, with the main Chinese stock indexes dropping to their lowest levels since early 2009 before recovering most of the day's losses near the end of trading. The Shanghai composite index, which tumbled 5.3 percent Monday, slumped more than 5 percent again by early afternoon Tuesday. Despite the central bank's reassurances, market sentiment remained fragile, with investors remaining cautious about the potential impact of the credit squeeze on the broader economy.

The central bank held its interest rate at 0.5 percent, already a record low, and also made no change to its program of economic stimulus, leaving the target at 375 billion pounds, or about $570 billion. The British government had reported last week that the economy in the second quarter had grown 0.6 percent from the previous quarter and that all main industries were reporting faster growth for the first time in three years. \"We're starting to see some real signs of momentum building,\" said James Knightley, an economist at ING. \"People feel more secure in their jobs, households feel richer as house prices rise. There's a real improvement of sentiment.\" This optimism is reflected in the latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which showed that its index of business optimism rose to its highest level in five years. Meanwhile, the UK's services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the country's economy, continued to grow at a steady pace, with a survey by Markit showing that its purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates on hold is seen as a vote of confidence in the economy's prospects, and is likely to be welcomed by households and businesses alike. With inflation still below target, the central bank has room to maneuver if the economy continues to strengthen, and many economists are now predicting that the next move will be a rate cut rather than a hike.",

If you and your spouse live in a state where same-sex marriage is sanctioned, and you meet other criteria (see below), the application should be straightforward. An unresolved question, however, is whether couples who were legally married in one state but moved to another state that doesn't recognize gay marriage can get the same benefits. That's because the Social Security Administration currently uses a \"place of residence\" standard in deciding spousal benefits. Susan Sommer, senior counsel with the gay rights group Lambda Legal, said Social Security had instructed its staff to accept and hold such applications, pending further legal clarification. \"We're awaiting guidance, and we're really hopeful,\" she said. The agency also is holding other types of applications for now, like those for survivor benefits when one spouse dies. However, Ms. Bonauto said she was encouraged by the case of 83-year-old Herb Burtis, a musician and voice teacher in Western Massachusetts. Mr. Burtis had applied for survivor benefits after his husband died in 2008. (They married in 2004, when Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage). His late husband's monthly retirement benefits were $700 higher because he had earned more than Mr. Burtis, and Mr. Burtis filed a claim for the extra payment. His application was initially denied. But he became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully challenged the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which was struck down in June by the United States Supreme Court. He is now getting the extra money, and also received a lump-sum payment for the last five years. Ms. Bonauto said there was \"every reason to expect\" that the agency would eventually process and pay survivor benefits to other eligible same-sex applicants. Here are some questions to consider:\n\n# How do I know if I'm eligible for benefits? You must meet certain criteria. For instance, to receive spousal retirement benefits, you generally must be at least 62 and have been married for at least 12 months; for the survivor's benefit, you must be at least 60 and have been married for nine months. If you meet age and duration requirements, Ms. Bonauto said, you should apply for benefits, even in the face of other uncertainties. You can apply online at www.ssa.gov forspousal retirement benefits. But you must apply for survivor's benefits by calling or visiting a local Social Security office; make an appointment before you go. GLAD advises you to bring a copy of your marriage license, or your civil union or domestic partnership certificate, and a copy of your spouse's death certificate. Here is the continuation of the article:\n\nIn addition to the age and duration requirements, applicants must also provide proof of their same-sex marriage, which can be a challenge for couples who were married in one state but now live in another. \"It's a little bit of a bureaucratic nightmare,\" said Sommer. \"But we're hopeful that the Social Security Administration will find a way to make it work.\" For now, couples who are unsure about their eligibility or the application process can seek guidance from organizations like GLAD and Lambda Legal. \"We're here to help,\" said Bonauto. \"We want to make sure that same-sex couples have the same access to benefits as all other married couples.\"",

        "Text": "Of course, the 1 percent or top 0.1 percent is not a static figure. Every year, millions of individuals and households move up or down the income scale depending on their earnings, investments and age. Fortunes wax and wane as new tech gurus graduate from college and top lawyers head into retirement. Still, economists said that people holding considerable capital -- de facto, the already rich -- have done well during the recovery. Moreover, the 1 percent tends to be sticky, and perhaps even more so in bad times than in good times, Mr. Saez said. One study by the Treasury economists Gerald Auten, Geoffrey Gee and Nicholas Turner found that a quarter to a third of 1 percenters in a given year stayed in the 1 percent for all of the following five. . Thus, the profile of wealth in the United States, before the recession and after, has remained much the same. The prototypical high-net-worth individual is coastal, educated, older, white and male, Mr. Friedman said. The investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett, might not be coastal, but the other categories apply, and with cash on hand and an appetite for acquisitions during the recovery, his net worth has increased by about $10 billion over the last year. Technology has minted hundreds of new top earners too, also generally men, but often much younger. David Duffield of Workday and Elon Musk of Tesla, among others, have benefited from the tech boom. Still, fields like finance, medicine and energy continue to be top moneymakers, with financiers and owners of their own or family businesses dominating the ultra-high-net-worth category. Three big interconnected economic phenomena have driven the boomerang among the country's top earners, economists said: stocks, houses and loans. The rich took huge losses when the markets plummeted in 2008 and 2009. But those who held on or bought in after then have been richly rewarded, as every dollar invested in the Dow Jones in 2009 is worth about $1.40 now, after correcting for inflation. The gains in the markets have bolstered the earnings and the net worth of the half of Americans who own stocks, including through vehicles like mutual funds. But the wealthy have benefited disproportionately. In addition to the surge in stock values, the housing market has also seen a significant recovery, with many wealthy individuals and families benefiting from the rise in property values. This has been particularly true for those who own multiple properties, including vacation homes and rental properties. According to data from the National Association of Realtors, the median price of existing single-family homes in the United States has increased by over 30% since 2009, with many high-end properties seeing even greater gains.\n\nThe third factor driving the boomerang among the country's top earners has been the availability of credit and loans. While many individuals and businesses struggled to access credit during the recession, the wealthy have been able to maintain access to low-interest loans and credit lines. This has allowed them to invest in new opportunities, expand their businesses, and take advantage of the recovery.\n\nAs a result, the wealthy have been able to not only recover from the losses they suffered during the recession, but also to increase their net worth significantly. According to a report by the economic consulting firm, PwC, the number of billionaires in the United States has increased by over 50% since 2009, with many of them seeing their net worth increase by tens of millions of dollars. The report also found that the top 1% of earners in the United States now hold over 40% of the country's total wealth, up from around 30% in 2009.",

In an era of stagnant incomes and rising tuition and student debt, the burden of college costs on families and former students is well documented. But the new findings, from the National Survey of Student Engagement, show that financial worries are a major source of stress for undergraduates while they are still in school. About three-fifths of students surveyed reported that they often worry about having enough money to cover ordinary costs, and students who spend the most hours at paying jobs are, not surprisingly, those feeling the most financial stress. The survey also found that students who reported higher levels of financial stress were more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, and were less likely to participate in extracurricular activities or volunteer work. Furthermore, students who worked more hours were more likely to have lower GPAs and be at risk of dropping out of school.

With such uncertainty, businesses have also recently curtailed spending on capital investments like computers, delivery trucks and other equipment, apparently in anticipation of higher tax rates and the destructive side effects of government cutbacks. Given that capital expenditures have been weak recently, some economists believe businesses will start spending more if Congress ends or at least delays the risk of severe fiscal tightening. \"You would think there must be for most businesses a list of projects they'd like to do which they've just been pushing a little bit into the future because they haven't been able to justify taking the risk because they don't know what's around the corner,\" said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. \"When they know more about the future, and what tax rates they'll be paying, they will be able to dust off those plans and finally execute them.\" Improving access to credit helps these capital expenditures become not only more attractive, but also more accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been rising in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve. The National Federation of Independent Business has also reported that the share of small business owners who say their credit needs are not being met has been falling. Additionally, corporate profits reached a high, even adjusting for inflation, in the third quarter. Companies have amassed a lot of cash that they can use to buy equipment or hire people if they feel secure enough about the recovery. Consumers, on the other hand, are still not exactly cash-rich, particularly since their disposable income has been flat to falling in recent months. But in the last few years they have deleveraged greatly -- either by paying down debt or having it written off through default -- and, more important, they are feeling a little wealthier because the housing market appears to have bottomed out. The country has finally worked its way through the excess housing inventory from the bubble years, and now housing prices and housing construction are rising. This increased confidence in the economy, combined with the improving credit environment and strong corporate profits, could lead to a surge in consumer spending and business investment. As a result, the economy could experience a boost in growth, potentially offsetting the negative impact of fiscal tightening. However, it's essential for policymakers to carefully consider the timing and magnitude of their decisions to avoid disrupting this fragile recovery. The Fed's decision to keep interest rates low and its commitment to providing liquidity to the markets have also helped to stabilize the economy. As the economy continues to recover, it's crucial that policymakers work together to create a supportive environment that fosters growth, job creation, and stability.",

        "Text": "DENVER  Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, convening a two-day labor-management conference here on Tuesday, argued that teachers' unions can help solve many of the challenges facing public schools. But as the conference opened, that view was under challenge in a number of state capitals. Republicans in several states have proposed legislation in recent weeks that would bar teachers' unions from all policy discussions, except when the time comes to negotiate compensation. In Tennessee and Wisconsin, Republicans have proposed stripping teachers' unions of collective bargaining rights altogether. The proposed legislation has sparked fierce debate among educators, union leaders, and lawmakers, with some arguing that it would weaken the voice of teachers and undermine the ability of schools to address issues such as curriculum development and school safety. \"This is a clear attempt to silence teachers and undermine the collective bargaining process,\" said Karen Johnson, president of the Tennessee Education Association. \"Teachers are not just employees, they are professionals who have a critical role to play in shaping the education system.\" Meanwhile, Secretary Duncan emphasized the importance of collaboration between teachers, administrators, and policymakers to address the complex challenges facing public education. \"We need to work together to find solutions, not tear each other down,\" he said.",

But Mr. Schauble's comments left room for a less radical solution in which Greece might be given more time to pay its debts. \"There is no experience with what happens when a country inside a currency union becomes insolvent,\" Mr. Schauble said in an interview published Thursday in the German newspaper Handelsblatt. \"This is a unique situation and we need to be cautious. However, we are also aware that Greece is making efforts to implement austerity measures and structural reforms. We will have to see how these efforts unfold and whether they are sufficient to address the country's debt crisis. It's too early to say what the final outcome will be, but we are committed to finding a solution that works for all parties involved.\" Mr. Schauble added that Germany and other eurozone countries were considering various options, including a debt swap or a longer repayment period, to help Greece manage its debt burden.",

        "Text": "The American trade deficit shrank unexpectedly in April after the United States sold $175.6 billion in goods and services overseas, the most exports on record, the government reported on Thursday. The Commerce Department report said that exports of goods were $126.4 billion and services $49.1 billion, while total imports were $219.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $43.7 billion, the lowest since December. The deficit in March was revised down to $46.8 billion from $48.2 billion, the department said. The gap had been forecast by some economists to widen to $48.8 billion. The unexpected narrowing of the trade deficit was attributed to a surge in exports of American-made goods, particularly in the technology and machinery sectors. The strong demand for US goods was driven by the ongoing global economic recovery and the strengthening of major trading partners such as the European Union and Japan. Meanwhile, imports of goods and services from other countries, including China and Mexico, slowed down due to tariffs and other trade restrictions imposed by the US government. The Commerce Department's report was seen as a positive sign for the US economy, which has been struggling to grow in recent months. Many economists believe that the narrowing trade deficit could contribute to a stronger economic performance in the second half of the year.",

With Europe's economic and financial woes weighing on prospects for global growth, officials said they had agreed to take \"all necessary measures needed to stabilize the financial system\" and to contain the troubles. The officials did not provide specifics, but said they were working toward introducing a grand plan at a meeting on Oct. 23 in Brussels. The meeting, which brought together finance ministers from the G20's 20 member countries, was seen as a crucial step towards finding a lasting solution to the debt crisis that has been plaguing Europe for months. Despite the progress made, officials acknowledged that there were still several key issues that needed to be addressed before a comprehensive plan could be put in place. These included the need for a stronger banking union, a more effective system for dealing with sovereign debt defaults, and a plan for recapitalizing Europe's struggling banks. Despite these challenges, officials remained optimistic that a solution could be found, and that the global economy would be able to recover from the crisis.",

Many of its nearly one million items -- special collections, journals, dissertations, documents -- can be accessed online. But while many academic libraries are digitizing and moving holdings off site, Manseuto is the largest and latest (of about two dozen libraries) to add automated storage and retrieval systems. Volumes are housed in solid steel cases about 50 feet below ground. Should someone want to actually touch the real thing, books are delivered through a labyrinthine system of cranes and elevators. The innovative system allows staff to retrieve specific volumes in a matter of minutes, without having to physically search through shelves. The Mansueto Library's automated storage and retrieval system is capable of storing over 3.5 million volumes, freeing up valuable space on campus for collaborative workspaces and student study areas. According to library officials, the new system will also enable more efficient cataloging and preservation of rare and fragile materials. With its cutting-edge technology and futuristic design, the Mansueto Library is poised to become a hub of academic innovation and discovery at the University of Chicago.",

This academic year, it totals $400,000. \"I don't think there's any other school district in the nation that puts dollars of any consequence into chess,\" said Jay Harris, who coordinates the district's program. But for Brownsville, a border city that is one of the poorest in the nation, the \"royal game\" serves as an avenue to success and a source of pride that many believe is worth the investment. \"The chess program has been a game-changer for our students,\" said Harris. \"It's not just about moving pieces around on a board, it's about critical thinking, problem-solving, and strategy. We've seen students who were struggling in other subjects suddenly excel when they're playing chess.\" The district's program has also become a source of community pride, with local businesses and organizations sponsoring teams and tournaments. \"It's a way for us to show that we value education and that we're willing to invest in our kids,\" said Harris.",

They, too, learned the secrets of Apple's hit mobile devices from the Stanford course on iPhone applications, which was introduced in fall 2008 to a packed lecture hall. But while Mr. Anthony took the class as a senior at Stanford, many other members of Apple's burgeoning developer community have tuned in to free video recordings of lectures at iTunes U, where it is often one of the most popular downloads. Stanford's online class, Mr. Anthony says, \"is pretty much the primary way to learn about iPhone development right now.\" People watching from home can't show up at the instructor's office hours, or send an e-mail message and expect an answer. And this term's classes aren't available online; in the past, sessions would appear on iTunes U just two to three days after each class, seemingly a necessity in a fast-evolving field. However, Stanford's decision to make this term's classes unavailable online has left many developers frustrated and scrambling to find alternative sources of information. \"It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack,\" said John Lee, a freelance developer who relies on the online classes to stay up-to-date with the latest iPhone developments. \"I've tried searching for alternative resources, but nothing compares to the quality and depth of Stanford's course.\" Despite the inconvenience, many developers are still finding ways to access the material, often by recording the classes themselves or seeking out online forums and discussion groups. Despite the challenges, Apple's developer community remains strong, with over 100,000 registered developers creating innovative apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch.",

Stephanie Fiore, for example, wondered where to store her many pairs of shoes, since her closet already seemed too small to fit all her clothes. One floor above, Letticia Camacho and Juliet Dolan, new roommates, giggled at the odd coincidence of having brought items that followed the same color scheme: turquoise-and-purple hangers, storage boxes, sheets. On the fifth floor, Mohamed Sako kept his dorm room door ajar and his stereo on, the words to Nicki Minaj's \"Your Love\" wafting onto the hallways  \"You got spark, you, you got spunk.\" Living on campus is a privilege available to 500 of the roughly 20,000 students at Queens College, which is primarily a commuter college in a corner of Flushing that is easily reachable by car and by bus, but not by subway. Rooms at the Summit, as the dorm is officially named, come with full kitchens, cable television, wireless Internet access and private bathrooms. As the afternoon wore on, the sounds of laughter and chatter filled the halls, punctuated by the occasional clang of pots and pans in the kitchens. On the third floor, a group of students gathered around a laptop, eagerly watching a live stream of the President's speech on the importance of community engagement. Meanwhile, in the lounge area, a cluster of students played a lively game of cards, their faces lit up by the warm glow of the setting sun streaming through the windows. As the day drew to a close, the students of Room 227 and beyond began to settle in, their new home at the Summit taking shape around them.",

(As part of the agreement, only researchers can view the tapes, not school administrators). Participants include teachers of grades four through nine in regular public schools. To demonstrate the project for The New York Times, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation asked teachers in Charlotte and Memphis to volunteer to tape additional classes, not bound by the confidentiality provisions. One who volunteered was Rachael Maher, who teaches seventh-grade math at Alexander Graham Middle School in Charlotte. For an hour, with digital video equipment capturing a panoramic view of the classroom, Ms. Maher taught her students the Pythagorean theorem. As she wrote equations on the whiteboard, Ms. Maher's students scribbled notes and asked questions, their faces lighting up with understanding. The camera captured every moment, from the initial confusion to the eventual \"aha\" moments. The footage will be analyzed to identify effective teaching strategies, such as Ms. Maher's use of real-world examples to illustrate the theorem. The researchers hope that the study will provide valuable insights to help improve teacher training and student learning outcomes.",
