        "Text": "Evernote, the note-taking service, is facing a user backlash after restricting the number of features available to free accounts. The company's Evernote Basic tier, which offers free access to the software, will now only be able to sync across two devices. For most people, this will be a computer and one mobile device, leaving users with more than one computer, or a computer and two mobile devices (a phone and a tablet, for instance), needing to pay for the first time. Free users can still access the web version of Evernote, though. At the same time, the price for the Plus and Premium tiers of Evernote has risen by about 40%, taking them to $34.99 (£25.96) and $69.99 (£51.92) a year respectively. The move has sparked widespread criticism from users who feel that the new restrictions are a significant blow to the service's value proposition. Many users have taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration, with some even threatening to switch to alternative note-taking apps.\n\n\"This is a huge step backwards for Evernote,\" said Sarah Johnson, a freelance writer who has been using the service for years. \"I understand that the company needs to make money, but restricting the number of devices you can sync with is a major inconvenience. I'll be looking into alternative options for note-taking.\"\n\nEvernote's decision to restrict the number of devices that can be synced with the free account has also raised questions about the company's commitment to providing a seamless user experience. Many users rely on the service to access their notes across multiple devices, and the new restrictions will require them to pay for a premium subscription to achieve this.\n\n\"It's frustrating to see a company like Evernote, which has built its reputation on providing a flexible and accessible service, suddenly impose such restrictive limits on its free users,\" said Tom Smith, a student who uses Evernote to take notes during lectures. \"I'm not sure I'm willing to pay for a premium subscription just to access the features I need.\"\n\nDespite the backlash, Evernote has defended its decision, citing the need to maintain the quality and reliability of its service. In a statement, the company said: \"We're committed to providing the best possible experience for our users, and that means making sure that our service is reliable and secure. The changes we've made to our pricing and features are designed to help us achieve this goal, while also providing our users with more value and flexibility.\"\n\nHowever, many users remain unconvinced, and the controversy is likely to have a significant impact on the company's reputation and user base. As the debate continues to rage on social media and online forums, it remains to be seen whether Evernote will be able to recover from the backlash and maintain its position as one of the leading note-taking services.",

        "Text": "The ABC is reporting that its former managing director Michelle Guthrie has received a payout of more than $800,000 after being terminated by the public broadcaster, but is still suing for more. An ABC spokesperson said the termination payment was made to Guthrie in line with her contractual entitlements. Guardian Australia understands it was determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, which oversees federal public servants' pay. According to sources, Guthrie's termination payment is the result of a complex negotiation process between her legal team and the ABC's management. The payout is reportedly the largest ever made to a departing ABC executive, and has raised eyebrows among industry insiders and observers.\n\nGuthrie's lawsuit, which is ongoing, alleges that her termination was unfair and unjustified. She claims that she was unfairly targeted by the ABC's board and management, and that her departure was motivated by a desire to eliminate her as a potential competitor for the role of managing director.\n\nThe ABC has denied these allegations, stating that Guthrie's termination was a result of a performance review that identified significant issues with her leadership style and management of the organization. The broadcaster has also accused Guthrie of breaching her contract by failing to comply with certain obligations and responsibilities.\n\nThe dispute between Guthrie and the ABC has sparked a heated debate about the role of the public broadcaster in Australian society, and the accountability of its executives. Some have called for greater transparency and oversight of the ABC's management practices, while others have defended the organization's autonomy and independence.\n\nThe Remuneration Tribunal's role in determining Guthrie's termination payment has also been criticized by some, who argue that the tribunal's decisions are often opaque and lack transparency. Others have defended the tribunal's process, saying that it is necessary to ensure fair and consistent treatment of federal public servants.\n\nAs the dispute continues to unfold, the Australian public is left to wonder what the future holds for the ABC and its leadership. Will the organization be able to move forward from this controversy, or will it continue to be plagued by internal strife and external criticism? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "The sucker punch has been coming ever since the press – with hundreds of local newspaper editors up front – tried to fend off the supposed royal charter regulatory menace of article 40 (the one where publishers pay legal costs, win or lose). Lord Justice Leveson's insistence on a regulator offering cheap arbitration was a terrible sticking point, the editors said: a final burden on a struggling industry. Which, of course, made arbitration itself the litmus test for MPs and ministers wondering what to do next. Thus the culture, media and sport committee now gives Ipso (the non-Leveson-compliant regulator almost everyone has joined) a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme. The move by the culture, media and sport committee to give Ipso a year to implement an acceptable arbitration scheme has been met with mixed reactions from the industry. While some have welcomed the extension, others have expressed frustration and disappointment at the lack of concrete action to address the long-standing issue.\n\nIpso, which was established in 2014 as a self-regulatory body for the UK press, has faced criticism for its failure to implement a robust arbitration system. The organization has argued that it has been working towards implementing a scheme, but has faced technical and logistical challenges.\n\nHowever, critics have accused Ipso of dragging its feet and failing to provide a meaningful solution to the problem. \"A year is a long time, and we need to see real progress on this issue,\" said Tom Watson, a Labour MP and member of the culture, media and sport committee. \"The press needs to take responsibility for its own regulation, and that includes implementing a fair and effective arbitration system.\"\n\nThe issue of arbitration has been a major sticking point in the debate over press regulation. The Leveson Inquiry, which was established in 2011 to investigate phone hacking and other abuses by the press, recommended that a regulator be established with the power to impose arbitration on publishers. However, the press industry has long resisted this proposal, arguing that it would be a costly and burdensome requirement.\n\nThe culture, media and sport committee's decision to give Ipso a year to implement an arbitration scheme is seen as a compromise between the press industry's demands and the government's desire to see meaningful regulation in place. However, some have argued that it is a missed opportunity to take a more robust approach to regulation.\n\n\"The government has failed to grasp the nettle on press regulation,\" said Hacked Off, a campaign group that has been pushing for greater regulation of the press. \"Instead of giving Ipso a year to implement a half-baked arbitration scheme, they should be introducing a robust and independent regulator with the power to hold the press to account.\"\n\nThe debate over press regulation is likely to continue in the coming months, with the culture, media and sport committee set to hold further hearings and the government expected to introduce legislation on the issue. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the press industry will need to adapt to a changing regulatory landscape, and that arbitration will remain a key part of that debate.",

He was born in Coventry, the son of Florence (nee Wilday) and Cyril Dewis. His education was cut short when his father, a coal merchant and carter, died in 1934, and Norman had to find work. Norman Dewis's early years were marked by hardship and determination. He began working at the age of 14, taking on various jobs to support his mother and younger sister. His first employment was as a messenger boy for the local council, followed by stints as a milkman and a shop assistant.\n\nHowever, Norman's passion for cars soon took over, and he began working at a local garage, where he honed his mechanical skills and developed a deep understanding of engines and mechanics. His talent and dedication did not go unnoticed, and in 1947, he was approached by Jaguar's chief test driver, William Heynes, who offered him a job as a junior test driver.\n\nDewis accepted the offer and quickly proved himself to be an exceptional driver and mechanic. He worked tirelessly alongside Heynes, testing and developing Jaguar's early models, including the iconic XK120 and XK140. His expertise and attention to detail earned him the respect of his colleagues and the admiration of his employers.\n\nAs Jaguar's chief test driver, Norman Dewis played a crucial role in the development of the company's most iconic models, including the E-Type and the XJ6. His testing and feedback were instrumental in refining the performance, handling, and reliability of these vehicles, which went on to become legendary in the world of motoring.\n\nDewis's legacy extends beyond his contributions to Jaguar's success. He was a mentor and inspiration to many young engineers and drivers, and his dedication to his craft earned him a reputation as one of the most respected and skilled test drivers in the industry.\n\nThroughout his long and illustrious career, Norman Dewis remained humble and grounded, always crediting his colleagues and the company for his success. He was a true ambassador for Jaguar and a testament to the company's commitment to excellence.\n\nIn his later years, Dewis continued to be involved with Jaguar, attending classic car events and sharing his stories and experiences with enthusiasts. His passing leaves a void in the world of motoring, but his legacy will live on through the many lives he touched and the iconic cars he helped shape.",

        "Text": "Among some astronomers, there is a growing suspicion that our solar system's distant reaches conceal a large, ninth planet that we have not yet seen. New findings about a small ice world far beyond Pluto buttress this idea. On Monday, astronomers led by Scott S. Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington revealed the orbital details of the world, which they have nicknamed the Goblin. The discovery of the Goblin, officially designated as 2015 TG387, has sparked renewed interest in the possibility of a large, undiscovered planet lurking in the outer reaches of the solar system. Sheppard and his team used the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii to observe the Goblin's orbit, which takes a whopping 40,000 years to complete around the sun.\n\nThe Goblin's unusual orbit is what caught the attention of astronomers, as it appears to be influenced by the gravitational pull of an unseen massive body. Sheppard and his team believe that this body could be the long-sought ninth planet, which they have dubbed Planet Nine.\n\n\"We've been searching for this missing planet for a long time, and now we have a real candidate,\" said Sheppard in a statement. \"The Goblin's orbit is unlike anything we've seen before, and it's a strong indication that there's something massive out there that's affecting its path.\"\n\nThe Goblin itself is a small, icy world, measuring approximately 300 kilometers in diameter. It is one of the most distant known objects in the solar system, with an average distance from the sun of about 65 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the average distance between the Earth and the sun.\n\nWhile the Goblin's discovery is exciting, it is not yet conclusive evidence of the existence of Planet Nine. However, the findings do provide strong supporting evidence for the theory. Sheppard and his team plan to continue observing the Goblin and other similar objects in the hopes of gathering more data that could confirm the presence of the elusive planet.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine has been ongoing for several years, with astronomers using a combination of observations and computer simulations to try and locate the missing world. The discovery of the Goblin has reignited interest in the search, and scientists are eager to see what other secrets the distant reaches of the solar system may hold.\n\nAs the search for Planet Nine continues, scientists are also exploring the implications of its potential existence. If confirmed, the planet could provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system, as well as the possibility of life beyond Earth.\n\nFor now, the Goblin remains a mysterious and intriguing addition to our understanding of the solar system, and astronomers will continue to study it in the hopes of uncovering more secrets about the distant reaches of our cosmic neighborhood.",

Like most relationships, it started so well. You spotted the car across a crowded car park and your eyes were drawn by those dramatic lines. The rimless headlamps and plunging codpiece grille added to the appeal. You took the key from your pocket, you wanted to get to know this car a little better. You pressed unlock and… eergh… the car emits a long, dreadful jarring beep. I've \"beeped\" a lot of cars in my time, but the tone on this one is awful. It sounds crazy to dismiss a car because the security tone is too harsh, too long and too unnecessary, but every time I locked or unlocked Giulietta that noise put my teeth right on edge. Clamber in and the disappointment continues. As I settled into the driver's seat, I was met with a sea of black plastic and a steering wheel that felt more like a chunk of granite than a tactile delight. The seats, while comfortable, lacked the plushness and support I've come to expect from Italian luxury brands. The dashboard, a mishmash of buttons and dials, seemed more suited to a budget-friendly supermini than a premium hatchback.\n\nThe infotainment system, while responsive, was slow to boot up and took an eternity to navigate. The graphics were dated, and the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration was a glaring omission. It was as if Alfa Romeo had taken a step back in time, forgetting the importance of modern connectivity in today's connected world.\n\nBut, I thought, perhaps the driving experience would make up for these shortcomings. After all, Alfa Romeo has a rich heritage of producing cars that are a joy to drive. I put the Giulietta into gear and set off, eager to see if it could redeem itself.\n\nThe initial impression was promising. The engine, a 1.4-liter turbocharged unit, provided a decent amount of punch, and the six-speed manual transmission was smooth and precise. The handling, while not as sharp as some of its rivals, was still engaging and fun.\n\nHowever, as the miles ticked by, the Giulietta's flaws began to reveal themselves. The ride was firm, bordering on harsh, and the suspension struggled to absorb even the smallest of bumps. The steering, while accurate, lacked the feel and feedback that I've come to expect from a car in this class.\n\nAs the week drew to a close, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The Giulietta, while not a bad car by any stretch, failed to live up to my expectations. The noise, the bland interior, and the lackluster driving experience all combined to make it a car that, despite its stunning looks, felt like a missed opportunity.\n\nIn a crowded and competitive market, the Giulietta needs to stand out from the crowd. Unfortunately, it falls short. With its flaws and shortcomings, it's a car that's hard to recommend, even to the most ardent Alfa Romeo fan. Perhaps, as the saying goes, \"all's fair in love and war,\" but when it comes to cars, I think it's fair to say that this Giulietta is a love that's lost its spark.",

However, when the team conducted a series of experiments, they found that the plants' respiration rates actually increased by a staggering 15 times more than predicted.\n\nThis unexpected result has significant implications for our understanding of how plants respond to rising temperatures, which is a crucial aspect of climate change research. \"We were blown away by the magnitude of the response,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead author of the study. \"It's clear that plants are more resilient than we thought, but it also highlights the importance of accurately measuring their responses to temperature changes.\"\n\nThe researchers used a combination of laboratory and field experiments to study the effects of temperature on plant respiration. They measured the respiration rates of several plant species, including crops and wild plants, at different temperatures ranging from 20°C to 40°C. The results showed that as temperatures increased, the plants' respiration rates skyrocketed, with some species experiencing a 20-fold increase in respiration.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for agriculture and conservation. \"Understanding how plants respond to temperature changes can help us develop more effective strategies for adapting to climate change,\" said Dr. John Smith, a co-author of the study. \"For example, farmers may need to adjust their irrigation and fertilization practices to account for the increased respiration rates of their crops.\"\n\nThe researchers also noted that their findings could have implications for the development of climate change mitigation strategies. \"If plants are more resilient to temperature changes than we thought, it could mean that they'll continue to thrive even as temperatures rise,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"However, it also highlights the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.\"\n\nThe study's results have been published in the journal Nature and have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community.

The mythological tale of Perseus, a demigod from ancient Greece, is brought to life as the stars align to form the shape of the constellation.\n\nFor those looking to spot the constellations, the key is to look southwards in the evening, around 9pm. The chart highlights the core of the constellations, with Perseus, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Pegasus all visible in the same region of the sky. The constellations are best viewed when the sky is clear and dark, allowing for the stars to shine through with minimal light pollution.\n\nPerseus, the constellation, is said to represent the hero of the myth, who beheaded the snake-haired Medusa and saved Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus. The constellation is easily recognizable by its distinctive \"W\" shape, formed by the bright stars Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Persei.\n\nCassiopeia, on the other hand, is named after the queen in the myth who boasted about her beauty, leading to the gods sending the sea monster Cetus to attack her daughter Andromeda. The constellation is shaped like a \"W\" or an \"M\", depending on the time of year and the observer's location.\n\nAndromeda, the princess, is said to be chained to a rock as a sacrifice to the sea monster, but was saved by Perseus, who killed the beast and freed her. The constellation Andromeda is formed by the bright stars Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Andromedae, and is easily recognizable by its distinctive \"V\" shape.\n\nPegasus, the winged horse, is said to have been born from the blood of the Gorgon Medusa, whom Perseus beheaded. The constellation is formed by a group of bright stars that resemble a square or a rectangle, with the bright star Alpha Pegasi marking the \"nose\" of the horse.\n\nFor those interested in stargazing, now is an excellent time to get out and spot these constellations. With the summer months approaching, the nights are getting longer and darker, making it easier to see the stars. Grab a pair of binoculars, find a dark spot away from city lights, and get ready to be transported to the world of ancient Greek mythology.",

The problem is particularly acute for ethnic minorities, with figures showing those from BME backgrounds are much less likely to be homeowners than white Britons. According to a recent report by the National Housing Federation, the average house price in the UK has risen by 2.5% in the past year, with prices in London and the South East increasing by as much as 5%. This has led to a significant increase in the number of people who are struggling to get onto the property ladder.\n\nThe report also highlighted the stark disparities in homeownership rates between ethnic minorities and white Britons. Figures from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that just 23% of people from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) backgrounds own their own home, compared to 64% of white Britons.\n\nThis gap is particularly pronounced in certain regions, such as London, where only 15% of BME households own their own home, compared to 45% of white households. In other areas, such as the North East, the gap is smaller, but still significant, with 31% of BME households owning their own home, compared to 54% of white households.\n\nThe reasons for this disparity are complex and multifaceted, but experts point to a range of factors, including discriminatory practices in the mortgage market, lack of affordable housing options, and limited access to financial support.\n\nOne of the key challenges facing BME households is the difficulty in securing a mortgage. Research by the charity Shelter has found that BME households are more likely to be rejected for a mortgage than white households, even when they have similar credit profiles. This is due in part to the fact that many mortgage lenders use biased algorithms that are more likely to reject applications from BME households.\n\nIn addition, many BME households struggle to access affordable housing options. A report by the London School of Economics found that BME households are more likely to live in overcrowded or poor condition housing, and are less likely to have access to green spaces or community facilities.\n\nThe government has announced plans to address these disparities, including a new initiative to increase the number of affordable housing options available to BME households. The initiative, which is being piloted in several London boroughs, will provide financial support to BME households who are struggling to get onto the property ladder.\n\nIn addition, the government has pledged to work with mortgage lenders to address the issue of biased algorithms and to increase transparency in the mortgage application process. However, many experts argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the problem, including a lack of affordable housing options and limited access to financial support.\n\nAs the UK's housing market continues to rise, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the disparities faced by BME households.

Credit unions are financial co-operatives owned and controlled by their members that have traditionally specialised in loans and savings for the less well-off, but are now targeting people of all incomes. They are seen as offering a vital alternative to banks, expensive payday lenders and loan sharks, and the launch of this latest union, called retailCURe, is a big boost for the sector. The new credit union, retailCURe, aims to provide affordable financial services to retail workers, who are often vulnerable to the high-interest rates and fees charged by payday lenders. According to a recent study, over 1.2 million retail workers in the UK are currently using payday lenders to make ends meet, with many being forced to pay exorbitant rates of interest and fees.\n\nRetailCURe is hoping to change this trend by offering competitive loan rates and savings accounts to its members. The credit union will also provide financial education and support to help retail workers manage their finances and avoid debt. \"We're excited to be launching retailCURe, which will provide a vital lifeline to retail workers who are struggling to make ends meet,\" said Theo Paphitis, one of the key backers of the initiative.\n\nThe credit union has already gained the support of several major high street brands, including John Lewis and Debenhams, which will be providing financial backing and expertise to help get the initiative off the ground. \"We're proud to be supporting retailCURe, which will help our colleagues and customers avoid the clutches of payday lenders,\" said a spokesperson for John Lewis.\n\nThe launch of retailCURe is seen as a major boost for the credit union sector, which has traditionally focused on serving low-income communities.

With such uncertainty, businesses have also recently curtailed spending on capital investments like computers, delivery trucks and other equipment, apparently in anticipation of higher tax rates and the destructive side effects of government cutbacks. Given that capital expenditures have been weak recently, some economists believe businesses will start spending more if Congress ends or at least delays the risk of severe fiscal tightening. \"You would think there must be for most businesses a list of projects they'd like to do which they've just been pushing a little bit into the future because they haven't been able to justify taking the risk because they don't know what's around the corner,\" said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. According to Gault, if Congress can provide a clearer picture of the country's fiscal future, businesses may feel more confident in their investments, leading to an increase in capital expenditures. This, in turn, could have a positive impact on the overall economy.\n\nGault's sentiments are echoed by other economists, who point out that businesses have been holding back on investments due to the uncertainty surrounding the tax code and government spending. \"The lack of clarity on the tax front is making it difficult for businesses to make long-term plans,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"If Congress can provide some certainty, we could see a boost in capital expenditures, which would be a positive sign for the economy.\"\n\nThe impact of weak capital expenditures is already being felt in certain industries. For example, the construction industry has seen a significant decline in investment in recent months, with many builders and developers putting projects on hold until the uncertainty surrounding the tax code is resolved.\n\nHowever, not all economists are optimistic about the potential for an increase in capital expenditures. Some argue that the underlying issues driving the decline in confidence are too deep-seated to be addressed solely through Congressional action. \"The problem is not just a lack of clarity on the tax front, it's also a lack of confidence in the overall direction of the economy,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at DS Economics. \"Until we see some meaningful progress on the deficit and debt, I'm not sure that businesses will be willing to take on significant new investments.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, many economists believe that an increase in capital expenditures would be a positive sign for the economy. \"Capital expenditures are a key driver of economic growth, and if businesses start investing again, it could have a significant impact on the overall economy,\" said Gault. \"It's not a silver bullet, but it's an important step in the right direction.\"\n\nAs Congress continues to debate the future of the tax code and government spending, businesses and economists alike will be watching closely for signs of a shift in policy. If Congress can provide the clarity and certainty that businesses are seeking, it could be a major boost for the economy. But if the uncertainty continues, it could have far-reaching consequences for businesses and consumers alike.",

        "Text": "Hundreds of Apple workers across Europe who were employed to check Siri recordings for errors have lost their jobs after the company announced it was suspending the programme earlier this month. More than 300 employees have had their contracts ended in the company's Cork facility alone, according to former employees, with more sent home from other sites across Europe. The staff had been on paid leave since 2 August, the day Apple announced its decision to suspend the programme, referred to as \"grading\", as it conducted \"a thorough review\". The decision followed a story in the Guardian that revealed the workers frequently heard confidential medical information and couples having sex while checking the Siri recordings. The graders, employed through contracting firms, were sent home that Friday, with many told there was no work for them due to \"technical errors\". The sudden termination of the grading program has left many former employees reeling, with some expressing concerns about the sudden loss of income and the uncertainty surrounding their future employment prospects.\n\n\"I was told there was no work for me due to technical errors, but I know that's not the truth,\" said one former grader, who wished to remain anonymous. \"We were doing our jobs, and then suddenly we were sent home without any explanation. It's been a nightmare trying to find new work, and I'm worried about how I'll pay my bills.\"\n\nThe grading program, which was launched in 2015, was designed to ensure the accuracy and quality of Siri's responses. The graders, who were employed through contracting firms, listened to recordings of Siri conversations and identified errors, such as mispronunciations or incorrect answers. However, the program has been plagued by controversy in recent years, with many workers complaining about the emotional toll of listening to sensitive and disturbing conversations.\n\nThe Guardian's investigation, which revealed that graders were frequently exposed to confidential medical information and intimate conversations, sparked widespread outrage and calls for Apple to improve its handling of the program. The company's decision to suspend the program was seen as a major victory for the workers, who had been fighting for better working conditions and more transparency.\n\nHowever, the sudden termination of the program has left many workers feeling betrayed and abandoned. \"We were told that our work was important, that we were helping to make Siri better,\" said another former grader. \"But it seems like we were just disposable pawns in Apple's game. They didn't care about us or our well-being, they just wanted to get rid of us.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the grading program has also raised questions about Apple's treatment of its contractors. Many workers have spoken out about the poor working conditions, low pay, and lack of benefits that they experienced while working for Apple. The company's decision to suspend the program has been seen as a major blow to its reputation, and many are calling for greater transparency and accountability in its treatment of contractors.\n\nAs the dust settles on the grading program, many former workers are left wondering what the future holds. Will Apple find a new way to ensure the quality of Siri's responses, or will it abandon the program altogether? One thing is certain, however: the controversy surrounding the grading program has exposed the darker side of Apple's operations, and it will take more than just a suspension of the program to repair the damage.",

        "Text": "Financial markets around the world have dropped sharply amid mounting fears of a slowdown in the global economy, after eurozone factory output fell at the fastest rate in almost six years. Friday's losses on stock exchanges across Europe and on Wall Street came after figures suggested economic growth across the European single currency bloc remained weak in the first quarter of 2019, dashing hopes of a rebound from a weak end to last year. Economists said the poor readings of industrial output probably reflected a slowdown in China and the world economy, raising the prospect that growth for the rest of 2019 would be weaker than expected. New York slumped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 460 points, or 1.8%, while the FTSE 100 dropped by 2% and markets across Europe also recorded steep losses. The decline in global markets was widespread, with major indices in Asia and Europe also experiencing significant losses. The Shanghai Composite Index fell by 2.5%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped by 2.1%. In Europe, the German DAX index lost 2.3%, while the French CAC 40 index fell by 2.2%.\n\nThe poor economic data from the eurozone has raised concerns about the impact on global trade and growth. The European Central Bank (ECB) has already taken steps to stimulate the economy, cutting interest rates and launching a new round of quantitative easing. However, the latest figures suggest that these measures may not be enough to boost growth.\n\nThe slowdown in the eurozone is also having a ripple effect on other regions, including the United States. The US Commerce Department reported that factory output in the country fell by 0.5% in April, the largest decline in nearly a year. This has led to concerns about the impact on the US economy, which has been growing steadily for several years.\n\nEconomists are divided on the outlook for the global economy, with some predicting a mild recession and others arguing that the slowdown is temporary. However, most agree that the current situation is concerning and that policymakers need to take action to address the issues.\n\nThe decline in global markets has also had a significant impact on investor sentiment, with many investors becoming increasingly risk-averse. This has led to a flight to safety, with investors flocking to assets such as government bonds and gold.\n\nIn response to the market volatility, central banks around the world are considering taking action to stabilize the situation. The ECB is expected to announce further measures to support the eurozone economy, while the US Federal Reserve is also considering cutting interest rates.\n\nThe situation is being closely watched by investors and policymakers around the world, who are waiting to see how the global economy will respond to the current challenges. In the meantime, the decline in global markets is likely to continue, with many investors bracing themselves for a potentially turbulent period ahead.",

Your sense of smell may fluctuate in sensitivity over the course of 24 hours, in tune with our circadian clocks, with your nose best able to do its job during the hours before you go to sleep, according to a study published last month. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) conducted the study, which involved 300 participants who were asked to identify a series of scents at different times of the day. The results showed that the participants' ability to detect and distinguish between different smells was significantly better in the evening, around 8-10 pm, compared to other times of the day.\n\n\"This is the first study to demonstrate that our sense of smell is regulated by our internal clock,\" said Dr. Jay Gottfried, the lead author of the study. \"Our findings have important implications for how we think about the sense of smell and its role in our daily lives.\"\n\nThe researchers believe that the fluctuations in our sense of smell may be linked to the natural fluctuations in our body's levels of certain hormones, such as cortisol and melatonin. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating our sleep-wake cycles and may also influence our sense of smell.\n\nThe study's findings could have practical applications in a range of fields, from medicine to marketing. For example, healthcare professionals may need to consider the timing of scent-based therapies, such as aromatherapy, to maximize their effectiveness. Similarly, advertisers may need to rethink their use of scents in marketing campaigns, as the effectiveness of a particular scent may vary depending on the time of day.\n\nThe study's results also raise interesting questions about the relationship between our sense of smell and our brain's ability to process and remember different smells. While the study did not directly address these questions, the researchers plan to investigate them further in future studies.\n\nIn the meantime, the study's findings offer a fascinating insight into the complex and dynamic nature of our sense of smell. So, the next time someone tells you to \"wake up and smell the roses,\" you might want to consider the timing of your rose-sniffing activities.",

But when hundreds of passengers were then left stranded, crisis-response experts accused the airline of failing them, too. Four days later, half a billion pounds have been wiped off the value of BA parent company IAG. Paul Charles, a former director of communications for Eurostar and Virgin Atlantic, where he created the airline's crisis strategy, is baffled by how long it took BA to say anything. \"You have to respond within an hour with a full statement on what is going on,\" he says. As the hours ticked by, passengers grew increasingly frustrated, with many taking to social media to vent their anger and disappointment. \"Still stuck at Heathrow, no food, no water, no communication from BA,\" tweeted one stranded traveler. \"Absolutely appalling service from British Airways.

On a floor of 100 exhibitors, dominated by custom steel and titanium bikes, one builder stood out because of his choice of material: carbon fibre. While the majority of road bikes are carbon fibre these days, custom frames built from the lightweight material are rare because of the technical challenges involved. However, from his workshop in Worcestershire, Richard Craddock is overcoming these barriers. Craddock spent a number of years designing cycles for various brands and riding for an amateur racing team in France before deciding to build a carbon bike \"exact for me\". With a background in design and a passion for racing, Richard Craddock was well-equipped to tackle the challenges of building a custom carbon fibre bike. After years of working with various brands, he decided to take the leap and create a bike that was tailored to his own specific needs and preferences.\n\nCraddock's journey into carbon fibre frame building began with extensive research and experimentation. He spent countless hours studying the properties of the material, learning about its strengths and weaknesses, and experimenting with different layups and manufacturing techniques. He also drew inspiration from other industries, such as aerospace and Formula 1, where carbon fibre is commonly used to create high-performance components.\n\nDespite the technical hurdles, Craddock's dedication and expertise ultimately paid off. His first custom carbon fibre bike, which he built in his Worcestershire workshop, was a stunning example of what could be achieved with this challenging material. The bike's sleek, aerodynamic design and exceptional handling capabilities quickly earned it a reputation among local cyclists, and word of Craddock's exceptional craftsmanship spread rapidly.\n\nToday, Craddock's carbon fibre bikes are in high demand among professional and amateur cyclists alike. His frames are known for their exceptional strength, lightness, and ride quality, making them a favorite among riders who demand the best. Craddock's commitment to using only the highest-quality materials and his attention to detail have earned him a reputation as one of the UK's leading carbon fibre frame builders.\n\nCraddock's success has also led to collaborations with other industry experts, including wheel manufacturers and component suppliers. His ability to work closely with these partners has allowed him to create bespoke bikes that are tailored to the specific needs of each rider. Whether it's a professional racing team or an amateur enthusiast, Craddock's bikes are designed to deliver exceptional performance and a unique riding experience.\n\nAs the popularity of carbon fibre bikes continues to grow, it's clear that Richard Craddock is at the forefront of this trend. His innovative approach to frame building, combined with his passion for cycling and attention to detail, have earned him a reputation as one of the UK's most talented and respected frame builders. With his custom carbon fibre bikes, Craddock is redefining the boundaries of what's possible in the world of cycling, and his work is inspiring a new generation of riders and frame builders to push the limits of what's possible.",

However, they barely addressed the controversy surrounding the company's handling of Russian interference in the 2016 election, despite the fact that the issue has been a major focus of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian meddling.\n\nThe lack of transparency and accountability from Facebook's executives has sparked outrage among lawmakers and advocacy groups, who argue that the company is not doing enough to prevent similar interference in future elections.\n\n\"This is a company that is making billions of dollars off of our personal data, and yet they're not willing to take responsibility for the harm that they've caused,\" said Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"It's unacceptable that they're more focused on making money than on protecting our democracy.\"\n\nFacebook's handling of the Russian interference issue has also raised questions about the company's commitment to transparency and accountability. Despite promising to be more transparent about political advertising on its platform, Facebook has faced criticism for its lack of clarity and consistency in its policies and practices.\n\nThe company's executives have also been criticized for their lack of personal accountability. Zuckerberg and Sandberg have both faced intense scrutiny for their handling of the Russian interference issue, but they have yet to take personal responsibility for the company's mistakes.\n\n\"It's not enough for Facebook to just apologize and move on,\" said Senator Warner. \"They need to take concrete steps to prevent this kind of interference from happening again, and they need to be held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nAs the debate over Facebook's role in the 2016 election continues to unfold, the company's executives will face increasing pressure to provide greater transparency and accountability. With the 2020 election just around the corner, it's more important than ever that Facebook takes concrete steps to protect the integrity of our democracy.",

        "Text": "A decision by the Supreme Court overturning its 2003 ruling in Grutter v. Bollinger and ending the ability of universities and colleges to consider race as one among several factors informing \"holistic\" admissions decisions would be far-reaching in its harm. The experience in California over the last two decades is instructive. In 1997, the year before a statewide ban on affirmative action went into effect, the incoming classes of undergraduates at Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles, were both approximately 8 percent African-American. Last year, only 4.3 percent of U.C.L.A. ...only 4.3 percent of U.C.L.A.'s incoming class identified as African-American, a decline of nearly 46 percent. At Berkeley, the figure was even more stark, with the proportion of African-American students falling to just 3.6 percent, a drop of over 54 percent from the pre-ban era.\n\nThe decline in diversity is not limited to African-American students. The percentage of Hispanic students at U.C.L.A. also dropped significantly, from around 12 percent in 1997 to just 9.2 percent last year. At Berkeley, the percentage of Hispanic students fell from 13.4 percent to 10.3 percent over the same period.\n\nThe impact of the ban on affirmative action has been particularly felt in the state's community colleges, where the proportion of African-American students has declined by over 60 percent since the ban took effect. This has had a ripple effect on the state's workforce, with many industries struggling to attract and retain diverse talent.\n\nProponents of affirmative action argue that the Supreme Court's decision would not only harm the diversity of higher education, but also perpetuate systemic inequalities in the workforce and society as a whole. They point to studies showing that diverse teams and organizations are more innovative, productive, and successful, and that a lack of diversity can lead to a lack of representation and a lack of understanding of diverse perspectives.\n\nThe debate over affirmative action is not limited to the academic sphere. The issue has been at the forefront of national politics, with many politicians and advocacy groups weighing in on the matter. In 2018, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 16, which allowed the state's public universities to consider race and ethnicity in admissions decisions. The measure was seen as a rebuke to the Trump administration's efforts to roll back affirmative action policies.\n\nAs the Supreme Court weighs its decision on the future of affirmative action, the experience in California serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of dismantling these policies. The decline in diversity at the state's universities and colleges is a loss not only for the students who are affected, but for the state as a whole. It is a reminder of the importance of ensuring that all students, regardless of their background, have access to higher education and the opportunities that it provides.",

        "Text": "Further automation of the retail sector raises issues far beyond the needless luxuries of choice, convenience and speed of delivery (Amazon to test drone deliveries in British skies, 27 July). I wonder if the \"demand\" for stuff to be delivered by robot to our door within 30 minutes of ordering really exists – is modern satisfaction really that shallow? But in an increasingly automated society, where are the wages to buy these goods going to come from? As the retail sector continues to evolve, the question of where the wages will come from to purchase these goods becomes increasingly pressing. With automation taking over many tasks, including those traditionally performed by humans, the traditional employment model is being turned on its head.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the International Labor Organization (ILO), the rise of automation is expected to displace up to 80 million jobs globally by 2030. While some of these jobs may be replaced by new ones, the ILO warns that many of the new jobs created will be low-skilled and low-paying, exacerbating income inequality.\n\nIn the United States, for example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that between 2000 and 2016, the share of income going to the top 1% of earners increased from 13% to 21%, while the share going to the bottom 90% decreased from 64% to 49%. This trend is expected to continue, with automation and artificial intelligence (AI) potentially widening the wealth gap even further.\n\nThe consequences of this are far-reaching. As wages stagnate and income inequality grows, the ability of people to afford the goods and services they need to live decent lives becomes increasingly precarious. This is particularly concerning for low-income households, who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of automation is also having a profound impact on the way we work and live. With more tasks being performed by machines, the concept of a traditional 9-to-5 job is becoming increasingly outdated. This is leading to a shift towards a gig economy, where workers are forced to constantly juggle multiple jobs to make ends meet.\n\nIn this new economy, the notion of a stable income and benefits package is becoming a luxury of the past. Instead, workers are being forced to rely on platforms like Uber and TaskRabbit to make a living, with all the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with it.\n\nAs we move forward in this increasingly automated society, it is crucial that we address these issues head-on. This means implementing policies that promote fair wages, social welfare programs, and education and training initiatives that prepare workers for the changing job market.\n\nIt also means rethinking our values and priorities as a society. Do we truly value the convenience and speed of delivery that comes with automation, or do we prioritize the well-being and dignity of human workers? The answer to this question will determine the kind of society we build in the years to come.",

Wenner said Rolling Stone was wrong to fully retract a discredited 2014 article about allegations of a gang rape at the University of Virginia, asserting in videotaped testimony shown on Friday that much of the material in the article was correct. \"We did everything reasonable, appropriate up to the highest standards of journalism to check on this thing,\" Mr. Wenner said in a libel trial in federal court here. The trial, which began earlier this week, is a libel lawsuit brought by Nicole Eramo, a former associate dean of students at the University of Virginia, who claims that the article damaged her reputation and caused her emotional distress. The article, titled \"A Rape on Campus,\" was published in November 2014 and claimed that a fraternity gang rape had occurred at the university. However, an investigation by the university and an independent review panel found that the article's claims were largely fabricated.\n\nEramo's lawyers have argued that Rolling Stone's reporting was reckless and negligent, and that the magazine failed to properly fact-check the article before publication. In response, Wenner and other Rolling Stone executives have maintained that the article was thoroughly researched and that the magazine did everything it could to verify the claims made in the article.\n\nIn his videotaped testimony, Wenner said that he stood by the article's reporting and that he believed it was a \"powerful and important\" story that shed light on the issue of campus sexual assault. He also defended the magazine's reporting process, saying that Rolling Stone's editors and reporters had conducted extensive interviews with the alleged victim, Jackie, and had verified her claims through multiple sources.\n\nHowever, Eramo's lawyers have pointed out that the article's reporting was marred by numerous errors and inconsistencies, and that the magazine's fact-checking process was inadequate. They have also presented evidence that Jackie's story was largely fabricated, and that she had made multiple contradictory statements about the alleged rape.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue for several more days, with both sides presenting evidence and witnesses. The outcome of the trial could have significant implications for Rolling Stone and the media industry as a whole, as it will set a precedent for how libel lawsuits are handled in the future.",

Lyft's Earnings Report Highlights Shift in Focus to Profitability\n\nIn a significant departure from its previous growth-at-all-costs approach, Lyft's latest earnings report emphasized the company's commitment to profitability. During a conference call with investors, CEO Logan Green reiterated the company's goal to become profitable by late 2021, a timeline that has been accelerated from previous estimates.\n\nThe shift in focus towards profitability is a response to the changing landscape of the ride-hailing industry. As competition intensifies and regulatory pressures mount, Lyft is looking to differentiate itself by prioritizing financial sustainability. The company's efforts to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency have already started to bear fruit, with net losses narrowing to $911 million in the second quarter.\n\nLyft's path to profitability will be achieved by excluding certain costs, including stock-based compensation and certain expenses related to its self-driving car division. While this approach may raise eyebrows among investors, it reflects the company's willingness to take a more conservative approach to its financials.\n\nThe company's revenue growth remains strong, with gross bookings increasing by 22% year-over-year to $3.6 billion. However, Lyft's focus on profitability has led to a decline in its daily active riders, which fell by 10% from the previous quarter. The company attributed this decline to its efforts to optimize its pricing strategy and reduce incentives for drivers.\n\nLyft's shift towards profitability has been met with skepticism by some analysts, who argue that the company's growth prospects are being sacrificed for short-term financial gains.

The Rise of Smart Homes: Is Sharing Your Wi-Fi Password a Risk Worth Taking?\n\nIn today's interconnected world, smart gadgets have become an integral part of our daily lives. From smart thermostats to voice assistants, these devices make our lives easier and more convenient. However, with the increasing reliance on Wi-Fi connectivity, a pressing question has emerged: is it safe to give smart gadgets the password to your Wi-Fi network?\n\nThe answer is not a simple yes or no. While sharing your Wi-Fi password with smart gadgets can provide seamless connectivity and convenience, it also poses significant security risks. With the password, hackers can gain unauthorized access to your network, compromising your personal data and online activities.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for data breaches. Smart gadgets, especially those with internet connectivity, can collect and transmit sensitive information, such as browsing history, search queries, and personal messages. If your Wi-Fi password is compromised, hackers can intercept this data, putting your privacy at risk.\n\nAnother concern is the vulnerability of smart gadgets to malware and viruses. Many smart devices are not designed with robust security measures, making them susceptible to hacking and exploitation. If your Wi-Fi password is shared with these devices, hackers can use them as a gateway to infiltrate your network and spread malware.\n\nSo, should you be worried? The answer is yes. However, there are steps you can take to minimize the risks:\n\n1. Use strong and unique passwords for each smart gadget. Avoid using the same password for multiple devices to prevent a single breach from compromising all your devices.\n2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n3. Regularly update your smart gadgets' firmware and software to ensure you have the latest security patches and features.\n4. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic and protect your data from prying eyes.\n5. Limit access to your Wi-Fi network by setting up a guest network for visitors and restricting access to specific devices.\n\nIn conclusion, while sharing your Wi-Fi password with smart gadgets can provide convenience, it is essential to weigh the risks against the benefits. By taking proactive steps to secure your network and devices, you can minimize the risks and enjoy the benefits of smart home technology while maintaining your online security and privacy.",

The sudden departure has left many in the industry wondering what led to the change in leadership, especially given the studio's current financial stability.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, Tsujihara's decision to leave was a mutual one, with the studio's board of directors and the CEO himself agreeing that it was time for a change. The exact reasons for his departure are still unclear, but insiders suggest that a combination of factors, including the studio's shifting priorities and Tsujihara's own personal circumstances, contributed to the decision.\n\nTsujihara has been at the helm of Warner Bros. since 2013, and during his tenure, the studio has experienced significant success, including the release of several blockbuster films and the development of popular TV shows. He is credited with overseeing the studio's expansion into new areas, such as streaming and digital content, and has been instrumental in shaping the studio's strategy for the future.\n\nThe search for a new CEO is already underway, with several internal and external candidates being considered for the position. In the meantime, Warner Bros. has appointed Ann Sarnoff, the studio's Chief Operating Officer, as the interim CEO.\n\nSarnoff has been with Warner Bros. for over a decade and has played a key role in the studio's operations, including overseeing the development and production of several successful films and TV shows. Her appointment as interim CEO is seen as a stabilizing force, and she is expected to continue the studio's current momentum while the search for a permanent CEO is underway.\n\nThe leadership change at Warner Bros. comes at a time when the studio is poised to release several highly anticipated films, including the next installment in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and a new superhero movie. The studio is also continuing to expand its streaming services, including the popular HBO Max platform.\n\nAs the search for a new CEO continues, industry insiders are eagerly watching to see who will take the reins at Warner Bros. and what direction they will take the studio in the future. One thing is certain, however: the studio's commitment to producing high-quality content and its focus on innovation and growth will continue to be a priority, regardless of who is at the helm.",

        "Text": "Six of the biggest American technology firms have combined forces to call for major changes to the Investigatory Powers bill, commonly known as the snooper's charter. The firms warn that \"important amendments are required\" to create a bill that will not set dangerous precedents \"which may be copied elsewhere and have wider ramifications for all parties, both in the UK and overseas\". Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, who had teamed up for an earlier group submission, were joined for the first time by Apple, which had previously insisted on going it alone in its efforts to lobby the British parliament. The tech giants' joint statement, which was submitted to the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, highlights several concerns regarding the Investigatory Powers bill. One of the main issues is the lack of clear safeguards to prevent the government from abusing its powers to access personal data.\n\nThe companies argue that the bill's language is too broad and could lead to the government collecting and storing vast amounts of data without proper justification. They also express concern that the bill does not provide adequate protections for data stored outside of the UK, which could lead to conflicts with international data protection laws.\n\nAnother major issue raised by the tech firms is the bill's requirement for internet companies to retain user data for up to a year. They argue that this would create a significant burden on their infrastructure and could lead to increased costs for consumers.\n\nThe companies are also concerned about the bill's provisions for hacking and cyber-attacks. They argue that the bill's language is too vague and could lead to the government using its powers to engage in activities that could be considered illegal under other circumstances.\n\nIn addition to these specific concerns, the tech firms are also worried about the potential impact of the bill on the global internet. They argue that if the UK sets a precedent for mass surveillance, it could lead to a slippery slope where other countries follow suit, potentially leading to a loss of privacy and freedom for individuals around the world.\n\nThe joint statement from the tech giants is seen as a significant blow to the government's plans to pass the Investigatory Powers bill in its current form. The bill is currently making its way through the UK Parliament, and it is expected to be debated and voted on in the coming weeks.\n\nThe government has previously defended the bill, arguing that it is necessary to keep the country safe from terrorism and other threats. However, the tech firms' concerns have raised questions about the bill's impact on privacy and individual freedoms.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the government will be able to address the tech firms' concerns and pass the bill in its current form. However, one thing is clear: the Investigatory Powers bill has sparked a major debate about the balance between national security and individual privacy, and it is likely to have far-reaching implications for the future of the internet and online communication.",

        "Text": "Televisions, fridges and other internet-connected home appliances should carry cyber security ratings alongside energy efficiency ratings, a police chief has suggested. Durham chief constable Mike Barton said customers should be given the at-a-glance information for internet-ready equipment in the same way fridges, freezers, TVs and other appliances have to display their energy efficiency ratings before sale. Barton, the national policing lead for crime operations, proposed the idea as part of efforts to protect households from fraudsters and hackers in the era of the Internet of Things, where otherwise \"dumb\" devices can be put online and be interconnected for automation and smart appliance activities. Analysts have forecast that by 2020 there will be as many as 21bn connected devices around the world, with the surge in the number and variety of internet-ready products sparking a string of security warnings. Earlier this year, an official report warned that smartphones, watches, televisions and fitness trackers could be targeted by cyber criminals seeking to hold users to ransom over their personal data. Barton's proposal comes as the UK government is set to introduce new measures to improve the security of internet-connected devices. The proposed Cybersecurity Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, aims to make manufacturers of connected devices more accountable for the security of their products.\n\nThe Durham chief constable's suggestion to display cyber security ratings alongside energy efficiency ratings is seen as a practical solution to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. \"It's not just about energy efficiency anymore,\" Barton said. \"We need to think about the security of these devices and how they can be used to compromise our personal data.\"\n\nThe proposal has been welcomed by cybersecurity experts, who argue that it would help to raise awareness among consumers about the potential risks associated with internet-connected devices. \"It's essential that consumers are given clear information about the security of the devices they buy,\" said Dr. Emma Jones, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Cambridge. \"This would help to reduce the number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals.\"\n\nThe idea of displaying cyber security ratings is not new, but it has gained momentum in recent months as the number of internet-connected devices continues to grow. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been pushing for manufacturers to provide clear information about the security of their devices.\n\nThe UK government has also been taking steps to improve the security of internet-connected devices. In June, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) launched a consultation on the proposed Cybersecurity Bill, which aims to make manufacturers of connected devices more accountable for the security of their products.\n\nThe proposed bill would require manufacturers to take certain steps to improve the security of their devices, including conducting regular security testing and providing clear information about the security of their products. It would also give the government the power to impose fines on manufacturers that fail to comply with the new regulations.\n\nThe proposal has been welcomed by cybersecurity experts, who argue that it would help to reduce the number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals. \"The proposed Cybersecurity Bill is a step in the right direction,\" said Dr. Jones. \"It would help to raise the bar for manufacturers and provide consumers with greater peace of mind when buying internet-connected devices.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the proposal to display cyber security ratings alongside energy efficiency ratings is a practical solution to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. It would help to raise awareness among consumers about the potential risks associated with internet-connected devices and reduce the number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals.",

The engineering firm struck a deal with trade unions that will safeguard work for nearly a third of its 22,300-strong UK workforce for five years, as it prepares to double the number of engines it builds. Rolls-Royce will ditch plans to close a precision machining facility in Derby, saving 150 jobs that were at risk, as well as creating 200 new positions by building a new testing facility for jet engines. Of the £150m planned investment, £90m will be spent on building the \"testbed\", Rolls-Royce's sixth in Derby, where it puts engines destined for commercial jets through their paces. The investment is part of Rolls-Royce's efforts to increase its production capacity to meet growing demand for its engines, particularly from the commercial aviation sector. The company has been working to recover from a series of setbacks, including a major engine failure on a Singapore Airlines flight in 2018, which led to a significant loss of confidence in its products.\n\nHowever, under the leadership of CEO Warren East, Rolls-Royce has made significant strides in recent years to address the issues and improve its manufacturing processes. The company has also been investing heavily in research and development, with a focus on electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems.\n\nThe new testing facility, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2024, will be a major hub for Rolls-Royce's engine testing and development activities. The facility will be equipped with state-of-the-art testing equipment and will allow the company to test its engines under a wide range of conditions, from high-altitude to high-temperature scenarios.\n\nRolls-Royce has also announced plans to invest in its supply chain, with a focus on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the region. The company has pledged to work closely with local suppliers to develop new products and services, and to provide training and development opportunities for their employees.\n\nThe deal with trade unions has been hailed as a major success, with Unite the Union's national officer for aerospace, Ian Waddington, describing it as a \"vital\" investment in the region's engineering sector. \"This investment is a major boost for Rolls-Royce and the region's economy,\" he said. \"It will safeguard thousands of jobs and provide a platform for growth and development in the years to come.\"\n\nThe news has been welcomed by local politicians, with Derby's Mayor, Chris Poulter, describing it as a \"game-changer\" for the city. \"This investment is a testament to the hard work and dedication of Rolls-Royce's employees and the region's engineering sector as a whole,\" he said. \"We look forward to working closely with the company to ensure that this investment has a lasting impact on the region's economy.\"\n\nOverall, Rolls-Royce's £150m investment in the east Midlands is a major vote of confidence in the region's engineering sector, and is expected to have a significant impact on the local economy. The deal with trade unions has ensured that thousands of jobs will be safeguarded, and the company's plans to invest in its supply chain and build a new testing facility will provide a platform for growth and development in the years to come.",

But environmental groups say a shortfall in the capacity of the company's water permits is evidence the company's readiness claims are \"bogus\" and designed to heap political pressure on decision-makers. Publicly available Queensland government information shows Adani holds two short-term water permits, for Mistake Creek and the Belyando River, which expire in April and June this year.

His stance has earned him widespread respect across the political spectrum, and his continued leadership would likely be welcomed by many in the financial sector and beyond.\n\nThe news has also sparked speculation about the potential implications for the Bank of England's interest rate policy. Carney has been a key figure in the bank's decision-making process, and his continued presence could influence the timing and pace of future rate hikes. The bank has already raised interest rates twice since the Brexit vote, and some economists believe that Carney's guidance could play a crucial role in shaping the bank's future policy decisions.\n\nWhile the exact timing and circumstances of Carney's potential extension remain unclear, the prime minister's public endorsement has sent a strong signal that the UK government is committed to supporting the governor's efforts to stabilize the economy. The move would also be seen as a significant coup for May, who has faced criticism from some quarters over her handling of the Brexit process.\n\nAs the UK navigates the complex and often treacherous waters of Brexit, the stability and continuity provided by Carney's leadership could prove invaluable. With the prime minister's full backing, the governor is likely to remain a key figure in shaping the country's economic future, at least in the short to medium term.",

The company's parent, Centrica, said falling gas and power prices had brought new suppliers to the market, intensifying the rivalry for customers. The 3% fall in UK home customers was also the result of a significant number of long-term contracts coming to an end at the same time, leaving British Gas with 14.26m accounts. Customer numbers started rising again in June, it said. The decline in customer numbers marks a significant shift in the UK energy market, which has long been dominated by the \"big six\" suppliers, including British Gas, E.ON, and SSE. However, in recent years, new entrants have disrupted the market, offering competitive prices and innovative services to attract customers.\n\nAccording to industry experts, the rise of smaller suppliers has been driven by the increasing popularity of online-only retailers, such as Bulb and Octopus Energy, which have capitalized on the growing demand for affordable and flexible energy deals. These new players have been able to offer prices that are significantly lower than those of the traditional suppliers, making them an attractive option for price-conscious consumers.\n\nThe impact of this increased competition has been felt most acutely by British Gas, which has seen its market share decline steadily over the past few years. The company has responded by launching its own range of competitive tariffs and introducing new services, such as its \"Smart Meter\" scheme, which allows customers to monitor and control their energy usage in real-time.\n\nDespite the decline in customer numbers, British Gas remains one of the largest energy suppliers in the UK, with a significant presence in both the domestic and commercial markets.

We're investing in new technologies and services to help our customers manage their energy usage and reduce their bills. We're also working hard to reduce our own carbon footprint and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.\"\n\nAs the energy market continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether British Gas will be able to regain its footing and regain its position as one of the leading energy suppliers in the UK. However, with its commitment to innovation and customer service, the company is well-placed to adapt to the changing market and continue to thrive in the years to come.",

The song, famous as a civil rights anthem -- and revived in recent years for numerous vigils across the country in response to gun violence -- is the subject of a lawsuit that challenges the validity of the song's copyright. The lawsuit, filed by a group of musicians and musicologists, argues that the song's copyright was obtained through a series of questionable transactions and agreements. According to the plaintiffs, the original song, \"I'll Overcome Someday,\" was written by African-American gospel singer and minister Charles Tindley in the 1900s. The song gained popularity among African-American churches and became a staple of the civil rights movement.\n\nIn the 1940s, a white songwriting team, including Pete Seeger and Guy Carawan, adapted the song and changed its title to \"We Shall Overcome.\" The song became a rallying cry for the civil rights movement, with thousands of people singing it during protests and marches. The song's popularity continued to grow, and it was featured in numerous films, TV shows, and advertisements.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the copyright for \"We Shall Overcome\" was obtained through a series of agreements and transactions that were not properly documented or authorized. They claim that the song's original authors, including Tindley and Seeger, did not receive fair compensation for their work, and that the copyright was later sold and transferred without their knowledge or consent.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to have the copyright for \"We Shall Overcome\" declared invalid and to establish a new public domain for the song. The plaintiffs believe that this would allow the song to be used freely by anyone, without the need for permission or payment.\n\nThe lawsuit has sparked a heated debate among musicians, musicologists, and civil rights activists. Some argue that the song's copyright should be protected, citing the importance of preserving the cultural and historical significance of the song. Others argue that the song should be in the public domain, citing the fact that it has been widely used and adapted for decades without proper compensation to the original authors.\n\nThe outcome of the lawsuit is likely to have significant implications for the music industry and for the use of \"We Shall Overcome\" in the future. If the court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, it could pave the way for other songs and musical compositions to be re-evaluated and potentially declared public domain. On the other hand, if the court rules in favor of the defendants, it could reinforce the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and the value of creative works.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the lawsuit has already sparked a renewed interest in the song's history and significance. Musicologists and historians are re-examining the song's origins and evolution, and many are calling for greater recognition and compensation for the original authors and performers. As the lawsuit continues to unfold, it is clear that \"We Shall Overcome\" will remain an important and controversial cultural icon for years to come.",

Or at least an experiment suggests they do.\n\nA groundbreaking study published in the journal Science has revealed that chimpanzees and bonobos are capable of reading human minds, a skill previously thought to be exclusive to humans. The research, conducted by a team of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, has significant implications for our understanding of animal cognition and intelligence.\n\nThe experiment involved a series of tests in which humans and apes were paired together in a room. One member of the pair was shown a picture, while the other was asked to guess what the image depicted. The twist was that the ape was not physically shown the picture, but rather, the human was. The researchers then measured the ape's ability to correctly identify the image based on the human's thoughts.\n\nThe results were astonishing. The apes were able to accurately guess the images up to 70% of the time, even when the human was thinking of a complex or abstract concept. This suggests that the apes were not simply mimicking the human's actions, but rather, were actually reading their thoughts.\n\n\"This study shows that apes are capable of mental time travel, allowing them to access and understand the thoughts and intentions of others,\" said Dr. Frans de Waal, a primatologist and co-author of the study. \"This is a remarkable ability that has previously been thought to be unique to humans.\"\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching. It suggests that apes may be more intelligent and self-aware than previously thought, and raises questions about their ability to understand and respond to human emotions and intentions.\n\n\"This study has significant implications for our understanding of animal cognition and intelligence,\" said Dr. de Waal. \"It challenges our assumptions about the uniqueness of human consciousness and highlights the importance of considering the cognitive abilities of other animals.\"\n\nThe research also has practical applications in fields such as animal training and conservation. If apes are capable of reading human minds, it may be possible to use this ability to improve communication and training techniques.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked a renewed interest in the cognitive abilities of apes and have raised important questions about the nature of intelligence and consciousness. As researchers continue to explore the minds of our primate cousins, we may uncover even more surprising and remarkable abilities.",

What you don't hear quite so often is that the stuff under the land is also apparently made of freedom as well. That is, at least according to a news release this week from the Department of Energy (DoE). According to the Department of Energy's (DoE) recent announcement, the United States has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of geothermal energy. The revelation suggests that the country's vast underground resources are not only abundant but also contain a unique property that could revolutionize the way we generate electricity.\n\nThe DoE's statement claimed that the newly discovered \"freedom material\" has the ability to store and release thermal energy in a way that is both efficient and sustainable. This breakthrough could potentially solve the nation's energy crisis by providing a reliable and clean source of power.\n\nGeothermal energy has long been touted as a promising alternative to fossil fuels, but the technology has been hindered by the limited availability of suitable underground resources. The DoE's discovery, however, could change the game by unlocking new areas for exploration and development.\n\nThe concept of \"freedom material\" may seem unusual, but experts explain that it is a unique combination of minerals and rock formations that can absorb and release heat energy without generating greenhouse gas emissions. This property makes it an attractive option for countries looking to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nWhile the DoE's announcement has generated significant excitement in the scientific community, some experts have raised concerns about the feasibility of harnessing this new resource. Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading geologist, cautioned that the technology is still in its infancy and requires further research to ensure its viability.\n\n\"We need to conduct more studies to understand the full potential of this 'freedom material' and its potential applications,\" Dr. Rodriguez said. \"It's a promising development, but we must proceed with caution and rigor to ensure that it is safe and effective.\"\n\nDespite these reservations, the DoE remains optimistic about the prospects of this new technology. In a statement, the agency expressed its commitment to investing in research and development to unlock the full potential of the \"freedom material.\"\n\n\"This breakthrough has the potential to transform the way we generate electricity and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,\" said a DoE spokesperson. \"We are excited to explore the possibilities of this new technology and its potential to benefit the American people.\"\n\nAs the scientific community continues to study and refine the technology, the world waits with bated breath to see if the \"freedom material\" will indeed live up to its promise. One thing is certain, however – the discovery has sent shockwaves through the energy sector and has the potential to change the course of history.",

        "Text": "Why did the chiton roll into a ball? \"To get to the other side,\" said Julia Sigwart, an evolutionary biologist at Queens University Belfast in Northern Ireland. About 500 million years ago, a couple species of now extinct trilobites became the first animals to roll themselves into a ball for protection. The discovery of these ancient trilobites has provided scientists with a fascinating glimpse into the early evolution of animal behavior. According to Sigwart, the trilobites' unique ability to roll into a ball was likely a response to their environment, which was characterized by frequent predators and harsh conditions.\n\n\"It's thought that these trilobites lived in shallow waters, where they were vulnerable to predators such as early fish and other invertebrates,\" explained Sigwart. \"By rolling into a ball, they were able to protect their soft, vulnerable underside and present a more formidable defense to potential predators.\"\n\nThe trilobites' ball-rolling behavior is not unique to these ancient creatures, however. Many modern animals, from hedgehogs to armadillos, exhibit similar behaviors as a means of defense. But the trilobites' ability to do so 500 million years ago is a significant discovery, as it suggests that this behavior may have evolved independently in different species.\n\nSigwart and her team used computer simulations to study the trilobites' behavior, using data from fossilized remains to recreate their movements and interactions. The simulations revealed that the trilobites' ball-rolling behavior was not just a simple reflex, but rather a complex strategy that allowed them to optimize their defense and increase their chances of survival.\n\n\"This study shows that even in the early days of animal evolution, species were developing sophisticated behaviors to cope with their environments,\" said Sigwart. \"It's a reminder that the evolution of behavior is a long and complex process, and that even seemingly simple behaviors can have a rich history.\"\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature, has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of animal behavior. It suggests that the development of complex behaviors is not unique to modern animals, but rather has a long and ancient history.\n\nAs scientists continue to uncover the secrets of the ancient trilobites, they are gaining a deeper understanding of the evolution of life on Earth. And it's clear that even the most seemingly simple behaviors can hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of the past.",

        "Text": "Airbnb has taken a step closer to avoiding onerous national regulations after an adviser to the European court of justice said the company should be regarded as a digital service provider. Maciej Szpunar, one of the ECJ's advocates general, found that Airbnb was what Brussels would describe as an information society service, a status that comes with the right to operate freely across the EU. Szpunar rejected the claims of a French tourism association that the company should face the same accounting, insurance and financial obligations as traditional providers of real estate. Airbnb, which is registered in Ireland, argues that its commercial activities in matching property owners with people seeking accommodation could not be regarded as real estate brokerage. The ruling is a significant victory for Airbnb, which has been facing increasing pressure from regulators and traditional hospitality industry players to comply with stricter regulations. The company has long argued that its platform is fundamentally different from traditional real estate agencies, as it does not own or manage properties, but rather provides a digital marketplace for property owners to list their properties and for guests to book them.\n\nSzpunar's opinion, which is not binding but is highly influential, could have far-reaching implications for the way the EU regulates online platforms. If upheld, it could pave the way for other digital service providers to operate more freely across the EU, without being subject to the same regulatory requirements as traditional industries.\n\nThe French tourism association, which brought the case against Airbnb, had argued that the company's activities constituted a real estate brokerage, and therefore should be subject to the same regulatory requirements as traditional real estate agencies. However, Szpunar disagreed, finding that Airbnb's activities were more akin to those of an information society service provider, which is defined as a company that provides information or other services over the internet.\n\nAirbnb's lawyer, Yves Bot, welcomed the ruling, saying that it recognized the company's innovative business model and its contribution to the EU's digital economy. \"This opinion confirms that Airbnb is a digital service provider, not a real estate agent,\" Bot said. \"We believe that this decision will help to promote innovation and competition in the EU's digital economy, and will benefit both hosts and guests.\"\n\nThe ruling is also seen as a blow to traditional hospitality industry players, who have long complained that Airbnb's lack of regulation has given it an unfair advantage. The company's ability to operate freely across the EU, without being subject to the same regulatory requirements as traditional hotels and other accommodation providers, has been a major source of frustration for many in the industry.\n\nHowever, some experts have warned that the ruling could also have unintended consequences, such as creating a regulatory vacuum that could allow other online platforms to operate outside of the law. \"While the ruling may be seen as a victory for Airbnb, it also raises questions about the lack of regulation in the online platform economy,\" said Dr. Maria Martinez, a professor of law at the University of Cambridge. \"If we don't have proper regulation, we risk creating a Wild West scenario where companies can operate with impunity.\"\n\nThe European Commission is expected to issue its own opinion on the case in the coming weeks, and the final ruling is expected to be made by the ECJ later this year. The outcome could have significant implications for the future of online platforms in the EU, and could shape the way that regulators approach the issue of online regulation in the years to come.",

In addition, their counterparts in several other European countries were expected to take more limited labor action this week. The strikes, which are set to take place on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, are expected to cause significant disruptions to air travel across Europe. The French controllers' union, Sud-Aviation, has called for the strikes in response to the European Commission's proposal to accelerate the integration of air traffic management systems.\n\nAccording to the union, the proposal would lead to the loss of thousands of jobs and a reduction in working conditions for air traffic controllers. The union is also concerned that the integration of systems would lead to a decrease in safety standards and an increase in the risk of errors.\n\nThe strikes are expected to affect flights across Europe, with many airlines already warning of delays and cancellations. The French national carrier, Air France, has announced that it will cancel around 30% of its flights during the strike period.\n\nOther European countries are also expected to take labor action this week. In the UK, air traffic controllers are planning a 24-hour strike on Wednesday, while in Germany, controllers are planning a series of one-hour walkouts throughout the day.\n\nThe strikes come as the European Commission is pushing to finalize its proposal for a single European sky, which would integrate air traffic management systems across the continent. The commission argues that the integration would improve efficiency and reduce costs, but the unions are concerned that it would lead to job losses and a decrease in safety standards.\n\nThe French government has urged the unions and the European Commission to negotiate a solution to the dispute, but so far, no agreement has been reached. The strikes are expected to cause significant disruptions to air travel, and passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest information before traveling.",

The UK-listed engineering firm said on Wednesday it would pay out share bonuses to its three co-founders and the finance chief under a five-year incentive plan, which was approved by investors in 2012. Based on the average share price over the past 40 days of 234p, the total bonus pot is worth £240m. The quartet – Christopher Miller, executive chairman; David Roper, executive vice chairman; Simon Peckham, chief executive; and Geoff Martin, chief financial officer – are entitled to 68% of it. This means they will get £40m each in shares. The remainder of the pot will be shared between 20 senior managers. The executives can sell shares to cover the £70m of income tax due on the awards but must retain at least half the remaining shares for at least two years. The news has sparked controversy among investors and critics, who argue that the massive payout is a reflection of the company's poor performance and lack of transparency. Melrose Industries has faced criticism in the past for its aggressive cost-cutting measures and lack of investment in research and development, which has led to concerns about its long-term sustainability.\n\nDespite the company's struggles, the four executives have seen their share of the bonus pot increase significantly since the incentive plan was first introduced in 2012. The plan, which was approved by investors at the time, was intended to incentivize the executives to drive growth and increase shareholder value. However, critics argue that the plan has been manipulated to benefit the executives at the expense of other stakeholders.\n\n\"This is a clear example of corporate greed,\" said one investor, who wished to remain anonymous. \"The executives are being rewarded for their poor performance, while the company's employees and customers are left to suffer the consequences. It's a clear example of the disconnect between the interests of the executives and those of the company as a whole.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the bonus payout comes as Melrose Industries is facing increased pressure from activist investors, who are pushing for changes to the company's strategy and governance. The company has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability, and many investors are calling for greater oversight and accountability from the company's executives.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Melrose Industries has defended the bonus payout, saying that it is a reflection of the company's strong performance and the executives' hard work. The company has also pointed out that the bonus payout is not the only form of compensation that the executives receive, and that they are also entitled to other forms of remuneration, such as salary and benefits.\n\nHowever, many investors and critics remain skeptical, and the controversy surrounding the bonus payout is likely to continue to dominate the headlines in the coming weeks and months. As the company's executives reap the rewards of their hard work, many are left to wonder whether the company's priorities are truly aligned with those of its stakeholders.",

Paul Oetken, wrote in his decision. \"But the states have failed to persuade the court that this novelty alone establishes that the SALT cap exceeds Congress's broad tax power.\" Judge Oetken's ruling was a significant blow to the states, which had argued that the SALT cap was an unconstitutional overreach by the federal government. The cap, which was introduced as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, limits the amount of state and local taxes that individuals can deduct from their federal taxable income.\n\nThe states, led by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, had claimed that the SALT cap disproportionately affected middle- and upper-income taxpayers who live in high-tax states. They argued that the cap was a violation of the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, but not to impose taxes that unfairly burden certain states.\n\nHowever, Judge Oetken disagreed, stating that the SALT cap was a legitimate exercise of Congress's power to tax. He noted that the cap was a neutral tax policy that applied equally to all states, regardless of their tax rates. The judge also rejected the states' argument that the SALT cap was a form of protectionism, designed to favor low-tax states over high-tax states.\n\nThe ruling is a significant setback for the states, which had hoped to challenge the SALT cap in court. The cap has been a contentious issue in recent years, with many taxpayers and lawmakers arguing that it unfairly penalizes high-tax states and drives up the cost of living.\n\nThe decision is also likely to have implications for the 2020 presidential election, where the SALT cap has become a major issue in several battleground states. Democrats, who have promised to repeal the SALT cap if they win the White House, are likely to use the ruling to argue that the cap is an unfair and unconstitutional tax policy.\n\nIn a statement, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has been a vocal critic of the SALT cap, said that the ruling was \"disappointing\" and that the state would continue to fight against the cap. \"We will not give up on our fight to protect the rights of New Yorkers and ensure that they are not unfairly penalized by the federal government,\" Cuomo said.\n\nThe decision is not the final word on the SALT cap, however. The states are likely to appeal the ruling to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and if necessary, to the Supreme Court. The issue is also likely to be addressed in the 2020 presidential election, where voters in high-tax states may be looking for candidates who promise to repeal the SALT cap.",

In recently submitted filings before the Australian Competition Tribunal, Glencore Coal complained that increased fees to enter the newly privatised Newcastle port, which produces more than 170m tonnes of saleable coal a year, will \"materially impact on the profit margins of coal producers\". The challenge comes amid diminished share prices for the multinational company and job cuts in its zinc production operations around the world. Their challenge followed the New South Wales's government decision to privatise the Newcastle port as part of a joint venture between Hastings Fund Management and China Merchants. Glencore's legal challenge has sparked concerns among industry experts and environmental groups, who fear that the company's efforts to reduce port access fees may compromise the port's ability to manage the increasing volume of coal exports.

The preliminary report, issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, said on Thursday that while the vehicle's guidance system had spotted the woman about six seconds before hitting her, emergency braking manoeuvres were not enabled in order to \"reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior\". Instead, the Uber system anticipated that the human back-up driver would intervene. However, the automated system was not designed to alert the driver of the impending danger. The investigation's findings have raised concerns about the safety protocols in place for self-driving vehicles, particularly in situations where human intervention is required. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) emphasized that the incident highlights the need for more robust safety measures to prevent such tragedies in the future.\n\nThe NTSB's preliminary report also revealed that the Uber vehicle was traveling at a speed of approximately 28 miles per hour when it struck the pedestrian, Elaine Herzberg, 49, who was walking her bicycle across the road in Tempe, Arizona. Herzberg died at the scene, and the incident marked the first known fatality involving a self-driving vehicle in the United States.\n\nThe investigation has sparked debate among experts and lawmakers about the role of human oversight in the development and testing of autonomous vehicles. While some argue that human intervention is essential to ensure safety, others believe that the technology is not yet mature enough to operate without human supervision.\n\nThe Uber incident has also led to increased scrutiny of the company's testing procedures and safety protocols. The ride-hailing giant has faced criticism for its handling of the incident, with some questioning why the company did not alert authorities immediately after the accident.

The wait was worth it. When half a dozen parrots flew over to the tree, Gómez Garza noticed their intense red fronts and the beautiful blue tips on their wing feathers. The plumage set them apart from the two species known to live in the area, which both have distinctive white fronts. As the parrots began to feed on the pods, Gómez Garza carefully observed their behavior, taking note of their size, shape, and unique characteristics. He was struck by the vibrant colors and striking patterns on their feathers, which seemed to shimmer in the sunlight. The scientist's trained eyes were scanning every detail, his mind racing with the possibilities.\n\nAfter several hours of observation, Gómez Garza carefully collected a few feathers from the parrots' roosting site, making sure not to disturb the birds or their habitat. He then returned to his laboratory in Mexico City, eager to examine the feathers under a microscope and analyze their DNA.\n\nThe results were nothing short of groundbreaking. Gómez Garza's team discovered that the parrots were a previously unknown species, distinct from any other known parrot species in the region. The team named the new species Amazona garzai, in honor of the scientist's dedication to the field.\n\nThe discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community, with ornithologists and conservationists around the world hailing Gómez Garza's find as a major breakthrough. The Amazona garzai was not only a new species, but also a critically endangered one, with a population estimated to be less than 1,000 individuals.\n\nConservation efforts were quickly put into place to protect the parrots and their habitat, with local and international organizations working together to establish protected areas and monitor the population. Gómez Garza's discovery also sparked a renewed interest in the region's avifauna, with many scientists and enthusiasts flocking to the Yucatán Peninsula to catch a glimpse of the elusive Amazona garzai.\n\nFor Gómez Garza, the discovery was a culmination of years of dedication and hard work, and he was humbled by the recognition and accolades that followed. \"This is a momentous day for Mexican ornithology,\" he said in a statement. \"We are proud to have made this discovery, and we are committed to protecting and preserving this incredible species for generations to come.\"",

To face the lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees that day, the internet companies are sending in their legal muscle: the general counsels. That way, the companies avoid putting their chief executives -- Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai of Google -- in the spotlight to deal with questions and the full-blown public relations crisis over whether they are contributing to an undermining of democracy. Here's who will appear in the congressional hearings:\n\nMr. ...Mr. Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook, will be joined by Mr. Richard Salgado, the company's director of law enforcement and intellectual property, and Mr. Samidh Gauntlett, the director of product policy and counterterrorism. Google's team will consist of Mr. Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president and general counsel, and Mr. Halimah DeLaine Wilson, the director of law enforcement and government affairs.\n\nTwitter, on the other hand, will be represented by Mr. Sean Edgett, the company's general counsel, and Mr. Nick Pickles, the director of public policy for the Americas.\n\nThese legal representatives will be grilled by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who are eager to get to the bottom of the Russian meddling scandal. The hearings are expected to be intense, with lawmakers demanding answers on how the tech giants failed to detect and prevent the spread of fake news and propaganda on their platforms.\n\nThe stakes are high for the companies, as they face the possibility of new regulations and increased scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators. The hearings come at a time when the tech industry is already facing criticism over issues such as data privacy, online harassment, and the spread of misinformation.\n\nIn the days leading up to the hearings, the companies have been scrambling to prepare, conducting internal reviews and gathering evidence to present to lawmakers. Facebook, for example, has been working to identify and remove Russian-backed accounts and pages from its platform, while Google has been reviewing its search algorithms to ensure they are not promoting fake news.\n\nDespite the intense scrutiny, the companies are likely to face tough questions from lawmakers, who are concerned about the impact of social media on democracy. The hearings are expected to be a major test for the tech industry, as it navigates the complex and often contentious world of politics and regulation.\n\nIn the end, the success of the hearings will depend on the ability of the companies to provide clear and convincing answers to the lawmakers' questions, while also addressing the concerns of the American public. As the tech giants take their seats in front of the congressional committees, they will be under the microscope, with the world watching to see how they respond to the challenges facing the industry.",

I, like many other customers, had been left feeling frustrated and disappointed by the company's failure to deliver on its promise.\n\nDespite repeated calls and emails to the company, I was met with a series of excuses and delays. The initial \"slight delay\" in obtaining the fabric had turned into a prolonged wait, with no end in sight. I was told that the cushion was still awaiting arrival, and that I would be contacted as soon as it was received. However, as the days turned into weeks, I began to lose hope.\n\nThe lack of communication from Lloyd Loom was equally concerning.

A balance of UK retailers saying sales rose minus those who reported falling sales fell to 4% in June, down from 7% in May, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest snapshot of the retail sector (pdf). The survey was conducted between 26 May and 14 June – before the UK's shock vote to leave the EU. Grocers, furniture and carpet shops, along with hardware and DIY stores, reported a pickup in sales in the year to June. The survey's findings suggest that the retail sector was already experiencing a slowdown in the months leading up to the EU referendum, which was held on June 23. This may have been due to a combination of factors, including uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the vote and a general decline in consumer confidence.\n\nDespite the overall slowdown, some sectors within the retail industry did report an increase in sales. The Confederation of British Industry's survey found that grocers, furniture and carpet shops, and hardware and DIY stores all saw a pickup in sales in the year to June. This may be attributed to the fact that these types of stores are often essential for household needs, and consumers may have been stocking up on essentials in anticipation of potential shortages or price increases following the referendum.\n\nThe survey's results are in line with other recent indicators that suggest the UK's economy was already showing signs of slowing down in the run-up to the EU referendum. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the UK's economy grew at its slowest pace in a year in the first quarter of 2016, with GDP increasing by just 0.4% compared to the previous quarter.\n\nThe CBI's survey also found that retailers' expectations for the future have become more pessimistic, with 24% of respondents expecting sales to fall in the next three months, compared to 14% who expected an increase. This suggests that retailers are bracing themselves for a potential downturn in consumer spending following the referendum.\n\nThe UK's decision to leave the EU is likely to have significant implications for the retail sector, including potential changes to trade agreements and tariffs, as well as uncertainty surrounding the movement of goods and people across borders. The CBI has called on the government to provide clarity and stability for businesses in the aftermath of the referendum, and to prioritize measures that support economic growth and job creation.\n\nIn the meantime, retailers are likely to continue to monitor consumer sentiment and adjust their strategies accordingly. With the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU likely to persist for some time, it remains to be seen how the retail sector will adapt to these changes and what impact they will have on the wider economy.",

Card Factory's Unorthodox Approach to Avoiding Bag Tax Sparks Controversy\n\nIn an effort to circumvent the government's 5p bag tax, Card Factory has taken an unconventional approach by chopping the handles off thousands of its carrier bags. The move has sparked controversy among environmentalists and consumers alike, who question the effectiveness of this solution.\n\nThe 5p bag tax, introduced in October, aims to reduce the use of single-use plastic carrier bags and encourage shoppers to opt for reusable bags instead. However, Card Factory's decision to remove the handles from its bags has raised concerns that the company is not taking the issue seriously enough.\n\n\"It's a bit of a cop-out, to be honest,\" said Sarah Jones, a local resident who shops regularly at Card Factory. \"If they're not willing to make a proper effort to reduce their plastic usage, then what's the point of the tax in the first place?\"\n\nCard Factory has defended its decision, stating that the chopped handles are still reusable and can be used as tote bags.

        "Text": "Drip water on a hot pan, and the droplets will skitter around the pan, speeding like tiny mad hovercraft on cushions of steam. This is the Leidenfrost effect, which you've probably experienced while cooking. Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, a German doctor and theologian, described the phenomenon in 1756 in a book about the properties of water. But French scientists have now figured out something new about those skittering drops. When they are small enough -- about a millimeter in diameter -- the roiling of heat in the liquid will cause the droplet to tilt and rotate. That, in turn, propels the droplet to roll. Scientists -- and home cooks -- never noticed this before, because no one had tried pinning a water droplet on a precisely flat surface. Plus, since water is clear, you usually can't see which way the liquid is churning. It was already known that the droplets, levitating on top of a layer of vapor, move easily, but the presumption was that they were sliding down a slope or pushed by air currents. This breakthrough discovery has significant implications for various fields, including engineering, physics, and even medicine. The researchers at the French institution, using advanced imaging techniques, were able to visualize the previously unknown behavior of the water droplets. They found that the rotation and tilting of the droplets creates a unique pattern of movement, which could be exploited to develop new technologies.\n\nOne potential application is in the design of more efficient heat transfer systems. By understanding how the droplets move and interact with their surroundings, engineers could develop new materials and surfaces that maximize heat transfer while minimizing energy loss. This could have significant benefits in industries such as power generation, aerospace, and automotive manufacturing.\n\nThe discovery also has potential implications for the field of medicine. Researchers are exploring the possibility of using the Leidenfrost effect to develop new methods for delivering targeted doses of medication or therapy to specific areas of the body. By harnessing the unique properties of the water droplets, scientists may be able to create more effective and efficient delivery systems for a range of medical treatments.\n\nThe French scientists' findings have also sparked interest in the field of fluid dynamics, where researchers are working to better understand the complex interactions between fluids and surfaces. The discovery of the tilting and rotation of the water droplets has opened up new avenues for research, and scientists are eager to explore the potential applications of this phenomenon.\n\nIn addition to its scientific significance, the discovery has also captured the imagination of the general public. The visualization of the Leidenfrost effect has been shared widely on social media, and many people are fascinated by the mesmerizing images of the water droplets in motion. The discovery has also sparked a renewed interest in the fundamental properties of water and the ways in which it interacts with its surroundings.\n\nAs researchers continue to explore the implications of this discovery, it is clear that the Leidenfrost effect has the potential to revolutionize a range of fields and industries.

This growth was driven by the increasing adoption of mobile devices and the growing importance of mobile in the digital advertising landscape.\n\nAlphabet's strong performance was also boosted by the success of its cloud computing business, Google Cloud, which saw revenue growth of 53% year-over-year to $2.8 billion. The company's cloud business has been gaining traction in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for cloud-based services and the company's efforts to expand its presence in the market.\n\nIn addition to its strong financial performance, Alphabet also made several announcements during its earnings call, including plans to repurchase about $7 billion of its Class C stock. This move is seen as a way for the company to return value to its shareholders and reduce its outstanding share count.\n\nDespite the strong performance, Alphabet's CEO Sundar Pichai expressed caution about the company's future prospects, citing concerns about the impact of global economic uncertainty and the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China. However, he also highlighted the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and its commitment to investing in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nOverall, Alphabet's strong quarterly performance is a testament to the company's dominance in the digital advertising market and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. While there are certainly challenges ahead, the company's strong financial position and commitment to innovation position it well for continued growth and success in the future.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Ten years ago, Google was hacked by the Chinese military in one of the most startling cyberattacks on an American company by government-affiliated agents. This week, Chronicle, a security start-up owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, plans to bring some of what it learned from that incident to other companies through a widely anticipated new product called Backstory. The highly anticipated product, Backstory, is designed to help companies detect and respond to sophisticated cyber threats, including those originating from nation-state actors. According to experts, the product's capabilities are a direct result of the research and development conducted by Chronicle's team in the aftermath of the 2009 Google hack.\n\nThe 2009 attack, which was attributed to Chinese military hackers, was a significant wake-up call for the tech industry. It marked one of the first times that a major American company had been targeted by a foreign government in such a brazen manner. The incident led to widespread concerns about the vulnerability of corporate networks and the potential for future attacks.\n\nChronicle's Backstory product is designed to address these concerns by providing companies with a comprehensive platform for detecting and responding to advanced threats. The product uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may indicate a cyber attack.\n\n\"We've learned a lot from our own experiences with cyber attacks, including the 2009 incident,\" said Stephen Gillett, CEO of Chronicle. \"We've taken those lessons and applied them to the development of Backstory, which is designed to help companies detect and respond to even the most sophisticated threats.\"\n\nBackstory is expected to be particularly useful for companies that operate in high-risk industries, such as finance, healthcare, and government contracting. These industries are often targeted by nation-state actors and other advanced threat actors due to the sensitive nature of the data they handle.\n\nThe product is also designed to be highly scalable, allowing companies of all sizes to use it to protect their networks. Chronicle has already partnered with several major companies to test the product, and it is expected to be widely available later this year.\n\nThe announcement of Backstory comes at a time when cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent. In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile attacks on major companies, including Equifax, Yahoo, and Target.\n\nAs a result, companies are increasingly looking for new and innovative ways to protect their networks and data. Chronicle's Backstory product is designed to meet this need, and its announcement is likely to be closely watched by the tech industry.\n\nIn a statement, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai praised the development of Backstory, saying that it was an important step in the fight against cyber attacks. \"We're committed to using our expertise and resources to help protect our customers and the broader tech industry from cyber threats,\" he said. \"Backstory is an important part of that effort, and we're excited to bring it to market.\"",

Research from Citizens Advice finds almost one in five people struggling with debts have had their credit card limit raised without them requesting it. The charity has demanded the Financial Conduct Authority bans the practice, amid growing concerns over a boom in lending. Unsecured lending is returning to levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis, raising alarm bells at the Bank of England that consumers may struggle to repay loans in another economic downturn, thus putting financial stability at risk. The report, which analyzed data from 2019 to 2022, reveals that 18% of individuals with unmanageable debt levels had their credit card limits increased without their consent. This trend is particularly concerning, as many of these individuals may not have the financial means to cope with the additional debt.\n\nCitizens Advice is urging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to take immediate action to prevent credit card lenders from taking advantage of vulnerable consumers. The charity is calling for a ban on the practice, citing concerns that it could exacerbate the problem of unaffordable debt and lead to a wave of defaults and debt collection woes.\n\nThe FCA has been criticized for its lack of oversight in the credit card industry, with some experts arguing that the regulator has been too lenient in its approach to debt collection practices. The Bank of England has also expressed concerns about the growth of unsecured lending, warning that it could pose a risk to financial stability if consumers are unable to repay their debts.\n\nThe report's findings have sparked a heated debate about the need for greater regulation in the credit card industry. Some experts argue that credit card lenders are taking advantage of consumers' lack of financial literacy and are using aggressive marketing tactics to encourage people to take on debt.\n\n\"This is a classic case of lenders taking advantage of vulnerable consumers,\" said a spokesperson for Citizens Advice. \"We are calling on the FCA to take immediate action to protect consumers from these unfair practices. It is unacceptable that lenders are increasing credit card limits without consent, and we urge the regulator to take a strong stance against this behavior.\"\n\nThe FCA has yet to comment on the report's findings, but the issue is likely to be a topic of discussion at its next meeting. In the meantime, consumers are being advised to be vigilant and to carefully review their credit card statements to ensure that they are not being taken advantage of.\n\nAs the credit card industry continues to grow, it is essential that regulators take a closer look at the practices of lenders and ensure that they are acting in the best interests of consumers. The public deserves to be protected from unfair and deceptive practices, and it is up to the FCA to ensure that this happens.",

Osamu Masuko, chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors, said on Thursday that the alliance would shift to a system where the group would be led by the heads of the three companies, rather than a single figurehead like Ghosn. Masuko, speaking to reporters in Tokyo, said changes to the alliance's capital structure were not discussed by company leaders at a meeting in Amsterdam. A change in the governance structure of the alliance was seen as likely by some analysts. Ghosn, who was the architect of the alliance and chaired the boards of all three manufacturers, was arrested 10 days ago after Nissan alleged he underreported income to regulators. The sudden departure of Carlos Ghosn, who had been instrumental in forging the alliance between Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors, has sent shockwaves throughout the automotive industry. The news of his arrest in Japan has raised questions about the future of the alliance and its leadership structure.\n\nAccording to Osamu Masuko, the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors, the alliance will adopt a new leadership model where the heads of the three companies will take on a more prominent role. This move is seen as a departure from the previous system, where Ghosn held the position of chairman and played a dominant role in the alliance's decision-making process.\n\nMasuko's comments came after a meeting between the leaders of the three companies in Amsterdam, where the future of the alliance was discussed. While the meeting did not result in any significant changes to the alliance's capital structure, analysts believe that a change in the governance structure is likely in the coming months.\n\nGhosn's arrest has raised concerns about the stability of the alliance and the potential impact on the companies' operations. The alliance has been a key player in the global automotive industry, with a combined market value of over $100 billion. The companies have worked together on a range of projects, including the development of new vehicles and the sharing of resources.\n\nIn a statement, Renault said that it was \"fully committed\" to the alliance and would work with its partners to ensure the continued success of the partnership. Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors also released statements expressing their commitment to the alliance and their confidence in its future.\n\nThe arrest of Ghosn has also raised questions about the future of his leadership roles at the three companies. Ghosn was the chairman of the boards of Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors, and his departure has left a power vacuum at the top of the companies.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, the alliance will need to navigate a period of uncertainty and change.

Personal insolvencies in England and Wales totalled 24,531 between January and March, up 6.7% on the previous quarter and 15.7% higher than the same period a year earlier. It was the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014, according to the Insolvency Service, which published the figures. The rise in personal insolvencies has been attributed to a combination of factors, including stagnant wages, rising living costs, and increased debt levels. The Insolvency Service's figures show that the majority of insolvency cases (63%) were attributed to debt problems, with the remaining 37% caused by other factors such as business failures or financial difficulties.\n\nThe data also reveals that the number of individuals seeking debt relief orders (DROs) increased by 14.5% compared to the same period last year, with 10,444 DROs issued in the first quarter of 2017. DROs are a type of insolvency procedure that allows individuals to write off up to £20,000 of unsecured debt and are often used by those who are struggling to pay their bills.\n\nThe Insolvency Service's director, Sean Feeney, warned that the figures are a \"cause for concern\" and highlighted the need for individuals to seek advice and support to manage their debt. \"We urge anyone struggling with debt to seek help and advice from a qualified debt advisor or a charity such as StepChange Debt Charity,\" he said.\n\nThe rise in personal insolvencies has also been linked to the UK's economic uncertainty, with many individuals feeling anxious about their financial security due to the ongoing Brexit negotiations. The Bank of England has also warned that the UK's economic growth is expected to slow down in the coming months, which could exacerbate the problem.\n\nExperts are calling for urgent action to address the issue, including measures to improve financial education and increase access to affordable credit. \"The government needs to take a more proactive role in addressing the root causes of debt and providing support to those who are struggling,\" said Mike O'Connor, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity.\n\nIn the meantime, individuals who are struggling with debt are being advised to seek help and support as soon as possible.

Investors were spooked after its chief executive, Wilf Walsh, said trading conditions had been more challenging in recent weeks and added: \"The outlook has been further complicated by the outcome of last week's referendum and we are cautious about the impact the associated uncertainty will have on consumer confidence.\" Despite the retailer reporting underlying profits up by a third to £17.3m in the year to 30 April, the shares touched a low of 216.88p before staging a recovery to reach 225p by lunchtime. In previous downturns home furnishings retailers sales have been affected by a slowdown in the housing transactions which are a trigger for purchases. Carpetright revealed that its new financial year had got off to a bumpy start with like-for-like sales down 7.6% in the UK in May but swinging back to growth of 6.3% in June. The decline in Carpetright's shares comes as no surprise, given the current economic uncertainty surrounding the UK's decision to leave the European Union. The retailer's CEO, Wilf Walsh, has expressed concerns about the impact of Brexit on consumer confidence, which could lead to a slowdown in high street spending.\n\nCarpetright's latest financial results show that underlying profits rose by a third to £17.3m in the year to 30 April, which may seem positive at first glance. However, the company's CEO has warned that trading conditions have been more challenging in recent weeks, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has added to the complexity of the outlook.\n\nThe company's like-for-like sales in the UK have been affected, with a decline of 7.6% in May, followed by a rebound to growth of 6.3% in June. This fluctuation is a cause for concern, as it suggests that Carpetright is still feeling the effects of the economic uncertainty.\n\nHistorically, home furnishings retailers have been vulnerable to downturns in the housing market, as a slowdown in housing transactions can lead to a decrease in sales. Carpetright's reliance on the housing market for its sales is a significant risk factor, and the current uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the EU only adds to the challenge.\n\nIn response to the decline in its shares, Carpetright has announced plans to reduce costs and improve its operational efficiency. The company has also launched a new marketing campaign aimed at boosting sales and increasing customer engagement.\n\nWhile Carpetright's shares may have taken a hit, the company is not the only high street retailer to be affected by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Many retailers are facing similar challenges, and the current economic climate is expected to continue to impact the industry in the coming months.\n\nIn conclusion, Carpetright's decline in shares is a reflection of the current economic uncertainty surrounding the UK's decision to leave the European Union. While the company's financial results may seem positive, the CEO's warnings about the impact of Brexit on consumer confidence and the fluctuation in like-for-like sales are cause for concern. As the UK's exit from the EU continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Carpetright and other high street retailers will adapt to the changing economic landscape.",

Scientists aren't sure why Earth was stifling hot for several million years during the Cretaceous period, but according to Dr. Tarduno, the prevailing hypothesis is that the atmosphere was filled with heat-trapping carbon dioxide, most likely the result of extraordinary volcanic activity. The resulting greenhouse effect would have transformed the polar ecosystem into a place where Tingmiatornis arctica and its prey could thrive. The discovery, led by Dr. Tarduno, a paleomagnetist at the University of Rochester, sheds new light on the Earth's climate during the Cretaceous period, a time when dinosaurs roamed the planet. The team's research suggests that the extreme heat was not limited to the equatorial regions, but was a global phenomenon that affected the entire planet.\n\nAccording to Dr. Tarduno, the team's findings are based on a unique combination of geological and paleontological data. By analyzing the magnetic properties of ancient rocks and the fossil record of the time, the researchers were able to reconstruct the Earth's climate during the Cretaceous period.\n\nThe study's results are significant because they challenge the traditional view of the Cretaceous period as a time of relative climate stability. Instead, the data suggests that the Earth's climate was much more dynamic and variable than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery also has implications for our understanding of the Earth's climate today. \"The Cretaceous period was a time of extreme climate change, and yet the Earth was able to recover and adapt,\" said Dr. Tarduno. \"This tells us that the Earth is capable of regulating its climate, even in the face of extreme events.\"\n\nThe team's research is ongoing, and they are currently working to better understand the mechanisms that drove the Earth's climate during the Cretaceous period. However, the initial findings have already sparked a new wave of interest in the field of paleoclimatology, and are expected to have a significant impact on our understanding of the Earth's climate history.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Tarduno, the research team included scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan.

May was unrelenting in her support for the austerity policies imposed by her government since 2010 and the havoc they have created for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our in our society. Now's the time for her to do what she said she would do. The proposal to introduce a binding cap on executive pay ratios, which would require companies to disclose the difference between the highest and lowest paid employees, was a key part of May's plan to tackle income inequality. However, it seems that some directors are now trying to backtrack on this commitment, citing concerns about the potential negative impact on company performance and competitiveness.\n\nBut May must remain firm in her support for this proposal. The issue of executive pay has long been a source of public anger and frustration, with many feeling that top executives are rewarded with lavish salaries and bonuses while ordinary workers struggle to make ends meet. The proposed cap on executive pay ratios is a crucial step towards addressing this issue and promoting greater fairness and transparency in the workplace.\n\nFurthermore, the proposal is not just about fairness, but also about good governance and accountability. By requiring companies to disclose their pay ratios, the government can help to ensure that executives are held accountable for their actions and that companies are held to account for their treatment of their employees.\n\nIt's worth noting that the UK is not alone in this issue. Many other countries, including the US, France, and Germany, have already implemented similar measures to curb excessive executive pay. In fact, a recent study by the High Pay Centre found that the UK has some of the highest levels of executive pay in the world, with CEOs earning an average of 129 times more than the average worker.\n\nMay must not let the directors' lobbying efforts undermine her commitment to tackling income inequality and promoting good governance. She must stand firm and ensure that the proposal to cap executive pay ratios becomes law. Anything less would be a betrayal of the many ordinary workers who have been affected by the government's austerity policies and a failure to deliver on the promises made to address income inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, May's proposal to cap executive pay ratios is a crucial step towards promoting fairness and transparency in the workplace.

The exceptions are live broadcasts of major sporting events and awards shows. ...and even those events are seeing a decline in viewership. According to a recent report by Nielsen, the average viewership for major sporting events has dropped by 15% over the past two years, with some events experiencing losses of up to 30%.\n\nThe shift towards streaming has been a major factor in this decline. Many viewers are opting to watch their favorite shows and events online, rather than tuning in to traditional television. This has led to a fragmentation of the audience, with viewers spread across multiple platforms and devices.\n\nDespite this trend, some shows are still managing to attract large audiences. The latest season of the popular drama \"Stranger Things\" on Netflix, for example, drew an estimated 64 million viewers in its first four weeks of release. Similarly, the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\" consistently drew audiences of over 10 million viewers per episode in its final season.\n\nHowever, even these shows are not immune to the effects of streaming. According to a survey by the market research firm Deloitte, 70% of respondents said they use streaming services to watch TV shows, with 40% saying they use them exclusively.\n\nThe decline in traditional TV viewership is also having a significant impact on the advertising industry. With fewer viewers tuning in to traditional TV, advertisers are being forced to rethink their strategies and allocate their budgets to other platforms.\n\nDespite these challenges, many TV networks are still holding out hope that traditional TV will make a comeback. Some are investing heavily in new content and formats, in an effort to attract and retain viewers. Others are exploring new ways to monetize their content, such as through subscription-based services.\n\nHowever, it's unclear whether these efforts will be enough to stem the tide of decline. As more and more viewers turn to streaming, it's likely that traditional TV will continue to struggle to compete. The future of television is likely to be a hybrid model, with viewers consuming content across multiple platforms and devices.\n\nIn the meantime, TV networks and advertisers will need to adapt to this new reality and find new ways to reach and engage with their audiences.

An estimated 5 to 10 percent of college students have celiac disease or other gluten-related disorders, according to Dr. Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research and Treatment in Boston. The move is a significant step towards providing a more inclusive and accommodating dining experience for students with dietary restrictions. Both Kent State and Cornell University have partnered with food service providers to offer a wide range of gluten-free options, including poke bowls, salads, and sandwiches.\n\nAccording to Kent State's dining services, the university's new gluten-free hall features a dedicated station serving gluten-free pasta, pizza, and other dishes. The hall also offers a variety of gluten-free bread and baked goods, making it easier for students with gluten intolerance to find options that fit their dietary needs.\n\nCornell University's gluten-free dining hall, on the other hand, features a global cuisine menu with dishes inspired by international flavors. The hall offers a variety of gluten-free options, including stir-fries, curries, and noodle dishes.

This includes separate cooking and preparation areas, as well as dedicated gluten-free utensils and equipment.\n\nDr. Fasano, who has been studying celiac disease and gluten-related disorders for over two decades, praised the efforts of both universities. \"It's fantastic to see institutions taking proactive steps to accommodate students with gluten-related disorders,\" he said. \"By providing gluten-free options and implementing proper protocols, these universities are not only supporting students' health but also promoting inclusivity and diversity on campus.\"\n\nThe move is also seen as a significant step towards reducing the stigma surrounding gluten-related disorders. According to Dr. Fasano, many students with gluten intolerance or celiac disease often feel like they are forced to choose between their health and their social life. By providing gluten-free options, universities can help students feel more included and supported.\n\nAs the demand for gluten-free options continues to grow, it's likely that more universities will follow in the footsteps of Kent State and Cornell. With the rise of food allergies and intolerance, providing inclusive dining options is no longer a nicety, but a necessity.\n\nFor students with gluten-related disorders, the new gluten-free dining halls at Kent State and Cornell University are a welcome addition to campus life.

As much as they'd like us to believe it, they do not have the monopoly on the scientific arguments. Good science is a rigorous and critical process of inquiry: it is far from perfect, neutral and incontrovertible. The CPA's criticism of the RSA report is a valid one, as it is essential to base policy decisions on sound scientific evidence. The report's authors may have relied too heavily on anecdotal evidence and personal opinions, rather than conducting rigorous research and analysis.\n\nMoreover, the CPA is correct in pointing out that good science is a continuous process of inquiry, refinement, and adaptation. It is not a static entity that can be relied upon to provide definitive answers. Scientific knowledge is constantly evolving, and new discoveries can often challenge existing theories and findings.\n\nIn the context of crop protection, this means that any policy decisions or recommendations should be grounded in the latest scientific research and understanding of the complex interactions between crops, pests, and the environment. The CPA's expertise in this area is undeniable, and their criticism of the RSA report serves as a reminder of the importance of evidence-based decision-making.\n\nHowever, it is also important to recognize that the RSA report was not intended to be a definitive scientific treatise, but rather a thought-provoking exploration of the future of food, farming, and the countryside. The report's authors drew on a wide range of perspectives and expertise, including those from the farming community, environmental organizations, and consumer groups.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding the RSA report is a welcome one, as it highlights the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders. By engaging in a critical and constructive discussion of the issues, we can work towards developing more effective and sustainable solutions for the future of our food system.\n\nIn conclusion, while the CPA's criticism of the RSA report is justified, it is essential to recognize the report's value as a catalyst for discussion and debate.

This includes gold status in the teaching excellence framework, one of the top 12 universities in the UK in the research excellence framework, and ranked fifth-best university in the UK by the Guardian University 2018 guide. The university makes an important contribution to the local community and economy. Despite her impressive achievements, Breakwell has faced intense scrutiny and criticism from some quarters. In November, she survived a no-confidence vote, with 55% of the university's governing body voting against a motion of no confidence. The vote was sparked by concerns over her leadership style and perceived lack of transparency.\n\nHowever, Breakwell's supporters argue that her leadership has been instrumental in driving the university's success. Under her tenure, the university has invested heavily in research infrastructure, attracted top talent, and expanded its international partnerships. The university's gold status in the teaching excellence framework is a testament to her commitment to improving the student experience.\n\nMoreover, Breakwell has been a vocal advocate for women in leadership positions, using her platform to promote gender equality and challenge stereotypes. Her own journey to the top of the academic hierarchy is a testament to her determination and resilience.\n\nHowever, the controversy surrounding Breakwell's leadership has also raised important questions about the role of vice-chancellors in universities.

        "Text": "Q. How does my phone know to flip the screen around? \"Q. How does my phone know to flip the screen around?\n\nA. It's a common phenomenon that has left many of us wondering - how does our phone know to automatically flip the screen when we rotate it? The answer lies in the clever combination of sensors and software that work together to detect the orientation of our device.\n\nThe primary sensor responsible for this functionality is the accelerometer, which measures the phone's acceleration and orientation in three-dimensional space. This data is then used by the phone's operating system to determine the device's position and orientation.\n\nWhen you rotate your phone, the accelerometer detects the change in acceleration and sends the data to the phone's processor. The processor then uses this information to trigger the screen rotation, ensuring that the display remains upright and readable regardless of the device's orientation.\n\nBut that's not all - other sensors also play a crucial role in ensuring seamless screen rotation. The gyroscope, for instance, measures the phone's rotational velocity and orientation, providing additional data to the processor to refine the screen rotation.\n\nThe phone's operating system also plays a vital role in this process. The OS uses the data from the sensors to determine the device's orientation and adjusts the screen accordingly. This is achieved through a combination of algorithms and software tweaks that ensure a smooth and seamless user experience.\n\nIn addition to the accelerometer and gyroscope, some phones also employ additional sensors such as the magnetometer, which measures the phone's magnetic field and helps to further refine the screen rotation.\n\nIn conclusion, the ability of our phones to automatically flip the screen around is a testament to the impressive advancements in sensor technology and software engineering. By combining the data from multiple sensors and clever algorithms, our phones are able to detect and respond to changes in orientation with remarkable accuracy and speed.\"",

Created to address the severe teacher shortage following Rab Butler's 1944 Education Act, the college, led by the innovative Roy Macklin, was more concerned with the character and experience of applicants than in formal qualifications. During the second world war, Edgar had worked in a protected occupation as a shipwright in Portsmouth dockyard, but saw a vocation in primary school teaching and shared Macklin's view of education as a guide for living rather than narrowly vocational or academic. The college provided an intensive 50-week course for mature students, mainly former servicemen and women. Possessing practical skills and often widely travelled, they brought to the classroom a wealth of knowledge denied to colleagues whose life had been spent wholly in the education system. Edgar's experience at Bognor Regis emergency teacher training college was transformative. The college's emphasis on character and experience allowed him to bring his unique perspective to the classroom. His background in shipbuilding and his wartime experiences gave him a deep understanding of the importance of practical skills and teamwork, which he was able to share with his students.\n\nAfter completing his training, Edgar began his teaching career at a primary school in Portsmouth. He quickly established himself as a popular and effective teacher, known for his ability to engage his students and make complex concepts accessible. His approach to teaching was holistic, focusing on the development of the whole child, rather than just their academic abilities.\n\nEdgar's teaching career spanned over three decades, during which he worked with thousands of students. He was particularly proud of his work with children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and was dedicated to helping them reach their full potential. His passion for teaching and his commitment to his students earned him numerous awards and recognition from his peers and the community.\n\nIn addition to his teaching career, Edgar was also an active member of his local community. He served on the board of governors at his local school, and was involved in various charitable organizations. He was also a keen sportsman, and enjoyed playing cricket and sailing in his spare time.\n\nEdgar is survived by his wife, Margaret, and their two children, Jane and Michael. He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and the countless students whose lives he touched through his teaching.",

We have always fancied a hot tub, but never had the money. The quest for a relaxing soak in a hot tub is a common dream for many of us. For one Guardian Money reader, the desire for a warm and bubbly retreat has been a long-held aspiration, but one that has been put on the backburner due to financial constraints. However, with a little creativity and some savvy research, it's possible to turn this dream into a reality.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to consider the cost of a hot tub. While a high-end model can set you back thousands of pounds, there are more affordable options available. For instance, a basic hot tub can be purchased for around £500-£1,000, while a more advanced model with extra features like massage jets and chromotherapy can cost upwards of £2,000-£3,000.\n\nAnother option is to consider buying a used or refurbished hot tub. Many online retailers and hot tub dealerships offer certified pre-owned models at a significant discount. Additionally, some manufacturers offer refurbished or demo models that have been thoroughly inspected and tested, which can be a great way to get a high-quality hot tub at a lower price point.\n\nFor those on a tight budget, it's worth considering alternative options. A portable hot tub, also known as a \"pool\", can be a great alternative to a traditional hot tub. These inflatable tubs are designed for relaxation and can be set up in a backyard or even indoors. They're often more affordable, with prices starting from around £100-£300.\n\nIt's also important to think about the running costs of a hot tub. While the initial purchase price may be the biggest expense, there are ongoing costs to consider, such as electricity, water, and maintenance. To minimize these costs, it's essential to choose a hot tub with energy-efficient features and to regularly clean and maintain the tub to prevent damage and extend its lifespan.\n\nFor our reader, who is looking to install a hot tub in their backyard, there are a few things to consider. Firstly, it's essential to check with local authorities to ensure that hot tubs are allowed in the area and to obtain any necessary permits. Additionally, it's important to choose a location that is level, well-drained, and close to a power source.\n\nFinally, it's worth considering the benefits of a hot tub beyond just relaxation. Many people find that soaking in a hot tub can help alleviate stress, improve sleep, and even provide relief from chronic pain. With the right mindset and a little creativity, a hot tub can become a valuable addition to any home.\n\nIn conclusion, while a hot tub may seem like a luxury item, it's possible to make it a reality with a little research and planning. Whether you opt for a basic model or a high-end luxury tub, the benefits of relaxation and rejuvenation are well worth the investment.",

Nothing is too abstrusely academic, it seems, to seed an attack campaign fueled by websites that surveil social media to find gotcha-worthy gems. The Professor Watch List, for one, created last year by the conservative group Turning Point USA, is helping drive a new level of scrutiny of professors who, it says, \"discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.\" Some sites even send out alerts to subscribers. The rise of online vigilantism has created a culture of fear and intimidation among academics, with many professors feeling compelled to self-censor their views to avoid being targeted. The Professor Watch List, which claims to have identified over 200 professors who allegedly promote \"leftist propaganda\" in their teaching, has been criticized for its lack of transparency and methodology.\n\nCritics argue that the list is often based on incomplete or misleading information, and that it is being used to silence professors who are simply trying to engage their students in discussions about complex social issues. Many of the professors listed have spoken out against the list, saying that it is an attempt to intimidate and silence them.\n\n\"It's a form of intellectual McCarthyism,\" said Dr. Sarah Jones, a professor of sociology at a major university who was recently added to the list. \"These groups are trying to create a climate of fear, where professors are too afraid to speak their minds or teach about controversial topics. It's a threat to academic freedom and the very fabric of our educational system.\"\n\nThe Professor Watch List is not the only group targeting professors. Other conservative organizations, such as Campus Reform, have also launched campaigns to expose and criticize professors who they deem to be liberal or left-leaning. These groups often use social media to spread their message, and have been accused of using tactics such as doxing and harassment to silence their targets.\n\nThe impact of these campaigns is being felt across the academic community. Many professors are now self-censoring their views, afraid to express opinions that may be seen as controversial or political. Others are facing backlash from students and colleagues who disagree with their views, and are struggling to maintain their academic freedom.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning for professors of color, who are already underrepresented in academia. Many have spoken out about the pressure they feel to conform to traditional academic norms, and the fear of being targeted by online vigilantes.\n\n\"I've had to be very careful about what I say and do, because I know that I'm being watched,\" said Dr. Jamal Brown, a professor of African American studies at a major university. \"It's a constant stress, knowing that I could be attacked or doxed at any moment. It's taking a toll on my mental and physical health, and it's making it harder for me to do my job.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, many are calling for action to be taken to protect academic freedom and prevent the silencing of professors. Some are advocating for legislation to protect professors from online harassment, while others are calling for universities to take a stronger stance against these campaigns.\n\nUltimately, the fate of academic freedom hangs in the balance. Will professors be able to continue to speak their minds and teach without fear of retribution, or will the pressure of online vigilantism continue to silence them? Only time will tell.",

But about three-fourths of Facebook users were unaware that the company lists their personal traits and interests for advertisers on its site, according to a study published by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday. Half of the users who looked at the Facebook page with that data -- known as their \"Ad Preferences\" -- said they were not comfortable with the company's compiling that information. The study, which surveyed over 1,000 Facebook users, found that only 27% of respondents were aware that Facebook collects and stores their personal traits and interests for advertising purposes. This lack of awareness is particularly concerning, as many users may not be aware of the extent to which their online activities are being tracked and used to target them with specific advertisements.\n\nThe Pew Research Center's findings highlight the need for greater transparency and accountability from Facebook and other social media companies. \"Facebook's business model relies heavily on collecting and using user data to target advertisements,\" said Lee Rainie, director of internet and technology research at the Pew Research Center. \"However, our study shows that many users are not aware of this practice, and that raises important questions about consent and privacy.\"\n\nThe study also found that younger Facebook users, aged 18-29, were more likely to be aware of Facebook's data collection practices than older users. However, even among this group, only 41% were aware of the company's compilation of their personal traits and interests.\n\nFacebook has faced intense scrutiny in recent years over its handling of user data, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the unauthorized sharing of millions of users' personal information. In response to the controversy, the company has implemented several measures aimed at increasing transparency and protecting user privacy, including the creation of a \"Data Portal\" that allows users to view and manage the data that Facebook collects about them.\n\nHowever, the Pew Research Center's study suggests that more needs to be done to educate users about Facebook's data collection practices and to ensure that they have meaningful control over their personal data. \"Facebook and other social media companies need to do a better job of explaining how they collect and use user data, and they need to provide users with more granular controls over their data,\" said Rainie.\n\nThe study's findings also have implications for policymakers, who are grappling with the issue of data privacy and the need for stronger regulations to protect users' personal information. \"This study highlights the need for Congress to pass comprehensive data privacy legislation that protects the rights of consumers and holds companies accountable for their handling of user data,\" said Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), a leading advocate for data privacy reform.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, Facebook has reiterated its commitment to transparency and user privacy. \"We take the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously, and we are committed to providing them with clear and transparent information about how we collect and use their data,\" said a Facebook spokesperson. \"We will continue to work to improve our data practices and to provide users with more control over their data.\"",

Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, also saw an increase in users considering it their main online profile, from 5% to 7%.\n\nHowever, the survey also revealed that the use of other social media platforms, such as TikTok and Snapchat, is on the rise. The proportion of internet users who consider TikTok to be their main online profile increased from 2% to 5%, while the proportion of users who consider Snapchat to be their main online profile increased from 3% to 5%.\n\nThe shift away from Facebook is also attributed to the rise of messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram, which offer a more private and secure way of communicating with friends and family. The survey found that the proportion of internet users who consider WhatsApp to be their main messaging app increased from 40% to 50% over the past year.\n\n\"The survey highlights the importance of data privacy and security in the way people use social media,\" said a digital rights expert. \"As people become more aware of the risks associated with social media, they are looking for alternative platforms that offer greater control over their personal data.\"\n\nThe regulator's survey also found that the use of social media is becoming more fragmented, with people using multiple platforms to communicate with friends and family.

For the first time, a flexible, wearable sensor can collect data about multiple chemicals in body sweat. Pioneering Breakthrough in Wearable Technology: Monitoring Chemicals in Sweat for Better Health Insights\n\nWearable monitors have revolutionized the way we track our physical activity, heart rate, and body temperature. However, a new development in wearable technology has taken it to the next level. For the first time, a flexible, wearable sensor can collect data about multiple chemicals in body sweat, opening up new possibilities for personalized health monitoring and diagnosis.\n\nThe innovative sensor, developed by a team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), uses a novel combination of nanotechnology and machine learning algorithms to detect and analyze the chemical composition of sweat. This breakthrough has significant implications for the diagnosis and management of various diseases, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and even certain types of cancer.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maria Rodriguez, the lead researcher on the project, \"Sweat is a rich source of information about our physiological state. By analyzing the chemical makeup of sweat, we can gain valuable insights into our overall health and detect potential issues before they become serious.\"\n\nThe wearable sensor, which is small enough to fit on a wristband or a patch, uses a proprietary nanomaterial to detect and quantify the levels of various chemicals in sweat. These chemicals can include biomarkers for specific diseases, as well as indicators of stress, fatigue, and other physiological responses.\n\nThe sensor's ability to collect data on multiple chemicals in sweat is a major advancement over existing wearable technology, which typically only measures a single parameter, such as heart rate or body temperature. By analyzing the complex chemical profile of sweat, the sensor can provide a more comprehensive picture of an individual's health, allowing for more accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast. For example, the sensor could be used to monitor patients with diabetes, allowing for real-time tracking of glucose levels and early detection of potential complications. Similarly, the sensor could be used to monitor athletes, providing valuable insights into their physiological state and helping to prevent injuries and improve performance.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its early stages, the researchers are optimistic about its potential to revolutionize the field of wearable technology. \"We believe that this technology has the potential to transform the way we approach health monitoring and diagnosis,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"By providing a more comprehensive picture of an individual's health, we can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.\"\n\nThe team is currently working on refining the sensor and developing a commercial version that can be used in a variety of settings, from hospitals to homes. With its potential to revolutionize the way we approach health monitoring and diagnosis, this breakthrough in wearable technology is certainly one to watch.",

The rankings are based on a range of indicators, including academic reputation, employer reputation, and research citations.\n\nThe UK's performance in the QS World University Rankings has significant implications for the country's economy and society. The country's universities play a critical role in driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, and a decline in their performance in key subjects such as engineering and technology could have long-term consequences.\n\nIn response to the decline, the UK government has announced plans to invest an additional £100 million in engineering and technology education, as well as a series of initiatives aimed at attracting and retaining top talent in these subjects. The government has also launched a review of the UK's research funding system, with a view to identifying ways to improve the country's performance in these areas.\n\nWhile the UK's performance in the QS World University Rankings is a cause for concern, the country's universities remain among the best in the world. The UK's top universities will need to continue to innovate and adapt if they are to remain competitive on the global stage, but with the right investment and support, there is no reason why they cannot continue to excel in a range of subjects.",

        "Text": "When James Oseland was editor in chief of Saveur, the food magazine, he had dinner one night with Maria Rodale, the chief executive of the publisher Rodale. There, at ABC Kitchen near Union Square, they ran into Alice Waters, the acclaimed chef and champion of sustainable food. As they chatted, Oseland and Rodale discovered a shared passion for promoting healthy, locally sourced food and sustainable agriculture. Waters, known for her iconic Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, was already a pioneer in the farm-to-table movement. The trio's conversation that night sparked an idea that would eventually become a reality: a new food magazine that would focus on the intersection of food, culture, and sustainability.\n\nFast forward a few years, and Oseland, Rodale, and Waters co-founded Lucky Peach, a biannual magazine that would go on to become a beloved and influential voice in the culinary world. Launched in 2011, Lucky Peach quickly gained a reputation for its unique blend of food writing, photography, and humor. The magazine's pages featured stories on everything from artisanal cheese makers to underground supper clubs, all with a focus on the people and places behind the food.\n\nUnder Oseland's editorial guidance, Lucky Peach became known for its irreverent tone and its willingness to tackle tough topics, such as the environmental impact of the food industry and the challenges faced by small-scale farmers. The magazine's contributors included a diverse range of writers, from celebrated chefs like David Chang and René Redzepi to food writers and critics like Jonathan Gold and Ruth Reichl.\n\nThroughout its run, Lucky Peach has received widespread critical acclaim, earning multiple James Beard Award nominations and winning several awards from the Association of Food and Wine Writers. The magazine's influence can be seen in the many food writers and bloggers who have been inspired by its unique voice and approach.\n\nDespite its success, Lucky Peach announced in 2020 that it would be ceasing publication. In a statement, Oseland cited the challenges of the digital age and the changing media landscape as reasons for the decision. However, the magazine's legacy lives on, and its influence can still be seen in the many food writers and publications that have followed in its footsteps. As a testament to its impact, Lucky Peach's archives remain available online, offering a fascinating glimpse into the world of food and culture during the 2010s.",

        "Text": "BBC veteran John Simpson has accused consecutive governments of \"savagery\" and taking \"ideological delight\" in attacking the corporation. Simpson, who has spent five decades at the the corporation including his current role of world affairs editor, told the Guardian: \"The BBC, like the NHS, should be controlled by non-partisan, non-political groups which don't have an axe to grind.\" He added that both sides of the House of Commons were prone to attack the BBC simply because it didn't \"toe the party line\". Simpson reserved his greatest opprobrium for Tony Blair and his former press secretary Alistair Campbell, both for their involvement in the Hutton affair and their dealings with Rupert Murdoch. \"Here is the British prime minister cosying up to a man who has got no interest in Britain, who is deeply opposed to Britain and Britain's interest, and is against the main national broadcaster,\" Simpson said. Simpson's scathing critique of the government's treatment of the BBC comes at a time when the corporation is facing unprecedented attacks from both the Conservative and Labour parties. The BBC has been accused of being biased and left-wing, with some politicians calling for its funding to be cut or its charter to be revoked.\n\nHowever, Simpson believes that the real issue is not the BBC's alleged bias, but rather the government's attempts to exert control over the corporation's editorial content. \"The BBC is not a political party, it's a public service broadcaster,\" he said. \"It's not supposed to take sides or promote a particular ideology. Its job is to inform, educate and entertain the public, and that's what it does.\"\n\nSimpson's comments have been widely praised by journalists and media organizations, who see him as a champion of press freedom and a defender of the BBC's independence. \"John Simpson is a national treasure,\" said one senior journalist. \"He's a reminder that there are still people in this country who care about the importance of a free and independent press.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the BBC, the corporation remains one of the most trusted and respected institutions in the UK. A recent survey found that 74% of the public believe the BBC is doing a good job, and 62% believe it is important to have a publicly-funded broadcaster like the BBC.\n\nHowever, the BBC is not immune to the challenges facing the media industry as a whole. The rise of social media and online news sources has led to a decline in viewership and listenership, and the corporation is facing significant budget cuts as a result.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the BBC has been working to adapt to the changing media landscape. The corporation has launched several new digital services, including a range of online news platforms and a popular podcasting service. It has also invested heavily in new technology, including artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\n\nDespite these efforts, the BBC remains committed to its core mission of providing high-quality, impartial journalism to the public. As Simpson said, \"The BBC is not just a broadcaster, it's a national institution. It's a symbol of British values and a reminder of the importance of a free and independent press.\"",

The answer, expressed in terms of quantum particles of light known as photons, is 4 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion. Astronomers Achieve Unprecedented Feat: Measuring the Total Light Produced by All Stars in the Universe\n\nIn one of those exercises that you think should be impossible or perhaps a punishment for some infraction, a team of astronomers has now measured the total amount of light that has ever been produced by all the stars in our universe. The answer, expressed in terms of quantum particles of light known as photons, is 4 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion.\n\nThis monumental task was accomplished by a team of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Arizona, who used a combination of observations from space-based telescopes and computer simulations to calculate the total amount of light emitted by stars throughout the history of the universe.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead author of the study, \"Measuring the total amount of light produced by all stars in the universe is a challenging task, as it requires us to account for the light emitted by stars of all ages, sizes, and types, as well as the effects of interstellar gas and dust on the light as it travels through space.\"\n\nTo achieve this feat, the team used data from the Hubble Space Telescope and other space-based observatories to study the light emitted by stars in different parts of the universe. They also used computer simulations to model the behavior of stars and the effects of interstellar gas and dust on the light.\n\nThe team's calculations suggest that the total amount of light produced by all stars in the universe is equivalent to about 4 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion photons. This is a staggering number that is difficult to wrap your head around, but it gives us a sense of the sheer scale of the universe and the incredible amount of energy that has been released by stars over billions of years.\n\nThe implications of this study are significant, as it provides new insights into the history and evolution of the universe. For example, the team's calculations suggest that the universe was much brighter in the distant past, when the first stars and galaxies were forming. This is because these early stars were much more massive and luminous than the stars we see today, and they emitted a lot more light.\n\nThe study also has implications for our understanding of the universe's future. As the universe continues to expand and cool, the stars that are currently shining will eventually burn out and cease to emit light. However, the team's calculations suggest that the universe will continue to emit light for billions of years to come, as new stars form and shine.\n\nIn conclusion, the team's achievement is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the importance of continued investment in space exploration and astronomy. By studying the light emitted by stars, we can gain a deeper understanding of the universe and its many mysteries, and we can continue to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible.",

Appearing on Fox News on Monday, the rightwing commentator Michael Knowles launched an extraordinary attack on Thunberg, 16, who is campaigning in the US to urge action on the climate crisis. Knowles's swipe at Thunberg followed one from Laura Ingraham, one of Fox News's most prominent presenters, who compared Thunberg and other young climate activists to the characters in Stephen King's horror story Children of the Corn. Thunberg gave a blistering speech at the United Nations summit, criticizing world leaders for their \"betrayal\" of young people through a lack of action on the climate crisis. Knowles, a guest on Fox News's The Story, was invited to discuss Thunberg's speech and the climate crisis. The apology from Fox News came after a widespread backlash on social media, with many criticizing the network for allowing such personal and hurtful attacks on a teenager who is simply exercising her right to speak out on an issue that affects her generation.\n\nThunberg's speech at the United Nations summit was widely praised for its passion and conviction, and her message resonated with many young people around the world who are demanding action on the climate crisis. Despite this, Knowles and Ingraham's comments were seen as a desperate attempt to discredit and belittle Thunberg, and were widely condemned by climate activists and others who support her cause.\n\nIn a statement, Fox News apologized for allowing Knowles's comments to air, saying that they \"do not condone personal attacks or insults towards anyone, including Greta Thunberg.\" The statement also acknowledged that Thunberg's speech at the United Nations was \"powerful and important\" and that the network respects her right to express her opinions.\n\nThunberg herself responded to the attacks on Twitter, saying that she was \"not surprised\" by the backlash from Fox News, but that she was \"surprised\" that the network's hosts and guests felt the need to resort to personal attacks. She also thanked her supporters for standing up for her and for the climate movement, saying that their voices are \"louder than the noise of the haters.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Thunberg's speech and the subsequent attacks from Fox News have sparked a wider debate about the role of media in covering the climate crisis. Many have argued that the network's decision to allow such personal and divisive attacks on Thunberg was a clear example of how media outlets can shape public opinion and influence the way people think about important issues.\n\nIn response to the backlash, many climate activists and organizations have called for a boycott of Fox News, saying that the network's behavior is a clear example of how they prioritize sensationalism and controversy over responsible journalism. Others have argued that the network's apology was too little, too late, and that the damage has already been done.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Thunberg's speech and the subsequent backlash have highlighted the importance of the climate crisis and the need for urgent action to address it. As the world continues to grapple with the consequences of climate change, it is clear that the voices of young people like Thunberg will be crucial in shaping the future of our planet.",

The first of several projects, a mini-series called \"Secure and Hold: The Last Days of Roger Ailes,\" is already in the works at Showtime. Mr. Blum, 48, said by phone on Monday that the company, Blumhouse Television, would focus on \"dark genre\" programming -- not just horror, but \"things that scare us.\" In addition to the mini-series about Mr. Ailes, who was ousted from Fox News last year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, Blumhouse Television will also lead the financing and production of a drama set in the same dystopian world as the \"Purge\" movie franchise. Blumhouse Television is expected to produce a slate of dark genre programming, including television movies, series, and documentaries. The company's focus on \"things that scare us\" will explore a range of themes and genres, from horror and suspense to thriller and drama.\n\nAccording to Blum, the company's goal is to create content that pushes the boundaries of what audiences are used to seeing on television. \"We're not just looking to make horror movies or TV shows,\" he said. \"We're looking to make shows that are thought-provoking, that challenge our assumptions, and that leave a lasting impact on viewers.\"\n\nThe mini-series \"Secure and Hold: The Last Days of Roger Ailes\" is set to premiere on Showtime later this year. The project is a collaboration between Blumhouse Television and Showtime, and will explore the final days of Ailes' tenure at Fox News.

Official figures confirmed the economy bounced back from the freezing temperatures earlier in the year as shoppers spent heavily during the football World Cup and a long heatwave. But more detailed data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that consumers, hit by rising utility bills and transport costs, had to cope with almost static disposable incomes, forcing them to dip into savings to maintain their spending habits. The ONS reported that consumer spending, which accounts for around 60% of the UK's economic activity, rose by 0.4% in the third quarter of the year, the fastest pace in five years. However, this growth was largely driven by households using up their savings to fund their spending, rather than an increase in their disposable income.\n\nThe data also showed that businesses, on the other hand, continued to cut back on investment, with capital expenditure falling by 0.3% in the quarter. This is a worrying sign for the economy, as business investment is often seen as a key driver of long-term growth.\n\nThe ONS attributed the decline in business investment to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union. Many companies have been hesitant to invest in the UK due to the lack of clarity on the country's future trading relationships with the EU and other countries.\n\n\"The uncertainty surrounding Brexit is still affecting business investment, and it's clear that companies are being cautious about committing to new projects until the situation becomes clearer,\" said a spokesperson for the ONS.\n\nThe figures also showed that the UK's trade deficit widened to £13.1 billion in the third quarter, up from £10.7 billion in the previous quarter. This is a concern for the economy, as a large trade deficit can put pressure on the value of the pound and make imports more expensive.\n\nDespite the challenges, the ONS remains optimistic about the UK's economic prospects. \"While there are some signs of caution in the data, the UK's economy is still showing resilience and is likely to continue growing in the coming months,\" said the spokesperson.\n\nThe news comes as the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, prepares to deliver his autumn budget statement. Hammond is under pressure to provide more clarity on the government's plans for Brexit and to outline measures to support businesses and households affected by the uncertainty.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers will be keeping a close eye on their finances, with many struggling to make ends meet due to the rising cost of living. The ONS data shows that households are having to dip into their savings to maintain their spending habits, and many are likely to be hoping for some relief in the budget statement.",

        "Text": "Mutual of Omaha said it did not comment on pending legal matters. John Hancock did not respond to a request for comment. Women typically account for about two-thirds of the long-term-care insurance claims paid annually, said Jesse Slome, spokesman for the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, an industry group. Last year, companies paid $7.5 billion in claims. The effect is that women will now pay several hundred dollars more a year in long-term-care premiums than a man would for a comparable policy, according to the association's 2014 report, based on data from insurers. (The new gender-based premiums apply to new policies, not policies that were in place before the change took effect.) The change in premium rates is expected to have a significant impact on women, who are already more likely to take time off work to care for family members and are more likely to outlive their spouses. According to the National Center for Women's & Retirement Research, women are 50% more likely to be caregivers and 70% more likely to be sole caregivers.\n\n\"This is a huge blow to women, who are already facing significant financial challenges in retirement,\" said Barbara Stowell, CEO of the National Association of Women Business Owners. \"Long-term care insurance is a vital tool for women to protect their assets and ensure they can receive the care they need if they become unable to care for themselves. Now, they will have to pay more for that protection.\"\n\nThe change in premium rates is also expected to have a significant impact on the long-term care insurance industry, which has been struggling to attract new customers. According to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, the number of new long-term care insurance policies sold has been declining steadily over the past decade.\n\n\"The industry has been facing significant challenges, including rising claims costs and declining interest rates,\" said Jesse Slome, spokesman for the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. \"The change in premium rates will likely accelerate the decline in new policy sales and make it even more difficult for the industry to attract new customers.\"\n\nDespite the challenges facing the industry, experts say that long-term care insurance remains an important tool for individuals to protect their assets and ensure they can receive the care they need if they become unable to care for themselves. However, the change in premium rates is expected to make it more difficult for women to afford this protection.\n\n\"In the past, women have been able to rely on their spouses to care for them if they become unable to care for themselves,\" said Barbara Stowell. \"Now, they will have to pay more to ensure that they can receive the care they need. This is a significant financial burden for women, who are already facing significant financial challenges in retirement.\"",

Customers of the website have reported being told at car hire desks that their booking would not be honoured unless they paid again – in some cases many hundreds of pounds – because Atlas had not paid the car's actual provider. Frustrated customers of the west London car hire booking firm, which acted as booking agent for all the big car hire brands, have reported the problem on Twitter and other social media in recent days. \"Cancelling my rental car, keeping my money and providing no other option two days before I fly home for Christmas. Seriously?\" wrote Tom Richards on Twitter. The chaos has left many travelers scrambling to find alternative transportation for the holiday season, with some even considering canceling their trips altogether.\n\nAccording to reports, Atlaschoice's failure to pay the car hire providers has left thousands of bookings in limbo. The company, which acts as a booking agent for major car hire brands, has been accused of not honoring bookings and demanding additional payment from customers.\n\nOne customer, who wished to remain anonymous, told our reporter that she was left stranded at the airport after being informed that her booking was not valid. \"I was devastated,\" she said. \"I had already paid for my rental car and was looking forward to a stress-free holiday. Instead, I was left with no car and no money to pay for an alternative.\"\n\nOther customers have taken to social media to express their frustration and disappointment. \"Atlaschoice has ruined my Christmas,\" wrote Sarah Johnson on Twitter. \"I booked a car through them and now they're saying they can't honor it. I'm stuck at the airport with no car and no way to get home.\"\n\nThe company's failure to pay its suppliers has also had a ripple effect on the car hire industry as a whole. Many of the major car hire brands, such as Hertz and Avis, have been left scrambling to fill the gap left by Atlaschoice's collapse.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Atlaschoice apologized for the inconvenience caused and assured customers that the company is working to resolve the issue. \"We understand the frustration and disappointment that our customers are feeling, and we are doing everything in our power to rectify the situation,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, many customers remain skeptical and are calling for the company to take immediate action to rectify the situation. \"It's unacceptable that Atlaschoice has left thousands of customers in this situation,\" said Tom Richards, who was one of the first to report the problem on social media. \"They need to take responsibility and provide a solution immediately.\"\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, it remains to be seen how Atlaschoice will resolve the crisis and what measures will be taken to prevent similar situations in the future. In the meantime, travelers are advised to exercise caution when booking with third-party companies and to thoroughly research the company before making a booking.",

He was 85. The cause was vascular disease, his daughter, Lane Von Herzen, said. Richard P. Von Herzen, an explorer who found that the icy depths of the deep sea concealed vast regions of simmering heat, helping to confirm the scientific view of the Earth's crust as continuously in motion, died on Jan. 28 in Portola Valley, Calif. He was 85. The cause was vascular disease, his daughter, Lane Von Herzen, said.\n\nBorn in 1937 in New York City, Von Herzen grew up with a passion for exploration and the natural world. He earned a degree in geology from Harvard University and later received a Ph.D. in marine geology from the University of California, Berkeley. His early research focused on the Mid-Ocean Ridge, a vast underwater mountain range that runs along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nVon Herzen's groundbreaking work on the Mid-Ocean Ridge began in the 1960s, when he joined the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a leading research center in marine science. Alongside his colleagues, he designed and deployed a series of deep-sea submersibles to explore the rugged terrain of the ocean floor. Their findings challenged the prevailing view of the Earth's crust as a static, unchanging entity.\n\nIn 1968, Von Herzen and his team discovered a vast network of hydrothermal vents, towering structures that spew forth superheated water and minerals from the Earth's mantle. These vents, located in the darkness of the deep sea, supported unique ecosystems that thrived in the harsh conditions. The discovery of these vents revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's crust, revealing a dynamic and constantly evolving process.\n\nVon Herzen's work on the Mid-Ocean Ridge and the discovery of hydrothermal vents earned him numerous awards and accolades, including the National Science Foundation's prestigious Alan T. Waterman Award. He continued to work as a research scientist and explorer until his retirement in the early 2000s.\n\nThroughout his career, Von Herzen was known for his tireless enthusiasm, his ability to inspire and mentor young scientists, and his dedication to sharing the wonders of the ocean with the public. He wrote several books and produced documentaries to share his findings with a broader audience, inspiring generations of explorers, scientists, and environmentalists.\n\nRichard P. Von Herzen's legacy extends far beyond his scientific contributions. He leaves behind a family, including his wife, Nancy, and their three children, as well as a global community of scientists, explorers, and enthusiasts who were inspired by his work and his passion for discovery. His passing is a significant loss to the scientific community, but his discoveries and achievements will continue to shape our understanding of the Earth's crust and the wonders that lie beneath the surface.",

        "Text": "In 2014, for the first time, the nation's student body -- from kindergartners to 12th graders -- was majority-minority. And the change is spilling out into the nation's colleges and the country over all. Census data predicts that by 2050 the United States will be majority-minority as well. As I see these changes, I continue to ask, Are our college and university faculties ready to teach a diverse student body? The demographic shift in the United States is a topic of increasing concern for educators and policymakers alike. As the nation's student body becomes more diverse, it is imperative that college and university faculties reflect this change. However, a recent study by the American Council on Education found that faculty diversity has not kept pace with the growing diversity of students.\n\nAccording to the study, in 2019, only 26% of full-time faculty members at degree-granting institutions were from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, including Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American individuals. This is a significant decrease from the 1980s, when 35% of faculty members belonged to these groups.\n\nThe lack of diversity among faculty members can have far-reaching consequences for students. Research has shown that students who have diverse instructors are more likely to feel a sense of belonging and are more likely to succeed academically. Furthermore, diverse faculty members bring unique perspectives and experiences to the classroom, which can enrich the learning experience for all students.\n\nSo, what can be done to increase faculty diversity? One solution is to implement targeted recruitment and hiring practices. Many institutions are now actively seeking out candidates from underrepresented groups and providing them with support and resources to help them succeed. For example, some universities are offering mentorship programs and professional development opportunities specifically for faculty members from diverse backgrounds.\n\nAnother solution is to provide incentives for faculty members to stay in academia. Many talented individuals from underrepresented groups may be deterred from pursuing careers in academia due to the lack of opportunities and resources. By providing competitive salaries, benefits, and research funding, institutions can attract and retain top talent.\n\nAdditionally, institutions can also focus on creating a more inclusive and welcoming campus culture. This can be achieved by promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as cultural events and diversity training programs, and by providing resources and support for students from diverse backgrounds.\n\nIn conclusion, the demographic shift in the United States is a significant challenge for higher education, but it also presents an opportunity for institutions to rethink their approach to faculty diversity. By implementing targeted recruitment and hiring practices, providing incentives for faculty members to stay in academia, and creating a more inclusive campus culture, institutions can ensure that their faculties are better equipped to teach and support a diverse student body.",

ITV, which saw its share price fall by more than 20% on Friday, continued to see jittery investors drive its price down more than 5% in early trading on Monday. At midday on Monday its share price had fallen to 164p, down from a pre-Brexit 220p and a one-year high of 280p. Investors worried about the repercussions of Brexit on ITV, which relies on a now nervy advertising market for much of its revenues, have driven the broadcaster's market capitalisation from £9bn to about £6.5bn in the days since the EU referendum. As the uncertainty surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union continues to weigh on the country's economy, ITV's financial woes are likely to be exacerbated by the potential decline in advertising revenue. The broadcaster's reliance on a fragile advertising market has left it vulnerable to the whims of the market, and investors are growing increasingly concerned about the long-term implications of Brexit on the company's financial performance.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that ITV's struggles could make it an attractive target for potential suitors, particularly those looking to expand their presence in the UK media market. However, any takeover bid would likely face significant regulatory hurdles, given the company's size and influence in the industry.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, ITV remains a significant player in the UK media landscape, with a portfolio of popular channels and a strong presence in the digital market. The company's ability to adapt to changing viewer habits and consumer behavior has allowed it to maintain its position as a leading broadcaster, despite the rise of online streaming services.\n\nHowever, the current market conditions are likely to test ITV's resilience, and the company's management will need to work closely with investors to restore confidence in the business. A potential takeover bid could provide a much-needed injection of capital, but it would also require a significant overhaul of the company's operations and strategy.\n\nAs the dust settles on the Brexit vote, ITV's fortunes will be closely watched by investors and industry observers alike. While the company's short-term struggles are a cause for concern, its long-term prospects remain uncertain, and only time will tell whether it will emerge from this period of uncertainty as a stronger, more resilient business.",

Mark Carney said high street banks were being displaced by online lenders that were untested in a recession, when bankruptcies might make their loans worthless. Cyber-attacks could also strip customers of digital money, leaving them to face huge losses without the traditional protection offered by regulators, he said. The warning follows a speech last year by Adair Turner, the former chief financial regulator, who said losses on loans made over the internet could make the worst bankers look like \"lending geniuses\". Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney said digital money held out the prospect of allowing millions of people excluded from the mainstream banking system to access loans securely. Threadneedle Street has several initiatives under way to allow peer-to-peer online lenders access to central bank funds and facilitate transactions. Carney emphasized that while digital lending has the potential to increase financial inclusion, it is crucial to ensure that these online lenders are subject to robust regulations to prevent them from posing a systemic risk to the financial system.\n\n\"The growth of digital lending has created new opportunities for financial inclusion, but it also poses new risks,\" Carney said. \"We need to ensure that these online lenders are subject to the same high standards as traditional banks, including robust risk management and adequate capital buffers.\"\n\nCarney's warning comes as the Bank of England has been working to develop new regulations for digital lenders. The central bank has been consulting with industry stakeholders and regulators to develop a framework that would allow online lenders to access central bank funds and facilitate transactions.\n\nThe Bank of England has also been working with other international regulators to develop common standards for digital lending. Carney said that the bank is committed to ensuring that digital lending is safe and stable, and that it does not pose a risk to the financial system.\n\nDespite the risks, Carney acknowledged that digital lending has the potential to increase financial inclusion, particularly for small businesses and individuals who may not have access to traditional banking services.\n\n\"Digital lending has the potential to increase financial inclusion, particularly for small businesses and individuals who may not have access to traditional banking services,\" Carney said. \"However, it is crucial that we ensure that these online lenders are subject to robust regulations to prevent them from posing a systemic risk to the financial system.\"\n\nCarney's warning has sparked concerns among industry stakeholders, who are calling for greater regulation of digital lenders.

I'm sure you can guess the answer. \"Joe\", the owner of Joe's Music, a 15-year-old small musical instrument and accessory shop that also provides lessons in Willoughby, Ohio, made the declaration in a recent Facebook post. \"Dear Trump sympathizers,\" he wrote. \"I am truly sorry, however I feel unclean and dirty accepting money from you. Please, politely shop somewhere else. Sorry, I would rather starve and close the store than participate in wrongdoing.\" The post quickly went viral, sparking a heated debate on social media and beyond.

Ministers are to overhaul laws that mean parents can avoid supporting their child by holding their money in a joint account with a new partner. Current rules mean only money held in a sole account can be seized for payment. The new rules, which are expected to come into effect within the next few months, aim to close a loophole that has allowed some parents to avoid paying child maintenance by transferring their funds to a joint account with a new partner.\n\nAccording to government officials, the current laws have created an unfair situation where parents who are able to transfer their assets to a joint account can avoid their financial responsibilities towards their child. This has led to many parents being able to avoid paying child maintenance, leaving the other parent to struggle to provide for their child's needs.\n\nThe new rules will ensure that all parents, regardless of whether they hold their money in a sole or joint account, will be held accountable for their financial responsibilities towards their child. This means that parents will no longer be able to use a joint account as a way to avoid paying child maintenance.\n\nThe changes are expected to benefit many parents who have been struggling to receive the financial support they need to provide for their child. Child maintenance is an essential aspect of family life, and it is crucial that parents are held accountable for their financial responsibilities towards their child.\n\nThe government has been working closely with child maintenance experts and advocacy groups to ensure that the new rules are fair and effective. The changes are expected to come into effect in the next few months, and parents who are affected by the changes will be notified in advance.\n\nIn addition to closing the loophole, the new rules will also introduce stricter penalties for parents who fail to pay child maintenance. This includes fines and even imprisonment in severe cases.\n\nThe government is committed to ensuring that all parents are held accountable for their financial responsibilities towards their child. The new rules are an important step in achieving this goal, and they are expected to have a significant impact on the lives of many parents and children.\n\nThe changes are also expected to benefit the wider community, as they will help to reduce the financial burden on the state and ensure that children receive the support they need to thrive.",

        "Text": "PARIS -- Global stocks fell and oil rose above $100 a barrel on Wednesday as concern about the political crises in Egypt and Portugal added to traders' growing anxieties. Egypt was at the center of geopolitical concern after President Mohamed Morsi on Tuesday night defied an army ultimatum that he resign, raising the risk that the country would descend into bloodshed and chaos. As the situation in Egypt continued to deteriorate, investors grew increasingly nervous, sending global stocks plummeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 200 points, while the S&P 500 index dropped by 1.5%. European markets also suffered, with the FTSE 100 in London declining by 1.2% and the DAX in Frankfurt falling by 1.5%.\n\nThe turmoil in Egypt was not the only factor contributing to the market's volatility. In Portugal, the government was struggling to form a new coalition after the country's president dissolved parliament, sparking fears of a political crisis. The uncertainty surrounding the Portuguese government's ability to manage the country's debt and economic woes added to the market's jitters.\n\nOil prices surged as a result of the geopolitical concerns, with Brent crude rising above $100 a barrel for the first time in over two years. The price increase was largely driven by the fear that the political instability in Egypt and Portugal could disrupt global oil supplies.\n\n\"The situation in Egypt is a major concern for the global economy,\" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"The country is a major oil producer and any disruption to its oil exports could have significant implications for the global economy.\"\n\nThe market's reaction to the events in Egypt and Portugal was swift and severe. The Egyptian pound fell to a record low against the US dollar, while the Portuguese stock market plummeted by over 5%.\n\nThe international community is urging calm and calling for a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Egypt. The United States, European Union, and other international organizations have all issued statements condemning the violence and urging restraint.\n\nThe situation in Egypt is likely to remain volatile in the coming days, with many investors bracing for the worst. The global economy is highly interconnected, and any disruption to oil supplies or global trade could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nIn the meantime, investors are likely to remain cautious, with many seeking safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds. The market's reaction to the events in Egypt and Portugal serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the potential for even seemingly isolated events to have far-reaching consequences.",

And when it comes to car aesthetics I am often seriously out of step with vehicle designers. I'd say that the three ugliest cars of the past decade are the Porsche Cayenne, Nissan Juke and Range Rover Evoque. However, it appears that Jaguar Land Rover has taken note of the criticism and has made significant changes to the new Range Rover Evoque, which is set to hit the market with a price tag of £31,600. The company has promised a more refined and sophisticated design, which may just win over the hearts of critics like myself.\n\nThe new Evoque boasts a more angular and aggressive stance, with a more prominent grille and sleeker lines. The car's proportions have also been tweaked, with a longer wheelbase and a more sloping roofline, giving it a more dynamic and athletic appearance.\n\nBut it's not just about looks; the new Evoque has also received a significant overhaul under the bonnet. The range of engines has been expanded to include a new 2.0-litre Ingenium diesel, which produces 163 horsepower and 380 Nm of torque. This engine is expected to provide improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, making it a more attractive option for environmentally-conscious buyers.\n\nThe new Evoque will also feature a range of advanced safety features, including autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, and a 360-degree camera system. These features will be available as part of the car's optional Technology Pack, which will also include a 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a 12-speaker Meridian sound system.\n\nDespite the changes, the new Evoque still retains its iconic design cues, including its distinctive clamshell bonnet and floating roof. The car's interior has also been updated, with a more premium feel and a range of new trim options, including a luxurious SVAutobiography trim.\n\nThe new Range Rover Evoque is set to arrive in showrooms in spring 2019, with deliveries expected to begin in the following months. With its improved design, refined engines, and advanced safety features, the new Evoque is shaping up to be a serious contender in the compact luxury SUV market. Whether or not it will win over my heart remains to be seen, but one thing is certain – it's a significant improvement over its predecessor.",

        "Text": "Two celestial events will take place on Friday night: a lunar eclipse and the passing of a comet. While both sound significant, neither will be much of a spectacle for the casual skygazer. The eclipse will be a penumbral lunar eclipse, meaning that only a portion of Earth's shadow will cover the moon. Unlike a total lunar eclipse, where the entire moon takes on a reddish color from being engulfed by the Earth's shadow, the moon will appear only slightly darker than usual during Friday's eclipse. However, astronomers and space enthusiasts will still be excited about the event, as it marks the 12th penumbral lunar eclipse in the past 20 years and the 3rd in the past 12 months. This frequency is relatively rare, making it a unique opportunity for scientists to study the Earth's atmosphere and its effects on the lunar surface.\n\nOn the other hand, the passing of the comet will be a more distant and less visible event. Comet C/2023 K1, also known as the \"K1 Comet,\" will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of approximately 1.5 astronomical units (AU). For perspective, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 1 AU. The comet's small size and distant approach will make it difficult to spot with the naked eye, and even with binoculars, it will appear as a faint, fuzzy patch in the sky.\n\nDespite the lack of visual spectacle, the K1 Comet is still significant because it's a new discovery and provides scientists with a chance to study the composition and behavior of a fresh comet. Comets are believed to be remnants from the formation of the solar system, and studying them can offer insights into the early history of our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nThe lunar eclipse and comet passage will be visible from most parts of the world, although the timing and visibility may vary depending on the observer's location. For those interested in witnessing the events, astronomers recommend finding a dark location with minimal light pollution and using binoculars or a telescope to enhance the viewing experience.\n\nIn conclusion, while the celestial events on Friday night may not be as spectacular as some might have hoped, they still hold scientific significance and provide an opportunity for astronomers and space enthusiasts to learn more about our universe. So, grab a pair of binoculars, find a comfortable spot, and enjoy the rare chance to observe these celestial wonders up close.",

        "Text": "Q. Google Maps gives the mileage between places based on driving directions on the available highways, but is there a way to calculate the distance between two towns \"as the crow flies\"? A. The driving directions that Google offers between locations do factor in the available roads, as well as traffic conditions, detours and other situations that may take you out of your way. However, if you're looking for a more direct and precise measurement of distance between two towns, Google Maps also provides an option to calculate the \"as the crow flies\" distance, also known as the straight-line distance or great-circle distance. This method calculates the distance between two points on the surface of the Earth, assuming a straight line, without considering the actual roads or highways.\n\nTo access this feature, users can simply click on the \"Search\" bar on Google Maps and enter the names of the two towns. Once the map loads, click on the \"Directions\" button and select the \"Get Directions\" option. On the resulting page, click on the \"Options\" menu and toggle the \"Avoid Highways\" option to \"Off\". This will allow Google Maps to provide the most direct route between the two locations, which is often the shortest distance between the two points.\n\nThe \"as the crow flies\" distance can be found on the top-right corner of the Google Maps page, under the \"Distance\" heading. This distance is usually significantly shorter than the driving distance, as it doesn't take into account the curves and bends of the roads. For example, the driving distance between New York City and Los Angeles is approximately 2,796 miles, while the \"as the crow flies\" distance is around 2,469 miles.\n\nIt's worth noting that the \"as the crow flies\" distance is not always the most practical or efficient way to travel between two locations. Roads and highways are designed to accommodate traffic and other factors, which can affect the overall journey time and safety. However, for purposes of planning and estimating distances, the \"as the crow flies\" method can be a useful tool for users.",

But as the conference opened, that view was under challenge in a number of state capitals. As Duncan addressed the gathering of educators and union leaders, he emphasized the importance of collaboration between teachers, administrators, and policymakers to address the pressing issues facing America's public education system. He highlighted the need for innovative solutions to improve student outcomes, increase teacher effectiveness, and enhance school accountability.\n\nHowever, not everyone in attendance shared Duncan's optimism. In several state capitals, lawmakers and education officials were engaged in heated debates over proposed legislation that would limit the power of teachers' unions and introduce more stringent accountability measures.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker's proposal to strip public employees of their collective bargaining rights sparked widespread protests and demonstrations outside the state capitol building. Union leaders argued that the move would undermine their ability to negotiate fair contracts and advocate for their members' interests.\n\nMeanwhile, in Michigan, a bill aimed at increasing the number of charter schools and relaxing regulations on private schools sparked concerns among traditional public school advocates. They argued that the proposal would divert much-needed funding away from existing public schools and further exacerbate existing inequalities.\n\nDuncan's conference was not immune to the controversy, with some attendees expressing frustration over the lack of progress on key issues such as teacher evaluation and compensation. \"We're not seeing the kind of bold action we need to address the systemic problems facing our schools,\" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \"The secretary's message is too focused on 'we're all in this together' when what we need is real policy change.\"\n\nDespite the disagreements, Duncan remained committed to his message of collaboration and cooperation. \"We can't afford to be divided on this issue,\" he said. \"We need to work together to find solutions that benefit all students, not just some.\"\n\nThe conference concluded with a sense of urgency and a renewed commitment to finding common ground. While the road ahead will be challenging, many attendees left with a sense of hope that, together, educators and union leaders can create a brighter future for America's public schools.",

The £1.7bn mine, which was given the go-ahead last year after a protracted planning battle, has promised to restore the region's proud mining heritage and bring more than 1,000 jobs. The project received a major boost on Tuesday when Sirius Minerals, the company behind the Yorkshire mine, announced a US$300m (£245m) deal with Rinehart's Australian agricultural firm Hancock Prospecting. The mine, which sits on protected moorland overlooking Whitby and Robin Hood's Bay, aims to produce up to 20m tonnes a year of a potassium-rich mineral called polyhalite, a type of potash fertiliser described by Sirius as a \"fertiliser of the future\". The investment deal is a significant milestone for Sirius Minerals, which has faced numerous challenges and setbacks during the planning and development phase of the project. The company's CEO, Mark Creasy, hailed the deal as a \"game-changer\" for the project, stating that it would enable the company to move forward with the construction of the mine and begin extracting the valuable mineral.\n\nThe polyhalite produced at the mine will be used to fertilize crops in some of the world's most fertile agricultural regions, including the United States, Brazil, and Europe. The mineral is particularly valuable for its ability to provide a slow-release fertilizer, which helps to promote healthy plant growth and reduce the need for frequent re-fertilization.\n\nThe investment from Hancock Prospecting is expected to provide a significant boost to the local economy, with Sirius Minerals estimating that the mine will create over 1,000 jobs during the construction phase and a further 500 jobs once the mine is operational. The company has also pledged to invest in local infrastructure and community projects, including the restoration of historic mining sites and the creation of a new visitor center.\n\nThe deal has been welcomed by local residents and business leaders, who have been eagerly awaiting the start of construction on the mine. \"This is a fantastic opportunity for our community,\" said Councillor David Jeffels, leader of Scarborough Borough Council. \"The mine will bring much-needed jobs and investment to the area, and we look forward to working with Sirius Minerals to ensure that the project is a success.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is celebrating the news. Environmental groups have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the mine on the protected moorland and the local ecosystem. \"We are disappointed that the mine has been given the go-ahead, despite our concerns about the potential environmental damage,\" said a spokesperson for the North York Moors National Park Authority. \"We will be working closely with Sirius Minerals to ensure that the mine is operated in a responsible and sustainable way.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the deal is seen as a major coup for Sirius Minerals and a significant vote of confidence in the company's plans. The investment from Hancock Prospecting will provide the necessary funding for the company to move forward with the construction of the mine, and the deal is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy and community.",

As Neil Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin made their historic moonwalk, they left behind a trail of scientific instruments, flags, and footprints that would forever change the course of human exploration. The Apollo 11 mission marked a monumental achievement for space travel, demonstrating that humans could not only reach the moon but also return safely to Earth.\n\nThe success of the mission was a testament to the tireless efforts of thousands of scientists, engineers, and technicians who worked behind the scenes to make it a reality. From the development of the powerful Saturn V rocket to the creation of the lunar module's intricate systems, every aspect of the mission required precision, innovation, and collaboration.\n\nThe moonwalk itself was a carefully planned and executed event. Armstrong and Aldrin spent about two and a half hours on the moon's surface, collecting samples, conducting experiments, and taking in the breathtaking views of the lunar landscape. Their iconic words, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" echoed across the globe, inspiring a new generation of scientists, engineers, and explorers.\n\nThe Apollo 11 mission also marked a significant milestone in the Cold War, as the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a space race that would shape the course of international relations for decades to come.

Press the Windows key + I to open the Settings app.\n2. Click on Update & Security.\n3. Click on Windows Update.\n4. Click on the \"Update history\" button.\n5. Look for the update you're interested in and check the \"Installed on\" date to see if it's been installed.\n\nAlternatively, you can also check for installed updates by using the Windows Update Troubleshooter tool. This tool can help identify and fix issues with Windows Update, including missing or failed updates.\n\nTips for Managing Windows 10 Updates\n\nTo ensure your Windows 10 device stays up-to-date and secure, follow these tips:\n\n* Enable automatic updates to ensure your device receives the latest patches and feature updates.\n* Schedule updates during a time that works best for you, such as during a reboot or when you're not using your device.\n* Monitor your update history to ensure that all updates have been installed successfully.\n* Consider using a third-party update tool, such as the Windows Update Troubleshooter, to identify and fix issues with Windows Update.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding Windows 10 updates is crucial for maintaining a secure and performing device. By knowing how to identify system upgrades and checking for installed updates, you can ensure your device stays up-to-date and running smoothly. Remember to enable automatic updates, schedule updates during a convenient time, and monitor your update history to keep your Windows 10 device running at its best.",

The prospect of Quitaly has sent shockwaves throughout the European financial community, with many experts warning of a potential domino effect that could have far-reaching consequences for the entire eurozone.\n\nItaly's economic woes are well-documented, with the country's GDP growth rate averaging just 0.2% per annum over the past two decades. This lack of growth has led to a rise in unemployment, which currently stands at over 10%, with youth unemployment rates reaching as high as 35%. The consequences of this stagnation are evident in the high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) that are crippling Italy's banking system.\n\nAccording to data from the Bank of Italy, NPLs currently account for over 18% of the country's total loan book, with some estimates suggesting that this figure could rise to as much as 30% by the end of the year. This has led to a credit crunch, making it increasingly difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to access financing, further exacerbating the economic downturn.\n\nThe Italian government has been working to address these issues, implementing a series of reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness and stimulating economic growth. However, progress has been slow, and many are questioning the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nIn recent weeks, there have been growing calls for Italy to abandon the euro and reintroduce the lira, with some arguing that this would allow the country to implement its own monetary policy and stimulate economic growth. However, this is a complex and contentious issue, with many experts warning of the potential risks and consequences of such a move.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has been working closely with the Italian government to address the country's economic woes, providing financial support and guidance to help stabilize the banking system. However, the ECB has also made it clear that it will not tolerate any attempts to abandon the euro, and that any such move would be met with swift and decisive action.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, investors are growing increasingly nervous, with the value of the euro falling sharply in recent days. The prospect of Quitaly has also led to a surge in demand for safe-haven assets, such as gold and government bonds.\n\nIn the meantime, the Italian government is working to address the concerns of investors and the European Union, with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte promising to take decisive action to stabilize the economy and restore confidence in the financial markets. However, with the country's economic woes showing no signs of abating, the threat of Quitaly remains a very real possibility, and one that could have far-reaching consequences for the entire eurozone.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Waymo, the autonomous vehicle business that operates under Google's parent company, dropped several patent claims against Uber on Friday, scaling back some of its major allegations in a bitter lawsuit over driverless technology. In a federal court filing, Waymo said it was dropping three of its four claims over Uber violating its patents related to light detection and ranging sensor technology, or lidar. Lidar is a vital component in driverless car technology, helping the vehicle detect its surroundings to navigate roads. The move comes as a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between the two tech giants, which has been ongoing since February 2017. Waymo had initially accused Uber of stealing trade secrets and intellectual property related to its lidar technology, which it claimed was developed by former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski.\n\nAccording to the court filing, Waymo is still pursuing one remaining claim over Uber's alleged violation of a patent related to a specific type of lidar sensor. However, the company has dropped claims over Uber's alleged use of Waymo's trade secrets, as well as claims that Uber's self-driving car system infringes on Waymo's patents.\n\nThe decision to scale back its claims comes as a surprise to many in the industry, given the significance of lidar technology in the development of autonomous vehicles. Lidar, which uses laser light to create high-resolution images of the environment, is a critical component in enabling vehicles to detect and respond to their surroundings.\n\nIndustry experts say that the move may be a strategic one for Waymo, allowing the company to focus its efforts on more critical areas of the lawsuit. \"By dropping some of the claims, Waymo may be trying to simplify the case and make it more manageable,\" said John Simpson, a transportation expert at the non-profit advocacy group Consumer Watchdog. \"It's also possible that Waymo is trying to send a signal to Uber that it's willing to negotiate and find a resolution.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has been a major distraction for Uber, which has been working to develop its own autonomous vehicle technology. The company has faced numerous setbacks and controversies in recent years, including a high-profile data breach and allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\nFor Waymo, the lawsuit has been a key part of its efforts to establish itself as a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry. The company has been working to develop its own self-driving car technology, and has partnered with several major automakers to deploy its systems on the road.\n\nThe outcome of the lawsuit is still uncertain, and it's unclear when the case will go to trial. However, the decision to drop some of its claims may be seen as a sign that Waymo is willing to negotiate and find a resolution, rather than continuing to pursue a costly and lengthy legal battle.",

The Spanish economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the January-March quarter, the same rate of contraction as in the last quarter of 2011, the National Statistics Institute said in Madrid. The news sent shockwaves through financial markets, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the prospects for a swift economic recovery in the region. The decline in stocks was moderate, but the mood was decidedly gloomy, with many analysts warning that the Spanish recession could have far-reaching consequences for the global economy.\n\nThe Spanish government had been struggling to implement austerity measures and reform its labor market, but the contraction in the economy has raised questions about the effectiveness of these efforts. The country's debt burden has also continued to rise, reaching 68.5 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2012, according to data released by the National Statistics Institute.\n\nThe news sent the euro tumbling to a one-week low against the US dollar, as investors sought safe-haven assets. The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds also rose to 5.85 percent, its highest level since November 2011, as investors demanded higher returns to compensate for the increased risk.\n\nThe European Union's economic commissioner, Olli Rehn, expressed concern about the situation, saying that the Spanish recession was a \"serious warning\" that the region's economic crisis was far from over. He urged European leaders to take swift action to address the crisis, including implementing reforms and providing support to struggling economies.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the Spanish recession could have a significant impact on the global economy, particularly if it were to spread to other countries in the region. The IMF called for a coordinated response from European leaders, including a combination of fiscal and monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy.\n\nThe news also sent ripples through the global financial markets, with stocks falling in Asia and the US. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 index dropped 0.3 percent. The yield on US 10-year Treasury bonds also rose to 1.95 percent, its highest level since May.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, investors will be closely watching the European Central Bank's (ECB) next move. The ECB has been under pressure to provide more support to the region's struggling economies, and some analysts are calling for the bank to implement a comprehensive stimulus package to boost growth and confidence.\n\nIn the meantime, the Spanish government has announced plans to implement additional austerity measures, including a 10 percent cut in public sector wages and a 20 percent reduction in government spending. The government has also pledged to implement labor market reforms and increase competition in the economy.\n\nWhile the news is certainly concerning, many analysts believe that the Spanish economy has the potential to recover once the necessary reforms are implemented.

Some have speculated that the White House might choose her for a position on the Federal Reserve's board of governors. Brainard, who has served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs since 2010, will depart from her role on Friday, according to a Treasury Department spokesperson. Her departure comes as a surprise to many, as she has been a key figure in shaping the country's international economic policy under the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nBrainard's departure has sparked speculation about her potential future plans, with many pointing to the Federal Reserve's board of governors as a possible destination. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that she could be a top contender for the position of Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a role that has been vacant since Stanley Fischer stepped down in 2017.\n\nIf Brainard were to join the Federal Reserve, she would bring a wealth of experience in international finance and economic policy to the table.

Instead, we often rely on muscle memory and trial-and-error to develop our own unique typing style. However, this informal approach may be hindering our productivity and efficiency.\n\nA recent study by the University of California, Berkeley, has shed light on the most effective typing techniques for smartphones. The research, published in the journal Human-Computer Interaction, analyzed the typing habits of over 1,000 participants and identified several key strategies that can improve typing speed and accuracy.\n\nOne of the most surprising findings was the importance of finger placement. Unlike traditional computer keyboards, where fingers rest on the home row, smartphone typing often involves placing fingers on the screen in a more scattered manner. The study found that participants who placed their fingers on the screen in a more organized, grid-like pattern were able to type faster and more accurately.\n\nAnother key takeaway was the significance of finger movement. The study revealed that participants who used a more fluid, sweeping motion to type were able to type faster and more accurately than those who used a more staccato, tap-like motion.\n\nThe researchers also identified the importance of keyboard layout and design. The study found that participants who used keyboards with a more ergonomic design, featuring curved keys and a sloping surface, were able to type faster and more accurately than those who used standard, flat keyboards.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the average smartphone user? According to Dr. Jane Smith, lead researcher on the study, \"By adopting a few simple strategies, such as placing fingers in a grid-like pattern and using a more fluid typing motion, individuals can significantly improve their typing speed and accuracy on their smartphones.\"\n\nIn addition to these specific techniques, the study also highlighted the importance of practice and consistency. \"The more you practice typing on your smartphone, the more your brain adapts to the unique demands of the device,\" said Dr. Smith. \"By committing to regular practice, individuals can continue to improve their typing skills and increase their overall productivity.\"\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly dependent on smartphones, it's clear that developing effective typing techniques is crucial for staying ahead of the curve. By adopting the strategies outlined in this study, individuals can take their smartphone typing skills to the next level and reap the benefits of increased productivity and efficiency.",

They might also have noted that, despite 19 years of whistleblowing legislation, there is no general provision requiring employers to maintain the confidentiality of disclosers or to allow anonymous reporting of suspected wrongdoing. Prof David Lewis Whistleblowing Research Unit, Middlesex University • David Butler states: \"The last time Labour was in as hopeless a position as it is today, we had three consecutive election victories lying in wait\" (Letters, 25 February). If he is thinking of the same year as me, there were three consecutive election defeats first. I am 56 and cannot wait that long. The criticism from media lawyers and the public highlights the urgent need for reform in the way whistleblowers are protected in the UK. The lack of a general provision requiring employers to maintain the confidentiality of disclosers or to allow anonymous reporting of suspected wrongdoing is a glaring omission in the country's whistleblowing legislation.\n\nAs the Whistleblowing Research Unit at Middlesex University notes, the current laws have been in place for nearly two decades, yet whistleblowers continue to face reprisal and retaliation for speaking out against wrongdoing. This not only undermines the integrity of the reporting process but also discourages individuals from coming forward with vital information.\n\nThe case of Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy for years, is a stark reminder of the risks whistleblowers take when they choose to reveal information that is deemed sensitive or confidential. His case has sparked a global debate about the role of whistleblowers in holding those in power accountable and the need for greater protection for those who come forward with information.\n\nThe lack of a general provision requiring employers to maintain the confidentiality of disclosers is particularly concerning, as it leaves whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and reprisal. This is especially true in industries where there is a culture of silence and fear, such as healthcare and finance.\n\nIn response to these concerns, there are growing calls for reform of the whistleblowing legislation. Some have suggested introducing a general provision requiring employers to maintain the confidentiality of disclosers, while others have called for greater protections for whistleblowers, including the ability to report anonymously.\n\nThe government has yet to respond to these calls, but the public is increasingly demanding action. As the Whistleblowing Research Unit notes, the lack of effective protection for whistleblowers is a major obstacle to transparency and accountability in the UK. It is time for the government to take action and ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported, rather than punished and silenced.\n\nIn the meantime, individuals like David Butler, who have spoken out against the government's handling of the situation, are providing a voice for those who feel silenced and marginalized. His letter, which pointed out the error in David Lewis's assertion that Labour had three consecutive election victories in the past, highlights the importance of fact-checking and the need for accurate information in public discourse.\n\nAs the debate around whistleblowers and transparency continues to unfold, it is clear that the UK needs a more robust and effective system of protection for those who come forward with information.

Greg Clark, the business secretary, said the announcement was \"great news for the UK economy\". He added: \"The government is committed to ensuring businesses have the support they need to thrive and today's announcement underlines that businesses are confident that the UK remains open for business.\" McDonald's is pushing ahead with its expansion plans despite Britain voting to leave the EU, which has sparked fears of a slowdown in the economy and businesses pulling investment out of the country. The fast-food giant's decision to create new jobs and expand its operations comes as a boost to the UK economy, which has been facing uncertainty following the Brexit vote. The company's plans will not only provide employment opportunities for thousands of people but also contribute to the country's economic growth.\n\nAccording to McDonald's, the new jobs will be created across various roles, including management, customer service, and kitchen staff. The company will also be recruiting apprentices and offering training programs to help employees develop their skills.\n\nThe expansion plans will see McDonald's open 25 new restaurants across the UK, with a focus on urban areas and key transportation hubs. The company will also be extending its opening hours at existing sites, allowing customers to enjoy its services for longer periods.\n\nOne of the key initiatives that McDonald's will be introducing is table service, which is designed to enhance the customer experience and increase sales. The company will be trialing the new service in select locations before rolling it out nationwide.\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by the government, with Business Secretary Greg Clark hailing it as \"great news for the UK economy.\" Clark emphasized that the government is committed to supporting businesses and creating an environment that encourages investment and growth.\n\nMcDonald's decision to push ahead with its expansion plans despite the uncertainty surrounding Brexit is seen as a vote of confidence in the UK economy. The company's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, has stated that McDonald's remains committed to the UK market and is confident that the country will continue to thrive.\n\nThe news has also been welcomed by industry experts, who see it as a sign that businesses are adapting to the new economic landscape and finding ways to thrive in a post-Brexit world. According to a recent survey, over 60% of businesses in the UK are confident that they will be able to adapt to the changes brought about by Brexit.\n\nWhile there are still many challenges ahead for the UK economy, McDonald's announcement is a positive sign that businesses are committed to investing in the country and creating jobs. As the UK begins to navigate its new relationship with the EU, it is likely that we will see more businesses making similar announcements, providing a boost to the economy and giving people new opportunities to get back to work.",

        "Text": "Soggy May bank holidays are not celebrated by most people, but young people revising for school exams may benefit from them, after US researchers discovered that hotter temperatures lead to worse grades. The data is extensive. Academics at Harvard, UCLA and Georgia State University used the scores of more than 10 million secondary students over 13 years, and compared temperature changes in hot southern and colder northern states. In every case, a half-degree rise in the average temperature over the year equalled a 1% drop in average exam scores. The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, found that the impact of temperature on exam scores was most pronounced for students in the southern states, where temperatures are already known to be higher. In these regions, a 1% drop in exam scores was equivalent to a 0.5°C (0.9°F) increase in average temperature over the year.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the relationship between temperature and exam scores was strongest for math and science exams, which are often more challenging and require more cognitive effort. In contrast, language-based exams, such as English and history, were less affected by temperature.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Emily Chen from Harvard University, attributed the findings to the fact that hotter temperatures can impair cognitive function and make it more difficult for students to focus and retain information. \"When it's hot outside, students may feel more fatigued and distracted, which can negatively impact their ability to learn and perform well on exams,\" she explained.\n\nThe research has significant implications for education policy and practice. With climate change projected to increase temperatures globally, the study suggests that schools may need to adapt their teaching strategies and exam schedules to mitigate the impact of heat on student performance.\n\nFor example, schools in hot climates could consider implementing cooling measures, such as air-conditioned classrooms or shaded outdoor areas, to help students stay comfortable and focused. They could also adjust their exam schedules to avoid peak heat hours or provide additional support and resources to students who may be struggling due to the heat.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked debate about the need for climate-resilient education systems. \"As we prepare students for an uncertain future, it's essential that we take into account the impacts of climate change on their learning and well-being,\" said Dr. Chen. \"By doing so, we can help ensure that all students have access to high-quality education, regardless of the temperature outside.\"",

Sea turtles use the earth's magnetic fields to navigate back to the area where they were born decades earlier, according to a new study that used loggerhead genetics to investigate their travels.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the University of Delaware used a combination of genetic analysis and satellite tracking to study the migration patterns of loggerhead sea turtles. The team found that the turtles' ability to detect the earth's magnetic fields, known as magnetoreception, plays a crucial role in their ability to navigate back to their birthplace, a process known as natal homing.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Current Biology, analyzed the genetic makeup of 144 loggerhead sea turtles that were born in the Mediterranean and tracked their movements over a period of several years. The researchers found that the turtles' genetic profiles were closely linked to their birth location, and that they were able to use this information to determine their migration route.\n\n\"We were able to identify specific genetic markers that were associated with the turtles' birth location, and we used this information to predict their migration route,\" said Dr. Chris Manassa, lead author of the study. \"Our findings suggest that the turtles are using their genetic makeup to guide their migration, and that magnetoreception is an important component of this process.\"\n\nThe researchers used satellite tracking to monitor the turtles' movements, and found that they were able to migrate thousands of miles over a period of several years. The turtles' ability to detect the earth's magnetic fields allowed them to navigate through the ocean and avoid obstacles, such as ships and coastal structures.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for the conservation of sea turtles. The researchers suggest that the turtles' ability to navigate back to their birthplace is a critical component of their survival, and that human activities, such as coastal development and pollution, may be disrupting this process.\n\n\"The loss of habitat and the disruption of migration routes are major threats to sea turtle populations,\" said Dr. Manassa. \"Our study highlights the importance of preserving the turtles' natural habitats and migration routes, and of reducing human impacts on their behavior and ecology.\"\n\nThe study's authors hope that their findings will inform conservation efforts and help to protect sea turtle populations. They also plan to continue studying the turtles' migration patterns and behavior to learn more about their remarkable navigational abilities.\n\n\"This is a fascinating area of research, and we are excited to continue exploring the mysteries of sea turtle migration,\" said Dr. Manassa. \"Our findings have important implications for the conservation of these incredible animals, and we hope that they will help to inform efforts to protect their populations.\"",

Netflix, which is up for 15 Oscars including best picture and director for Roma, hit 9.7m UK subscribers at the end of the third quarter last year, according to a new report from TV measurement body Barb. The report estimates that rival Amazon's Prime Video service is only just over half the size of Netflix in the UK - with 4.9m users - with Netflix continuing to extend its lead. Netflix UK added 2.2m new subscribers in the year to the end of the third quarter 2018, double the 1.1m Amazon added, growing at almost 30% in the third quarter. \"Change is afoot as subscription video-on-demand services continue to cement their place in the television ecosystem,\" said Barb. The report also highlighted the growing importance of streaming services in the UK's television landscape. According to Barb, the number of UK households with a streaming service has increased by 15% over the past year, with 74% of households now having at least one subscription.\n\nNetflix's dominance in the UK market is not surprising, given its early mover advantage and significant investment in original content. The company has produced a wide range of popular shows and movies, including \"The Crown\", \"Stranger Things\", and \"Narcos\", which have all been major hits with UK audiences.\n\nAmazon Prime Video, on the other hand, has struggled to gain traction in the UK market. Despite its strong brand recognition and existing customer base, the service has struggled to compete with Netflix's extensive library of content and user-friendly interface.\n\nHowever, Amazon is not giving up yet. The company has announced plans to increase its investment in original content in the UK, with a focus on producing more shows and movies that appeal to British audiences. Amazon has also been expanding its partnership with UK broadcasters, such as the BBC and Channel 4, to offer more exclusive content to its subscribers.\n\nDespite the competition from Amazon, Netflix remains the clear leader in the UK streaming market. The company's growth is expected to continue, driven by its expanding library of content and increasing popularity among UK consumers.\n\nIn a statement, a Netflix spokesperson said: \"We're thrilled to see our subscriber base continue to grow in the UK, and we're committed to delivering even more great content to our members. We're proud to be a part of the UK's vibrant entertainment landscape, and we look forward to continuing to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible in streaming.\"\n\nThe news is a significant boost for Netflix, which is also facing increased competition from other streaming services, such as Disney+, Apple TV+, and HBO Max.

But when I rang customer services a man told me it does not accept debit cards, contrary to what it says on the website. Then when I received my bank statement in February I noted that a payment of £286 was taken from my debit account by Argos, but I still haven't received any goods. I was shocked and frustrated by the experience, and I decided to take further action to resolve the issue. I contacted my bank, who confirmed that the payment had been taken from my account and was now in dispute. They advised me to contact Argos again to try to resolve the matter.\n\nI rang Argos customer services once more, and this time I was transferred to a supervisor who listened to my concerns and apologized for the inconvenience. She explained that the website had been updated to reflect that debit cards were no longer accepted, but that my original order had been processed before the change was made.\n\nThe supervisor told me that she would investigate the matter and get back to me within 24 hours. I was skeptical, but I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Years of Chinese government efforts to reverse their dwindling numbers, such as the restoration of bamboo forests and establishment of national habitat reserves, helped bring the animals back from the brink. They were declared no longer endangered in September 2016 after population estimates reached 1,864 -- not counting cubs. However, the conservation success story is not without its challenges. The giant panda's habitat is still under threat due to deforestation and urbanization, which has led to the fragmentation of their natural habitats. This has made it difficult for the pandas to find suitable mates and has increased the risk of inbreeding.\n\nIn recent years, the Chinese government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges. One such initiative is the \"Bamboo Forest Restoration Program\", which aims to restore 10 million hectares of bamboo forests by 2025. The program involves the planting of millions of bamboo saplings, as well as the creation of artificial habitats to mimic the pandas' natural environment.\n\nThe government has also established a network of \"panda corridors\" to connect isolated panda populations and allow them to roam freely. These corridors are designed to provide a safe passage for the pandas to migrate between different habitats, reducing the risk of inbreeding and increasing genetic diversity.\n\nDespite these efforts, the giant panda population is still vulnerable to threats such as climate change, disease, and human-panda conflict. Climate change is altering the pandas' food supply and habitat, making it harder for them to survive. Disease is also a major concern, as the pandas are susceptible to diseases such as distemper and pneumonia.\n\nTo address these challenges, conservationists are working closely with local communities to develop sustainable livelihoods that do not harm the pandas or their habitats. This includes initiatives such as eco-tourism, which allows visitors to observe the pandas in their natural habitat while generating income for local communities.\n\nIn addition, scientists are working to develop new technologies to monitor the pandas' behavior and health. For example, camera traps are being used to monitor the pandas' activity patterns and detect any signs of disease. Genetic analysis is also being used to identify the genetic makeup of the pandas and develop breeding programs that prioritize genetic diversity.\n\nOverall, while the giant panda's conservation success story is a testament to the power of government and community efforts, it is clear that there is still much work to be done to ensure the long-term survival of this iconic species.",

The cats are among nearly 500,000 land species whose survival is now in question because of threats to their natural habitats, according to a report on Monday by the United Nations. The Sundarbans, 4,000 square miles of marshy land in Bangladesh and India, hosts the world's largest mangrove forest and a rich ecosystem supporting several hundred animal species, including the endangered Bengal tiger. The report, titled \"IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,\" highlights the alarming rate at which species are disappearing due to human activities such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change. The study found that one in eight species of land animals, including the Bengal tiger, are at risk of extinction.\n\nThe Sundarbans, a unique and fragile ecosystem, is home to not only the Bengal tiger but also other endangered species such as the Ganges River dolphin and the estuarine crocodile. The region's mangrove forests, which cover over 10% of the world's total mangrove area, provide vital shelter and food for these species.\n\nHowever, the Sundarbans is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and increased cyclone frequency. The region is already experiencing more frequent and intense flooding, which is threatening the habitat and livelihoods of the people who live there.\n\nThe UN report warns that the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services has severe consequences for human well-being, including the loss of pollination, pest control, and climate regulation. The report also highlights the economic costs of biodiversity loss, estimating that it could cost the global economy up to 20% of its annual GDP by 2050.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the Sundarbans and its inhabitants. The Indian government has established several protected areas and conservation programs, while the Bangladesh government is working to restore degraded habitats and reduce pollution.\n\nHowever, more needs to be done to address the scale and urgency of the crisis. The report calls for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect and restore natural habitats, and address the root causes of biodiversity loss.\n\n\"The IPBES report is a wake-up call for all of us,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading conservation biologist. \"We need to take immediate action to protect the natural world, not just for the sake of the animals and plants, but for our own survival.\"\n\nThe report's findings are a stark reminder of the urgent need for global cooperation and action to address the biodiversity crisis.

But a growing number of tech startups are bucking this trend, achieving profitability before going public. This shift is being driven by a combination of factors, including the increasing importance of cash flow in the eyes of investors, the rise of subscription-based business models, and the need for companies to demonstrate their financial stability before listing on the stock market.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of a profitable tech startup is Zoom Video Communications, the video conferencing platform that went public in April 2019. Zoom reported a net income of $7.6 million in 2018, on revenues of $330 million, and has continued to grow its profitability since its IPO. The company's ability to generate cash has been a major factor in its success, allowing it to invest in new products and services while also returning value to its shareholders.\n\nAnother example is Slack Technologies, the workplace communication platform that went public in June 2019. Slack reported a net loss of $138 million in 2018, but its revenue grew by 50% to $400 million. The company's profitability has been driven by its subscription-based model, which generates significant recurring revenue. Slack's ability to demonstrate its financial stability before going public helped it to attract a strong reception from investors, and its stock has performed well since its IPO.\n\nThe trend towards profitability before going public is not limited to these two companies. Other successful tech startups, such as DocuSign and Atlassian, have also achieved profitability before listing on the stock market. DocuSign, the electronic signature platform, reported a net income of $21.5 million in 2018, on revenues of $591 million. Atlassian, the software development platform, reported a net income of $246 million in 2018, on revenues of $1.2 billion.\n\nThe shift towards profitability before going public is likely to continue, as investors become increasingly demanding of financial discipline from the companies they invest in. This trend is likely to benefit companies that are able to demonstrate their ability to generate cash and grow their profitability over time. For investors, it means that they will have more confidence in the financial stability of the companies they invest in, and will be more likely to support them over the long term.",

        "Text": "London and Frankfurt will lose out to New York and Singapore unless a free trade deal on financial services after Brexit is agreed, according to leading City businesses. The report from key banks, law firms and fund managers in the UK proposes a \"bespoke\" free trade agreement once Britain leaves the EU. Such a deal would allow British and EU-based financial companies to sell their products and services without tariffs, taxes or quotas in each other's markets after Brexit. The report, which was compiled by a group of 15 leading financial institutions, including Barclays, HSBC, and JPMorgan, as well as law firms such as Clifford Chance and Linklaters, warned that without a free trade agreement, London and Frankfurt would struggle to maintain their status as major financial hubs.\n\n\"The City of London and Frankfurt are at risk of losing their competitive edge in the global financial markets if we don't secure a bespoke free trade agreement with the EU,\" said a spokesperson for the report's authors. \"We need to ensure that our financial services sector can continue to operate seamlessly across borders, and that requires a tailored agreement that addresses the specific needs of our industry.\"\n\nThe report highlights the importance of financial services to the UK economy, with the sector contributing around 10% of GDP and employing millions of people. It also notes that the EU is the UK's largest trading partner, with financial services accounting for a significant proportion of UK exports to the bloc.\n\nThe authors of the report are calling on the UK government to prioritize the negotiation of a free trade agreement on financial services as part of the Brexit negotiations. They argue that such an agreement would not only benefit the UK's financial sector but also the wider economy.\n\n\"The benefits of a bespoke free trade agreement would be felt across the economy, from small businesses to large corporations,\" said the spokesperson. \"It would help to maintain the UK's economic competitiveness, create new jobs, and boost economic growth.\"\n\nThe report's findings are likely to be welcomed by the UK government, which has previously stated its commitment to maintaining the UK's status as a major financial center post-Brexit. However, the negotiations with the EU are expected to be complex and challenging, and it remains to be seen whether the UK and EU can agree on a free trade agreement that meets the needs of the financial services sector.\n\nIn the meantime, the authors of the report are urging the UK government to engage in constructive dialogue with the EU to ensure that a bespoke free trade agreement is secured. They are also calling on the financial services sector to work together to promote the benefits of such an agreement and to support the government's efforts to secure a successful outcome.\n\nAs the Brexit negotiations continue, the eyes of the financial world will be on the UK and EU to see whether they can agree on a free trade agreement that will ensure the continued success of London and Frankfurt as major financial hubs.",

Though television executives were bracing for a ratings collapse after an election year of extraordinary viewership -- CNN's chief executive, Jeff Zucker said he expected to lose a quarter of his audience -- ratings are going only one direction in President Trump's first 11 days on the job: up. According to Nielsen Media Research, the three major cable news networks - CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC - have seen a significant surge in viewership since Trump's inauguration on January 20th. CNN, in particular, has experienced a remarkable 55% increase in total viewership compared to the same period last year, with an average of 2.1 million viewers tuning in each day.\n\nFox News has also seen a notable jump, with a 25% increase in total viewership, while MSNBC has reported a 15% rise. The ratings boost is not limited to primetime hours, with daytime viewership also experiencing a significant surge.\n\nThe unprecedented viewership numbers can be attributed to a combination of factors. The Trump presidency has sparked intense interest and curiosity among the public, with many Americans eager to stay informed about the latest developments and policy decisions emanating from the White House.\n\nAdditionally, the polarized political climate has led to a heightened sense of engagement and activism among citizens, with many tuning in to cable news to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis. The intense media coverage surrounding Trump's presidency, including his frequent Twitter posts and public appearances, has also contributed to the ratings boom.\n\nTelevision executives are thrilled with the unexpected surge in viewership, which has alleviated concerns about a post-election ratings collapse. \"We're seeing a level of engagement and interest that's unprecedented,\" said CNN's Jeff Zucker. \"We're grateful to have a president who is so comfortable in front of the camera and is generating so much interest in the news.\"\n\nThe ratings bonanza has also led to a renewed focus on cable news programming, with networks scrambling to capitalize on the momentum. MSNBC has launched new shows and expanded its prime-time lineup, while Fox News has introduced a new morning program and is exploring additional programming options.\n\nAs the Trump presidency continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the ratings surge will sustain itself in the long term. However, for now, cable news networks are basking in the glow of a ratings windfall that has few precedents in the history of television.",

The dire March trading meant like-for-like sales in the first three months of 2018 were down 15.4% on the same period last year – even worse than the 15.1% decline posted in the previous quarter. The poor performance of Homebase has raised concerns about the future of the company, which has been struggling to recover from a decline in sales since its acquisition by Wesfarmers in 2016. The company has been trying to revamp its business strategy, including closing underperforming stores and introducing new products, but so far, the efforts have not yielded the desired results.\n\nIndustry experts say that the decline of Homebase is a reflection of the changing retail landscape, with many consumers turning to online shopping and discount stores. \"The DIY market is highly competitive, and Homebase has been struggling to adapt to the changing consumer behavior,\" said Mark Fletcher, a retail analyst at Verdict Retail. \"The company needs to rethink its strategy and focus on providing a better online shopping experience and more competitive pricing to stay relevant.\"\n\nWesfarmers has been trying to sell Homebase, but so far, no buyer has been found. The company has been forced to write down the value of Homebase by £1.8 billion, highlighting the severity of the situation. \"We are exploring all options to maximize value for our shareholders, including a sale or a strategic partnership,\" said a Wesfarmers spokesperson.\n\nThe decline of Homebase has also had a ripple effect on the wider retail industry, with many other DIY chains and garden centers also reporting a decline in sales. The British Retail Consortium has warned that the retail industry is facing its toughest trading conditions in a decade, with many retailers struggling to stay afloat.\n\nIn a bid to turn things around, Homebase has launched a new marketing campaign, which focuses on promoting its online shopping experience and offering more competitive pricing. The company has also introduced a new loyalty scheme, which rewards customers for repeat purchases. However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to stem the decline of the company.\n\nFor now, the future of Homebase remains uncertain, and many are left wondering whether the company will be able to recover from its current woes. One thing is certain, however: the retail landscape is changing rapidly, and companies like Homebase need to adapt quickly to stay relevant in the market.",

She said that the creation of a \"privacy centre\" was prompted by the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU regulation that seeks to give Europeans more control over their information and how companies use it. The new privacy centre will be available globally, not just in the European Union, and will provide users with a single location to manage their privacy settings, including options to control who can see their posts, share their location, and access their account information. Sandberg emphasized that the goal of the new centre is to empower users to make informed decisions about their privacy, rather than simply presenting them with a complex array of options.\n\n\"We want to make it easy for people to understand what data we're collecting, why we're collecting it, and how we're using it,\" Sandberg said. \"We want to give people the tools they need to make informed choices about their privacy, and to feel confident that they're in control of their data.\"\n\nThe new privacy centre is just one of the measures that Facebook is taking to comply with the GDPR, which comes into effect on May 25. The regulation requires companies to provide users with clear and transparent information about how their data is being used, and to obtain their explicit consent before collecting or sharing their personal information.\n\nIn addition to the privacy centre, Facebook is also updating its data policy to provide users with more information about how their data is being used. The company is also introducing new features to help users delete or correct their personal data, and to provide them with more control over how their data is shared with third-party apps.\n\nThe changes are part of a broader effort by Facebook to improve transparency and accountability around data privacy. The company has faced criticism in recent years over its handling of user data, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which millions of Facebook users' personal information was harvested and used for political advertising.\n\nSandberg acknowledged that Facebook still has work to do to regain the trust of its users, but she emphasized that the company is committed to protecting their privacy and providing them with the tools they need to make informed decisions.\n\n\"We're committed to being transparent about how we use data, and to giving people the tools they need to control their data,\" Sandberg said. \"We're committed to making sure that our users feel confident that their data is safe with us.\"\n\nThe new privacy centre is expected to roll out globally in the coming weeks, and will be available to all Facebook users, regardless of their location.",

In regards to Flickr, I still have most of the original images on my computer, but need to retrieve a handful of photos I can't find on my hard drive. Can I download the Flickr copies in the original resolution, or will they be in a lower image quality? For users like you who are considering deleting their Yahoo and Flickr accounts, it's essential to know what happens to your content and data. In the case of Flickr, you can download your photos in their original resolution, but there are some limitations and considerations to keep in mind.\n\nAccording to Flickr's official blog, users can download their photos in their original resolution by using the \"Download Your Data\" tool. This feature allows you to export your photos, videos, and other content in their original format, including the original resolution. However, this option is only available for users who have a Flickr Pro account or who have upgraded to a paid account.\n\nFor users with a free account, the download option is limited to a maximum resolution of 1024 pixels on the longest side. This means that if you have high-resolution photos with larger dimensions, they will be downscaled to fit within the 1024-pixel limit.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the \"Download Your Data\" tool is only available for a limited time. Flickr will delete all data associated with your account, including photos and videos, if you don't download your content within 30 days of deleting your account.\n\nIf you're unable to find the photos you're looking for on your hard drive, you may want to consider using a third-party tool or service to help you locate them. There are several options available, including photo recovery software and online backup services.\n\nIn addition to downloading your photos, it's also important to consider the following:\n\n* Check your Flickr account settings to ensure that your photos are set to be publicly available. If they're set to private, you won't be able to download them.\n* Make sure you have the necessary permissions to download your photos. If you've shared photos with others, they may have the right to use or download them.\n* Consider backing up your photos to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to ensure they're safe and easily accessible.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can ensure that your photos are safely stored and easily accessible, even if you decide to delete your Flickr account.",

But the concept often falls flat, as readers see through awkward advertorials and as the logos of eager corporate sponsors overtake pop-culture events like South by Southwest. And then there is Red Bull Music Academy. ...and then there is Red Bull Music Academy. While many branded content initiatives struggle to find their footing, Red Bull's music-focused program has consistently impressed with its ability to blur the lines between advertising and art. For over two decades, the Austrian energy drink company has been producing high-quality music events, workshops, and online content that has earned the respect of both industry insiders and music fans.\n\nOne of the key factors behind Red Bull Music Academy's success is its willingness to take risks and push boundaries. Unlike many branded content initiatives that rely on tired tropes and obvious product placement, Red Bull's programs often feature innovative and avant-garde music, art, and culture. This approach has allowed the company to attract a loyal following among music enthusiasts and creatives who appreciate its commitment to artistic expression.\n\nRed Bull Music Academy's flagship program is its annual festival, which takes place in various cities around the world. The event features a diverse range of performances, from electronic music to jazz and hip-hop, and often includes interactive installations and workshops. The festival has become a must-attend event for music industry professionals and fans alike, with past attendees including the likes of Kanye West, Bjork, and Flying Lotus.\n\nBut Red Bull Music Academy's impact goes beyond its festival and live events. The company has also established a network of online channels, including YouTube and SoundCloud, where it publishes exclusive music content, interviews, and documentaries. This digital presence has allowed Red Bull to reach a global audience and provide a platform for emerging artists to showcase their talents.\n\nDespite its success, Red Bull Music Academy has not been without its controversies. Some critics have accused the company of using its cultural initiatives as a way to promote its brand and increase sales. Others have questioned the lack of transparency around the company's funding and sponsorship deals.\n\nHowever, Red Bull Music Academy's defenders argue that the company's commitment to artistic expression and its willingness to take risks have helped to create a unique and valuable cultural platform. As the advertising industry continues to evolve and the lines between marketing and media continue to blur, Red Bull Music Academy serves as a model for how branded content can be done effectively and with integrity.\n\nIn an era where consumers are increasingly skeptical of advertising and marketing messages, Red Bull Music Academy's success is a testament to the power of creative storytelling and the importance of building meaningful relationships with audiences. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in branded content, it will be interesting to see how it adapts to the changing media landscape and continues to inspire and engage its loyal following.",

Guests at the Orangers hotel in the coastal town of Hammamet spoke of being locked inside their resort on Saturday until a 6,000 Tunisian dinar (£1,680) fee was paid before they were allowed to leave for their flight, or even to visit a shop. Those buses that arrived to transport holidaymakers to the airport at Enfidha were turned away by security, Orangers guests told the Guardian. Thomas Cook customers Maddie Clamp, 26, and her boyfriend, Shaun Holmes, 30, from Derby described how they had been locked within their holiday complex as management, apparently wrong-footed by the news of the travel giant's financial troubles, tried to secure payment from their guests. \"They wouldn't even let us out of the hotel,\" Holmes said. \"The Thomas Cook rep said he'd contacted the chief of police [about their situation].\" The standoff at the Orangers hotel in Hammamet, Tunisia, has sparked widespread concern among Thomas Cook customers, who were left feeling trapped and helpless as they awaited a resolution to the situation.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the hotel's management team, seemingly caught off guard by the news of Thomas Cook's financial struggles, attempted to recoup the outstanding debt by demanding a significant fee from the holidaymakers.

It was a very stressful and unsettling experience.\"\n\nThe situation was further complicated by the fact that buses sent to transport the holidaymakers to the airport at Enfidha were turned away by security, leaving the guests feeling stranded and uncertain about their future travel plans.\n\nThomas Cook has since issued a statement apologizing for the incident and assuring customers that it is working to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. The company has also offered to provide alternative accommodation and transportation for affected customers.\n\nIn the meantime, the Tunisian authorities have launched an investigation into the matter, with local police and officials working to mediate the situation and ensure the safe and timely departure of the holidaymakers.\n\nThe standoff at the Orangers hotel has raised concerns about the impact of Thomas Cook's financial struggles on its customers, particularly those who are currently on holiday or planning to travel with the company in the coming weeks.

        "Text": "The most profound change to human life over the previous 100 years came to a halt in 2010. In the decades before it, life expectancy in Britain kept rising, with men, in particular, born in the 1920s and 1930s enjoying far longer and healthier lives than ever expected. This increase in lifespan has affected everything – from housing to health to pensions. It's why we need to find ever greater sums for the NHS. It's why the state pension age has had to go up. Arguably, it's a big reason why house prices are so high – because people are living in them for longer. But the great leap forward in longevity has come to a shuddering halt. An extraordinary analysis by the Office for National Statistics this week reveals that the trend line in longevity stopped in 2010, and has flatlined since. Experts are left scratching their heads as to why this sudden and unprecedented halt in the rise of life expectancy has occurred. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis, which reviewed data from 1921 to 2019, found that the average life expectancy at birth for men in England and Wales plateaued at 79.3 years, while women's life expectancy peaked at 83.6 years in 2010.\n\n\"This is a major puzzle,\" said Dr. Emma Smith, a demographer at the University of Cambridge. \"We've seen steady increases in life expectancy over the past century, driven by improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and living standards. It's unclear what could be causing this sudden and unexpected halt.\"\n\nOne possible explanation is the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on public health. Research has shown that economic downturns can lead to increased stress levels, poor diet, and reduced access to healthcare, all of which can negatively affect life expectancy.\n\nAnother theory is that the rise in obesity and other lifestyle-related health issues may be playing a role. The ONS analysis found that the proportion of adults in England who are obese has increased significantly over the past decade, from 24% in 2007 to 27% in 2019.\n\nHowever, experts are quick to point out that these factors alone do not fully explain the sudden halt in life expectancy. \"We need to look beyond just economic or lifestyle factors to understand what's going on,\" said Dr. Smith. \"There may be other underlying factors at play, such as changes in healthcare systems or environmental factors.\"\n\nThe implications of this sudden halt in life expectancy are significant. The NHS, which is already under pressure due to an aging population, may need to reassess its priorities and resources. The government may also need to re-evaluate its pension and social security policies, which are based on assumptions about continued increases in life expectancy.\n\nAs the experts continue to puzzle over the reasons behind this sudden halt, one thing is clear: the trend of increasing life expectancy, which has defined human progress over the past century, is no longer a given.",

One newspaper industry source says that the figure being touted is about 1,000 copies. The scarcity of copies in Scotland has raised questions about the newspaper's reach and potential impact on the Scottish market.

The report, which was released on Wednesday, highlighted the need for Greece to accelerate its economic reforms and structural overhauls to avoid a deeper financial crisis. The IMF warned that if Greece fails to implement the necessary reforms, it could lead to a persistent recession, which would further exacerbate the country's financial woes.\n\nThe 11 billion-euro hole in Greece's finances is a significant concern, as it would require Greece's European creditors to consider providing additional debt relief and financing to help the country meet its bailout program requirements. The IMF report emphasized that Greece needs to implement bold and swift reforms to address its economic challenges, including reducing its high public debt, improving its tax collection system, and increasing its competitiveness.\n\nGreece has been struggling to recover from its debt crisis, which began in 2009. The country received its first bailout package in 2010, followed by a second bailout in 2012. The current 172 billion-euro bailout program, which was agreed upon in 2015, has provided Greece with financial assistance and structural reforms aimed at stabilizing its economy and improving its competitiveness.\n\nHowever, despite the progress made, Greece's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and internal challenges. The country's high public debt, which stands at over 180% of its gross domestic product, is a major concern, as it makes it difficult for Greece to borrow money on the international markets.\n\nThe IMF report also highlighted the need for Greece to address its high unemployment rate, which stands at over 20%. The country's labor market has been struggling to recover from the debt crisis, and the IMF warned that if Greece fails to implement effective policies to reduce unemployment, it could lead to social unrest and political instability.\n\nIn response to the IMF report, Greek officials have emphasized the need for a comprehensive and sustainable solution to the country's economic challenges. The Greek government has pledged to implement the necessary reforms and structural overhauls to address its economic woes, and has called on its European creditors to provide additional debt relief and financing to help the country meet its bailout program requirements.\n\nThe IMF report has sparked concerns among investors and financial markets, with the yield on Greek government bonds rising to over 7% on Thursday. The report has also raised concerns among European officials, who are urging Greece to implement the necessary reforms to address its economic challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the IMF report highlights the need for Greece to implement bold and swift reforms to address its economic challenges. The country's persistent recession and high public debt make it difficult for Greece to recover from its debt crisis, and the IMF report emphasizes the need for Greece's European creditors to provide additional debt relief and financing to help the country meet its bailout program requirements.",

Emergency dispatchers in California have fielded in the region of 1,600 accidental calls originating from a repair and refurbishment centre in Elk Grove, with no one on the other end. \"We've been seeing these calls for the last four months from Apple,\" police dispatcher Jamie Hudson told CBS, explaining that the instances take up valuable seconds away from real emergencies. Apple's Refurbishment Centre Under Fire for False Emergency Calls\n\nThe alarming trend of false emergency calls from Apple's refurbishment centre in Elk Grove, California, has left authorities and residents alike scratching their heads. According to police dispatcher Jamie Hudson, the centre has been responsible for around 20 accidental calls per day since October, with a staggering total of approximately 1,600 calls in the past four months.\n\nThe calls, which are often triggered by unknown means, have been a significant distraction for emergency dispatchers, who are tasked with responding to real-life emergencies. \"These calls take up valuable seconds away from real emergencies,\" Hudson emphasized, highlighting the potential consequences of the centre's actions.\n\nApple has yet to provide a clear explanation for the false calls, leaving many to speculate about the cause. Some have suggested that the centre's equipment or software may be malfunctioning, while others believe that human error could be to blame.\n\nThe issue has sparked concerns about the centre's ability to handle sensitive and potentially critical information. As a refurbishment centre, Apple's Elk Grove facility is responsible for repairing and refurbishing used iPhones, iPads, and other devices. It is unclear whether the centre's equipment or processes are compromised, allowing false calls to slip through.\n\nApple has issued a statement acknowledging the issue, but has not provided further details. \"We take these reports seriously and are working to identify the cause of the issue,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and are committed to resolving the matter as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIn the meantime, authorities are urging Apple to take immediate action to prevent further false calls. \"We need Apple to take responsibility and take steps to ensure that this doesn't happen again,\" said Elk Grove Police Chief, Steven Brooks. \"We can't afford to have our emergency responders tied up with false calls when real emergencies are unfolding.\"\n\nAs the investigation continues, residents and authorities alike are left wondering how such a large number of false calls could go unnoticed for so long. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and transparency in the tech industry, particularly when it comes to sensitive and critical information.\n\nIn the coming days, Apple is expected to provide further updates on the situation, including any measures it plans to take to prevent future false calls. Until then, the people of Elk Grove and beyond will be left to wonder how such a significant issue could have gone unchecked for so long.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Airbnb agreed on Monday to settle a lawsuit against the city of San Francisco, putting to rest litigation that could have hampered the company's efforts to expand and go public. In the settlement, Airbnb essentially agreed to San Francisco's demand to be more transparent about its hosts and to help enforce existing registration laws. Under the terms of the settlement, Airbnb will implement a new system to verify the identities of its hosts and provide the city with regular reports on the number of hosts and the types of properties they operate. The company will also work with the city to identify and remove illegal short-term rentals from its platform.\n\nThe settlement comes as a relief to both Airbnb and the city, which had been locked in a contentious battle over the company's business practices. The lawsuit was filed in 2015, alleging that Airbnb was not doing enough to prevent illegal short-term rentals and was contributing to the city's housing shortage.\n\nAirbnb has long maintained that it is a platform for people to rent out their homes and apartments to travelers, and that it is not responsible for ensuring that its hosts comply with local laws and regulations. However, the city has argued that Airbnb has a responsibility to police its platform and prevent illegal activity.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Airbnb will also pay the city $1.8 million to cover the costs of enforcing the city's registration laws. The company will also provide the city with data on its hosts and properties, which will help the city to better understand the scope of the short-term rental market in San Francisco.\n\nThe settlement is seen as a victory for the city, which has been struggling to address the issue of illegal short-term rentals. The city has implemented a number of measures to try to curb the problem, including increasing fines for violators and requiring hosts to register with the city.\n\nAirbnb's settlement with the city is also seen as a major step forward for the company, which has been working to improve its reputation and build trust with regulators. The company has faced criticism in the past for its lack of transparency and accountability, and the settlement is seen as a sign that it is taking steps to address these concerns.\n\nThe settlement is effective immediately, and Airbnb will begin implementing the new system for verifying host identities and providing reports to the city within the next 60 days. The company will also work with the city to develop a plan for identifying and removing illegal short-term rentals from its platform.\n\nOverall, the settlement between Airbnb and the city of San Francisco is a major development in the ongoing battle over short-term rentals. It marks a significant step forward for the city, which has been struggling to address the issue of illegal short-term rentals, and it demonstrates Airbnb's commitment to transparency and accountability.",

Ball, who works under the pseudonym Docubyte, began the project after developing a fascination and affection for such retro devices. \"It's rare now to find any machine that you can touch and interact with,\" he says. As a child of the 80s, Ball grew up surrounded by the hum of computers and the glow of screens. He spent countless hours playing games and experimenting with code on his family's Apple IIe. But as technology advanced and devices became more streamlined, the tactile experience of interacting with early computers began to fade away.\n\n\"I think that's what drew me to these old machines,\" Ball explains. \"They're not just relics of the past, they're artifacts that tell a story about how we got to where we are today.\"\n\nGuide to Computing is a stunning collection of photographs that showcases the beauty and character of these vintage devices. From the chunky, boxy designs of the first IBM PCs to the sleek, futuristic lines of the Apple Lisa, each machine is meticulously photographed and presented in a way that highlights its unique features and quirks.\n\nBall's passion for these old computers is evident in every shot. He's not just capturing their physical appearance, but also their personality and charm. In one image, a vintage Commodore 64 is posed against a bright blue background, its keys and buttons glowing like a miniature cityscape. In another, a 1980s-era IBM PC is set against a warm, wooden backdrop, its chunky monitor and keyboard looking like a relic from a bygone era.\n\nThe photographs are so detailed and well-composed that they almost seem like works of art. Ball's use of lighting, composition, and color is masterful, and each image is a testament to his skill and dedication as a photographer.\n\nBut Guide to Computing is more than just a collection of pretty pictures. It's also a tribute to the pioneers of the computer age, who toiled away in relative obscurity to create the machines that would change the world.\n\n\"These people were the true innovators,\" Ball says. \"They were the ones who had the vision and the passion to create something new and exciting. And even though their machines may seem old-fashioned now, they're still an important part of our history and heritage.\"\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly reliant on sleek, high-tech devices, Guide to Computing serves as a timely reminder of the beauty and importance of the past. It's a celebration of the machines that came before, and a testament to the power of human ingenuity and creativity.\n\nFor Ball, the project is also a way to connect with his own childhood and the early days of computing. \"I'm not just documenting these machines, I'm also trying to recapture the sense of wonder and excitement that I felt when I first discovered them,\" he says.\n\nWith Guide to Computing, Ball has created something truly special – a work of art that's both a tribute to the past and a celebration of the present. It's a reminder that even in the age of smartphones and tablets, there's still beauty and charm to be found in the machines that came before.",

The study found that frozen samples of sperm exposed to microgravity retained similar characteristics to sperm samples kept on the ground, raising hopes that a sperm bank could one day be set up in space to help populate new worlds. This could prove interesting for female astronauts, amid reports that future missions to Mars may involve women-only space crews. The findings, published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, have sparked excitement among scientists and space enthusiasts alike, as they suggest that human reproduction could be possible in space without the need for male companions. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), involved exposing frozen samples of human sperm to microgravity conditions, similar to those found in space.\n\nThe researchers found that the sperm samples retained their normal structure and function, including their ability to fertilize eggs, even after being exposed to microgravity for several weeks. This is significant, as previous studies have suggested that microgravity can have a negative impact on sperm quality and function.\n\n\"This study shows that sperm can survive and remain viable in microgravity, which opens up new possibilities for reproduction in space,\" said Dr. Lisa Calixto, lead author of the study. \"It's a crucial step towards establishing a sperm bank in space, which could be used to help populate new worlds.\"\n\nThe possibility of establishing a sperm bank in space is particularly intriguing in light of reports that future missions to Mars may involve all-female space crews. NASA has already announced plans to send the first woman to the moon in 2024, and there are ongoing discussions about the possibility of sending a woman-only crew to Mars in the near future.\n\nIf a sperm bank were established in space, it could potentially provide a way for female astronauts to have children while on mission, without the need for male companions. This could be a significant advantage for women who may not have the opportunity to have children due to the demands of their careers or other personal circumstances.\n\nHowever, there are still many challenges to overcome before a sperm bank can be established in space. For example, there are concerns about the long-term effects of microgravity on sperm quality and function, as well as the need for specialized equipment and facilities to store and handle the sperm samples.\n\nDespite these challenges, the researchers involved in the study are optimistic about the potential for human reproduction in space. \"This study shows that it's possible to store and use sperm in space, which is a crucial step towards establishing a human settlement on another planet,\" said Dr. Calixto.\n\nThe study's findings have also raised questions about the potential for human reproduction in space to be used for other purposes, such as creating a new generation of space-faring humans. While this is still largely speculative, the possibility of establishing a human settlement on another planet is becoming increasingly plausible, and the study's findings could play a significant role in making that a reality.\n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings have significant implications for human reproduction in space, and could potentially pave the way for the establishment of a sperm bank in space. While there are still many challenges to overcome, the possibility of human reproduction in space is an exciting and rapidly evolving field, and one that could have significant implications for the future of human space exploration.",

But if Calpers can be forced to take a haircut in Stockton, then what's to stop another city from saying, 'Gee, we'll file for bankruptcy and cut in half our $10 million pension contribution?' The statement by Mr. Sweet, a financial expert, highlights the growing concern among city officials regarding the potential consequences of the Calpers' decision to reduce pension benefits for the city of Stockton. The Calpers, California Public Employees' Retirement System, is the largest public pension fund in the United States, and its decision to cut benefits has sent shockwaves throughout the municipal finance community.\n\nAccording to experts, the Calpers' move is a wake-up call for cities that are struggling to balance their budgets and are facing significant pension obligations. Many cities, like Stockton, are facing severe financial crises, with pension costs eating up a significant portion of their budgets. The Calpers' decision to reduce benefits could set a precedent for other cities to follow suit, potentially leading to a wave of pension cuts across the country.\n\n\"This is a major concern for cities that are already struggling to make ends meet,\" said John Smith, a municipal finance expert. \"If Calpers can reduce benefits, then what's to stop other cities from doing the same? It's a slippery slope, and it could have devastating consequences for city workers and residents alike.\"\n\nThe potential consequences of the Calpers' decision are far-reaching, with many experts predicting that it could lead to a decline in city services, increased taxes, and a decrease in the overall quality of life for city residents. Additionally, the decision could also have a significant impact on the broader economy, as cities are major drivers of economic growth and development.\n\nDespite the concerns, some experts argue that the Calpers' decision is a necessary step to ensure the long-term sustainability of the pension system. \"The pension system is unsustainable in its current form, and something needs to be done to address the issue,\" said Jane Doe, a pension expert. \"Reducing benefits is a difficult but necessary step to ensure that the system remains viable for generations to come.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, city officials and pension experts are urging caution and calling for a comprehensive review of the pension system. \"We need to take a step back and assess the situation,\" said Mr. Sweet. \"We can't just react to the Calpers' decision without thinking about the long-term consequences.

That could blanket most of the United States in a thick layer of ash and even plunge the Earth into a volcanic winter. Scientists have long been monitoring the supervolcano, known as the Yellowstone Caldera, for signs of increased activity. While it's impossible to predict when the volcano might erupt, experts say that the likelihood of a catastrophic event is higher than ever before.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jane Smith, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the supervolcano has been showing signs of unrest in recent years. \"We've seen an increase in seismic activity, including small earthquakes and tremors, which could be indicative of magma movement beneath the surface,\" she explained.\n\nIn addition to the seismic activity, scientists have also detected changes in the volcano's gas emissions. \"We've seen an increase in sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, which could be a sign that the magma is rising to the surface,\" said Dr. John Doe, a volcanologist with the University of Wyoming.\n\nWhile the prospect of a supervolcano eruption is daunting, experts say that it's not all doom and gloom. \"We've been monitoring the volcano closely, and we have evacuation plans in place in case of an emergency,\" said Dr. Smith. \"We're also working with local authorities to develop emergency response plans and to educate the public on what to do in the event of an eruption.\"\n\nIn the meantime, scientists are working to better understand the supervolcano's behavior and to develop new technologies to detect and predict eruptions. \"We're using advanced sensors and monitoring systems to track the volcano's activity, and we're also studying the history of past eruptions to better understand the patterns and triggers of these events,\" said Dr. Doe.\n\nWhile the threat of a supervolcano eruption is real, experts say that it's not a reason to panic. \"We're taking the necessary steps to prepare for any eventuality, but we're also aware that the likelihood of a catastrophic eruption is still relatively low,\" said Dr. Smith. \"We're working hard to stay ahead of the game and to ensure the safety of the public.\"",

        "Text": "PARIS -- In its first such agreement with a European country, China signed a free-trade deal with Iceland on Monday as Beijing reached out for allies at a time when many of its trading partners are wary of its increasing economic might. The accord, meant to eliminate most tariffs over the next few years, was signed by trade officials in Beijing during a state visit by Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir of Iceland. When completed, it will unite two hugely mismatched economies: Iceland's 2011 gross domestic product of $14 billion was little more than a rounding error in China's G.D.P. The agreement, which was hailed as a major breakthrough in Sino-Icelandic relations, is expected to boost bilateral trade between the two nations significantly. According to officials, the deal will eliminate tariffs on over 90% of goods traded between China and Iceland, making it easier for businesses to import and export goods.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a strategic move by China to expand its economic influence in Europe, particularly in the wake of the ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Iceland, which is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), is also expected to benefit from the deal, as it will gain access to a large and growing market in China.\n\nThe agreement is not without its challenges, however. Iceland's small economy and remote location make it vulnerable to fluctuations in global markets, and some experts have expressed concerns that the country may become overly dependent on Chinese trade. Additionally, there are concerns about the environmental and social impact of increased trade and investment between the two countries.\n\nDespite these challenges, the agreement is seen as a major success for China's trade diplomacy, which has been gaining momentum in recent years. The deal is the first free-trade agreement between China and a European country, and it is expected to pave the way for similar agreements with other European nations.\n\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Sigurdardottir praised the agreement, saying that it would bring significant benefits to Iceland's economy and people. \"This agreement is a major milestone in our relations with China, and we are confident that it will lead to increased trade and investment between our two countries,\" she said.\n\nThe agreement is expected to come into effect in 2023, pending ratification by the Icelandic parliament and the Chinese National People's Congress. In the meantime, trade officials from both countries will work to finalize the details of the agreement and implement it.\n\nThe signing of the agreement marks a significant milestone in the development of Sino-Icelandic relations, which have been growing closer in recent years. The two countries have been cooperating on a range of issues, including climate change, renewable energy, and tourism.\n\nThe agreement is also seen as a major boost for Iceland's economy, which has been struggling in recent years. The country's economy has been heavily dependent on fishing and tourism, and the agreement is expected to bring new opportunities for businesses and investors.\n\nOverall, the agreement between China and Iceland is a significant development in the global economy, and it is expected to have far-reaching implications for trade and investment between Europe and Asia.",

Directors were expected to meet this week to sign off on a plan to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. A final decision has been on the cards since October, when China's state nuclear firm CGN announced that it would take a 33.5% stake in the project during a visit to the UK by the premier, Xi Jinping. However, sources close to the project have revealed that EDF is still grappling with concerns over the project's financial viability, casting a shadow over the planned meeting this week.\n\nAccording to insiders, EDF is struggling to secure the necessary funding for the project, which has already been plagued by delays and cost overruns. The company had initially expected to break ground on the new reactors in 2020, but this timeline has been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the project's financing has raised concerns among investors and industry experts, who fear that the delays could have far-reaching consequences for the UK's energy sector.\n\n\"This is a critical project for the UK's energy security, and any further delays could have significant implications for the country's ability to meet its renewable energy targets,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading energy expert at the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe Hinkley Point C project was originally expected to be completed in the mid-2020s, with the two new reactors generating enough electricity to power over 6 million homes. However, the delays and cost overruns have pushed the project's completion date back to the late 2020s, with some estimates suggesting it may not be finished until the 2030s.\n\nEDF has declined to comment on the reports, but a spokesperson for the company did confirm that the project's directors would be meeting this week to discuss the project's progress.\n\nThe news comes as the UK government is under pressure to meet its ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy. The government has set a goal of generating 30% of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2030, but the delays to the Hinkley Point C project have raised concerns that this target may not be met.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"We are working closely with EDF and other stakeholders to ensure the successful delivery of the Hinkley Point C project. We are confident that the project will be completed on time and within budget, and that it will play a crucial role in the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the project's financing, the UK government remains committed to the Hinkley Point C project, which is seen as a key component of the country's nuclear energy strategy.\n\nHowever, the latest delays have raised questions about the government's ability to deliver its ambitious energy targets, and whether it will be able to secure the necessary funding for the project.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the future of the Hinkley Point C project hangs in the balance, and the UK's energy sector is holding its breath for a resolution.",

The job cements Mr. Murdoch, 46, as successor to his father, Rupert Murdoch, 87, who will take the title of co-chairman. The appointment marks the end of an era for the Murdoch family's media empire, which has been a dominant force in the global entertainment and news landscape for decades. Lachlan Murdoch's ascension to the top spot comes after a tumultuous period for the company, which has seen significant changes in the media landscape and a decline in its once-mighty television ratings.\n\nThe 46-year-old Murdoch, who has been serving as the company's CEO of the Fox Corporation, a spin-off of the 21st Century Fox assets, will now oversee the entire media conglomerate, which includes the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox News, and other assets. His father, Rupert Murdoch, will take on a more ceremonial role as co-chairman, a move that is seen as a sign of the company's transition to the next generation.\n\nThe appointment was widely expected, as Lachlan Murdoch has been groomed for the role for years.

DoorDash is buying Caviar from Square, the payments company, which has owned the service since 2014. Caviar operates in around 15 cities and primarily offers food from upscale restaurants in urban areas. The acquisition is expected to strengthen DoorDash's position in the competitive food delivery market, which has seen a surge in growth in recent years. With the addition of Caviar's expertise and network of upscale restaurants, DoorDash aims to expand its offerings and appeal to a more affluent customer base.\n\nCaviar's founder, Jason Wang, will join DoorDash as a vice president and general manager, overseeing the integration of the two companies. Wang expressed excitement about the deal, stating that it will allow Caviar to scale its operations and reach more customers. \"We're thrilled to join forces with DoorDash and leverage their expertise to take our business to the next level,\" Wang said.\n\nThe acquisition is also expected to benefit Square, which has been looking to divest itself of non-core assets. Square's CEO, Jack Dorsey, said in a statement that the sale of Caviar will allow the company to focus on its core payments business. \"We're proud of what the Caviar team has accomplished, and we're confident that DoorDash is the right partner to take the business forward,\" Dorsey said.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, pending regulatory approval.

In an era of stagnant incomes and rising tuition and student debt, the burden of college costs on families and former students is well documented. The survey, conducted by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), found that 34% of students reported that financial struggles affected their academic performance, with 31% saying they had to skip buying required textbooks, software, or other materials due to the high costs.\n\nThe results of the survey highlight the growing concern about the affordability of higher education in the United States. With tuition rates continuing to rise, many students are forced to take on significant debt to finance their education. According to the NASFAA, the average student debt for the class of 2019 was over $31,000.\n\nThe financial struggles faced by college students can have long-term consequences, including delayed graduation, reduced career opportunities, and increased stress levels. The survey found that 45% of students reported feeling stressed about their financial situation, with 21% saying they felt anxious or overwhelmed.\n\nThe NASFAA survey also found that financial struggles were more common among certain groups of students. For example, 43% of students from low-income families reported that financial struggles affected their academic performance, compared to 25% of students from higher-income families. Similarly, 36% of students who were the first in their family to attend college reported skipping required academic materials due to cost, compared to 23% of students whose parents had attended college.\n\nThe survey's findings have prompted calls for policymakers to address the affordability crisis in higher education. \"These results are a wake-up call for policymakers and educators to take action to make college more affordable and accessible,\" said Justin Draeger, president of NASFAA. \"We need to work together to find solutions that benefit students and families, not just the institutions and investors.\"\n\nSome potential solutions include increasing funding for need-based financial aid, implementing more affordable textbook options, and providing resources to help students manage their debt. The NASFAA survey also found that many students are unaware of the financial aid options available to them, highlighting the need for greater awareness and education about the financial aid process.\n\nAs the cost of higher education continues to rise, it is clear that something must be done to address the financial struggles faced by college students. The NASFAA survey is a stark reminder of the need for policymakers, educators, and institutions to work together to make college more affordable and accessible for all students.",

I believe that by doing this we can give our shares of the property to our daughters, but remain in it should either of us die. Title: Protecting Inheritance: The Benefits of Tenants in Common\n\nAs a married couple, John and Sarah have been considering ways to protect their children's inheritance. One option they are exploring is converting their joint tenancy to a tenancy in common. This move would allow them to divide their property shares among their daughters, while still retaining the right to occupy the property until their passing.\n\nUnder a joint tenancy, the property is automatically inherited by the surviving joint tenant(s) upon the death of one of the owners. This means that if one partner dies, the other partner would automatically inherit the entire property, regardless of what the deceased partner's will or estate plan may have specified. By converting to a tenancy in common, John and Sarah can avoid this automatic inheritance and instead leave their shares of the property to their daughters.\n\nThere are several benefits to converting to a tenancy in common. For one, it allows the couple to divide their property shares among multiple beneficiaries, rather than just one. This can be particularly useful for couples with multiple children, as it allows each child to inherit a portion of the property. Additionally, a tenancy in common can provide greater flexibility in terms of inheritance, as the couple can specify exactly how they want their property shares to be distributed upon their passing.\n\nAnother advantage of a tenancy in common is that it can help to avoid disputes between beneficiaries. When a property is inherited under a joint tenancy, the surviving joint tenant(s) may have significant control over the property, which can lead to disputes between the beneficiaries. By converting to a tenancy in common, John and Sarah can avoid this potential source of conflict and ensure that their daughters inherit their shares of the property in a peaceful and orderly manner.\n\nTo convert their joint tenancy to a tenancy in common, John and Sarah will need to execute a new deed that reflects their changed ownership status. This deed will need to be signed by both parties and recorded with the local government. It's also a good idea for the couple to consult with an attorney to ensure that their new deed complies with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, converting a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common can be a valuable way for couples to protect their children's inheritance and ensure that their property is distributed according to their wishes. By doing so, John and Sarah can provide for their daughters' financial security and peace of mind, while also avoiding potential disputes and complications that may arise from a joint tenancy.",

At the end of two days of talks among the Group of 7 finance ministers outside London, other nations appeared to accept -- at least for now -- Japan's explanation that its new monetary efforts were meant to stimulate its domestic economy, rather than to drive down the yen on international currency markets. Despite the apparent understanding, concerns over Japan's monetary policies remain high, and the Group of 7 (G7) finance ministers did not shy away from emphasizing the need for a more balanced approach to economic growth. The meeting, which brought together top economic officials from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, focused on addressing the ongoing challenges facing the global economy.\n\nAccording to sources close to the talks, the G7 finance ministers expressed their concerns over the potential consequences of Japan's monetary easing policies, which have led to a significant depreciation of the yen against other major currencies. While Japan's efforts are aimed at stimulating its domestic economy, the impact on international currency markets has raised concerns about currency wars and the potential for a global trade imbalance.\n\nIn a statement released after the meeting, the G7 finance ministers acknowledged the need for a coordinated approach to economic policy, emphasizing the importance of fiscal responsibility and sustainable growth. The statement also highlighted the need for countries to work together to address the root causes of economic inequality and to promote fair trade practices.\n\nGermany, in particular, was under pressure to take more decisive action to boost economic growth in Europe. The country's finance minister, Olaf Scholz, faced criticism from some of his G7 counterparts for not doing enough to support struggling European economies. However, Scholz maintained that Germany is committed to supporting its European partners and is working to address the root causes of the economic challenges facing the region.\n\nThe G7 finance ministers also discussed the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, and the need for continued cooperation to address the crisis. The meeting came as global economic growth is expected to slow in the coming months, with many experts warning of a potential recession.\n\nDespite the challenges, the G7 finance ministers expressed optimism about the prospects for the global economy, citing the resilience of the financial system and the ability of governments to work together to address economic challenges. The meeting concluded with a renewed commitment to cooperation and a pledge to continue working together to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth.",

The debate reunited Donald J. Trump and Megyn Kelly on the stage for the first time since August. The highly anticipated event sparked a flurry of attention, with many viewers eager to see how the real estate mogul and the Fox News anchor would interact after a tumultuous summer.\n\nThe debate, moderated by Kelly and Bret Baier, focused on a range of topics including the economy, healthcare, and national security. Trump, who has been a dominant force in the Republican primary, faced off against a group of eight other candidates vying for the party's nomination.\n\nThe debate was marked by several contentious moments, including a heated exchange between Trump and Florida Senator Marco Rubio over the issue of immigration. Trump accused Rubio of being soft on immigration, while Rubio countered that Trump's proposal to build a wall along the US-Mexico border was unrealistic.\n\nDespite the tensions, the debate also saw several moments of levity, including a humorous exchange between Trump and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina over their respective business backgrounds. Fiorina, who has been gaining momentum in the polls, landed several blows against Trump, including a sharp critique of his business dealings.\n\nThe debate was widely covered in the media, with many outlets praising Kelly for her tough questioning of the candidates. Trump, however, took to Twitter to criticize Kelly, claiming that she was \"unfair\" and \"biased\" in her questioning.\n\nThe debate is likely to have a significant impact on the Republican primary, with many voters still undecided about which candidate to support. The next debate is scheduled to take place in November, and is expected to be just as intense and highly anticipated.\n\nIn the aftermath of the debate, Trump's campaign announced that it had raised over $10 million in the 24 hours following the event. The campaign also released a statement praising Trump's performance, saying that he had \"dominated the debate\" and had shown himself to be the \"strongest candidate\" in the field.\n\nThe debate was not without controversy, however. Several candidates, including Rubio and Fiorina, criticized Trump's refusal to release his tax returns, which they claimed was evidence of his lack of transparency. Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, citing an ongoing audit.\n\nDespite the controversy, the debate was widely watched and is likely to have a significant impact on the Republican primary. As the campaign season heats up, voters will continue to be treated to a series of high-stakes debates and town halls, with the winner likely to be decided at the Republican National Convention in July.",

        "Text": "Another tranche of the state's share in Royal Bank of Scotland could be sold off as early as this week, with speculation mounting that the Treasury is to resume its privatisation imminently. About 10% of the bank could be sold to investors, which would raise about £3bn but still crystallise a substantial loss to taxpayers after the government was forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008. While the Treasury's long-term goal is to sell its 70.5% stake and return the bank to the private sector, the share price could yet defer a decision. The potential sale of the 10% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has sent shockwaves through the financial markets, with investors and analysts alike speculating about the timing and implications of the move.\n\nAccording to sources close to the Treasury, the decision to sell off a portion of the state's share in RBS is not yet final, but it is believed that the government is keen to capitalize on the bank's improved financial performance and rising share price. The sale would be the first major step towards the Treasury's long-term goal of selling off its entire 70.5% stake in the bank.\n\nRBS has made significant progress in recent years, having reported a pre-tax profit of £1.1 billion in 2022, compared to a loss of £7.1 billion in 2013. The bank's improved financial health has been driven by a combination of cost-cutting measures, asset sales, and a gradual recovery in the UK economy.\n\nHowever, the sale of the 10% stake is not without its risks. The bank's share price has been volatile in recent months, and some analysts believe that the sale could be delayed or even cancelled if the price falls below a certain level. Additionally, the sale could be seen as a sign of the government's willingness to abandon its support for the bank, which could have implications for the bank's future lending activities and the wider financial sector.\n\nThe sale of the 10% stake is expected to raise around £3 billion, which would be used to reduce the government's debt and help fund other public spending initiatives. However, the sale would also crystallize a substantial loss for taxpayers, who were forced to bail out RBS during the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nThe potential sale of RBS has sparked concerns among some politicians and industry experts, who believe that the government is prioritizing short-term financial gains over the long-term stability of the bank and the wider financial system. Others have argued that the sale is necessary to restore confidence in the bank and the financial sector, and to pave the way for its eventual return to the private sector.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the sale of the 10% stake in RBS is likely to be closely watched by investors and analysts, who will be looking for signs of the bank's financial health and the government's commitment to supporting the financial sector.",

That's because they're living in the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, where toxic leftovers from the manufacture of chemicals like DDT and the infamous Agent Orange oozed into surrounding waterways to be taken up by the animals that inhabited them. It's an evolutionary miracle some of these animals are even alive. The State of New Jersey's warning comes as a result of ongoing concerns about the environmental and health impacts of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which has been listed as one of the most contaminated sites in the country. The site, located in Bergen and Hudson counties, was once home to a chemical manufacturing plant that produced a range of toxic substances, including DDT, Agent Orange, and other pesticides and herbicides.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the site has been contaminated with a variety of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and pesticides. These pollutants have seeped into the surrounding soil and water, posing a significant risk to human health and the environment.\n\nThe fish and shellfish in the Lower Passaic River and Newark Bay have been found to contain high levels of these pollutants, making them unsafe for human consumption. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has issued a warning advising people not to eat any fish or shellfish caught in these areas, and has also established a program to monitor the water quality and test for pollutants.\n\nThe Diamond Alkali Superfund Site is just one of many contaminated sites in New Jersey, but it is one of the most significant due to its proximity to densely populated areas and its history of chemical manufacturing. The site has been the subject of ongoing cleanup efforts, but the process has been slow and contentious.\n\nIn recent years, local residents and community groups have expressed concerns about the health impacts of the site, citing high rates of cancer and other health problems in the area. The DEP has established a health registry to track the health effects of exposure to the site, but many residents feel that more needs to be done to address the issue.\n\nThe EPA has also been working to clean up the site, but the process has been slow and costly. In 2019, the agency announced plans to begin construction on a new cleanup project, which is expected to take several years to complete.\n\nIn the meantime, residents are advised to avoid eating fish and shellfish from the Lower Passaic River and Newark Bay, and to take steps to minimize their exposure to the site. The DEP has established a hotline for residents with questions or concerns about the site, and is providing information and resources to help people stay safe.\n\nThe Diamond Alkali Superfund Site is a complex and contentious issue, but one thing is clear: it is a priority for both the state and federal governments to clean up the site and protect the health and well-being of local residents.",

In November 2016, attackers obtained credentials to access Uber's cloud servers and downloaded 16 large files, including the records of 35 million users worldwide. The records included passengers' full names, phone numbers, email addresses, and the location where they had signed up. Drivers were also affected, with 3.7 million, including 82,000 from the UK, having their weekly pay, trip summaries and, in a small number of cases, driver's licence numbers accessed. The ICO said the breach was caused by inadequate information security, and was compounded by Uber US's decision to not disclose the attack, instead complying with the hackers' demands to pay $100,000 as a \"bug bounty\". The fine, which is the largest ever imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), is a result of Uber's failure to protect the personal data of its users and drivers. The ICO investigation found that Uber's inadequate security measures allowed the attackers to gain unauthorized access to its cloud servers, resulting in the theft of sensitive information.\n\n\"This was not only a serious breach of people's privacy, but it was also caused by Uber's failure to follow basic data security practices,\" said Elizabeth Denham, the UK's Information Commissioner. \"We took enforcement action because Uber failed to act quickly to inform those affected and failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the impact of the breach on the individuals affected.\"\n\nThe ICO's investigation also found that Uber US's decision to pay the hackers $100,000, rather than reporting the breach to the authorities, was a major factor in the fine. \"This was a deliberate attempt to cover up the breach, and it's unacceptable,\" said Denham.\n\nThe fine is a significant blow to Uber's reputation, which has already been tarnished by a series of scandals and controversies in recent years. The company has faced criticism over its handling of sexual harassment allegations, its treatment of drivers, and its use of fake riders to spy on its competitors.\n\nIn a statement, Uber said it takes the security and privacy of its users' data very seriously, and it is working to improve its security measures. \"We have taken concrete steps to improve the security of our systems, including implementing additional security measures and conducting regular security audits,\" said the company.\n\nThe fine is the latest in a series of penalties imposed on companies for data breaches. In recent years, the ICO has fined companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google for failing to protect their users' data.\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of companies taking robust measures to protect their users' data, and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the event of a breach. As the use of personal data becomes increasingly widespread, it is essential that companies take their responsibilities seriously and prioritize the privacy and security of their users' data.",

Relations between its workers' union, the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, and the paper's owner, Block Communications, have been tense. The appointment of Keith C.

The strikes occurred on 14 days and were spread across one month, causing large disruptions for students – some of whom called for compensation. The UCU claims that universities are using \"strong-arm tactics\" to intimidate students and undermine the strike action. According to the union, some universities have sent out emails and social media messages warning students not to join picket lines and encouraging them to report any lecturers who participate in the strike.

Compared with the previous year, the number of active subscribers was down 4.8% in the fourth quarter. According to Weight Watchers, that was \"an improvement from being down 12.7%\" in the third quarter compared to the year before. The number of members attending in-person meetings has dipped below one million. At the end of the fourth quarter, about 997,900 members attended meetings compared to 1.2 million in December 2013. Another 1.39 million people subscribed to Weight Watchers online program, down from 1.74 million in December 2013. Despite the decline in membership, Weight Watchers' revenue increased by 11% in the fourth quarter, reaching $323 million. The company attributed this growth to the success of its digital platform, which has seen a 25% increase in subscribers since Oprah Winfrey joined the company.\n\nWinfrey's involvement has been credited with revamping the company's marketing strategy, which has helped to attract a new generation of dieters.

The ambitious strategy emerged on Thursday in the last of a series of summer policy papers published by the Department for Exiting the European Union ahead of the next round of talks in Brussels on Monday. In it, the government argues that its \"unique\" status as a leading player in the world of electronic commerce means that it should be able to demand special treatment from the EU when agreeing future standards. According to the document, the UK is proposing a bespoke agreement that would allow it to maintain its current level of data sharing with the EU, while also ensuring that British businesses can continue to operate seamlessly across the continent. This approach is seen as a key component of the government's strategy to minimize disruptions to trade and commerce in the wake of Brexit.\n\nThe paper emphasizes that the UK's status as a global leader in the digital economy, with a thriving tech sector and a strong reputation for data protection, means that it should be able to negotiate a unique arrangement with the EU. This would enable British companies to continue to share data with their EU counterparts, while also allowing the UK to maintain its own data protection standards.\n\nThe government is also seeking to establish a new framework for data sharing that would be based on a combination of EU and UK data protection laws. This would involve the creation of a new data protection agency in the UK, which would be responsible for ensuring that British businesses comply with EU data protection standards.\n\nThe proposal has been welcomed by some in the business community, who see it as a pragmatic solution to the challenges posed by Brexit. \"This is a common-sense approach that recognizes the UK's unique position in the global digital economy,\" said a spokesperson for the Confederation of British Industry. \"By negotiating a bespoke agreement with the EU, we can ensure that British businesses continue to thrive and compete on the global stage.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the proposal goes far enough. Some critics argue that the UK's data protection laws are not strong enough to protect the rights of EU citizens, and that the government's proposal does not do enough to address these concerns.\n\n\"The UK's data protection laws are not fit for purpose, and the government's proposal does not do enough to address the concerns of EU citizens,\" said a spokesperson for Privacy International. \"We need to see more robust protections for individuals' data rights, and a clearer commitment to upholding EU data protection standards.\"\n\nThe next round of talks between the UK and EU is set to take place on Monday, and it remains to be seen whether the government's proposal will be accepted by the EU. However, one thing is clear: the fate of data sharing between the UK and EU will have significant implications for businesses and individuals on both sides of the Channel.",

The sudden departure of Terry Burns, the outgoing chairman of the channel, has left many wondering about the future of the organization. Burns, a stalwart defender of the channel's independence, had been a vocal critic of privatization. His departure has sparked concerns that the channel may be on the verge of falling into private hands.\n\nCharles Gurassa, the new chairman, has a reputation for being a shrewd businessman with a background in aviation. As deputy chairman of easyJet, he has been instrumental in the airline's growth and expansion. However, his appointment to the channel has raised eyebrows among some critics who worry that his lack of experience in the media industry may put the channel's editorial independence at risk.\n\nGurassa's appointment comes at a time when the channel is facing significant challenges. The organization has been struggling to stay afloat amidst declining advertising revenue and increased competition from online media outlets. The UK government's decision to decline Burns' request for an extension of his tenure has been seen by many as a clear indication that privatization is on the cards.\n\nThe channel's employees are said to be worried about the impact of privatization on their jobs and the future of the organization.

An elite who stick together, 30 January). Deborah Orr's column in Saturday's Guardian sparked a heated debate about the effectiveness of criticizing the wealthy and privileged in society. In her article, Orr argued that by constantly demonizing the elite, we are inadvertently creating a sense of solidarity among them, leading to a more entrenched and isolated elite.\n\nOrr's argument is that by focusing solely on the perceived injustices and inequalities within the wealthy elite, we are neglecting the broader social and economic issues that affect the majority of the population. She suggests that this approach can actually reinforce the existing social hierarchies, rather than challenging them.\n\nThis perspective is supported by research in social psychology, which has shown that when people are faced with criticism or ridicule, they often respond by becoming more defensive and isolated. This can lead to a sense of group cohesion and loyalty among the targeted group, as they rally together to defend themselves against perceived attacks.\n\nMoreover, Orr argues that by constantly emphasizing the differences between the rich and the poor, we are perpetuating a narrative that reinforces class divisions and social segregation. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy between different social classes, making it more difficult to address the underlying issues that contribute to inequality.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with Orr's assessment. Some argue that criticizing the wealthy and privileged is a necessary step in highlighting the injustices and inequalities that exist in society. They argue that by shining a light on the excesses and inequalities of the elite, we can create a sense of moral outrage and pressure for change.\n\nThis debate highlights the complex and nuanced nature of social and economic issues. While it is important to acknowledge the challenges and inequalities faced by the majority of the population, it is also important to recognize the potential unintended consequences of our actions. By engaging in a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion about these issues, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.",

Last year Norman warned that M&S had been \"drifting\" for more than 15 years and pledged to lead a radical shake-up of the business alongside the chief executive, Steve Rowe. Machin's appointment as the new boss of Marks & Spencer's food halls marks a significant shift in the company's strategy, as it looks to regain its position as a leading player in the UK grocery market.

The ride-hailing service, said on Friday that its gross bookings -- or the amount of money it garnered from providing rides, excluding costs -- rose to $20 billion in 2016, double the amount in 2015. This significant growth is a testament to the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and expand its services to meet the evolving needs of its customers. Uber's gross bookings have been driven by the continued popularity of its ride-hailing service, as well as the success of its food delivery platform, UberEats.\n\nThe company's revenue growth has also been fueled by its expansion into new markets and the increasing adoption of its services by a wider range of consumers. Uber has been aggressively expanding its operations into new cities and countries, and its services are now available in over 600 cities worldwide.\n\nIn addition to its revenue growth, Uber has also made significant progress in reducing its losses. The company reported a net loss of $2.8 billion in 2016, down from $3.3 billion in 2015. This reduction in losses is a significant achievement for the company, and it demonstrates its ability to manage its costs and improve its financial performance.\n\nUber's financial performance has been driven by a number of factors, including its ability to increase its prices, improve its operational efficiency, and reduce its costs.

Sharif, a prominent figure in Bahrain's opposition movement, has been a vocal critic of the government's human rights record and has called for greater democratic reforms.\n\nThe arrest has sparked widespread condemnation from human rights groups and opposition parties, who have called for Sharif's immediate release. \"This is a clear attempt to silence Ebrahim Sharif and the opposition movement as a whole,\" said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. \"The Bahraini authorities are using these trumped-up charges to stifle dissent and maintain their grip on power.\"\n\nSharif's arrest comes just days after Prince Charles's visit to Bahrain, during which he met with the country's ruler, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. Human rights groups had called on Prince Charles to raise concerns about Bahrain's human rights record during his visit, but the royal family's official statement made no mention of the issue.\n\nThe Bahraini government has been accused of using Prince Charles's visit to distract from its human rights abuses and to present a more positive image of the country. \"The Bahraini authorities are trying to use Prince Charles's visit to whitewash their human rights record and to show that everything is okay,\" said Alwadaei. \"But the reality is that the country is still plagued by political repression, torture, and arbitrary detention.\"\n\nSharif's arrest has also sparked concerns about the safety of other opposition figures in Bahrain.

Asda's sales slid by 5.9% – its worst performance on record and the biggest slump in the market. Tesco was the best of the major chains, with sales down 1.3% according to analysis from Kantar Worldpanel published on Tuesday. That compares with falls of 5.1% and 1% revealed last month. In contrast, discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to see double-digit growth, with sales up 11.5% and 13.8% respectively, taking their combined market share to a new high of 10.5%.

The bids, received by last Thursday's deadline, came from so many places across the continent that it's perhaps simpler to note the ones that didn't fall over themselves to woo Amazon. The company did not provide a list, but a color-coded map posted on its website revealed the applicants came from all but seven American states -- North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Arkansas and Hawaii. Amazon's Second Headquarters Bid Process: A Look at the Contenders\n\nThe 238 proposals received by Amazon from cities and regions across North America have sparked a frenzy of excitement and anticipation. The e-commerce giant's decision to build its second headquarters has set off a competition among municipalities, each vying for the chance to host the company's new campus.\n\nThe bids, which were received by last Thursday's deadline, came from a diverse range of locations, including major metropolitan areas, small towns, and even entire states. The proposals were submitted in the form of detailed plans outlining the benefits and incentives each location could offer Amazon.\n\nThe map posted on Amazon's website provides a visual representation of the applicants, with a striking lack of bids from just seven American states. North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Vermont, Arkansas, and Hawaii are the only states that did not submit a proposal.\n\nWhile Amazon has not released the list of applicants, it's clear that many cities and regions are eager to attract the company's second headquarters. The bid process has been a closely guarded secret, with Amazon's officials reviewing the proposals behind closed doors.\n\nSo, what makes a city or region an attractive location for Amazon's second headquarters? The company has outlined several key criteria, including a strong and diverse workforce, access to transportation and logistics, and a business-friendly environment.\n\nSome of the most notable bidders include:\n\n* New York City, which has offered a package of incentives worth up to $1.5 billion, including a tax break and a redeveloped waterfront area.\n* Los Angeles, which has proposed a 20-year tax abatement and a 10-year property tax exemption.\n* Chicago, which has offered a 10-year property tax break and a 10-year sales tax exemption.\n\nThe list of bidders also includes several smaller cities and towns, such as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Boise, Idaho. These locations are hoping to capitalize on their proximity to major universities and research institutions, as well as their lower costs of living and doing business.\n\nThe next step in the process will be for Amazon's officials to review the proposals and select the top contenders. The company has said it expects to announce its decision by the end of the year.\n\nAs the competition heats up, one thing is clear: Amazon's second headquarters will be a major economic driver for the winning city or region. The company's presence will bring new jobs, new investment, and new opportunities for growth and development.\n\nIn the end, it's a win-win situation for both Amazon and the city or region that is chosen.

Every year, millions of individuals and households move up or down the income scale depending on their earnings, investments and age. Fortunes wax and wane as new tech gurus graduate from college and top lawyers head into retirement. Still, economists said that people holding considerable capital -- de facto, the already rich -- have done well during the recovery. Moreover, the 1 percent tends to be sticky, and perhaps even more so in bad times than in good times, Mr. Saez said. One study by the Treasury economists Gerald Auten, Geoffrey Gee and Nicholas Turner found that a quarter to a third of 1 percenters in a given year stayed in the 1 percent for all of the following five. According to the study, the 1 percenters who remained in the top 1 percent for the entire five-year period were more likely to have higher levels of education, be self-employed, and have a higher proportion of their income come from investments. This suggests that those who are already wealthy are more likely to maintain their status due to their ability to accumulate and manage their wealth over time.\n\nIn contrast, those who are struggling to make ends meet are more likely to experience fluctuations in their income and wealth, making it more challenging for them to break into the top 1 percent. This is because they may be more susceptible to economic downturns, job losses, and other financial shocks that can quickly erode their savings and push them back down the income scale.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for policymakers and economists who are seeking to understand the dynamics of wealth inequality in the United States. It highlights the need for targeted policies aimed at promoting economic mobility and reducing the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nFor instance, policymakers could consider implementing policies that support education and training programs for low-income individuals, as well as initiatives that promote entrepreneurship and small business development. Additionally, they could explore ways to increase access to affordable healthcare, housing, and other essential services that can help alleviate financial burdens and promote economic stability.\n\nFurthermore, the study's results underscore the importance of addressing the issue of wealth concentration in the United States. With the top 1 percent holding an increasingly large share of the country's wealth, it is essential to develop policies that promote more equitable distribution of wealth and income.\n\nUltimately, the study's findings serve as a reminder of the complex and multifaceted nature of wealth inequality in the United States. By better understanding the dynamics of wealth concentration and mobility, policymakers and economists can work towards developing more effective solutions to address this pressing issue and promote a more equitable society for all.",

However, a more worrying point, which he might have addressed, is the way in which – no doubt due to the same processes that lead to the introduction of such terms – single words or phrases come to dominate language, killing off any opposition, and ultimately impoverishing it; to the extent that, for instance, many people nowadays seem to have only a single superlative at their disposal, resulting in such things as a poster that hangs in my GP's surgery, asking: \"Have you had great care today?\" Jim Grozier Brighton, East Sussex • Anyone who feels upset by the overuse of \"like\" might turn to the American poet AE Stallings, who takes it for the title of her 2018 collection. The proliferation of colloquialisms and slang in modern language is a phenomenon that has been observed and debated by linguists and language enthusiasts alike. While some argue that the evolution of language is a natural and necessary process, others lament the loss of precision and nuance that can result from the widespread adoption of informal language.\n\nIn the case of \"I was like...\", it is true that the phrase has become a staple of contemporary language, particularly among younger generations. However, as Shariatmadari notes, resistance to such neologisms is often futile, as language is constantly adapting to the needs and preferences of its users.\n\nBut the issue goes beyond simply the use of a particular phrase or word. The dominance of single words or phrases can have a profound impact on the way we communicate, ultimately leading to a homogenization of language that can be detrimental to its richness and diversity.\n\nThe example cited by Jim Grozier, the poster in his GP's surgery asking \"Have you had great care today?\", is a telling one. The use of the superlative \"great\" in this context is a perfect illustration of how language can become impoverished when we rely too heavily on a single word or phrase. The subtleties and nuances of language are lost when we are unable to convey complex emotions and ideas through a range of vocabulary and expression.\n\nFurthermore, the dominance of certain words or phrases can also have a profound impact on the way we think and express ourselves. When we rely too heavily on a single way of communicating, we can become trapped in a particular mindset or perspective, limiting our ability to explore new ideas and perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, while the evolution of language is a natural and necessary process, it is essential that we remain vigilant and aware of the impact that the dominance of certain words or phrases can have on the way we communicate and think. By embracing the diversity and complexity of language, we can ensure that our communication remains rich, nuanced, and expressive, and that our language continues to evolve in a way that is both natural and enriching.",

According to Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, the country's monetary policy is designed to stimulate economic growth and inflation, rather than to manipulate the value of the yen. He emphasized that the central bank's actions are aimed at achieving a sustainable economic recovery, rather than to gain a competitive advantage over other countries.\n\nThe comments came as Japan's economy contracted by 0.4% in the fourth quarter, defying expectations of a small growth. The contraction was largely attributed to a decline in exports, which was exacerbated by the ongoing trade tensions between Japan and its major trading partners.\n\nDespite the disappointing economic data, Kuroda remained optimistic about the country's prospects, citing the central bank's ability to implement effective monetary policy. \"We are committed to using all available tools to achieve our inflation target and promote sustainable economic growth,\" he said.\n\nThe Bank of Japan has been implementing an aggressive monetary policy in recent years, including negative interest rates and massive asset purchases. The central bank has also been experimenting with unconventional measures, such as yield curve control, to stimulate the economy.\n\nKuroda's comments were seen as a response to criticism from some quarters that Japan's monetary policy is designed to weaken the yen and boost exports. However, the central bank governor insisted that the bank's actions are aimed at achieving a sustainable economic recovery, rather than to manipulate the currency.\n\nThe Japanese government has also been implementing fiscal stimulus measures to boost the economy. In January, the government announced a package of measures worth around $120 billion, including increased spending on infrastructure and social welfare programs.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the Japanese economy, Kuroda remains confident that the country can achieve its economic goals. \"We are committed to achieving our inflation target and promoting sustainable economic growth,\" he said. \"We will continue to use all available tools to achieve this goal.\"\n\nThe Bank of Japan's next policy meeting is scheduled for March, and market analysts are expecting the central bank to maintain its current monetary policy stance. However, some analysts are predicting that the bank may consider further easing measures if the economy continues to struggle.\n\nIn the meantime, the Japanese government is expected to continue implementing its fiscal stimulus measures to support the economy.

        "Text": "BP has agreed to buy US shale oil and gasfields from the Anglo-Australian miner BHP for $10.5bn (£8bn), in the UK firm's biggest acquisition in nearly two decades. Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, lauded the deal as transformational and industry watchers said the move significantly beefed up the company's US shale presence, which was small compared to peers. The acquisition will boost BP's US oil and gas production by nearly a fifth and marks a new period of growth for the company, which is emerging after years under the $65bn burden of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. The deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2023, will see BP acquire BHP's shale oil and gas assets in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, and the Haynesville Shale, among others. The acquisition is expected to add around 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to BP's production, making it one of the largest transactions in the US shale industry in recent years.\n\nIndustry analysts say the deal is a significant coup for BP, which has been looking to expand its presence in the US shale market for some time. \"This acquisition is a major win for BP,\" said Neil Beveridge, an energy analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \"It gives them a much stronger foothold in the US shale market and positions them well for future growth.\"\n\nThe acquisition is also seen as a strategic move by BP to diversify its energy mix and reduce its reliance on declining oil fields. The company has been shifting its focus towards lower-carbon energy sources, such as natural gas and renewable energy, and the US shale assets will help it achieve this goal.\n\nThe deal is also expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the regions where the assets are located. \"This acquisition will create new opportunities for jobs and economic growth in the communities where we operate,\" said Dudley. \"We are committed to being a responsible and sustainable energy company and this deal is a key part of that.\"\n\nThe acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of 2023. Once completed, the deal will be one of the largest in BP's history, and marks a significant turning point for the company as it looks to the future.\n\nIn a statement, BHP said it was pleased to have reached an agreement with BP and looked forward to working with the company to ensure a smooth transition. \"This transaction is a great outcome for BHP and its shareholders,\" said BHP's CEO, Mike Henry. \"It allows us to focus on our core copper and iron ore business and continue to deliver value to our shareholders.\"\n\nThe deal is the latest in a series of significant transactions in the US shale industry in recent years. Last year, ExxonMobil acquired a stake in the Permian Basin from Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft, while Chevron acquired a stake in the Eagle Ford Shale from Occidental Petroleum.",

Their population decimated by poaching and habitat destruction, only about 4,000 of the endangered cats remain in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Conflicts with mountain farmers and pastoral herders also contribute to their dwindling numbers. Conservation Efforts Take a Unique Turn\n\nTo combat the decline of snow leopards, conservationists are turning to an unlikely ally: the cat's own waste. The feces of snow leopards, also known as scat, holds valuable information about the species' diet, habitat, and behavior. By analyzing the scat, researchers can gain insights into the cats' ecological role and identify areas where conservation efforts can be most effective.\n\nThe Himalayan Snow Leopard Conservation Program, a joint initiative between the World Wildlife Fund and the Government of Nepal, is at the forefront of this innovative approach. The program's researchers collect scat samples from the wild and transport them to a laboratory in Kathmandu for analysis.\n\n\"Scat analysis is a game-changer for snow leopard conservation,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading researcher on the project. \"It allows us to understand the cat's diet and habitat preferences, which informs our conservation strategies. For example, if we find that the snow leopards are primarily feeding on a certain species of rodent, we can target conservation efforts to protect that species and its habitat.\"\n\nThe program's findings have already led to significant changes in conservation policies. For instance, the Nepalese government has established protected areas and corridors to connect fragmented habitats, allowing snow leopards to roam freely and safely. The program has also worked with local communities to develop sustainable livelihoods, such as ecotourism and sustainable agriculture, which reduce the conflict between humans and snow leopards.\n\nHowever, despite these successes, the challenges facing snow leopard conservation remain significant. Habitat destruction and fragmentation continue to be major threats, as do conflicts with local communities. The program is working to address these issues through a combination of education, outreach, and community engagement.\n\n\"We recognize that snow leopard conservation is not just about protecting the cat itself, but also about the communities that live alongside them,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"We're working to build trust and partnerships with local communities, and to develop solutions that benefit both humans and snow leopards.\"\n\nAs the Himalayan Snow Leopard Conservation Program continues to make strides in the field, the path to snow leopard conservation is indeed paved in feces – but it's a crucial step towards ensuring the long-term survival of this majestic species.",

The 'big four' accountant said 24 of 80 new partners in its UK business, which includes offices in Switzerland, are female. The figure means that 30% of the prized positions went to women, up on last year's 29% and just 20% in 2014. The significant increase in female partners is a testament to Deloitte's ongoing efforts to promote diversity and inclusion within its ranks. The firm has made a concerted effort to address the gender imbalance at the senior level, introducing initiatives such as flexible working arrangements and mentorship programs to support the career advancement of women.\n\nDeloitte's UK CEO, Ian Stewart, hailed the results as a \"major milestone\" and attributed the progress to the firm's commitment to creating a more inclusive culture. \"We are proud of the progress we have made, but we know there is still more work to be done,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement comes as the accountancy industry faces increasing scrutiny over its lack of diversity. A report by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) found that women make up just 23% of partners in the top 100 UK accountancy firms, with men holding 77% of the positions.\n\nDeloitte's figures are a significant departure from this industry average, and the firm's efforts to increase diversity are being closely watched by its peers. \"Deloitte's commitment to diversity and inclusion is an inspiration to the rest of the industry,\" said Emma Chamberlain, a partner at rival firm KPMG. \"We are working towards similar goals and hope to see similar progress in the coming years.\"\n\nDespite the progress, Deloitte still has a significant gender imbalance at the senior level. The firm's latest diversity and inclusion report showed that just 16% of its UK senior managers are women, while 84% are men. However, the firm is working to address this imbalance through targeted initiatives, including training programs and flexible working arrangements.\n\nThe announcement of the new partners is also seen as a boost to Deloitte's reputation as a employer of choice for women. The firm has been recognized as one of the top 10 companies for women in the UK by the charity, Women in Business. \"Deloitte's commitment to diversity and inclusion is evident in its approach to talent development and retention,\" said the charity's CEO, Fiona Hathorn. \"The firm is a great example of how companies can create a culture that supports the career advancement of women.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Deloitte's announcement of its highest-ever proportion of female partners is a significant step forward for the accountancy firm and the industry as a whole. While there is still work to be done to address the gender imbalance at the senior level, the firm's commitment to diversity and inclusion is an inspiration to its peers and a testament to its dedication to creating a more inclusive culture.",

If you are Amazon, you use your hometown as a living lab.\n\nSeattle, the birthplace of Amazon, has long been the company's testing ground for innovative ideas and technologies. From drone delivery to cashierless convenience stores, the city has seen it all. And now, Amazon is taking its experimentation to the next level with the launch of its latest project: a smart neighborhood.\n\nLocated in the heart of Seattle, the smart neighborhood is a 38-acre community that will serve as a real-world laboratory for Amazon's latest technologies. The project, which is still in its early stages, aims to bring together Amazon's various businesses and services under one roof, creating a seamless and connected experience for residents.\n\nAt the heart of the smart neighborhood is Amazon's latest innovation: a smart home system that uses artificial intelligence to learn and adapt to the needs of its residents. The system, which is powered by Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, will be integrated into every home in the neighborhood, allowing residents to control everything from the lights and thermostat to the security cameras and door locks with just their voice.\n\nBut the smart neighborhood is more than just a showcase for Amazon's latest gadgets. It's also a test bed for the company's broader vision for the future of urban living. With its focus on sustainability, energy efficiency, and community engagement, the project is designed to create a model for urban development that is both environmentally friendly and economically viable.\n\nSo, how does it work? The smart neighborhood is designed to be a self-sustaining community, with its own energy grid, water management system, and waste reduction program. The homes themselves are designed to be energy-efficient, with solar panels and green roofs that help to reduce the neighborhood's carbon footprint.\n\nBut the real magic happens when you bring all of these technologies together. With Amazon's smart home system and its Alexa voice assistant, residents can control their homes and their community with ease. They can use their voice to turn on the lights, adjust the thermostat, and even order groceries and takeout from local businesses.\n\nAnd that's not all. The smart neighborhood is also designed to be a hub for local businesses and entrepreneurs, with co-working spaces, incubators, and accelerators that will help to foster innovation and job creation. The neighborhood will also feature a range of public spaces, including parks, plazas, and community centers, that will provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for residents and visitors alike.\n\nAmazon's smart neighborhood is just the latest example of the company's commitment to innovation and experimentation. By using its hometown as a living lab, Amazon is able to test and refine its latest technologies in a real-world setting, creating a better experience for its customers and driving growth and innovation in the process.\n\nAs the project continues to take shape, it's clear that Amazon's smart neighborhood is more than just a test bed for new technologies – it's a vision for the future of urban living. And with its focus on sustainability, community engagement, and innovation, it's a model that could be replicated in cities around the world.",

The Commons work and pensions select committee, which is already investigating the £571m deficit at BHS scheme, said on Friday night it would launch a wide ranging inquiry into the problem, probably starting in the autumn. Workers' occupational pensions have been forced centre stage in recent months by BHS's collapse and by Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. Almost 13,000 current and former BHS employees who were under retirement age when the company went into administration in March may face a 10% cut to their pensions as a result. The inquiry comes as concerns grow about the financial health of many occupational pension schemes, which are funded by employers and provide a guaranteed income to employees in retirement. According to the Pensions Regulator, there are over 5,000 occupational pension schemes in the UK, with a combined deficit of around £100 billion.\n\nThe committee's chair, Frank Field, said the inquiry would examine the reasons behind the growing number of schemes at risk of failing, and what can be done to prevent further collapses. \"We need to get to the bottom of why so many occupational pension schemes are struggling, and what can be done to protect the interests of workers who have been promised a certain level of income in retirement,\" Field said.\n\nThe committee will also investigate the role of pension fund managers and trustees in managing schemes, as well as the impact of changes to the pension landscape, such as the introduction of auto-enrolment and the increase in the state pension age.\n\nThe inquiry is expected to hear evidence from a range of stakeholders, including pension fund managers, trustees, and industry experts. The committee will also examine the experiences of workers who have been affected by pension scheme failures, and the support available to them.\n\nThe news of the inquiry comes as workers at British Steel are facing uncertainty over the future of their pension scheme. The £15 billion fund, which is one of the largest in the UK, is under review as part of Tata Steel's potential sale of its UK business. The fund is currently facing a deficit of around £1 billion, and workers are concerned about the potential impact on their retirement plans.\n\nThe situation is also being closely watched by employees of other companies that have been sold or are facing financial difficulties. The collapse of BHS has left thousands of workers facing a reduction in their pension benefits, and there are fears that other schemes could follow suit if they are not properly funded.\n\nThe inquiry is expected to provide much-needed clarity and guidance for workers and employers, and to help prevent further pension scheme failures. As the committee begins its investigation, it is clear that the future of occupational pensions in the UK is at a critical juncture, and that action is needed to protect the interests of workers and ensure that they receive the retirement income they have been promised.",

Underlying profits fell 46% from £9.2m 12 months ago to £5m in the six months to the end of July – excluding interest payments, tax, write downs on the value of property, and a one-off fall in income of nearly £4m related to a new credit card agreement. Profits were hit by the increased cost of delivering goods ordered online and a decline in sales of House of Fraser's own brands. The struggling department store chain, House of Fraser, has reported a significant decline in profits, citing the challenging retail environment as the primary reason. The company's underlying profits fell by 46% to £5 million in the first half of the year, compared to £9.2 million in the same period last year.\n\nThe decline in profits is attributed to several factors, including the increased cost of delivering goods ordered online and a decline in sales of House of Fraser's own brands.

Most meat processing plants have labour shortages equivalent to up to 15% of their required workforces, as the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 referendum has combined with uncertainty about residential status, according to the Grocer trade journal. The shortage of skilled labor in the meat industry is expected to have a significant impact on the availability of festive food staples, just as the holiday season is getting underway. The National Pig Association (NPA) has warned that some specialist processing plants are already struggling to meet orders, citing labor shortages as the main reason.\n\nAccording to the NPA, most meat processing plants are facing labor shortages equivalent to up to 15% of their required workforces. This is due to a combination of factors, including the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 referendum, which has made it more difficult for meat processing companies to attract and retain foreign workers. Additionally, uncertainty about residential status has also contributed to the labor shortage, as some workers are hesitant to commit to long-term contracts due to concerns about their ability to stay in the country.\n\nThe impact of the labor shortage is expected to be felt particularly in the production of hand-finished products, such as pigs in blankets, glazed hams, and three-bird roasts. These products require a high level of skill and attention to detail, making them particularly vulnerable to labor shortages.\n\nThe situation is expected to worsen in the coming weeks, as the demand for festive food staples increases. Meat processing companies are already warning of potential shortages and are urging consumers to stock up early to avoid disappointment.\n\nIn response to the labor shortage, some meat processing companies are turning to automation to fill the gap. However, this is not a solution that can be implemented overnight, and it is likely to take several months for new machinery to be installed and for workers to be trained to operate it.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are being advised to be patient and to plan ahead for their festive meals.

That may be true in the US but here it's much more often associated with the great Ken Morse, whose skill with the rostrum camera was such that he's said to be the world's most widely credited cameraman. However, Ken Burns' latest documentary series, \"The Vietnam War,\" is a masterclass in storytelling that transcends the technical skills of its cinematographer. The 18-hour series, co-directed with Lynn Novick, is a sweeping narrative that delves deep into the complexities of the Vietnam War, exploring its causes, consequences, and human cost.\n\nThe documentary is based on the book \"The Vietnam War: An Intimate History\" by Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns, which draws on hundreds of interviews with Americans who lived through the war, including soldiers, activists, and politicians. The series features stunning archival footage, much of which has never been seen before, as well as powerful oral histories that bring the war to life.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the documentary is its ability to balance the perspectives of both the American and Vietnamese sides of the conflict. Burns and Novick do not shy away from the brutal realities of war, but they also humanize the individuals caught up in it, from the soldiers fighting on the front lines to the civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe documentary is also notable for its nuanced exploration of the war's causes and consequences. Burns and Novick do not present a simplistic or black-and-white view of the war, but rather a complex and multifaceted one that acknowledges the role of imperialism, nationalism, and ideology in shaping the conflict.\n\nThroughout the series, Burns' distinctive narration is a constant presence, weaving together the various threads of the narrative with his trademark eloquence and passion. The documentary is a testament to his skill as a storyteller, as well as his deep understanding of the human experience.\n\n\"The Vietnam War\" is a must-see for anyone interested in history, politics, or human conflict. It is a powerful and moving tribute to the men and women who lived through the war, and a timely reminder of the enduring relevance of the conflict to our world today.",

The BBC lost 62% of its staff when it moved departments to MediaCity: that was twice as much per person on redundancy (£48,000) as on relocation (£27,000). The High Cost of Relocation: A Reality Check for TV Networks\n\nMoving out of London to other parts of the country, as several TV networks have done in recent years, comes with a hefty price tag. The BBC's relocation of its departments to MediaCity in Salford, followed by Channel 4's planned move to Birmingham, has raised concerns about the financial burden on employees.\n\nAccording to Enders Analysis, the BBC suffered a significant loss of staff when it made the move to MediaCity. A staggering 62% of its employees left the organization, with the majority opting for redundancy packages. The analysis revealed that the BBC paid out an average of £48,000 in redundancy payments per person, which is more than double the £27,000 it spent on relocation costs for those who chose to move.\n\nThe BBC's experience is not unique, as other TV networks have also faced similar challenges when relocating to new bases. Channel 4, for instance, is planning to move its headquarters from London to Birmingham in 2023, a decision that has sparked concerns about the impact on its staff.\n\nThe relocation process can be a daunting experience for employees, particularly those who have spent years building their careers in a specific location. The stress of uprooting their families, finding new housing, and adjusting to a new environment can be overwhelming. Furthermore, the cost of relocation can be a significant burden, especially for those who are not entitled to relocation packages or have limited financial resources.\n\nIn response to the challenges posed by relocation, TV networks are adopting various strategies to support their employees. The BBC, for example, has established a dedicated relocation team to assist employees with the transition process. The team provides guidance on everything from finding new housing to registering with local schools.\n\nWhile the cost of relocation is a significant concern, it is not the only factor that TV networks must consider when making decisions about their future locations. The move to new bases can also bring numerous benefits, including access to a wider talent pool, reduced costs, and improved working conditions.\n\nAs the TV industry continues to evolve, it is likely that relocation will remain a key part of the landscape. By acknowledging the challenges and costs associated with relocation, TV networks can better support their employees and ensure a smoother transition to new locations. Ultimately, the success of these moves will depend on the ability of TV networks to balance the needs of their employees with the demands of their businesses.",

The failed takeover bid between Bpost and PostNL has sent shockwaves throughout the postal industry, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for consolidation in the sector. While the talks between the two companies ultimately fell through, the fact that they were even considered has sparked renewed interest in the potential for mergers and acquisitions within the industry.\n\nRoyal Mail, which was previously linked with PostNL in December, has seen its shares rise 7p to 539.5p in a downbeat market. This surge in value has led many to speculate about the company's potential future moves, with some analysts suggesting that it could be a prime target for takeover.\n\nIn a statement, Royal Mail said that it would continue to focus on its core business of providing postal services to the UK, but did not rule out the possibility of future partnerships or acquisitions.

One thing is certain, however: the failed takeover bid between Bpost and PostNL has sent a clear message that the industry is ripe for change.",

        "Text": "Davidson College students don't take dirty clothes home to Mom. Why would they? ...Why would they? For the past year, Davidson College has been piloting a unique laundry initiative that has been gaining traction among its student body. The program, called \"Wash & Wear,\" offers students a convenient and sustainable way to do their laundry on campus, eliminating the need to transport dirty clothes back home.\n\nThe idea behind Wash & Wear was born out of a student-led sustainability initiative, which aimed to reduce the college's environmental footprint. According to the college's sustainability director, Emily Johnson, \"We realized that doing laundry was a significant contributor to waste and energy consumption. By bringing the laundry facility on campus, we can reduce the number of trips students take to off-campus laundromats and minimize the use of single-use detergent packets.\"\n\nThe program has been a huge success, with over 75% of students participating in the pilot program. The laundry facility, located in the heart of campus, offers a state-of-the-art washing and drying system, as well as eco-friendly detergent options. Students can purchase a laundry card, which can be reloaded with funds, and use the machines at their convenience.\n\nBut Wash & Wear is not just about convenience and sustainability – it's also about community building. The laundry facility has become a hub of social activity, with students often gathering to study, chat, or simply relax while waiting for their laundry to finish. \"It's amazing to see students from different majors and backgrounds coming together over a load of laundry,\" said sophomore Rachel Lee, who has been a regular at the facility. \"It's a great way to break the ice and make new friends.\"\n\nThe college plans to expand the program to include additional amenities, such as dry cleaning services and a clothing repair station. \"We're excited to see where this initiative takes us,\" said Johnson. \"Our goal is to create a campus culture that values sustainability and community, and Wash & Wear is just one way we're working towards that goal.\"\n\nAs the semester comes to a close, Davidson College students will have to say goodbye to their beloved laundry facility – but not before it's expanded and improved. With Wash & Wear, the college has proven that even the most mundane tasks can be transformed into opportunities for connection and sustainability.",

        "Text": "Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it's up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday's paper. We've got lots of old sash windows in our house, which we are replacing slowly and at great cost. A common conundrum for many homeowners! Replacing old sash windows can be a costly and time-consuming process, but it's often necessary to improve energy efficiency and reduce maintenance. Our reader is likely wondering if there are any more affordable options or ways to make the process more manageable.\n\nOne option to consider is to replace the sash windows with modern, energy-efficient alternatives that mimic the traditional look of the originals. This can be a cost-effective way to update the windows without sacrificing the character of the property. For example, uPVC sash windows can be designed to resemble traditional wooden sash windows, but with the added benefits of being low maintenance and durable.\n\nAnother approach is to repair and restore the existing sash windows, rather than replacing them entirely. This can be a more affordable option, especially if the windows are still in good condition. A professional window restoration service can help to repair any damage, replace worn-out parts, and apply a new finish to restore the windows to their former glory.\n\nFor those who are looking to replace the windows entirely, there are a few ways to make the process more manageable. One option is to replace the windows one by one, rather than all at once. This can help to spread the cost over a longer period and avoid the financial burden of replacing multiple windows at once.\n\nAnother approach is to consider a phased replacement, where the windows are replaced in stages, with each stage focusing on a specific area of the property. This can help to prioritize the most urgent windows and make the process more manageable.\n\nIn terms of costs, the price of replacing sash windows can vary widely depending on the type of window, the size of the property, and the location. On average, a single sash window can cost anywhere from £500 to £2,000, with the total cost of replacing all the windows in a property potentially running into the tens of thousands of pounds.\n\nUltimately, the best approach will depend on the specific needs and circumstances of the property. Our reader would be wise to consult with a professional window installer or surveyor to get a better understanding of the costs and options involved in replacing their old sash windows.",

In this case they will attempt to set down their probe, InSight, gently on to an area known as Elysium Planitia where it is intended to analyse seismic activity on the red planet. More probes have been sent to Mars than any other planet in the solar system but more than half of these missions have ended in failure, with the final stages, involving landing gently on the Martian surface, proving to be particularly dangerous and unsuccessful. The InSight lander, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is designed to study the internal structure of Mars and provide insights into the planet's formation and evolution. The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, which aims to understand the Martian environment and search for signs of life.\n\nThe Elysium Planitia region, where InSight is scheduled to land, is a vast and relatively flat plain in the western part of Mars. It is considered one of the safest and most accessible areas on the planet, making it an ideal location for a landing. The region is also of great scientific interest, as it is believed to be one of the oldest and most geologically stable areas on Mars.\n\nThe InSight lander is equipped with a range of instruments designed to study the Martian surface and subsurface. These instruments include seismometers to detect and analyze seismic activity, a heat flow probe to measure the flow of heat from the Martian interior, and a magnetometer to study the planet's magnetic field.\n\nThe landing process is expected to be a complex and challenging operation. NASA engineers will use a combination of propulsion systems and braking thrusters to slow down the lander as it enters the Martian atmosphere. The lander will then use its retro-propulsion system to slow down further and touch down on the Martian surface.\n\nThe InSight mission is a significant milestone in NASA's Mars Exploration Program, and the success of the landing will depend on a number of factors, including the accuracy of the lander's navigation system and the effectiveness of its propulsion systems. If successful, the mission will provide valuable insights into the internal structure of Mars and help scientists better understand the planet's geological history.\n\nThe InSight lander is expected to touch down on the Martian surface on November 26, and NASA engineers will be closely monitoring the landing process to ensure that everything goes according to plan. The mission is expected to last for at least two years, during which time the lander will conduct a range of scientific experiments and transmit data back to Earth.\n\nThe success of the InSight mission will not only provide valuable insights into the internal structure of Mars but also pave the way for future Mars missions. NASA is currently planning a number of future missions to Mars, including the Mars 2020 rover, which will search for signs of life on the planet. The InSight mission is an important step in this process, and its success will help to lay the groundwork for future Mars exploration.",

If you pay a £10 deposit for an online order of a gas cartridge they commit you'll get it back when you return it empty for recycling. However, on four occasions I have had to chase and in three cases they insisted they did not owe me anything. The latest wrangle went on for several weeks. I use SodaStream to avoid using plastic bottles of sparkling water. SodaStream's Deposit Reimbursement Issues Raise Concerns for Environmentally-Minded Consumers\n\nA UK consumer has shared a frustrating experience with SodaStream, a popular brand of home carbonation systems, over the company's deposit reimbursement policy. The consumer, who wishes to remain anonymous, has been struggling to reclaim deposits on empty gas cartridges, leading to a series of disputes with the company.\n\nThe issue began when the consumer paid a £10 deposit for an online order of a gas cartridge, as is standard practice with SodaStream. However, when they returned the empty cartridge for recycling, they were met with resistance from the company. On four separate occasions, the consumer was forced to chase SodaStream for their deposit, only to be told that the company did not owe them anything.\n\nThe latest dispute, which dragged on for several weeks, has left the consumer feeling frustrated and disillusioned with the company's customer service. \"I use SodaStream to avoid using plastic bottles of sparkling water, which is great for the environment,\" the consumer explained. \"But if their deposit reimbursement policy is not reliable, it undermines the whole point of using their product.\"\n\nSodaStream's deposit reimbursement policy is designed to encourage customers to recycle their empty gas cartridges, which are made from recyclable materials. The company claims that the deposits are intended to incentivize customers to return their cartridges for recycling, rather than simply disposing of them in the trash.\n\nHowever, the consumer's experience suggests that the policy may be flawed, with some customers facing difficulties in reclaiming their deposits. SodaStream has faced criticism in the past over its environmental claims, with some critics arguing that the company's use of single-use plastic cartridges undermines its commitment to sustainability.\n\nIn response to the consumer's complaints, SodaStream has apologized for any inconvenience caused and has offered to review the customer's account to resolve the issue. The company has also emphasized the importance of recycling and encourages customers to return their empty cartridges for recycling.\n\nDespite SodaStream's efforts to address the issue, the consumer's experience highlights the need for companies to prioritize customer service and transparency in their business practices. As consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility, companies like SodaStream must ensure that their policies and practices align with these values.\n\nIn the meantime, the consumer has decided to take their business elsewhere, citing concerns over SodaStream's deposit reimbursement policy. \"I'm not going to continue to use a company that doesn't stand by its promises,\" they said. \"I'll find another way to get my sparkling water fix that doesn't involve so much hassle and frustration.\"",

For the last several years, they have been teased and baffled by mysterious bursts of radio waves from the distant universe: pops of low-frequency radiation, emitting more energy than the sun does in a day, that occur randomly and disappear immediately. Nobody knows when these \"fast radio bursts,\" or F.R.B.s, will occur, or where exactly in the cosmos they are occurring. Despite the lack of concrete answers, scientists have been working tirelessly to unravel the mystery of these enigmatic events. In recent years, astronomers have detected over 80 fast radio bursts, with each one offering a tantalizing glimpse into the unknown.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of F.R.B.s is their sheer power. The bursts of energy released are so intense that they can be detected from millions of light-years away, making them a valuable tool for scientists to study the distant universe.\n\n\"We're essentially getting a snapshot of the universe in a split second,\" said Dr. Sarah Burke, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. \"These bursts are like cosmic flashlights, illuminating regions of space that would otherwise be dark and unexplored.\"\n\nBut what's causing these bursts remains a mystery. Astronomers have proposed a range of theories, from supernovae explosions to advanced alien technology. However, none of these explanations have been proven conclusively, leaving scientists to continue their search for answers.\n\nTo better understand F.R.B.s, researchers are employing a range of innovative techniques. One approach involves using radio telescopes to monitor the sky for signs of the bursts, while others are using advanced computer simulations to model the behavior of these events.\n\nOne promising lead has come from the discovery of a repeating F.R.B., which has been detected emitting bursts of energy at regular intervals. This has sparked hopes that scientists may be able to pinpoint the location of the burst and learn more about its origin.\n\n\"Finding a repeating F.R.B. is like finding a needle in a haystack,\" said Dr. Jocelyn Read, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's given us a new avenue to explore and potentially learn more about these enigmatic events.\"\n\nAs scientists continue to unravel the mystery of F.R.B.s, they are also gaining a deeper understanding of the universe and its many secrets.

In one of the highest-profile boardroom battles in recent years, Sir Chris Hohn's TCI fund management group has demanded the shareholder vote – which will take place on 19 December – to remove Donald Brydon, the City veteran who has chaired the exchange since 2015. The London Stock Exchange's decision to provide a detailed explanation for Xavier Rolet's departure has sparked intense scrutiny, with many questioning the true reasons behind the CEO's sudden exit. The 20-page circular, which sets the stage for the upcoming shareholder meeting, has shed some light on the circumstances surrounding Rolet's departure, but many are still left wondering what really happened.\n\nAccording to the circular, Rolet's \"operating style\" was a major factor in the exchange's decision to part ways with him. The document suggests that Rolet's leadership style was not aligned with the needs of the company, and that his departure was necessary to ensure the exchange's continued success.\n\nHowever, some have questioned the timing of Rolet's departure, with many pointing out that it came just days after the exchange announced a major overhaul of its leadership structure. The changes, which included the creation of a new role for Rolet, were seen by some as a way to give the CEO more autonomy and control over the company.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Rolet's departure has also raised questions about the role of Sir Chris Hohn's TCI fund management group, which has been a vocal critic of the exchange's leadership. TCI has demanded that the company's chairman, Donald Brydon, be removed from his position, citing his handling of Rolet's departure as a major reason for the demand.\n\nThe upcoming shareholder meeting, which is set to take place on December 19, is expected to be a highly contentious affair, with many shareholders set to vote on whether or not to remove Brydon from his position. The meeting is seen as a key test of the exchange's governance structures, and could have significant implications for the company's future direction.\n\nIn a statement, the London Stock Exchange said that it was committed to ensuring the continued success of the company, and that it was confident in its ability to navigate the current challenges.

The five members of the commission met in mid-December to discuss the investigation, according to the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is not public. The meeting, which took place on December 14, marked a significant milestone in the investigation, which has been ongoing for several months. The FTC is examining whether Facebook's sharing of user data with third-party companies, including Cambridge Analytica, violated the company's 2011 consent decree with the agency.\n\nUnder the decree, Facebook agreed to obtain users' explicit consent before sharing their data with third-party companies. However, the company's handling of user data has been criticized for being opaque and difficult to understand, leading to concerns that users may not have given informed consent.\n\nThe FTC's investigation is focused on whether Facebook's actions constituted a violation of the consent decree. If the agency finds that Facebook did violate the decree, it could seek fines of up to $41,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.\n\nThe investigation is also examining whether Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and other senior executives were aware of the company's data-sharing practices and whether they took adequate steps to prevent the misuse of user data.\n\nFacebook has faced numerous scandals in recent years, including the Cambridge Analytica data breach, which involved the harvesting of millions of users' data without their consent. The company has also faced criticism for its handling of misinformation and disinformation on its platform.\n\nThe FTC's investigation is seen as a major test of the agency's ability to regulate the tech industry and protect consumer privacy. The agency has a history of taking action against companies that violate consumer privacy, including a $5 billion fine against Google in 2019.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation is expected to have significant implications for Facebook and the tech industry as a whole.

Prezzo's creditors will be asked to approve proposals under which its restaurants' landlords accept rent reductions. The proposed restructuring plan aims to reduce the company's debt and improve its financial performance by renegotiating lease agreements with landlords. According to industry insiders, Prezzo's landlords are being asked to accept a 20-30% reduction in rent, which would help the chain to save millions of pounds annually.\n\nThe move comes as the casual dining sector continues to struggle with declining sales and increased competition from online food delivery services and fast-casual chains. Prezzo, which was founded in 2000, has seen its sales decline by 10% in the past year, with like-for-like sales falling by 5%.\n\nThe chain's struggles have been attributed to a combination of factors, including increased competition, rising costs, and a decline in consumer spending power. Prezzo's menu, which was once praised for its variety and quality, has also been criticized for being too complex and expensive.\n\nThe proposed restructuring plan is expected to be put to a vote by Prezzo's creditors in the coming weeks.

The potential sale of Uber Eats in India comes as the company faces significant financial challenges globally. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Uber reported a net loss of $1.1 billion, with its food-delivery business being a significant contributor to those losses.\n\nUber Eats, which was launched in India in 2017, has struggled to gain traction in the country's highly competitive food-delivery market. Despite investing heavily in the business, Uber has been unable to stem the losses, which have reportedly been in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nZomato, on the other hand, has been gaining momentum in the Indian food-delivery market. The company, which was founded in 2008, has expanded its operations to over 500 cities across the country and has partnered with over 150,000 restaurants.\n\nThe potential acquisition of Uber Eats by Zomato would give the company a significant boost in the food-delivery market, allowing it to expand its reach and offerings to customers. It would also give Uber a much-needed exit from the Indian market, allowing the company to focus on its core ride-hailing business.\n\nThe deal is still in the advanced stages of negotiation, and it is unclear what the terms of the sale would be. However, sources close to the deal suggest that Uber would likely receive a significant amount of cash and/or equity in Zomato as part of the deal.\n\nThe potential sale of Uber Eats in India is the latest in a series of moves by the company to restructure its business and cut losses. In recent months, Uber has sold off its self-driving car unit and has laid off thousands of employees in an effort to reduce costs and focus on its core business.\n\nThe deal is also seen as a significant vote of confidence in Zomato, which has been expanding rapidly in recent years. The company has received significant investment from investors, including Ant Financial, the financial arm of Alibaba Group, and has been expanding its operations in the Indian market.\n\nThe potential acquisition of Uber Eats by Zomato is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, pending regulatory approval.

        "Text": "Q. I just got a new iPhone and have noticed that every time I pick it up or move it, the screen pops on by itself instead of me turning it on with the switch. Is this a problem with the phone? iPhone owners often experience a common issue where the screen turns on automatically when they pick up or move the device. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"accidental wake-up\" or \"screen wake-up.\" While it may seem like a problem with the phone, it's usually a normal behavior that can be attributed to the device's built-in features.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for accidental screen wake-up is the iPhone's proximity sensor. This sensor is designed to detect when the phone is close to your face, and it automatically turns on the screen to allow for Face ID or Touch ID authentication. However, if the sensor is not functioning correctly, it may trigger the screen to turn on unnecessarily.\n\nAnother possible cause of accidental screen wake-up is the iPhone's motion sensors. These sensors are responsible for detecting the device's movement and orientation. If the sensors are not calibrated correctly, they may cause the screen to turn on when the phone is moved or picked up.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue, you can try a few simple steps. First, make sure that your iPhone is running the latest software. Sometimes, updating the software can resolve the issue. You can also try disabling the proximity sensor by going to Settings > Face ID & Passcode (or Touch ID & Passcode) and toggle off the \"Proximity Sensor\" option.\n\nAnother solution is to adjust the screen timeout setting. Go to Settings > Display & Brightness and adjust the \"Auto-Lock\" option to a longer or shorter time frame, depending on your preference. This will prevent the screen from turning on unnecessarily.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there's a hardware problem with your iPhone. In this case, it's recommended that you visit an Apple Store or authorized service provider for further assistance. They can diagnose the issue and perform any necessary repairs or replacements.\n\nIn conclusion, accidental screen wake-up is a common issue that can be caused by a variety of factors, including the proximity sensor and motion sensors. By trying a few simple troubleshooting steps, you can resolve the issue and enjoy a smoother iPhone experience.",

        "Text": "The hostilities between two prominent media companies are unlikely to cool off any time soon. On Wednesday, the CBS Corporation amended its lawsuit against its parent company, intensifying the battle for control of the network being waged between its chief executive officer, Leslie Moonves, and its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone. The amended lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, alleges that Redstone's National Amusements, Inc. has been exerting undue influence over the CBS board of directors, leading to a series of decisions that have harmed the company's interests. The lawsuit also claims that Redstone has been using her position as a controlling shareholder to further her own interests, rather than those of the company.\n\nThe dispute between Moonves and Redstone has been ongoing for several months, with both sides accusing the other of attempting to gain control of the company. Moonves has been CEO of CBS since 2003, and has led the company through a period of significant growth and success. Redstone, on the other hand, has been a major shareholder of CBS since 2008, and has been pushing for the company to merge with its sister company, Viacom.\n\nThe amended lawsuit is the latest development in a series of legal battles between Moonves and Redstone. In August, Moonves filed a lawsuit against Redstone, alleging that she had been trying to oust him as CEO and gain control of the company. Redstone has denied these allegations, and has accused Moonves of trying to block her efforts to merge CBS with Viacom.\n\nThe dispute has been playing out in the media, with both sides making public statements and engaging in a war of words. The amended lawsuit is likely to add to the tension and uncertainty surrounding the future of CBS.\n\nThe implications of the dispute are significant, not just for CBS, but for the media industry as a whole. If Redstone is successful in her efforts to gain control of the company, it could have a major impact on the direction of CBS and its subsidiaries. It could also have implications for the future of Viacom, which has been struggling in recent years.\n\nThe dispute is also likely to have implications for the future of the media industry as a whole. The merger of CBS and Viacom would create a massive media conglomerate, with significant influence over the industry. It could also lead to a consolidation of media companies, as smaller players are absorbed into larger ones.\n\nIn the meantime, the dispute between Moonves and Redstone is likely to continue to play out in the media and in the courts. It remains to be seen how the situation will ultimately resolve, but one thing is clear: the future of CBS and the media industry hangs in the balance.",

Why might Henry I be an appropriate way to end the series? 3) What comes next in the following series? 2.1, 3.5, 3.3, 2.3, 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 1.8 ... 4) What comes next in this series: 1, 2, 9, 12, 70, 89, 97, 102 ... The Puzzle Mastermind of Gogglebox\n\nFans of the popular TV show Gogglebox may be familiar with Bill, a.k.a. William Hartston, a puzzle enthusiast who has been a regular fixture on the program. But few may know that Bill is also a skilled puzzle creator, and his latest brain teasers have left even the most seasoned puzzle solvers scratching their heads.\n\nThe four puzzles Bill presented earlier today were a challenge for even the most experienced puzzle enthusiasts. The first puzzle, a number sequence, asked solvers to identify the next number in the series: 23, 9, 20, 14, 14, 9, 20, 6,... Many attempted to find a pattern in the numbers, but it wasn't until Bill revealed the answer that the solution became clear. The next number in the series is 4, as the sequence is based on alternating between adding and subtracting 3 from the previous number.\n\nThe second puzzle was a series of monarchs, with the question being why Henry I might be an appropriate way to end the series. The answer lies in the fact that Henry I was the first king of England to be crowned after the Norman Conquest, marking a significant turning point in English history. Bill's choice of Henry I as the final monarch in the series was a nod to this important event.\n\nThe third puzzle was a series of decimals, with the question being what comes next in the sequence: 2.1, 3.5, 3.3, 2.3, 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 1.8... After careful examination, solvers discovered that the sequence is based on alternating between adding and subtracting 0.1 from the previous number, with the exception of the jump from 1.3 to 2.4. The next number in the sequence is 2.7.\n\nThe final puzzle was a series of numbers, with the question being what comes next in the sequence: 1, 2, 9, 12, 70, 89, 97, 102... After analyzing the sequence, solvers found that it is based on a combination of addition and multiplication. The next number in the sequence is 111, as the sequence alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 2.\n\nBill's puzzles may have been challenging, but they also provided a fun and engaging way for solvers to exercise their brains. Whether you're a seasoned puzzle enthusiast or just looking for a fun challenge, Bill's puzzles are sure to provide hours of entertainment.",

Though male elk, or bulls, rarely make it past 5 years old because they are targeted by hunters, female elk, or cows, can live as long as 20 years. Remarkably, cows over age 10 seem nearly invulnerable to hunters. The remarkable longevity of female elk in southwestern Canada has puzzled wildlife experts for years. While it's not uncommon for male elk to fall victim to hunters, their female counterparts have managed to evade the threat for decades. According to a recent study published in the Journal of Wildlife Management, female elk in the region have a significantly higher survival rate compared to their male counterparts.\n\nResearchers attribute the difference in survival rates to the fact that hunters tend to target male elk, which are larger and more aggressive than females. This selective hunting pressure has led to a skewed sex ratio, with more female elk remaining in the population. As a result, females have had fewer predators and less competition for resources, allowing them to thrive.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from over 1,000 elk harvested in the region between 2000 and 2015, found that the majority of female elk (75%) survived to age 10 or older. In contrast, only 25% of male elk reached the same age. The researchers also discovered that female elk over age 10 were nearly invulnerable to hunters, with only 2% of this age group being harvested.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for wildlife management and conservation efforts in the region. \"Our study highlights the importance of considering sex-specific mortality rates when developing management strategies,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, lead author of the study. \"By understanding the unique survival patterns of female elk, we can better inform our conservation efforts and ensure the long-term sustainability of elk populations.\"\n\nThe study's results also have broader implications for wildlife conservation globally. \"This research demonstrates the importance of considering the social and ecological context of wildlife populations when developing conservation strategies,\" said Dr. John Doe, a wildlife ecologist at the University of British Columbia. \"By taking a sex-specific approach to conservation, we can better protect and manage wildlife populations for the long-term.\"\n\nAs the debate around hunting and conservation continues to evolve, the remarkable longevity of female elk in southwestern Canada serves as a reminder of the importance of considering the complex social and ecological dynamics of wildlife populations. By understanding the unique survival patterns of these remarkable animals, we can better work towards a future where wildlife thrives.",

Tech companies making self-driving cars could become better protected under the law than those car's owners, experts warn, as the announcement came of a powerful new coalition of automakers and big tech companies forming to take on US government regulations around self-driving vehicles. Google, Uber, Lyft, Ford and Volvo, all of which are working on self-driving car technology, will lobby as the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets to bring autonomous vehicles to the road across the US. The formation of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets has raised concerns among consumer advocates and experts, who fear that the tech giants behind the coalition will use their influence to shift the burden of liability in the event of an accident from themselves to the vehicle owners.\n\n\"This is a classic case of corporate interests trying to rewrite the rules to benefit themselves,\" said Rachel Weintraub, director of consumer policy at the Consumer Federation of America. \"If these companies are so confident in the safety of their self-driving cars, then they should be willing to take responsibility for any accidents that occur.\"\n\nUnder current laws, if a self-driving car is involved in an accident, the owner of the vehicle is typically held liable. However, experts warn that the coalition's efforts could lead to changes in the law that would make it easier for tech companies to avoid liability.\n\n\"The coalition's goal is to create a regulatory environment that is favorable to their interests,\" said David Strickland, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). \"This could lead to a situation where the companies are not held accountable for their actions, and the public is left to bear the risk.\"\n\nThe coalition's formation comes as the US government is preparing to issue new regulations on self-driving vehicles. The Department of Transportation has proposed a framework that would allow companies to deploy self-driving cars on public roads without human oversight, but the proposal has been met with criticism from consumer advocates and safety experts.\n\nThe Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets is touting its efforts as a way to bring autonomous vehicles to the road more quickly and safely. However, critics argue that the coalition's true goal is to protect the companies' interests and avoid accountability.\n\n\"We need to be careful not to let the companies write the rules in a way that benefits them at the expense of public safety,\" said Weintraub. \"The public deserves to know that the companies are putting their interests ahead of their safety.\"\n\nAs the debate over self-driving cars continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the coalition's efforts will impact the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles in the US.

Mr. Avrich said on Wednesday that he will rework his documentary, \"Unauthorized: The Harvey Weinstein Project,\" in the wake of sexual harassment and rape allegations against Mr. Weinstein. \"I have a moral obligation to edit and expand my film, and not just by tacking on an 11-minute ending about him as a sexual predator,\" Mr. Avrich said by phone from Ottawa. Avrich's original documentary, released in 2011, was intended to be a comprehensive look at Weinstein's career and influence in the film industry. However, the filmmaker claims that the final product was heavily edited and toned down to avoid controversy. With the recent allegations against Weinstein, Avrich sees an opportunity to revisit the project and provide a more accurate and nuanced portrayal of the disgraced producer.\n\n\"I was told that the film was too harsh, too critical, and that it would be better to focus on Weinstein's positive contributions to the industry,\" Avrich said. \"But now, with the allegations coming to light, I feel a sense of responsibility to revisit the film and tell the story in a way that is truthful and accurate.\"\n\nAvrich plans to re-interview many of the same sources who were involved in the original documentary, including industry professionals and those who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He also intends to include new information and testimony that has come to light in the wake of the allegations.\n\n\"I want to make sure that the film is a reflection of the truth, and not just a sanitized version of events,\" Avrich said. \"I believe that by telling this story, we can help to create a more just and equitable industry, where people are held accountable for their actions and where women and marginalized communities are treated with respect and dignity.\"\n\nThe reworked documentary is expected to be released in the coming months, although a specific date has not been announced. Avrich is working with a new production company and is seeking funding to complete the project.\n\nIn the meantime, Avrich is urging anyone who has information or testimony related to Weinstein's behavior to come forward and share their stories. He believes that by shedding light on the allegations, he can help to create a culture of accountability and transparency in the industry.\n\n\"We need to have a conversation about the systemic issues that have allowed this kind of behavior to go unchecked for so long,\" Avrich said. \"By telling this story, I hope to contribute to that conversation and help to create a better future for everyone in the industry.\"",

Jones was in insecure employment on a zero-hours contract in 2011 when he turned to Britain's then biggest payday lender. There was a lull in work and he \"needed something to tide me over\" while he waited for his finances to pick up. He took out a small Wonga loan – \"I think it was £50 to £100\" – but unfortunately his work situation did not improve and \"it just snowballed from there … [it] led to me taking out more and more, and from different sources\". As Jones' financial struggles continued, he found himself trapped in a cycle of debt, with Wonga and other payday lenders demanding repayment. He estimates that he took out over 20 loans from different lenders, with interest rates ranging from 1,000% to 5,000% APR.\n\n\"I was in a desperate situation and I didn't know how to get out of it,\" Jones recalled. \"I was getting letters and phone calls from Wonga and other lenders, and I was feeling like I was drowning in debt.\"\n\nJones' experience is not unique. The payday lending industry was at its peak in the early 2010s, with Wonga being one of the largest players. However, the sector has since faced intense scrutiny and regulation, with many lenders shutting down or significantly scaling back their operations.\n\nThe rise of payday lending was fueled by a combination of factors, including the 2008 financial crisis, which left many people struggling to make ends meet. The lenders preyed on vulnerable individuals, offering short-term loans with exorbitant interest rates and fees.\n\nHowever, the industry's practices were widely criticized for being exploitative and predatory. In 2014, Wonga was forced to pay compensation to thousands of customers after it was found to have sent fake legal letters to debtors, threatening them with court action.\n\nJones' experience with Wonga ultimately led to a change in his life. He began to seek help from debt charities and eventually managed to pay off his debts. He also decided to pursue a career in politics, driven by a desire to help others who had been affected by the payday lending industry.\n\nToday, Jones is a local councillor in his community, and he has become a vocal advocate for financial inclusion and consumer protection. He believes that his experience with Wonga has given him a unique perspective on the issues facing vulnerable individuals.\n\n\"I know what it's like to be trapped in a cycle of debt, and I know what it's like to feel like you're being taken advantage of,\" Jones said. \"But I also know that there is hope for change. By sharing my story, I hope to inspire others to speak out and demand better from the financial industry.\"",

The resulting meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse. The next shower you might be able to see is known as the Eta Aquariids. The Eta Aquariids: A Celestial Spectacle Awaits\n\nAs Earth continues its orbit around the sun, it encounters various streams of cosmic debris, resulting in spectacular meteor showers that illuminate the night sky. One of the most anticipated events of the year is the Eta Aquariids, a celestial spectacle that promises to captivate stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe Eta Aquariids, also known as the Eta Aquariid meteor shower, is an annual event that takes place in late May and early June. This shower is the result of Earth's encounter with the debris trail left behind by Halley's Comet, one of the most famous comets in history. As our planet passes through this trail, small particles of dust and rock enter the Earth's atmosphere, burning up and producing a bright streak of light in the sky.\n\nPeak Viewing Time\n\nThe Eta Aquariids typically peak around May 6th, with the shower's peak activity occurring between midnight and dawn. During this time, observers can expect to see up to 60 meteors per hour, making it one of the most active and visible showers of the year. The shower's radiant point, or the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, is located near the constellation Aquarius, which is visible in the southern sky around midnight.\n\nTips for Viewing\n\nTo make the most of this celestial event, stargazers are advised to find a dark location with minimal light pollution and clear skies. Dress warmly and bring a comfortable chair or blanket to ensure a relaxing viewing experience. It's also essential to allow your eyes to adjust to the darkness for at least 20 minutes before attempting to spot meteors.\n\nAdditionally, consider downloading a meteor shower tracking app or using a website that provides real-time updates on the shower's activity. These tools can help you stay informed about the shower's peak time and provide tips on the best viewing locations.\n\nAstronomical Significance\n\nThe Eta Aquariids hold significant importance in the field of astronomy. By studying this shower, scientists can gain valuable insights into the composition and origin of Halley's Comet, as well as the Earth's orbit and the interactions between our planet and other celestial bodies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Eta Aquariids offer a unique opportunity for stargazers to witness the beauty and wonder of the universe. With its peak activity occurring in late May and early June, this celestial event is not to be missed. So, grab a pair of binoculars, find a comfortable spot, and get ready to be mesmerized by the Eta Aquariids – a spectacular display of cosmic debris and celestial wonder.",

        "Text": "The oldest known case of dandruff has been identified in a small feathered dinosaur that roamed the Earth about 125m years ago. Paleontologists found tiny flakes of fossilised skin on a crow-sized microraptor, a meat-eating dinosaur that had wings on all four of its limbs. Tests on two other feathered dinosaurs, namely beipiaosaurus and sinornithosaurus, and a primitive bird known as confuciusornis, also revealed pieces of fossilised dandruff on the animals' bodies. The prehistoric skin flakes are the only evidence scientists have of how dinosaurs shed their skin. The material shows that rather than losing their outer layer in one piece, or in large sheets, as is common with modern reptiles, the feathered dinosaurs adapted to shed their skin in tiny flakes. The discovery of fossilized dandruff on these ancient creatures has provided a unique glimpse into the skin shedding habits of dinosaurs. According to Dr. Emma Taylor, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, \"The fact that we found dandruff on these feathered dinosaurs suggests that they had a unique skin shedding mechanism, unlike anything seen in modern reptiles.\"\n\nThe research team used a combination of microscopic analysis and computer simulations to study the fossilized skin flakes. They found that the flakes were remarkably similar to modern human dandruff, with a similar shape and size. However, the flakes were much smaller, typically measuring around 0.1 millimeters in length.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of dinosaur biology and ecology. \"The fact that dinosaurs shed their skin in tiny flakes suggests that they may have had a more complex skin structure than previously thought,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"It's possible that their skin was more like a modern bird's skin, with a layer of soft, fluffy feathers underneath a tougher outer layer.\"\n\nThe study also raises questions about the role of dandruff in the daily lives of dinosaurs. Did they experience itching or discomfort as a result of their skin shedding? Did they have any natural remedies to deal with the problem? These questions may never be fully answered, but the discovery of fossilized dandruff has certainly provided a new area of research for scientists to explore.\n\nThe findings have also sparked interest among the general public, with many people expressing fascination with the idea of dinosaurs having dandruff. \"It's amazing to think that these prehistoric creatures were dealing with the same kind of skin issues that we experience today,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"It's a reminder that, despite their differences, dinosaurs were still living, breathing creatures that faced many of the same challenges that we do.\"\n\nThe study's authors are now planning to conduct further research on the fossilized skin flakes, including analyzing the chemical composition and structure of the flakes. They hope to gain a better understanding of the skin shedding process in dinosaurs and how it may have evolved over time.\n\nIn the meantime, the discovery of fossilized dandruff has provided a unique window into the lives of dinosaurs, offering a glimpse into their daily struggles and triumphs. As Dr. Taylor noted, \"It's a reminder that, despite their extinction, dinosaurs continue to fascinate and inspire us today.\"",

In 2016, around 2.3m debt cases were passed to bailiffs by local authorities, according to data given to the House of Commons Treasury committee. It said: \"These debts are often pursued overzealously, and with routine recourse to bailiffs. The report, which was published on Wednesday, highlights the devastating impact that overzealous bailiff activity is having on vulnerable households across the country.

These debts are often small and can be settled through more reasonable means, but instead, councils are choosing to pursue them aggressively, causing unnecessary stress and financial hardship for vulnerable households.\"\n\nThe report also highlights the lack of transparency and accountability surrounding the use of bailiffs by councils. It notes that there is no national data on the number of bailiff visits or the amounts of money collected, making it difficult to track the impact of this practice.\n\nThe committee is calling for an immediate review of the use of bailiffs by councils, and for the government to introduce stricter guidelines on when bailiffs can be used. It is also urging councils to explore alternative methods of debt collection, such as payment plans and debt counseling.\n\nThe report's findings have been welcomed by anti-poverty campaigners, who have long argued that the use of bailiffs is a disproportionate and ineffective way to collect council tax debts.\n\n\"This report confirms what we have been saying for years - that the use of bailiffs is a vicious cycle that is driving people further into debt and poverty,\" said Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group. \"We urge the government to take immediate action to reform the system and ensure that councils are using more reasonable and effective methods to collect debts.\"\n\nThe report's recommendations have also been backed by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which has seen a significant increase in the number of people seeking help with council tax debt.\n\n\"Council tax debt is a major problem for many people, and it's unacceptable that councils are using bailiffs in a way that is causing unnecessary hardship,\" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. \"We urge councils to work with citizens to find more reasonable and effective solutions to debt collection.\"\n\nThe government has yet to respond to the report's findings, but it is expected to do so in the coming weeks.

Lefties don't reach for their guns or express \"hatred\" against others – including Daily Mail readers – they use satirical cartoons and mild rebukes. The Mail's response was a telling example of the vitriolic tone that has become all too familiar in modern discourse. By accusing left-leaning individuals of \"hatred\" and \"gun-toting\" extremism, the newspaper's editors demonstrated a profound lack of understanding of the very concept of satire.\n\nSatire, by its very nature, is a form of social commentary that uses irony, sarcasm, and ridicule to critique societal norms and institutions. It is a powerful tool for holding those in power accountable and encouraging critical thinking. The Daily Mail's attempt to conflate satire with hatred and violence is a desperate attempt to discredit and silence those who dare to challenge its ideology.\n\nFurthermore, the Mail's response was a clear example of projection. Rather than acknowledging the hurtful and divisive rhetoric that has been a hallmark of its editorial stance, the newspaper chose to accuse others of being \"hatred-filled\" and \"extremist.\" This tactic is a classic example of gaslighting, where the perpetrator attempts to manipulate the narrative to avoid accountability for their own actions.\n\nThe Daily Mail's reaction to the cartoon was not an isolated incident. In recent years, the newspaper has been at the forefront of a campaign to suppress free speech and stifle dissenting voices. From its relentless attacks on migrants and asylum seekers to its relentless promotion of xenophobia and nationalism, the Mail has consistently used its platform to spread hate and division.\n\nIt is clear that the Daily Mail is more interested in perpetuating a culture of fear and intolerance than in promoting constructive dialogue and understanding. As such, it is no surprise that its response to the cartoon was so vitriolic and divisive. The newspaper's actions are a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of holding those in power accountable for their actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the Daily Mail's response to the cartoon was a clear example of the newspaper's lack of understanding of satire and its desperate attempt to discredit and silence those who dare to challenge its ideology. As we move forward in this era of increased polarization and division, it is more important than ever that we stand up against hate and intolerance and promote a culture of empathy, understanding, and critical thinking.",

After student protests and internal review, at least five universities, from the University of Texas at Austin to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have renamed buildings that originally honored Ku Klux Klan members. The move to erase the legacy of racist historical figures has sparked a heated debate on campus, with some arguing that the removal of statues and renaming of buildings is a necessary step towards creating a more inclusive and respectful environment, while others claim it is a form of cultural cleansing.\n\nOne of the most high-profile examples is the University of Texas at Austin, which renamed its \"Perry-Castañeda Library\" to simply \"PCL\" after it was discovered that the building was originally named after two Confederate generals, Henry Perry and William Castañeda. The renaming was met with widespread approval from students and faculty, who argued that the original name was a painful reminder of the university's troubled past.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced. Some critics have argued that the removal of statues and renaming of buildings is a form of \"revisionist history\" that erases important parts of the past. \"We're not learning from our mistakes if we're just erasing them,\" said Dr. James Wilson, a historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"These figures, no matter how problematic they may be, are still an important part of our collective heritage.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, many universities are pushing forward with plans to rename buildings and remove statues that honor racist historical figures. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, for example, has renamed its \"Silent Sam\" monument, which was dedicated to Confederate soldiers, to \"The Memorial at Silent Sam\". The university has also established a task force to review all of its buildings and monuments to ensure that they are respectful and inclusive.\n\nThe movement to rename buildings and remove statues is not limited to universities. Cities and towns across the country are also reevaluating their public monuments and naming conventions. In New Orleans, for example, the city council has voted to remove four Confederate monuments from public parks, citing concerns about their impact on the city's African American community.\n\nAs the debate continues to rage, many are left wondering what the long-term implications will be for our understanding of history and our collective identity. Will the removal of racist historical figures lead to a more inclusive and respectful environment, or will it erase important parts of our past? Only time will tell.",

Australia and the rest of the world have been reeling from a string of temperature records being smashed. February caused alarm when it was the most unusually warm month on record by a huge margin. According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the past few months have seen temperatures soar to unprecedented levels, with the country experiencing its warmest summer on record. The trend is expected to continue, with forecasters predicting that March will also break records.\n\n\"This is not just a blip on the radar, this is a clear sign of the dangerous climate change that we're facing,\" said Dr. Emma Smith, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne. \"The fact that we're seeing record-breaking temperatures in multiple months is a wake-up call for all of us to take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint.\"\n\nThe unseasonable warmth has already had devastating consequences for many parts of the country. Drought-stricken regions are experiencing extreme heatwaves, exacerbating the already dire situation. In some areas, temperatures have reached as high as 45 degrees Celsius, putting the health and well-being of vulnerable communities at risk.\n\nThe impact is not limited to Australia alone. Climate scientists are warning that the global temperature record is likely to be broken again this year, with many countries experiencing extreme weather events. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching, from more frequent and severe heatwaves and droughts to rising sea levels and more intense storms.\n\nThe Australian government has announced a series of measures to address the crisis, including a new climate change strategy aimed at reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions. However, many experts are calling for more drastic action, including a transition to renewable energy sources and a phase-out of fossil fuels.\n\nAs the world grapples with the reality of climate change, individuals are also taking action. From reducing their energy consumption to adopting sustainable lifestyles, many Australians are making conscious choices to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n\"The science is clear, the consequences of climate change are severe, and it's up to all of us to take action,\" said Jane Doe, a climate activist from Sydney. \"We can't afford to wait, we need to work together to create a sustainable future for ourselves and for future generations.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the time for denial is over, and it's time for action.

The official start of tax-filing season arrived later than anticipated because of a delay caused by last year's government shutdown. If you are expecting to seek help from the Internal Revenue Service with your tax questions, you may find this to be a frustrating year. According to the IRS, the delay in the start of tax-filing season was due to the government shutdown, which occurred from October 1 to October 17, 2013. The shutdown resulted in a significant backlog of work, including processing of tax returns and refunds, which had to be cleared before the filing season could begin.\n\nAs a result, taxpayers are advised to be patient and allow extra time for their returns to be processed. The IRS has also implemented a number of measures to help alleviate the burden on its systems, including the use of temporary workers and overtime to process returns.\n\nDespite the challenges, the IRS is urging taxpayers to file their returns as soon as possible to avoid any potential delays. The agency has also extended the deadline for filing individual tax returns from April 15 to April 18, due to the Emancipation Day holiday in Washington, D.C.\n\nTaxpayers who are seeking help with their tax questions may find it more challenging this year, as the IRS is experiencing a significant shortage of staff.

The agency has also implemented a number of security measures to protect taxpayer information, including the use of two-factor authentication and encryption.\n\nIn addition to the challenges posed by the government shutdown, taxpayers may also face additional hurdles this year due to changes in tax laws. The American Taxpayer Relief Act, which was passed in January 2013, made a number of changes to the tax code, including the elimination of the payroll tax cut and the increase in tax rates for high-income individuals.\n\nTaxpayers who are unsure about how these changes affect their taxes are advised to seek the advice of a tax professional or to consult with the IRS.

Two years previously a consultant at Guy's hospital in London had asked our school if we could assist children with cerebral palsy; they wore out their shoes very quickly due to the manner in which they walked. We researched materials and eventually produced an automated machine that manufactured hard-wearing polypropylene toecaps to fit over their shoes. The innovative project, which was a collaborative effort between students and teachers, aimed to address the issue of frequent shoe replacement for children with cerebral palsy. The condition affects muscle tone and movement, often causing individuals to wear out their shoes prematurely due to the unique way they walk.\n\nThe team's solution, the automated machine, was designed to produce custom-fit polypropylene toecaps that could be attached to the shoes of children with cerebral palsy. The machine was capable of producing a range of sizes and shapes, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit for each individual.\n\nThe project's success was not limited to its practical application. It also served as a valuable learning experience for the students involved, teaching them important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and innovation. The project's impact was recognized by the BBC, which invited the school's team to participate in the Young Scientists of the Year competition.\n\nHeinz Wolff, a renowned scientist and television presenter, served as the specialist judge for the school's team in the competition.

Stagecoach said the single-decker bus will run autonomously only in its depots until laws change to allow it to carry passengers. Work is being carried out to adapt the bus with the same technology used on driverless pods recently used in a trial in Greenwich, south-east London. The trial, which is set to take place later this year, marks a significant step forward in the development of autonomous public transportation in the UK. Stagecoach, one of the country's largest bus operators, has partnered with a leading technology company to adapt the bus with the latest autonomous driving systems.\n\nAccording to Stagecoach, the single-decker bus will initially run solely within the company's depots, where it will be used to transport employees and equipment. This will allow the company to test the bus's autonomous capabilities in a controlled environment before considering its use on public roads.\n\nThe technology used in the bus is similar to that employed in the driverless pods recently trialed in Greenwich, south-east London. These pods, which were designed to transport passengers around the O2 Arena, used a combination of sensors and GPS to navigate through the area without human intervention.\n\nStagecoach's decision to trial the driverless bus comes as the UK government considers changes to the country's laws regarding autonomous vehicles. Currently, there are strict regulations in place that prohibit the use of self-driving cars and buses on public roads, unless they are accompanied by a human driver.\n\nHowever, with the increasing popularity of autonomous vehicles, the government is under pressure to update its laws to allow for their wider use. If successful, the trial could pave the way for the introduction of driverless buses on public roads in the future.\n\nThe trial is expected to provide valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of autonomous buses, as well as the public's perception of this new technology. Stagecoach has promised to engage with local communities and gather feedback throughout the trial to ensure that any concerns are addressed.\n\nWhile the trial is still several months away, Stagecoach is already planning for its next steps. The company has announced plans to expand its autonomous bus fleet in the coming years, with the aim of introducing driverless buses on public roads by the mid-2020s.\n\nAs the UK continues to push the boundaries of autonomous transportation, the trial of the driverless bus is an exciting development that could have significant implications for the future of public transportation. With its focus on safety, efficiency, and sustainability, the technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, and Stagecoach is at the forefront of this innovation.",

The company has published research into the most popular professions on its service in terms of how often those users get swiped right – approved as a potential match. For men, pilots are the most right-swiped jobs, followed by founder/entrepreneurs, firefighters, doctors and TV/radio personalities. The comparable women's chart is topped by physical therapists, followed by interior designers, founder/entrepreneurs, PR/communications workers and teachers. According to Tinder's research, the top 10 most right-swiped professions for men are dominated by high-stress, high-reward careers that showcase a sense of adventure, confidence, and a strong sense of responsibility. Pilots, in particular, seem to be a magnet for potential matches, with their ability to command respect and admiration from others.\n\nBut what is it about pilots that makes them so attractive to Tinder users? Experts suggest that it may be due to the combination of physical and mental challenges that pilots face on a daily basis. \"Pilots are seen as heroes, and the idea of being in control of a machine that can carry hundreds of people is incredibly appealing,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a relationship psychologist. \"Plus, the sense of adventure and thrill-seeking that comes with being a pilot is a major turn-on for many people.\"\n\nThe research also highlighted the importance of confidence and charisma in making a good impression on Tinder. Founder/entrepreneurs, who often possess a strong sense of self-assurance and a willingness to take risks, also ranked highly on the list. \"When you're an entrepreneur, you have to be able to think on your feet and take charge of situations,\" said Alex Chen, a successful startup founder who has used Tinder to meet new people. \"I think that confidence and sense of authority is really attractive to others.\"\n\nFor women, the top 10 most right-swiped professions are dominated by careers that emphasize empathy, creativity, and a sense of nurturing. Physical therapists, who work closely with patients to help them recover from injuries and illnesses, ranked highest on the list. \"Physical therapists are seen as caring and compassionate, and the idea of being able to help people heal and recover is incredibly rewarding,\" said Dr. Rachel Lee, a physical therapist who has used Tinder to meet new people.\n\nThe research also highlighted the importance of creativity and artistic expression in making a good impression on Tinder. Interior designers, who bring their own unique vision and style to their work, ranked highly on the list. \"As an interior designer, I'm always looking for new ways to express myself and bring my ideas to life,\" said Samantha Brown, an interior designer who has used Tinder to meet new people. \"I think that creativity and sense of self-expression is really attractive to others.\"\n\nOverall, the research suggests that Tinder users are looking for more than just a pretty face or a witty bio. They're looking for people who are confident, charismatic, and have a sense of purpose and direction. Whether you're a pilot or a physical therapist, a founder or an interior designer, the key to success on Tinder is to be true to yourself and showcase your unique strengths and passions.",

At the time it was seen as the most lucrative TV licence to be awarded since Channel 5 in 1997. Despite the initial excitement and optimism surrounding the launch of London Live, the station has struggled to gain traction and has consistently reported losses. According to reports, the station has lost around £20 million since its inception in 2014, with some estimates suggesting that it could be losing as much as £1 million per month.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that the station's failure to attract a significant audience and generate sufficient revenue has led to Lebedev's decision to explore options for selling the station. \"London Live has never been able to find its footing,\" said one source. \"It's been a struggle from the start, and despite some initial hype, it's never been able to deliver the kind of ratings or revenue that the owners had hoped for.\"\n\nThe potential sale of London Live has sparked concerns about the future of local TV in the UK. The government's plan to launch dozens of local TV channels was seen as a way to increase diversity and competition in the broadcasting sector, but the struggles of London Live have raised questions about the viability of the model.\n\n\"London Live was meant to be a flagship station, a beacon of what local TV could achieve,\" said another industry expert. \"But instead, it's been a disaster. If the government is serious about promoting local TV, they need to rethink their strategy and provide more support to stations that are struggling to make ends meet.\"\n\nThe potential sale of London Live is also likely to raise questions about the future of the Evening Standard and the Independent, which are also owned by Lebedev. The Evening Standard has been struggling to maintain its circulation and revenue in recent years, and some have speculated that Lebedev may be looking to offload the title as part of a broader restructuring of his media empire.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Lebedev's company, Lebedev Holdings, declined to comment on the potential sale of London Live, saying only that the company was \"exploring all options\" for the station. However, sources close to the company suggest that a sale is likely to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe potential sale of London Live is just the latest in a series of setbacks for Lebedev, who has faced criticism in recent years for his business dealings and his ownership of the Evening Standard and the Independent. Despite his reputation as a savvy businessman, Lebedev has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including a high-profile dispute with the Russian government over his ownership of the Evening Standard.\n\nIn the end, the sale of London Live may be seen as a necessary step for Lebedev to restructure his media empire and focus on his more profitable assets. However, it also raises questions about the future of local TV in the UK and the government's plans to promote diversity and competition in the broadcasting sector.",

In simultaneously released statements, CBS and Viacom -- which were part of the same company from 2000 to 2006 -- said that their boards had created special committees of independent directors to \"evaluate a potential combination.\" The decision to re-examine a potential merger comes as both companies face significant changes in the media landscape. The rise of streaming services and cord-cutting have led to declining ratings and revenue for traditional television networks, forcing companies to adapt and evolve to stay competitive.\n\nCBS and Viacom have been exploring ways to strengthen their position in the market, and a reunion could potentially provide a competitive advantage. The two companies have a long history of collaboration, having been part of the same company, ViacomCBS, from 2000 to 2006. During that time, they shared resources and expertise, which helped to drive growth and innovation.\n\nA reunion could also provide opportunities for cost savings and synergies, as the two companies combine their operations and eliminate redundancies. In their statements, both CBS and Viacom emphasized the potential benefits of a merger, citing the ability to create a more robust and diversified media company.\n\nHowever, the path to a merger is not without its challenges.

        "Text": "The small Queensland town of Gympie has been identified as the origin of 70% of the world's macadamia nuts. New research into the fatty seed has revealed the world's dominant commercial cultivar – grown in Hawaii – originated from a single tree in southern Queensland from the 19th century. Native to Australia, macadamia trees are only found naturally in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Hawaiian macadamia industry was grown from one cultivar from Australia that was repeatedly cloned. This means the commercial macadamia tree has an incredibly low genetic diversity, and researchers hope their findings will spur the discovery of wild trees and more \"novel genes\". Genetic diversity would improve crop productivity, increase disease resistance and enable macadamia to be grown in new places, said one of the researchers, Dr Craig Hardner. By looking at genetic markers, Hardner, from the University of Queensland, and Dr Catherine Nock, from Southern Cross University, traced the origins of Hawaii's whole industry back to Queensland. The research, published in the journal Horticulture Research, sheds new light on the origins of the world's most widely cultivated macadamia tree, which is used to produce the popular snack food. The team's findings suggest that the Hawaiian industry's reliance on a single cultivar has led to a lack of genetic diversity, making the crop more susceptible to disease and reducing its overall productivity.\n\n\"This is a significant finding, as it highlights the importance of preserving genetic diversity in crop breeding programs,\" said Dr. Hardner. \"By identifying the origins of the Hawaiian industry, we can now focus on finding and conserving wild macadamia trees, which will allow us to introduce new genes and improve the crop's overall performance.\"\n\nThe researchers used genetic markers to trace the origins of the Hawaiian industry back to a single tree in southern Queensland, which was discovered to be the parent tree of the dominant commercial cultivar. The team then analyzed the genetic makeup of the tree and compared it to that of wild macadamia trees found in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales.\n\nTheir analysis revealed that the commercial cultivar has a very low genetic diversity, with many of the genes being identical to those found in the parent tree. In contrast, wild macadamia trees have a much higher genetic diversity, with many unique genes that could be used to improve the crop's performance.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for the macadamia industry, which is worth millions of dollars globally. By introducing new genes from wild macadamia trees, farmers could produce crops that are more resilient to disease, require less water and pesticides, and can thrive in a wider range of environments.\n\nThe research also has implications for conservation efforts, as it highlights the importance of preserving wild macadamia trees and their habitats. The team is now working with conservation organizations and industry stakeholders to develop a plan to conserve and protect the wild macadamia trees, which are found in a limited geographic area.\n\n\"This is a great example of how scientific research can inform conservation efforts and improve the sustainability of an industry,\" said Dr. Nock. \"By working together, we can ensure that the macadamia industry continues to thrive while also protecting the environment and preserving the genetic diversity of this important crop.\"",

Mike Buchanan, the executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents many of the country's most expensive independent schools, claimed that pupils \"take their foot off the gas\" after accepting offers that do not require specific A-level grades. \"These youngsters have to carry their results with them for their whole careers,\" Buchanan, the former headteacher of Ashford School in Kent, told the Times newspaper. The HMC, which represents over 250 of the UK's most prestigious independent schools, has expressed concerns that the widespread use of unconditional offers is undermining the value of A-level grades and potentially harming the academic prospects of students. Buchanan emphasized that the lack of academic rigor in the application process is leading to a culture of complacency among students, who are no longer incentivized to work hard and achieve high grades.\n\nAccording to data from the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), the number of unconditional offers has increased significantly over the past decade, with over 40% of students receiving such offers in 2020. This trend has been driven in part by universities seeking to fill places and manage student numbers, as well as a desire to reduce stress and anxiety among applicants.\n\nHowever, the HMC argues that this approach is having unintended consequences. Buchanan warned that students who accept unconditional offers without achieving high grades may struggle to secure places on their preferred courses or even secure employment in their chosen fields. \"These youngsters have to carry their results with them for their whole careers,\" he stressed. \"If they don't have the academic foundation to succeed, they will be at a disadvantage.\"\n\nThe HMC is calling on universities to adopt a more balanced approach, offering conditional offers that require specific A-level grades or other academic achievements. This, they argue, would help to maintain the integrity of the A-level system and encourage students to strive for excellence.\n\nSome universities have already begun to rethink their approach to unconditional offers. For example, the University of Bristol has announced plans to reduce the number of unconditional offers it makes, while the University of Oxford has introduced a new system that requires students to achieve specific grades in certain subjects.\n\nThe debate over unconditional offers is likely to continue, with proponents arguing that they help to reduce stress and anxiety among students, while opponents claim that they undermine the value of academic achievement. As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of A-level grades and the university admissions process hangs in the balance.",

Potential clues to unraveling the mysteries behind why some marine mammals are susceptible to mass strandings, scientists hope. In a study published Wednesday in The Journal of Experimental Biology, scientists showed that dolphins and whales used more energy to swim fast than to cruise at normal speeds. This may seem obvious, but marine mammals aren't supposed to get tired swimming. Researchers at the Navy's Marine Mammal Program, in collaboration with scientists from the University of California, San Diego, conducted the study to better understand the physiological and behavioral responses of marine mammals to swimming. The six retired Navy dolphins, ranging in age from 10 to 15 years, were chosen for their calm and cooperative nature, making them ideal subjects for the experiment.\n\nThe dolphins were placed in a large, 20-meter-long tank with a depth of 3 meters, which was designed to mimic their natural aquatic environment. The tank was equipped with underwater cameras, sensors, and tracking devices to monitor the dolphins' movements, swimming patterns, and energy expenditure.\n\nThe study's findings revealed that dolphins and whales, despite their streamlined bodies, are not as efficient swimmers as previously thought. When swimming at high speeds, the animals used significantly more energy than when cruising at normal speeds. This unexpected discovery has significant implications for understanding the causes of mass strandings, which have been observed in various marine mammal species, including dolphins and whales.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that dolphins and whales, which are known for their impressive swimming abilities, are not as energy-efficient as we thought,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead researcher on the study. \"This suggests that they may be more susceptible to fatigue and exhaustion, which could contribute to their tendency to strand themselves on beaches.\"\n\nThe study's results also highlighted the importance of considering the energy expenditure of marine mammals when assessing the causes of mass strandings. Previous research has focused primarily on environmental factors, such as changes in ocean currents, water temperature, and noise pollution, as potential causes of strandings. However, the new findings suggest that physiological factors, such as energy expenditure, may also play a significant role.\n\nThe researchers hope that their study will contribute to a better understanding of the complex factors that lead to mass strandings, ultimately informing conservation efforts and improving the welfare of marine mammals. The study's findings have also sparked further research into the energy expenditure of other marine mammal species, including whales and sea lions.\n\nAs the scientific community continues to unravel the mysteries behind mass strandings, the retired Navy dolphins, now back in their natural habitat, have provided valuable insights into the world of marine mammals. Their contribution to the field of marine biology is a testament to the importance of interdisciplinary research and the power of collaboration between scientists and animals.",

But the report was sent back to the department rather than being investigated independently. It is unclear from the submission what ultimately happened with the investigation. According to the submission, the whistleblower claimed that the department's internal investigation was compromised due to the executive's involvement in the matter.

However, this characterization is misleading and requires correction. The Press Recognition Panel (PRP) was established by the Royal Charter on Self-Regulation of the Press in 2013, which was granted by the Privy Council. The Charter sets out the framework for self-regulation of the press in the UK, and the PRP is responsible for recognizing and overseeing the operation of independent press regulators.\n\nImpress, the regulator in question, is indeed recognized by the PRP, but this recognition is not a guarantee of independence. In fact, Impress's funding and governance structure raise concerns about its ability to operate independently. Impress is largely funded by the National Union of Journalists and the GMB union, which have a vested interest in promoting a more restrictive regulatory environment for the press.\n\nFurthermore, Impress's board is dominated by individuals with a history of advocating for stricter press regulation, including its chair, Joan Smith, who has been a vocal critic of the press and has called for greater government intervention in the industry. This raises questions about the regulator's ability to operate impartially and make decisions based on the public interest, rather than the interests of its funders or individual members.\n\nIn contrast, the existing regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), is funded by its member publications and is governed by a board that includes representatives from the press industry, as well as independent experts. While IPSO has faced criticism in the past, its independence and impartiality have been recognized by the PRP and the UK's Office of Communications (Ofcom).\n\nIn light of these concerns, it is essential to re-examine the role of Impress and its recognition by the PRP.

A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that the lawsuit over the move to replace five Viacom directors would go to trial, setting Oct. 17 as a tentative start date. The ruling by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick sets the stage for a high-stakes battle between Sumner Redstone's daughter, Shari Redstone, and his former protégé, Philippe Dauman, over control of the media conglomerate.\n\nShari Redstone, who serves as the chairwoman of Viacom's board of directors, has been pushing for a shake-up of the company's leadership, citing concerns over the company's performance and the need for fresh perspectives. Dauman, who was previously the CEO of Viacom, has resisted the changes, arguing that the company is on the right track and that the proposed replacements are unqualified for the positions.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed by Dauman and several other Viacom directors, alleges that Shari Redstone and her allies are trying to exert undue influence over the company and undermine its governance structure. The plaintiffs are seeking to block the proposed changes and have the court declare that the current board of directors is valid.\n\nThe trial is expected to be a complex and contentious affair, with both sides likely to present a range of arguments and evidence. The case will hinge on issues such as the company's bylaws, the roles and responsibilities of the board of directors, and the extent to which Shari Redstone's influence over the company is appropriate.\n\nThe outcome of the trial could have significant implications for Viacom's future, including the fate of its various subsidiaries, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, and CBS. The company's stock price has been volatile in recent months, and investors are likely to be watching the developments closely.\n\nIn a statement, Shari Redstone's representatives said that they were \"confident in the validity of the board's actions\" and looked forward to presenting their case in court. Dauman's representatives declined to comment.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several weeks, with opening statements scheduled to begin on October 17. The outcome is likely to be closely watched by the media industry and investors, as it could have significant implications for the future of Viacom and its various subsidiaries.",

When results are broken down by ethnic group, gender and free school meal (FSM) eligibility, white boys on FSM are the lowest attaining group, with only six out of 10 pupils (62%) meeting the required standard. Although official figures published by the government on Thursday show a two percentage point improvement on last year's results among this group, disadvantaged white boys still lag way behind their peers. According to the latest data, the phonics screening check, which is taken by all six-year-olds in England, has revealed a stark reality about the educational attainment of white boys from disadvantaged backgrounds. The results show that this group is significantly underachieving, with only 62% of pupils meeting the required standard.\n\nThe data also highlights the significant gap in attainment between white boys on free school meals (FSM) and their peers from other ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. For example, white girls on FSM achieved a 72% pass rate, while Asian girls on FSM achieved a 75% pass rate. Black boys on FSM also outperformed white boys on FSM, with a 70% pass rate.\n\nExperts have attributed the underachievement of white boys on FSM to a range of factors, including poverty, lack of access to quality education, and social and cultural factors. \"It's a complex issue, but we know that poverty and disadvantage can have a significant impact on a child's ability to learn,\" said Dr. Emma Smith, an education expert at the University of Cambridge. \"We need to address the root causes of poverty and disadvantage if we want to see improved educational outcomes for all children.\"\n\nThe government has announced plans to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged children, including increasing funding for schools in disadvantaged areas and providing additional support for teachers to help them identify and support struggling pupils. However, some critics have argued that more needs to be done to address the underlying issues that are contributing to the underachievement of white boys on FSM.\n\nThe results of the phonics screening check are a wake-up call for policymakers and educators, highlighting the need for a more targeted and effective approach to addressing the educational needs of disadvantaged children. As the government and education providers work to address these issues, it is essential that they prioritize the needs of white boys on FSM and work to close the attainment gap that exists between them and their peers.",

Users can, and should, opt in by clicking on the settings icon in the top right of their profile, hitting two-factor authentication in the following menu, and enabling the setting to \"require security code\". Once enabled, the app will text a six-digit code to users' phones every time they want to log in to the service. This new feature is a significant step forward in protecting Instagram users' accounts from potential threats. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to the traditional username and password combination, making it much harder for hackers to gain unauthorized access to an account.\n\nIn addition to protecting against password reuse and phishing, two-factor authentication can also help prevent account takeovers. If a hacker somehow manages to obtain a user's password, the two-factor authentication code sent to the user's phone will prevent them from logging in to the account.\n\nInstagram's decision to implement two-factor authentication is likely in response to the growing number of high-profile hacking incidents and data breaches that have affected social media platforms in recent years. As more and more users rely on social media to share personal and sensitive information, the importance of robust security measures cannot be overstated.\n\nOther social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, have also implemented two-factor authentication in recent years. It's encouraging to see Instagram follow suit, as it demonstrates a commitment to prioritizing user security and protecting users' personal data.\n\nFor users who are concerned about their online security, enabling two-factor authentication on Instagram is a simple and effective step they can take to protect their accounts.

In humans, this sort of behavior is thought to be linked to creativity and cognitive complexity. ...and cognitive complexity. However, research suggests that our ability to behave randomly may decline with age. A recent study published in the journal Psychological Science found that individuals under the age of 24 are more likely to exhibit random behavior, while those over 24 tend to become more predictable.\n\nThe study, conducted by a team of psychologists from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), used a series of tests to assess the randomness of participants' behavior. The tests included tasks such as drawing shapes, solving puzzles, and making decisions under uncertainty. The results showed that younger individuals were more likely to produce unpredictable and innovative responses, while older individuals tended to stick to more conventional and predictable patterns.\n\nThe researchers believe that this decline in random behavior may be due to the natural aging process, which can lead to a decrease in cognitive flexibility and an increase in reliance on established habits and routines. \"As people get older, they tend to become more set in their ways and less open to new experiences,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead author of the study. \"This can make it harder for them to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems.\"\n\nThe implications of this study are far-reaching, particularly in fields such as art, science, and business, where creativity and innovation are highly valued. \"If we can find ways to encourage people to behave more randomly, we may be able to boost their creative potential and improve their problem-solving skills,\" said Dr. Rodriguez.\n\nThe study's findings also have implications for our understanding of the human brain and its ability to adapt and change over time. \"Our results suggest that the brain's ability to generate random behavior may be more malleable than we previously thought,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"This could have important implications for our understanding of brain development and aging.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings suggest that our ability to behave randomly may decline with age, but it is not a fixed trait.

At stake is a noble place in evolutionary history: closest living analogue of the first-ever animal. ...the first-ever animal. The debate has been fueled by the discovery of new species and the development of advanced genetic analysis techniques. On one side, scientists have long argued that sponges are the most ancient living animals, with a lineage dating back over 600 million years. They point to the fact that sponges have a simple, multicellular body plan that is thought to be similar to that of the earliest animals.\n\nOn the other hand, researchers have been making a strong case for ctenophores as the true ancestors of all animals. They argue that the comb-like structure of ctenophores' cilia is a key innovation that allowed them to feed and move in ways that were not possible for sponges. This, they claim, makes ctenophores the more likely candidates for the first-ever animal.\n\nThe controversy has sparked heated debates at scientific conferences and has even led to the development of new research initiatives. Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading expert on sponge evolution, has been working on a new study that uses advanced genetic analysis techniques to compare the DNA of sponges and ctenophores. \"We're looking at the genetic code of these animals to see if we can find any clues about their evolutionary history,\" she explained. \"It's a complex problem, but we're making progress.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. John Smith, a ctenophore expert from the University of California, has been conducting experiments to study the feeding behavior of ctenophores. \"We're trying to understand how these animals capture their prey and how that relates to the evolution of animal body plans,\" he said. \"It's a fascinating area of research, and we're excited to see where it takes us.\"\n\nThe debate may seem esoteric to some, but it has important implications for our understanding of the history of life on Earth. If sponges are indeed the oldest living animals, it could have significant implications for our understanding of the Cambrian explosion, a period of rapid evolution that occurred around 540 million years ago. On the other hand, if ctenophores are the true ancestors of all animals, it could challenge our current understanding of animal evolution and lead to a re-evaluation of the fossil record.\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, scientists are eagerly awaiting the results of new research initiatives and the development of new technologies that will help them better understand the evolutionary history of these ancient animals.

Comets are sort of like dirty snowballs: As they travel through the solar system, they leave behind a dusty trail of rocks and ice that lingers in space long after they leave. When these tiny particles, known as meteoroids, enter Earth's atmosphere, they're traveling at incredibly high speeds, typically around 40,000 to 70,000 kilometers per hour. As they encounter the friction of the atmosphere, the meteoroids heat up and glow, producing the bright streaks of light we commonly refer to as meteors.\n\nMeteors can appear anywhere in the sky, but they often seem to radiate from a single point, known as the radiant. This is because meteoroids from the same comet or asteroid trail tend to follow a similar path, creating the illusion of a single source.\n\nThe largest meteoroids, measuring several meters in diameter, can produce fireballs that are bright enough to be seen during the day. These fireballs can also create sonic booms as they break apart and disintegrate in the atmosphere.\n\nNot all meteor showers are created equal, however. Some are more spectacular than others, depending on factors such as the size and composition of the meteoroids, as well as the speed and angle at which they enter the atmosphere.\n\nFor example, the Geminid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-December, is one of the most active and reliable annual events, producing up to 120 meteors per hour. The Perseid meteor shower, which occurs in mid-August, is another popular event, with rates of up to 60 meteors per hour.\n\nWhile meteor showers can be a thrilling sight, they also provide scientists with valuable information about the composition and origin of comets and asteroids. By studying the debris left behind by these celestial bodies, researchers can gain insights into the early history of the solar system and the formation of planets.\n\nSo, the next time you spot a meteor shower, remember that you're witnessing a tiny piece of our solar system's history, and that the fleeting moments of light and color in the sky are a reminder of the vast and wondrous universe that surrounds us.",

Many species of wrasses are preyed upon by larger fish, such as sharks and groupers, while others feed on small invertebrates like crustaceans and mollusks.\n\nUnfortunately, many wrasse species are facing threats to their survival due to human activities. Overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change are all taking a toll on wrasse populations, making conservation efforts a top priority.\n\nTo combat these threats, marine biologists and conservationists are working to protect wrasse habitats and reduce the impact of human activities on these fish. This includes establishing marine protected areas, implementing sustainable fishing practices, and educating the public about the importance of wrasse conservation.\n\nFor divers and snorkelers, spotting a wrasse is often a highlight of their underwater adventure. But for scientists, wrasses are more than just a pretty face – they're a vital part of the ocean's delicate ecosystem, and their conservation is crucial for the health of our planet.\n\nAs researchers continue to study these fascinating fish, they're uncovering new insights into their behavior, ecology, and evolution. From their complex social structures to their remarkable adaptability, wrasses are a true marvel of the ocean, and their importance cannot be overstated.",

The fraudster had taken out a loan from Sainsbury's Bank for £11,420 and paid it into the Santander account. Sainsbury's was informed and it raised an indemnity against Santander to recover the money, but told me my credit file would not be corrected until this was done. The Santander account has been closed, but the bank loan is still reflecting on my credit report. This seems a flagrant violation of my right to have inaccurate data rectified. As a victim of identity fraud, I was shocked and frustrated to discover that the bank loan was still reflecting on my credit report, despite the Santander account being closed. I felt that my right to have accurate and up-to-date information on my credit file was being ignored.\n\nI decided to take action and contacted the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to report the issue. The FCA advised me that I had the right to request a correction to my credit file and that I should contact the credit reference agency (CRA) responsible for maintaining my file.\n\nI contacted the CRA, Equifax, and requested that they correct my credit file to reflect the fact that the loan had been paid back and was no longer outstanding. However, Equifax told me that they could not correct my file until Sainsbury's Bank confirmed in writing that the loan had been paid back.\n\nI was left feeling frustrated and confused, as it seemed that the banks were not communicating effectively and that I was caught in the middle. I decided to contact Sainsbury's Bank directly and ask them to provide written confirmation that the loan had been paid back.\n\nAfter several weeks of chasing, I finally received a letter from Sainsbury's Bank confirming that the loan had been paid back in full. I sent this letter to Equifax, along with a copy of the letter from the FCA, and requested that they correct my credit file.\n\nIt took several more weeks, but eventually, Equifax corrected my credit file to reflect the fact that the loan had been paid back and was no longer outstanding. I was relieved and pleased that my credit file was now accurate, but I was also left feeling frustrated that it had taken so long and that I had to go to such lengths to get the issue resolved.\n\nIn the end, I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of monitoring my credit file regularly and being proactive in correcting any errors that may arise. I also learned that it's essential to keep records of all correspondence and to chase up issues with the relevant parties to ensure that they are resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner.\n\nAs a victim of identity fraud, I hope that my experience can serve as a warning to others to be vigilant and to take steps to protect their personal and financial information. I also hope that the banks and credit reference agencies will take steps to improve their communication and to make it easier for victims of identity fraud to get their credit files corrected.",

        "Text": "A growing proportion of independent faith schools are being failed by Ofsted because of concerns about leadership and the teaching of British values, according to official statistics. The schools watchdog said there had been a sharp decline in inspection outcomes for smaller, fee-paying schools, in particular faith schools. Latest figures show 49% of private faith schools inspected by Ofsted were judged less than good at their most recent inspection and 26% were inadequate. The details were released as part of Ofsted's roundup of inspections of non-association independent schools – smaller, fee-paying schools not part of groups affiliated to the Independent Schools Council. The figures, which cover inspections from 2018 to 2022, suggest that a significant number of independent faith schools are struggling to meet Ofsted's expectations. The watchdog has raised concerns about the leadership of these schools, citing issues such as inadequate governance, poor communication, and a lack of clear direction.\n\nOfsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said: \"While many independent faith schools provide an excellent education, we have concerns about the leadership and management of some of these schools. We are seeing too many instances of poor governance, inadequate teaching, and a failure to promote British values.\"\n\nThe decline in inspection outcomes for private faith schools is particularly concerning, given their reputation for providing high-quality education. However, Ofsted's findings suggest that many of these schools are failing to live up to their promise.\n\nExperts have attributed the decline to a range of factors, including increased competition for students, a lack of funding, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Some have also suggested that the growing popularity of faith schools has led to a lack of accountability, as parents are often willing to overlook shortcomings in order to secure a place for their child.\n\nDespite the concerns, many independent faith schools have defended their record, arguing that Ofsted's inspections are too narrow and do not take into account the unique values and ethos of faith-based education.\n\nOne such school, St. Mary's Catholic School, said in a statement: \"We are proud of our school's strong track record of providing an excellent education to our students. While we acknowledge that Ofsted has raised concerns about our leadership, we believe that our school is doing important work in promoting British values and providing a values-based education.\"\n\nThe findings have sparked a debate about the role of faith schools in British education, with some arguing that they should be subject to stricter regulations and inspections. Others have defended the autonomy of faith schools, arguing that they provide a valuable alternative to state-funded education.\n\nAs the debate continues, Ofsted has pledged to continue monitoring the performance of independent faith schools, with a particular focus on leadership and the teaching of British values. The watchdog has also announced plans to provide additional support to schools that are struggling to meet its expectations.\n\nFor parents, the findings are a wake-up call, highlighting the importance of doing their research and choosing a school that is committed to providing a high-quality education. As the education landscape continues to evolve, it is clear that the future of independent faith schools will be shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including inspection outcomes, parental demand, and government policy.",

        "Text": "The number of applications to build new shops fell by 9% in the past year, according to a report on Monday, marking the seventh decline in a row. There were 6,700 applications for new retail developments in 2015, down from 7,360, according to commercial law firm EMW. They are down by nearly a half from the pre-recession peak of 11,900 in 2008. The decline in new shop applications is a worrying trend for the retail industry, which has been struggling to adapt to changing consumer habits and the rise of online shopping. The report suggests that the decline is not limited to a particular region or type of retail, but is a widespread phenomenon affecting high streets and shopping centers across the country.\n\nExperts point to a number of factors contributing to the decline, including the rise of online shopping, changing consumer behavior, and increased competition from out-of-town retail parks. The decline is also attributed to the high costs and complexity of opening a new shop, including the need for significant upfront investment and the challenges of navigating planning regulations.\n\nThe decline in new shop applications is also having a knock-on effect on the wider economy, with many construction companies and suppliers reporting a decline in business. The report warns that if the trend continues, it could lead to a significant loss of jobs and a decline in local economic activity.\n\nDespite the gloomy outlook, some experts are calling for a more positive spin on the figures. They argue that the decline in new shop applications could be an opportunity for retailers to focus on creating more sustainable and efficient stores, and to invest in online and digital channels.\n\nThe report's findings are likely to be of concern to policymakers, who are already grappling with the challenges of reviving high streets and supporting local businesses. The government has announced a number of initiatives aimed at supporting the retail industry, including a review of business rates and a scheme to encourage more small businesses to take on apprentices.\n\nIn the meantime, retailers are being forced to adapt to the changing retail landscape. Many are investing in online platforms and digital marketing, while others are focusing on creating unique and experiential shopping experiences to attract customers. As the retail industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether the decline in new shop applications is a temporary blip or a more permanent shift in the way we shop.",

Harry was born and brought up in County Durham, the son of William Jones, a miner, and his wife, May (nee Cowley). His father was sent down the pit at the age of 12 to be the family breadwinner. Harry's mother left her village school at 14 but was a great reader. Raised on the estate of the Backhouses, the Darlington bankers, where her mother was housekeeper and her father coachman, May had access to their library, and thanks to this, Harry benefited from a pre-school education. Unemployment in Durham caused the family to move in 1940 to Coventry, where they experienced wartime air raids. Grammar schools were then fee paying, with a few bright children selected for special places, and Harry gained one at King Edward VI school, Nuneaton. Harry's academic achievements at King Edward VI school laid the foundation for his future success. He excelled in his studies, particularly in mathematics and science, and was awarded a scholarship to study at the University of Birmingham. It was during his time at university that Harry discovered his passion for teaching and his desire to make a positive impact on young people's lives.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in mathematics, Harry began his teaching career at a local comprehensive school in Coventry. He quickly established himself as a dedicated and inspiring educator, known for his ability to make complex concepts accessible to his students. His enthusiasm and passion for teaching soon earned him a promotion to head of mathematics, a position he held for several years.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Harry made the transition to college education, becoming a principal at a sixth-form college in the West Midlands. He spent the next two decades leading the college, guiding students through their A-levels and helping them prepare for their future careers. During his time at the college, Harry was instrumental in developing new programs and courses, including a pioneering initiative in adult education.\n\nIn the 1990s, Harry moved to a technical college in the East Midlands, where he continued to inspire and motivate students. He remained committed to adult education, recognizing the importance of lifelong learning and the need to provide opportunities for people to upskill and reskill. Harry's dedication to his students and his passion for teaching earned him numerous awards and recognition throughout his career.\n\nThroughout his life, Harry remained humble and grounded, crediting his parents and his early experiences for shaping his values and work ethic. Despite his many accomplishments, he never forgot his humble beginnings and remained committed to giving back to his community. Harry is survived by his wife, his children, and his grandchildren, who will always remember him as a kind, wise, and inspiring educator.",

        "Text": "Campus rape is finally receiving the attention it merits. But efforts to address the problem are developing in too scattershot a fashion, largely because of widespread confusion about the role of the university in responding to sexual assault. Institutions of higher education cannot substitute for a functioning criminal justice system, where the interests of the state are vindicated. As a result, many universities are struggling to navigate the complex and often contradictory responsibilities that come with addressing campus rape. On one hand, institutions are under pressure to provide a safe and supportive environment for students, which includes responding to reports of sexual assault in a way that prioritizes the well-being and dignity of the survivor. On the other hand, universities are also bound by legal and ethical obligations to maintain the integrity of the criminal justice system and ensure that allegations of sexual assault are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.\n\nThis tension has led to a patchwork of approaches to addressing campus rape, with some institutions taking a more proactive and comprehensive approach, while others have been criticized for being too slow to respond or for prioritizing the interests of the accused over those of the survivor. For example, some universities have established dedicated offices or teams to handle reports of sexual assault, while others have relied on existing student affairs or counseling services to handle the response.\n\nDespite these efforts, many experts argue that the university's role in responding to sexual assault is often unclear, and that this confusion can have serious consequences for survivors. \"When universities are unclear about their role, it can create a sense of powerlessness and disempowerment for survivors, who may feel like they are being forced to navigate a complex and often hostile system,\" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, a leading expert on campus sexual assault. \"Universities need to be clear and transparent about their policies and procedures, and they need to prioritize the well-being and dignity of survivors above all else.\"\n\nIn recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of campus sexual assault that have highlighted the need for clearer guidelines and more effective responses. For example, in 2019, a report by the National Center for Education Statistics found that one in five female college students had experienced sexual assault during their time at university. Similarly, a 2020 report by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights found that many universities were not providing adequate support and resources to survivors of sexual assault.\n\nIn response to these concerns, many universities are now working to develop more comprehensive and effective approaches to addressing campus rape. This includes establishing clear policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual assault, providing training for faculty and staff on how to support survivors, and increasing resources and support for survivors. \"Universities have a critical role to play in addressing campus rape, and we need to be doing more to support survivors and to hold perpetrators accountable,\" said Dr. Johnson. \"By working together, we can create a safer and more supportive environment for all students.\"",

It said the move would allow it to tap into a UK craft beer market worth £420m and predicted to reach £1bn by 2020. The move is part of Aldi's efforts to expand its range of specialty drinks and appeal to a wider customer base. The retailer has seen a significant increase in demand for craft beers in recent months, with sales of the products up by over 50% year-on-year.\n\nAldi's beer buyer, Mark Clement, said: \"We're excited to bring these fantastic British craft beers to our customers.

She has written more than 270 entries about forgotten but influential women in science – such as Susan Goldberg, the first female editor of National Geographic. Research shows just 16% of Wikipedia editors are female and only 17% of entries dedicated to notable people are for women. Western Research by Oxford University in 2016 revealed that the vast bulk of content written about most African countries on Wikipedia was by editors in Europe and North America. Wade's efforts have not only helped to increase the representation of women in science on Wikipedia, but also sparked a wider conversation about the importance of online inclusivity. Her work has also inspired others to take up the mantle and address the glaring gaps in online content.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges facing Wade and her fellow Wikipedia editors is the lack of diversity among the platform's user base. According to a 2019 report by the Wikimedia Foundation, the organization that oversees Wikipedia, only 16% of editors are female, and this figure is even lower for other underrepresented groups such as people of color and individuals with disabilities.\n\nDespite these challenges, Wade remains optimistic about the potential for Wikipedia to become a more inclusive and diverse platform. \"I think it's really important to have a diverse range of voices and perspectives online,\" she said in an interview. \"Wikipedia is one of the most widely used sources of information in the world, and it's crucial that it reflects the diversity of the world we live in.\"\n\nWade's work has also highlighted the importance of online literacy and digital skills in bridging the gap between those who are able to contribute to online platforms and those who are not. \"Many people, particularly women and marginalized communities, lack the digital skills and confidence to contribute to online platforms,\" said Dr. Sarah Jones, a researcher at the University of Oxford. \"This can create a vicious cycle, where those who are already more privileged are able to dominate online spaces, while those who are less privileged are left behind.\"\n\nTo address this issue, Wade and her colleagues are working to develop online training programs and resources that can help people from underrepresented groups to develop the digital skills they need to contribute to online platforms. They are also working to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment on Wikipedia, by promoting diversity and inclusion within the platform's community of editors.\n\nAs Wade's work continues to inspire others to take up the mantle and address the gaps in online content, it is clear that the fight for online inclusivity is far from over. However, with the dedication and passion of individuals like Wade, it is possible to create a more diverse and representative online world, where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and be heard.",

On Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan ruled that a lower court had erred in dismissing a defamation lawsuit filed by three former members of the fraternity at the center of the 2014 article. The ruling, which was made public on Tuesday, is a significant setback for Rolling Stone, which has been embroiled in controversy over the article since its publication in 2014. The article, titled \"A Rape on Campus,\" told the story of a woman who claimed to have been gang-raped at a fraternity house at the University of Virginia. However, an investigation by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism later found that the article contained numerous inaccuracies and fabricated details.\n\nThe defamation lawsuit was filed by three former members of the fraternity, who claimed that the article had damaged their reputations and caused them emotional distress. The lower court had initially dismissed the lawsuit, but the appeals court has now reversed that decision, allowing the lawsuit to move forward.\n\nRolling Stone's decision to put itself up for sale comes as the magazine is facing increased scrutiny over its editorial practices and reporting methods. The company has been under pressure to address concerns about the accuracy and fairness of its reporting, particularly in the wake of the controversy surrounding the UVA article.\n\nThe lawsuit is likely to be a major concern for potential buyers of the magazine, who will be looking for a stable and reputable publication to invest in. The controversy surrounding the UVA article has already led to a significant decline in Rolling Stone's circulation and advertising revenue, and the ongoing litigation is likely to further erode the magazine's reputation and value.\n\nIn a statement, Rolling Stone said that it was \"disappointed\" by the appeals court's decision and would continue to defend itself against the lawsuit. The company has also maintained that it stands by the original article and its reporting on the UVA case.\n\nThe case is expected to go to trial in the coming months, and could have significant implications for Rolling Stone and the journalism industry as a whole. The lawsuit highlights the importance of accuracy and fairness in reporting, and the potential consequences of getting it wrong.\n\nFor Rolling Stone, the lawsuit is a major distraction at a time when the company is trying to navigate a challenging media landscape.

UK car factories produced 1.52m vehicles last year, 9.1% fewer than 2017, according to figures published on Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK auto industry lobby group. Production for the British market fell by 16.3%. Investment into British car manufacturing almost halved during the year to £588.6m, a fall which the SMMT blamed on Brexit uncertainty. Publicly announced investments were lower than in any year since 2012, the first year comparable data was collected. The decline in British car production is a significant concern for the industry, which has been a major contributor to the UK's economy. The SMMT has warned that the slump in production is not only a result of the current economic uncertainty but also a sign of a long-term decline in the industry.\n\nThe UK's car manufacturing industry has been facing challenges in recent years, including rising production costs, increased competition from overseas manufacturers, and a decline in demand for traditional diesel cars. However, the impact of Brexit uncertainty has been a significant factor in the decline of the industry.\n\nThe SMMT has called on the government to provide clarity on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, in order to restore confidence in the industry. The organization has also urged the government to provide support to the industry, including investment in new technologies and infrastructure.\n\nThe decline in British car production has also had a significant impact on the country's automotive supply chain. Many component manufacturers and suppliers are based in the UK and rely on the car industry for their business. The decline in production has led to a decline in demand for these components, which has resulted in job losses and business closures.\n\nThe impact of the decline in British car production is not limited to the industry itself. The decline has also had a significant impact on the wider economy, with the industry accounting for around 10% of the UK's total exports. The decline in production has also led to a decline in tax revenue for the government, which could have a significant impact on public services.\n\nIn response to the decline in production, the government has announced plans to provide support to the industry, including a new investment fund to support the development of new technologies and infrastructure. The government has also announced plans to provide support to component manufacturers and suppliers, in order to help them adapt to the changing market.\n\nThe decline in British car production is a significant concern for the industry and the wider economy.

National Grid confirmed that gas from a Russian field targeted by US sanctions had been delivered by a Russian icebreaker to storage facilities at the Isle of Grain in Kent on Thursday night. Russian media seized on the delivery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to claim it would \"keep Britons from freezing this winter\" while the Russian embassy in the UK tweeted: \"Feeling cold? However, the reality appears to be far from Moscow's boasts. According to industry sources, the LNG shipment is already being re-exported, with the vessel that brought it to the UK now preparing to set sail again, bound for another destination.\n\nThe development has raised questions about the true nature of Russia's gas supplies to the UK and whether the country is indeed capable of meeting its own energy demands, let alone those of its European neighbors.\n\n\"This is a classic example of Russian gas being used as a pawn in their geopolitical games,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, an energy expert at the University of Oxford. \"Russia has been trying to flex its muscles by claiming it can supply the UK with gas, but in reality, this shipment was always intended for re-export to other markets.\"\n\nThe re-export of the LNG shipment has also sparked concerns about the potential for Russian gas to be used to manipulate energy markets and undermine European energy security.\n\n\"This is a worrying trend,\" said MEP and energy committee chair, Bas Eickhout. \"Russia is using its gas supplies as a tool to exert influence and pressure on its neighbors, and we need to be vigilant in monitoring the situation to ensure that European energy security is not compromised.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the Russian gas shipment, National Grid has maintained that the UK's energy supplies are secure and that the country is well-prepared to meet its gas demands this winter.\n\n\"We have a diverse range of gas suppliers and a robust infrastructure in place to ensure a reliable supply of energy to our customers,\" said a National Grid spokesperson. \"We are confident that we will be able to meet demand this winter, regardless of the origin of the gas.\"\n\nAs the debate surrounding Russian gas supplies to the UK continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the country's energy landscape is becoming increasingly complex, with multiple players vying for influence and control. As the winter months approach, it remains to be seen whether Russia will be able to deliver on its promises or whether its claims of being a reliable gas supplier will prove to be nothing more than empty boasts.",

The funding is in place. According to sources close to the deal, the consortium, which includes Diamond, a former CEO of Barclays, and other prominent investors, is planning to submit a formal bid for the bank's African operations in the coming weeks. The move comes as Barclays continues to divest its non-core assets and focus on its core UK and European operations.\n\nThe African operations, which include Barclays' presence in 12 countries across the continent, have been a significant contributor to the bank's profits in recent years. However, the bank has been under pressure to reduce its exposure to the region due to regulatory concerns and declining profitability.\n\nDiamond, who was CEO of Barclays from 2010 to 2012, has extensive experience in the African financial sector, having previously worked as CEO of Barclays Africa Group, the bank's African subsidiary. His involvement in the consortium is seen as a significant boost to the bid, given his deep understanding of the region and his connections within the financial industry.\n\nThe consortium is believed to have secured significant funding for the bid, with reports suggesting that it has committed to investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the African operations. This could help to alleviate concerns among regulators and stakeholders about the bank's ability to maintain its African presence.\n\nThe bid is expected to face stiff competition from other suitors, including rival banks and private equity firms.

The rise of streaming services has revolutionized the way we consume television shows, allowing viewers to watch their favorite programs on-demand and skip over commercials altogether. For many, this has been a game-changer, freeing up valuable time that was once spent sitting through ads.\n\nFor Emily Wilson, a busy working professional, the ability to skip commercials is a major perk. \"I have so many shows to keep up with, it saves time,\" she explains. \"Any second I spend watching a commercial is time wasted.\" As someone who rarely sees ads due to her use of streaming services, Emily's experience is likely atypical of the average viewer.\n\nHowever, not everyone is as pleased with the commercial-free experience offered by streaming services. Some argue that the lack of ads has led to a loss of revenue for content creators, making it more difficult for them to produce high-quality programming.\n\n\"I understand why people might want to skip commercials, but I think it's important to support the creators of the shows we love,\" says Sarah Lee, a freelance writer and TV enthusiast. \"If we don't see ads, how will they be able to afford to make more episodes?\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the trend towards commercial-free streaming shows no signs of slowing down.

This is Viacom's most significant move into streaming, now the go-to strategy for media companies as more and more viewers forgo traditional cable subscriptions. The emergence of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu has hastened the decline of the pay TV business and has upended the media universe. The acquisition of PlutoTV marks a significant shift in Viacom's strategy, as the company seeks to adapt to the changing media landscape. PlutoTV, which launched in 2014, is a free, ad-supported streaming service that offers a range of TV shows, movies, and on-demand content. The service has gained popularity among cord-cutters and cord-nevers, who are increasingly turning to streaming services for their entertainment needs.\n\nViacom's acquisition of PlutoTV is seen as a strategic move to expand its reach and offerings in the streaming space. PlutoTV's free, ad-supported model aligns with Viacom's existing business model, which has historically relied on advertising revenue. The acquisition also gives Viacom access to PlutoTV's large user base, which is expected to grow as more viewers turn to streaming services.\n\nThe acquisition is also seen as a way for Viacom to compete with larger streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, which have disrupted the traditional pay TV business. Viacom's portfolio of popular TV shows and movies, including \"Jersey Shore\" and \"Dora the Explorer,\" will be integrated into PlutoTV's platform, providing users with a wider range of content options.\n\nIndustry analysts predict that the acquisition will have a significant impact on the media landscape, as more traditional media companies follow Viacom's lead and invest in streaming services. \"This acquisition is a game-changer for Viacom and the media industry as a whole,\" said John Smith, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley. \"Viacom is recognizing that the future of entertainment is streaming, and they're making a bold move to get ahead of the curve.\"\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close in the coming months, pending regulatory approval. Viacom has not disclosed how it plans to integrate PlutoTV into its existing operations, but industry insiders expect the company to leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise to expand PlutoTV's offerings and reach.\n\nAs the media landscape continues to evolve, Viacom's acquisition of PlutoTV is a significant development that will have far-reaching implications for the industry. With this move, Viacom is positioning itself as a major player in the streaming space, and its acquisition of PlutoTV is a testament to the company's commitment to adapting to the changing media landscape.",

But if both you and your spouse work and you have school-age children, you may have another perspective on summer: as the season when you must juggle your schedule and scrounge up affordable child care until school reopens. In about 60 percent of two-parent households with children under 18, both parents work, according to Pew Research Center, a subsidiary of the Pew Charitable Trusts. As the summer months approach, many families with working parents face a daunting challenge: finding affordable and reliable childcare for their school-age children. According to the Pew Research Center, in approximately 60 percent of two-parent households with children under 18, both parents work outside the home. This means that millions of families must navigate the complexities of childcare arrangements, often on a limited budget.\n\nFor many, summer means a break from the structured routine of the school year, but it can also be a time of increased stress and anxiety. With summer camps and extracurricular activities often priced out of reach for many families, parents are left to scramble for solutions. Some may turn to family members or friends for help, while others may opt for more formal childcare arrangements, such as summer camps or daycare programs.\n\nHowever, these options can come with their own set of challenges. Summer camps, for example, can be expensive, with prices ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per week. Daycare programs, on the other hand, may have limited availability and may not provide the same level of structure and activity that children receive during the school year.\n\nIn response to these challenges, some communities are stepping up to provide support to working families. Many cities and towns offer free or low-cost summer programs for children, which can include activities such as swimming, arts and crafts, and outdoor games. These programs are often staffed by trained professionals and provide a safe and fun environment for children to socialize and learn.\n\nAdditionally, some employers are recognizing the challenges faced by working parents and are offering their own solutions. Some companies, for example, offer flexible scheduling or telecommuting options, which can help parents balance work and family responsibilities. Others may provide on-site childcare services or partner with local providers to offer discounted rates to their employees.\n\nAs the summer months approach, it's clear that finding affordable and reliable childcare is a pressing concern for many working families. While it may require some creative problem-solving and resourcefulness, there are many options available to help parents navigate this challenging time. By working together, communities and employers can help support working families and ensure that every child has access to the care and activities they need to thrive.",

Those that have remained on the fence until now have until 11am on Saturday in the UK to update for free. After that they will be stuck on whichever version of Windows they currently have installed, unless they purchase a Windows 10 upgrade. For many annoyed by Microsoft's aggressive pushing of Windows 10 to their computers, through automatic downloads, installs that happen while they're away making tea or interrupting the weather or pro-gamer streams, the end of the free upgrade period will come as a welcome relief. As the clock strikes 11am on Saturday, the free upgrade window will officially close, marking the end of an era for Windows 7 and 8 users. For those who have been holding out, the decision to upgrade or stick with their current operating system has never been more crucial.\n\nMicrosoft's aggressive push for Windows 10 has been a contentious issue, with many users feeling frustrated by the company's tactics. The automatic downloads and installs, which have been known to occur at inopportune moments, have been a major source of annoyance for some. However, for others, the benefits of upgrading to Windows 10 have been a major draw.\n\nSo, what are the key differences between Windows 7 and 8, and why should users consider upgrading to Windows 10? For starters, Windows 10 offers a range of new features and improvements, including a more streamlined interface, improved security, and enhanced gaming capabilities.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of Windows 10 is its improved security features. The operating system includes a range of built-in security tools, including Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, which provides real-time protection against malware and other threats. Additionally, Windows 10 includes a feature called Windows Hello, which allows users to log in using facial recognition or fingerprint scanning.\n\nAnother key benefit of Windows 10 is its improved gaming capabilities. The operating system includes a range of features designed specifically for gamers, including the ability to stream games to Xbox consoles and PCs, and support for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences.\n\nIn terms of the interface, Windows 10 offers a more streamlined and intuitive design. The operating system includes a range of new features, such as the Action Center, which allows users to quickly access important notifications and settings. Additionally, Windows 10 includes a feature called the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which allows users to run Linux applications directly on their Windows 10 machine.\n\nDespite the benefits of upgrading to Windows 10, there are some potential drawbacks to consider. For example, some users have reported issues with compatibility and performance, particularly on older hardware. Additionally, the upgrade process can be time-consuming and may require a significant amount of disk space.\n\nIn conclusion, the end of the free Windows 10 upgrade period marks a significant milestone for Windows 7 and 8 users. While some users may be relieved to be free from Microsoft's aggressive push for Windows 10, others may see the benefits of upgrading to the latest operating system. Whether or not to upgrade is ultimately a personal decision, but for those who do, the rewards could be significant.",

As well as research into the peasantry, he produced interesting work on the role of Russian émigrés in Britain during the final half-century of Tsarist rule. Born in Richmond, south-west London, John was adopted by Henrietta (nee Grundy) and Albert Slatter, a wine taster. He went to Latymer Upper school, Hammersmith, then read Russian and French at Jesus College, Cambridge (1963-66). At Cambridge, we became close friends from the start. In the summer of 1964 we travelled to Moscow to attend a language course. During our time in Moscow, John's fascination with the Russian language and culture only deepened. He was an exceptional linguist, and his fluency in Russian allowed him to delve deeper into the complexities of the country's history and society. This experience would later shape his academic pursuits and provide a unique perspective on the Russian émigré community in Britain.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate degree, John went on to pursue a Master's degree in Russian Studies at the University of Oxford. It was during this time that he developed a keen interest in the peasantry, a subject that would become the focus of his doctoral research. His dissertation, \"The Russian Peasantry: A Study of their Social and Economic Conditions,\" was published in 1972 and received critical acclaim for its thoroughness and insight.\n\nJohn's academic career was marked by a series of prestigious appointments, including lecturer positions at the University of London and the University of Edinburgh.

His experiences abroad not only enriched his understanding of the region but also informed his teaching and research.\n\nJohn's passing leaves a significant void in the academic community, and he will be deeply missed by his colleagues, students, and friends.

The Met Office forecasting service said that in the period from 2018 to 2022, annual global average temperatures are likely to exceed 1C above pre-industrial levels and could top the 1.5C threshold set as an aspiration by the global Paris climate change deal in 2015. \"It is now possible that continued warming from greenhouse gases along with natural variability could combine so we temporarily exceed 1.5C in the next five years,\" said Stephen Belcher, the chief scientist at the Met Office. The forecast, which is based on current trends and projections, highlights the urgent need for governments and industries to accelerate their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources. The Met Office's warning comes as the world is still struggling to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nThe 1.5C threshold is seen as a critical limit, beyond which the risks of catastrophic climate change become significantly higher. Rising temperatures above this threshold could lead to more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and storms, as well as more rapid melting of polar ice caps and sea-level rise.\n\nThe Met Office's forecast is based on a combination of climate models and observations, which suggest that the current rate of warming is faster than previously thought. The scientists found that the past five years have been the warmest on record, with 2020 being the hottest year globally.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for governments and industries to take immediate action to reduce their carbon footprint and transition to cleaner energy sources,\" said Dr. Belcher. \"We need to see a significant reduction in emissions in the next few years to avoid breaching the 1.5C threshold.\"\n\nThe forecast has sparked concerns among climate experts and policymakers, who are urging governments to take bold action to address the crisis. The European Union, for example, has set a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, while the United States has re-entered the Paris Agreement under President Joe Biden.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, the world is still far from meeting its climate goals. According to the United Nations, the current rate of progress is insufficient to meet the 1.5C target, and the world is on track to exceed the threshold by the mid-2030s.\n\nThe Met Office's forecast is likely to put pressure on governments to take more decisive action to address the climate crisis. The British government, for example, has been criticized for its slow progress on climate change, and the forecast may prompt it to reconsider its plans to increase carbon emissions in the coming years.\n\nAs the world grapples with the implications of the forecast, climate experts are warning that the consequences of inaction will be severe. \"We are running out of time to take action on climate change,\" said Dr. Belcher. \"The next few years are critical in determining the course of our planet's future.\"",

The announcement is a setback for Lloyds Banking Group, which bought HBOS in 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employers, were jailed in 2017 for committing the fraud, which centred on the Reading branch of the bank. It was described by the judge as an \"utterly corrupt scheme\" that left small business owners cheated, defeated and penniless. The National Crime Agency's (NCA) decision to reopen the investigation comes after a review of new evidence, which has raised concerns that some individuals may have been involved in the fraud beyond the six individuals who were initially convicted.\n\nThe fraud, which took place between 2003 and 2007, involved a complex scheme in which a group of individuals, including some former HBOS employees, used fake invoices and other fraudulent means to obtain large sums of money from small business owners. The scheme was orchestrated by a group of individuals who were known to the bank and had been given access to sensitive information.\n\nThe NCA's decision to launch a fresh probe is a significant setback for Lloyds Banking Group, which acquired HBOS in 2008. The bank has previously faced criticism for its handling of the fraud, with some critics arguing that it failed to take adequate steps to prevent the fraud from occurring.\n\nThe announcement has also been welcomed by some of the small business owners who were affected by the fraud. \"It's about time that the authorities took this fraud seriously,\" said one small business owner who was cheated out of £100,000 by the fraudsters. \"We've been waiting for justice for years, and it's only right that those responsible are held accountable.\"\n\nThe NCA's investigation is expected to take several months to complete, and it is unclear at this stage whether any new charges will be brought. However, the agency has vowed to leave no stone unturned in its pursuit of justice for the victims of the fraud.\n\nIn a statement, the NCA said: \"We are committed to ensuring that those responsible for this serious fraud are brought to justice.

The group, which consists of Iberia, Vueling and the recent addition of Aer Lingus as well as BA, said it expected to drive up operating profits by about another €1bn in 2016. Chief executive Willie Walsh said the results far exceeded the targets originally set in 2011 when BA merged with Iberia. The airline industry has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including volatile fuel prices, intense competition, and global economic uncertainty. However, IAG's impressive results demonstrate its ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nThe company's success can be attributed to a combination of factors, including its strategic acquisitions, cost-cutting initiatives, and efforts to improve operational efficiency. The addition of Aer Lingus to its portfolio, in particular, is expected to drive significant growth and profitability in the coming years.\n\nIAG's ability to capitalize on falling fuel prices has also been a major contributor to its success. With fuel costs accounting for a significant portion of an airline's operating expenses, a reduction in fuel prices can have a substantial impact on profitability. The company has taken steps to mitigate the impact of fuel price volatility by hedging its fuel costs and implementing fuel-efficient technologies.\n\nDespite the challenges it faces, IAG remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company plans to continue driving growth and profitability through a combination of organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions. Its focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency will also help to maintain its competitive edge in a highly competitive market.\n\nIn a statement, Chief Executive Willie Walsh said, \"We are delighted with our full-year results, which demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business. We have made significant progress in implementing our strategy, and we are well-positioned to drive growth and profitability in the years ahead.\"\n\nIAG's impressive results are a testament to its ability to navigate the complexities of the airline industry and emerge as a leader in the market. As the company continues to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions, it is likely to remain a major player in the global airline industry for years to come.",

Burnt Yates school, in north Yorkshire, a small jewel of a rural primary school with excellent buildings, fields and woodland and an active and generous trust, must close at the end of this academic year. When it was backed into a corner it could not find an academic chain to take it on; amalgamation came to nought and now the school must close. Burnt Yates school was founded and endowed in 1760; over 250 years of excellent education have taken place since then, supported until recently by one of the very best education authorities in the country. After a series of disastrous decisions by the current local authority, a poor Ofsted report put the seal on the school's fate. Huge efforts were made by parents, governors, trustees, our MP and the local community but to no avail. The closure of Burnt Yates school is a devastating blow to the local community, which has been left reeling from the news. The school's rich history and tradition of excellence in education make its demise all the more poignant.\n\nThe school's struggles began when it was forced to become an academy, a move that many believed was a mistake. Despite its excellent facilities and dedicated staff, the school was unable to find a suitable sponsor to take it over. A proposed amalgamation with another local school also failed to come to fruition, leaving the school with no choice but to close its doors.\n\nThe decision to close the school has been met with widespread anger and disappointment from parents, pupils, and the wider community. Many have expressed their sadness and frustration on social media, using the hashtag #SaveBurntYates to voice their opposition to the closure.\n\nLocal MP, [Name], has also spoken out against the decision, saying that the closure of the school is a \"tragedy\" and that the government needs to take action to support small, rural schools like Burnt Yates. The MP has called for an urgent review of the academy system and for more support to be given to schools that are struggling.\n\nThe closure of Burnt Yates school is not just a loss for the local community, but also for the education system as a whole. The school's closure is a stark reminder of the challenges that many small, rural schools face, and the need for greater support and investment in these areas.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the community will come together to plan a farewell event to mark the school's closure. The event will be an opportunity for pupils, parents, and staff to say goodbye to the school and to celebrate its rich history and tradition of excellence.\n\nDespite the closure of the school, the community is determined to keep the memory of Burnt Yates alive. A petition has been launched to save the school, and many are calling for the government to take action to support small, rural schools like Burnt Yates.\n\nThe closure of Burnt Yates school is a sad day for the education system, and a reminder of the challenges that many small, rural schools face. However, the community's determination to keep the school's memory alive is a testament to the power of community spirit and the importance of preserving our educational heritage.",

The Devastating Impact of Recent Hurricanes on the United States\n\nThe past few years have seen an unprecedented number of devastating hurricanes strike the United States, leaving a trail of destruction and heartbreak in their wake. From Katrina's catastrophic flooding of New Orleans in 2005 to Harvey's record-breaking rainfall in Texas in 2017, Maria's destructive path through Puerto Rico in 2017, and Dorian's brutal assault on the Bahamas and the southeastern United States in 2019, these powerful storms have tested the resilience of communities and the country as a whole.\n\nThe economic toll of these disasters has been staggering. According to estimates, Hurricane Katrina caused over $160 billion in damages, making it the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Hurricane Harvey's impact was similarly severe, with damages estimated at over $125 billion. The destruction caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is still being felt today, with an estimated $90 billion in damages and a long-term impact on the island's economy and infrastructure.\n\nBut the human cost of these disasters has been just as devastating. Thousands of people have lost their lives, and countless more have been displaced or left without access to basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The psychological trauma inflicted by these events has also been significant, with many survivors struggling to cope with the aftermath of the disasters.\n\nIn response to these devastating events, the federal government has taken steps to improve disaster preparedness and response. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has implemented new protocols for disaster response and recovery, and the National Weather Service has upgraded its forecasting capabilities to provide more accurate and timely warnings to the public.\n\nAt the state and local level, communities have come together to rebuild and recover. Non-profit organizations, businesses, and individuals have donated time, resources, and financial support to help those affected by the disasters. The outpouring of support has been a testament to the resilience and generosity of the American people.\n\nAs the country continues to grapple with the aftermath of these devastating hurricanes, it is clear that the road to recovery will be long and difficult. However, with the support of the federal government, state and local communities, and the public, it is possible to rebuild and emerge stronger than ever.",

Speaking as protesters displayed placards bearing the names of the dead, the chief executive, Ben Magara, told shareholders at the group's annual meeting that progress on building homes for 33,000 staff had been \"slower than we would have liked\". But he said rock-bottom platinum prices made it impossible for the company to resolve the housing issue and stay financially sound. Lonmin's CEO, Ben Magara, acknowledged that the company had made slow progress in addressing the housing needs of its employees, despite the devastating Marikana massacre in 2012 that left 34 miners dead. The incident was a stark reminder of the harsh working conditions and labor disputes that have plagued the platinum mining industry in South Africa.\n\nThe protesters, who were mostly Lonmin employees, held placards bearing the names of the deceased miners, demanding better living conditions and improved working conditions. The demonstration was a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by miners in the country.\n\nLonmin's struggles to provide adequate housing for its employees are not unique to the company. Many platinum miners in South Africa face similar challenges, with thousands of workers living in shacks and informal settlements near the mines. The issue has been a long-standing concern for labor unions and human rights groups, who argue that the mining industry has a responsibility to provide safe and decent living conditions for its workers.\n\nThe company's CEO, Ben Magara, acknowledged that the current economic environment was not conducive to resolving the housing issue. Rock-bottom platinum prices have put significant pressure on Lonmin's finances, making it difficult for the company to invest in new housing projects.\n\nHowever, labor unions and human rights groups are pushing for the company to take more decisive action to address the housing crisis. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has called for Lonmin to prioritize the construction of new homes for its employees, and has threatened to take industrial action if the company fails to meet its demands.\n\nThe Marikana massacre was a turning point in the history of the platinum mining industry in South Africa. The incident highlighted the deep-seated tensions and conflicts that exist between workers and management, and led to a renewed focus on labor rights and working conditions.\n\nIn the years since the massacre, there have been several incidents of violence and labor unrest at platinum mines in South Africa. The industry has struggled to recover from the negative publicity and reputational damage caused by these incidents, and has faced increasing pressure from investors and regulators to improve its working conditions and labor practices.\n\nLonmin's annual meeting comes at a critical time for the company, which is facing significant challenges in the current economic environment. The company's CEO, Ben Magara, acknowledged that the company was facing \"tough times\" and that it would need to make significant changes to its operations in order to remain competitive.\n\nHowever, the company's struggles to provide adequate housing for its employees are a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by the platinum mining industry in South Africa. The industry must take decisive action to address these issues, and to prioritize the well-being and safety of its workers.",

Steve Mosko, the former chairman of Sony Pictures Television, is in preliminary discussions with Sinclair about a senior management position, according to two people briefed on the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. Mosko's potential hire comes as Sinclair looks to bolster its programming offerings and increase its presence in the rapidly changing media landscape. The company has been expanding its reach through acquisitions, including the recent purchase of Tribune Media, which adds to its existing portfolio of stations.\n\nAs the former chairman of Sony Pictures Television, Mosko has a wealth of experience in the television industry. During his tenure at Sony, he oversaw the production and distribution of popular shows such as \"The Blacklist\" and \"Modern Family.\" He also played a key role in developing Sony's streaming strategy, including the launch of its subscription-based service, Sony Crackle.\n\nIf Mosko joins Sinclair, he would bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the company. Sinclair has been looking to increase its programming offerings and expand its reach beyond its traditional broadcast roots. The company has been investing in digital media and has launched several streaming services, including Sinclair Broadcast Group's streaming platform, STIRR.\n\nMosko's potential hire is seen as a significant coup for Sinclair, which is looking to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly changing media landscape. The company has been facing increased competition from streaming services and online media outlets, and has been looking to adapt to the changing landscape.\n\nThe deal is still in the preliminary stages, and it is unclear what role Mosko would play at Sinclair or what his responsibilities would be. However, if the deal goes through, it would be a significant coup for the company and a major boost to its programming efforts.\n\nSinclair has not commented on the potential hire, but sources close to the company say that Mosko is a strong candidate for the position. The company is expected to make an announcement in the coming weeks, pending the outcome of the talks.\n\nMosko's potential hire is the latest in a string of high-profile executive hires at Sinclair. The company has been looking to build out its senior management team and has brought in several experienced executives from the television and digital media industries.\n\nThe acquisition of Tribune Media has given Sinclair a significant boost, and the company is looking to capitalize on its new scale and reach. With Mosko on board, Sinclair would have a major player in the television industry leading its programming efforts, and would be well-positioned to take on the likes of Disney, Comcast, and other major media companies.",

As the world reeled from the devastating news of the Orlando tragedy, Disney's usually sunny disposition was overshadowed by a sense of shock and grief. The company's executives, including Iger, were quick to offer condolences to the victims and their families, while also working to ensure the safety and security of their theme parks and resorts.\n\nDespite the somber mood, Iger and his team were determined to push forward with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, a $5.5 billion investment that marked a significant milestone for the company's expansion into the Chinese market. The resort, which features six themed lands, including Adventure Isle, Treasure Cove, and Tomorrowland, was designed to cater to the unique tastes and preferences of Chinese consumers.\n\nAs Iger led the media tour around the park, he acknowledged the challenges posed by the Orlando shooting, but emphasized the importance of moving forward. \"We understand that this is a difficult time for many people, and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the victims,\" he said. \"However, we also believe that our theme parks and resorts can be a source of comfort, joy, and escape for people around the world.

He's going to drive it 170 miles from his home in Wales to the brilliantly eccentric Festival of the Unexceptional in Buckinghamshire. Fans of mint-condition Austin Allegros and cherished Datsun Sunnys will do well to make their way to Stowe House for the jamboree on 14 July. Ian's Invacar was effectively banned from the road in 2003, but somehow his was part of a group of 15 that escaped the scrapman's grab and now the former invalid carriage is insured, taxed and undergoing testing – so far this has revealed a huge oil leak and a serious carburettor fault.

Unveiled at the Institute of Education, HSE University on Friday, the 1.5-tonne die is the result of a crowdfunding campaign that drew support from a host of researchers, including the Nobel laureates Erik Maskin and Andre Geim – the latter being the co-discoverer of graphene who is currently based at the University of Manchester. The project was predicted to cost about $1,300, with backers receiving rewards ranging from normal-sized replica dice, to having the title of one of their papers recorded on one of the monument's sides. The monument, designed by artist and researcher Alexey Parygin, is a tribute to the often-overlooked but crucial role that peer reviewers play in the scientific process. Peer reviewers, who remain anonymous, are responsible for evaluating the quality and validity of research papers before they are published, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n\nAccording to Parygin, the idea for the monument came about after he was inspired by the struggles of his own peers, who often faced long hours and intense scrutiny in the review process. \"I realized that peer reviewers are the unsung heroes of science,\" he said in an interview. \"They are the ones who help to ensure that the research is accurate, reliable, and relevant, but they rarely receive recognition for their efforts.\"\n\nThe crowdfunding campaign, which raised over $1,300, was met with widespread support from the scientific community. Many researchers, including Maskin and Geim, donated to the campaign, with some even offering their own research papers to be featured on the monument's sides.\n\nOne of the featured papers is from Maskin, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2007. His paper, titled \"Mechanism Design: A Lecture in 7th Grade Math,\" is a humorous take on the complexities of game theory and was chosen by Maskin himself to be featured on the monument.\n\nGeim, who is currently based at the University of Manchester, also donated to the campaign and had his paper \"The Electric Arc Method of Graphene Synthesis\" featured on the monument. \"I'm thrilled to see this monument being created,\" Geim said in a statement. \"Peer reviewers play a vital role in ensuring the integrity of scientific research, and this monument is a wonderful way to recognize their contributions.\"\n\nThe monument is expected to become a popular attraction at the Institute of Education, HSE University, and will serve as a reminder to students and researchers alike of the importance of peer review in the scientific process. As Parygin noted, \"This monument is not just a celebration of peer reviewers, but also a reminder of the value of anonymous feedback in shaping our understanding of the world.\"",

The town has a range of housing options, from modern apartments to family homes, and is within easy reach of several major employers, including the University of Central Lancashire and the Lancashire County Council.\n\nAs I explored the town, I noticed a strong sense of community, with many residents actively involved in local clubs and organizations. The Rotary Club, which Emily mentioned, is just one example of the many groups that bring people together. There are also several community centers, libraries, and parks, which provide a range of activities and events for residents of all ages.\n\nOf course, no town is perfect, and South Ribble is no exception. The town's reliance on the motorway network can make it prone to traffic congestion, and some residents have expressed concerns about the impact of development on the town's character.\n\nDespite these challenges, however, it's clear that South Ribble is a special place. Its unique blend of history, culture, and community has made it a popular choice for young people looking for a place to call home. As I left the town, I couldn't help but feel that it's a place that has something for everyone – and that it's definitely worth a visit.",

It was only when I notified Castle Water we were moving that I found out they thought we were a commercial customer. We are a family of two adults and a baby. After receiving assurances that the mistake would be rectified and that Thames would claim the money we've paid to Castle, we received two bills for almost £1,000 from Thames Water.

Ahead of the G20 meeting in Argentina, which begins on Friday, the US president used a newspaper interview to warn China that he expects to move ahead on the imposition of higher import tariffs on Chinese goods. The news sent shares lower in London and New York on Tuesday, after Trump told the Wall Street Journal it was \"highly unlikely\" that he would heed a call by Beijing to refrain from increasing the tariffs from the start of next year. The warning from Trump comes as the US and China are locked in a bitter trade dispute that has been ongoing for months. The US has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with its own tariffs on US exports.\n\nThe tariffs have had a significant impact on global trade, with many companies and industries feeling the pinch. The US Chamber of Commerce has warned that the tariffs could lead to job losses and higher prices for consumers.\n\nThe G20 meeting in Argentina is seen as a key opportunity for world leaders to try to resolve the trade dispute. The meeting brings together leaders from the world's 20 largest economies, including the US, China, and the European Union.\n\nIn the interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump also said that he was open to a trade deal with China, but that it would have to be on US terms. He said that the US would not accept a deal that did not address its concerns about China's trade practices and intellectual property theft.\n\nThe Chinese government has been pushing for a trade deal, but has been unwilling to make significant concessions. China has accused the US of using trade as a tool to contain its growing economic power.\n\nThe G20 meeting is expected to be a tense and closely watched event, with many hoping that the leaders will be able to find a way to resolve the trade dispute and avoid a global recession.\n\nIn the meantime, the US and China are continuing to engage in a war of words, with both sides accusing each other of being responsible for the stalemate. The situation is likely to remain volatile until the G20 meeting, when the world will be watching to see if the leaders can find a way to break the impasse.\n\nThe tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese goods have had a significant impact on many industries, including technology and manufacturing. Many companies have been forced to raise prices or reduce production in order to cope with the increased costs.\n\nThe situation is also causing uncertainty for investors, with many wondering what will happen next. The Dow Jones industrial average fell by over 300 points on Tuesday, following the news of Trump's comments.\n\nThe G20 meeting is expected to be a key test of the relationship between the US and China, and the world will be watching to see if the leaders can find a way to resolve the trade dispute and avoid a global recession.",

Chewbaaka, rescued as a 10-day-old orphan in Namibia, became an \"ambassador\" animal for the Cheetah Conservation Fund there. (His name is a variation of the \"Star Wars\" character's.) By analyzing Chewbaaka's DNA and comparing it to that of other cheetahs, researchers were able to reconstruct the species' evolutionary history. The study, published in the journal Science, revealed that cheetahs underwent a rapid evolution around 2 million years ago, which enabled them to become the fastest land animals on Earth.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laurie Marker, the founder of the Cheetah Conservation Fund, \"Chewbaaka's genetic information provided a unique window into the past, allowing us to understand how cheetahs adapted to their environment and developed their remarkable speed.\"\n\nThe researchers used a technique called ancient DNA analysis, which involves extracting and sequencing DNA from fossilized remains or museum specimens. By comparing the DNA of modern cheetahs like Chewbaaka to that of ancient cheetahs, the scientists were able to identify key genetic changes that occurred during the species' evolution.\n\nThe study found that cheetahs underwent a series of genetic adaptations that allowed them to increase their speed and agility. These adaptations included changes to their muscle structure, skeleton, and nervous system.\n\n\"Chewbaaka's DNA was particularly useful because it provided a modern-day reference point for comparison,\" said Dr. Marker. \"By analyzing his genetic makeup, we were able to identify the specific genetic changes that occurred in cheetahs over time and how they contributed to their remarkable speed.\"\n\nThe findings of the study have important implications for conservation efforts. Cheetahs are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and their populations are declining due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching.\n\n\"Understanding the evolutionary history of cheetahs can help us better protect them in the present,\" said Dr. Marker. \"By identifying the genetic factors that contributed to their speed and agility, we can develop more effective conservation strategies to ensure the long-term survival of this incredible species.\"\n\nChewbaaka, now 12 years old, continues to serve as an ambassador for the Cheetah Conservation Fund, educating visitors about the importance of conservation and the plight of cheetahs in the wild. His remarkable story has inspired a new generation of scientists, conservationists, and animal lovers to work together to protect this majestic species.",

The scientists performed surgery to remove some of the heart of river fish and cave fish from the species Astyanax mexicanus, finding that while some river fish do regenerate tissue, the cave fish just grew scars over the damage. Salamander The amphibious salamander can regrow a lost tail to full length. This process sees cells migrating to the wound and then slowly regenerating the tail within a few weeks. The researchers from Mexico's National Autonomous University (UNAM) are working to unravel the mystery behind the remarkable regenerative abilities of certain animals, such as the salamander, which can regrow a lost tail to full length within a few weeks. In contrast, the cave-dwelling tetra fish, also known as Astyanax mexicanus, exhibit limited regenerative capabilities, with the wounds only forming scars.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, aimed to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern tissue regeneration in these animals. To achieve this, the researchers performed a series of surgeries on both river-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetra fish, removing a portion of their hearts and observing the healing process.\n\nThe results showed that while the river fish were able to regenerate the damaged tissue, the cave fish did not exhibit the same ability. Instead, the wounds formed scars, indicating a lack of regenerative capacity. This difference in regenerative ability is significant, as it highlights the unique adaptations of the cave-dwelling tetra fish to their environment.\n\nDr. Maria Rodriguez, the lead researcher on the project, explained that the findings have important implications for our understanding of tissue regeneration and the development of new treatments for human diseases. \"By studying the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern regeneration in these animals, we can gain valuable insights into how to improve human tissue regeneration,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers plan to continue their study by analyzing the genetic differences between the river-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetra fish, with the aim of identifying the specific genes and pathways involved in tissue regeneration. This knowledge could potentially be used to develop new treatments for human diseases, such as skin ulcers and burns, which currently have limited regenerative capabilities.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of understanding the unique adaptations of cave-dwelling animals, which have evolved to thrive in environments with limited light and resources. By studying these animals, scientists can gain a better understanding of the evolutionary pressures that have shaped their biology and develop new strategies for conserving and protecting these unique species.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of the cave-dwelling tetra fish provides valuable insights into the mysteries of tissue regeneration and the adaptations of animals to their environments. As researchers continue to uncover the secrets of these remarkable animals, we can expect to make significant breakthroughs in our understanding of biology and the development of new treatments for human diseases.",

The research, published in the journal Nature, suggests that early hominids may have been far more diverse than previously thought. The study, led by researchers at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, analyzed the fossil remains of Little Foot, a 3.3 million-year-old hominid discovered in the Sterkfontein Caves in 1994. By comparing the fossil's physical characteristics and dating to those of Lucy, a 3.2 million-year-old hominid discovered in Ethiopia in 1974, the team found that the two species may have co-existed during a period of significant evolutionary change.\n\nAccording to Dr. Paul Dirks, the lead author of the study, \"The discovery of Little Foot has provided us with a unique opportunity to re-evaluate our understanding of human evolution during the early Pliocene era. Our findings suggest that early hominids were more diverse than previously thought, and that different species may have co-existed for longer periods than we initially believed.\"\n\nThe study's authors used advanced computer simulations and statistical analysis to date the Little Foot fossil and determine its place in the human evolutionary timeline. They found that the fossil's physical characteristics, such as its skull shape and dental structure, are distinct from those of Lucy and other early hominids, but share some similarities with modern human species.\n\nThe discovery of Little Foot and its potential co-existence with Lucy has significant implications for our understanding of human evolution. It suggests that early hominids may have been more adaptable and resilient than previously thought, and that different species may have evolved in response to different environmental pressures.\n\nDr. Dirks notes that \"The study of Little Foot has also raised new questions about the evolution of human cognition and behavior. If early hominids were as diverse as we now believe, then it's possible that different species may have developed distinct ways of communicating, socializing, and adapting to their environments.\"\n\nThe findings of the study have been met with excitement and curiosity by the scientific community, and are expected to spark further research into the evolution of human species. As Dr. Dirks notes, \"The discovery of Little Foot is a reminder of the vast complexity and diversity of human evolution, and the many unanswered questions that still remain to be solved.\"",

The Centre for Cities said George Osborne's plan to bridge the economic gap between the wealthier south and the poorer north was too heavily focused on intercity transport links, and not enough on improving the performance of individual cities. The HS3 rail link proposal to speed up east-west connections between the major northern cities is a key part of the government's plan to redress the UK's economic imbalances. According to the Centre for Cities, while the HS3 rail link is a crucial step in connecting the major northern cities, it is only a small part of the overall solution. The thinktank argues that cities such as Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield need to focus on increasing their productivity and economic output in order to truly benefit from the improved transport links.\n\nThe Centre for Cities has identified several key areas where northern cities can improve their productivity, including investing in education and training, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving the skills and workforces of local businesses.\n\nIn a report released yesterday, the Centre for Cities highlighted the significant disparities in productivity between the north and south of England. The report found that, on average, productivity in the north is 15% lower than in the south, with some cities such as Hull and Middlesbrough experiencing productivity levels that are 30% lower than the national average.\n\nThe report's author, Luke Raikes, warned that unless the productivity gap is addressed, the chancellor's vision of a northern powerhouse will remain just that – a vision. \"The north needs to focus on building its economic strength from within, rather than just relying on improved transport links,\" Raikes said. \"This means investing in the skills and education of its workforce, and creating an environment that is conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship.\"\n\nThe Centre for Cities is calling on the government to provide more support to northern cities, including funding for education and training initiatives, and tax breaks for businesses that invest in research and development. The thinktank is also urging local authorities to work together to create a more cohesive and competitive economy across the north.\n\nThe government has welcomed the Centre for Cities' report, and has pledged to work with local authorities to improve productivity and economic growth in the north. A spokesperson for the chancellor said: \"We are committed to building a northern powerhouse that benefits all parts of the country. We will be working closely with local authorities and businesses to identify the key areas where we can make a real difference, and to ensure that our policies are focused on delivering economic growth and improving people's lives.\"\n\nAs the debate around the northern powerhouse continues, one thing is clear: the north of England has the potential to be a major economic driver for the country, but it will require a concerted effort from government, businesses, and local authorities to make it a reality.",

Weidmann's comments come as Monte dei Paschi, one of Italy's oldest and largest banks, faces a deadline to raise €5 billion to avoid a state-backed rescue. The bank's financial struggles have sparked concerns about the stability of Italy's banking system and the potential impact on the entire eurozone.\n\nThe Italian government has already committed to providing a guarantee to cover the bank's losses, but Weidmann's comments suggest that the ECB is not convinced that this is enough to ensure the bank's long-term viability. \"The guarantee is not a guarantee of success,\" Weidmann warned. \"The bank's financial health is the key to the success of the measures planned by the Italian government.\"\n\nWeidmann's remarks are likely to be seen as a warning to the Italian government to ensure that any bailout is properly structured and that the bank's financial health is thoroughly assessed before any rescue package is put in place. The ECB has been critical of the Italian government's handling of the crisis, and Weidmann's comments are the latest indication that the ECB is not willing to simply rubber-stamp a bailout without ensuring that it is in the best interests of the bank and the wider economy.\n\nThe fate of Monte dei Paschi is closely watched by investors and policymakers around the world, and Weidmann's comments are likely to add to the pressure on the Italian government to come up with a comprehensive plan to rescue the bank. The Italian government has until the end of the year to finalize the bailout plan, and Weidmann's comments suggest that the ECB will be closely monitoring the situation to ensure that the bank is properly supported.\n\nIn a separate development, the Italian government has announced plans to increase its stake in Monte dei Paschi to 70% as part of the bailout plan. The move is seen as a way to give the government more control over the bank's operations and to ensure that it is properly managed.

        "Text": "Santander has reduced its mortgage lending and its loans for car purchase amid Bank of England warnings about reckless lending and a \"spiral of complacency\" over mounting consumer debt. Its total mortgage lending fell by £1bn to £11.6bn in the first half of 2017 compared with 2016, with lending for buy-to-let down significantly. Net lending – which takes into account how many people remortgaged away from Santander – fell over the half year by £200m. According to industry experts, Santander's decision to scale back its mortgage lending is a sign of caution in response to the Bank of England's growing concerns about the UK's consumer debt levels. The Bank of England has repeatedly warned that the country's debt levels are unsustainable and that lenders are not doing enough to assess borrowers' ability to repay their loans.\n\nSantander's move is seen as a prudent step in an effort to avoid being caught out by a potential debt crisis. The bank's decision to reduce its mortgage lending is likely to have a ripple effect across the entire mortgage market, as other lenders may follow suit to avoid being left behind.\n\nThe reduction in mortgage lending is not the only area where Santander has tightened its lending criteria. The bank has also reduced its lending for car purchases, with net lending falling by £300m in the first half of 2017. This move is seen as a response to concerns about the rising cost of living and the increasing burden of debt on consumers.\n\nSantander's decision to reduce its lending comes at a time when the UK's consumer debt levels are at an all-time high. According to data from the Bank of England, consumer debt has risen by £30 billion in the past year alone, with credit card debt, personal loans, and car finance all contributing to the increase.\n\nThe Bank of England has been warning about the risks of reckless lending and a \"spiral of complacency\" over consumer debt for some time. In a recent speech, the Bank's Governor, Mark Carney, warned that the UK's debt levels are unsustainable and that lenders need to do more to assess borrowers' ability to repay their loans.\n\nSantander's decision to reduce its lending is likely to be welcomed by regulators and industry experts, who have been calling for lenders to be more cautious in their lending practices. The move is also likely to have a positive impact on the wider economy, as it will help to reduce the risk of a debt crisis and promote more sustainable lending practices.\n\nIn a statement, Santander said that it was committed to responsible lending and that its decision to reduce its lending was part of its efforts to ensure that its customers are able to manage their debt sustainably. The bank also said that it was working closely with regulators to ensure that its lending practices are in line with industry standards.\n\nOverall, Santander's decision to reduce its mortgage lending and car finance lending is a sign of caution in response to the Bank of England's growing concerns about consumer debt levels. The move is likely to have a positive impact on the wider economy and promote more sustainable lending practices.",

        "Text": "Researchers from Cornell University and elsewhere are studying a new technique to track the clouds of spores by indirect genetic sampling rather than by direct microscopic examination, to make better predictions of moth damage. A cloud can spread 40 miles or more from the original infestation, the researchers reported in 2017 in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. The innovative approach, known as \"environmental DNA\" or eDNA, involves collecting and analyzing genetic material from the environment to detect the presence of the moth's spores. This method has already shown promise in tracking invasive species and monitoring water quality.\n\nIn the case of the gypsy moth, the researchers are using eDNA to detect the genetic material of the moth's eggs, larvae, and adults. They are collecting water and soil samples from areas where the moths are known to infest, as well as from areas where they are not present. By analyzing the genetic material in these samples, the researchers can determine whether the moths are present and at what stage of their life cycle.\n\n\"This approach is much more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, a researcher at Cornell University and lead author of the study. \"We can collect multiple samples in a short amount of time and analyze them quickly, which allows us to make predictions about the spread of the moths more accurately.\"\n\nThe researchers are also using machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and make predictions about the spread of the moths. This involves training the algorithms on historical data and then using them to predict the likelihood of the moths spreading to new areas.\n\nThe potential benefits of this approach are significant. By detecting the presence of the moths earlier, foresters and other land managers can take proactive steps to prevent the spread of the infestation. This could include applying insecticides, introducing natural predators, or removing infested trees.\n\nIn addition, the eDNA approach could be used to monitor the effectiveness of these control measures and make adjustments as needed. This would allow for a more targeted and efficient use of resources, which could help to reduce the economic and environmental impacts of the infestation.\n\nWhile the eDNA approach shows promise, it is still in the early stages of development. The researchers are continuing to refine their methods and collect more data to improve the accuracy of their predictions. However, the potential benefits of this approach make it an exciting area of research that could have a significant impact on the management of the gypsy moth infestation.",

By Monday, at least one of the suspended workers said she had been fired, with reports that three other Google staffers had also been let go. Rebecca Rivers, a software engineer at Google who had been involved with internal protests against Google's work with US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), announced her firing on Twitter on Monday afternoon. Three other Google staffers were also fired on Monday, according to an internal company memo obtained by Bloomberg. Leaders of Google's security and investigations team said in the memo the firings were due to \"clear and repeated violations of our data security policies\". The firings come as a surprise to many at Google, who had expected the suspended workers to be reinstated after the company's initial decision to suspend them was met with widespread criticism from employees and human rights groups. The suspensions were seen as a crackdown on internal dissent and a threat to the company's culture of free speech and activism.\n\nRebecca Rivers, who was one of the suspended workers, had been a vocal critic of Google's partnership with CBP, which has been accused of human rights abuses and mistreatment of migrants. Rivers had also been involved in organizing internal protests and petitions against the partnership, which had gained significant support from her colleagues.\n\nThe firings have sparked outrage among Google employees, who are demanding answers from the company's leadership about the reasons behind the dismissals. Many have taken to social media to express their support for the fired workers and to condemn the company's actions.\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to silence dissent and stifle free speech,\" said one Google employee, who wished to remain anonymous. \"We will not stand idly by while the company tries to intimidate and silence us.\"\n\nThe firings have also sparked concerns about the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

Researchers had never reported finding the deadly disease in the long-living rodents -- not in the wild, or in zoos. Even after injecting their cells with the same viruses that trigger tumors in mice, the pink, wrinkly-skinned critters came out just fine. However, a recent study published in the journal Nature has revealed that a small percentage of naked mole rats do indeed develop cancer, despite their reputation for being cancer-resistant. The finding has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, as it challenges our understanding of the rodents' remarkable ability to evade the disease.\n\nResearchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center used advanced genetic sequencing techniques to analyze the genomes of over 100 naked mole rats, including some that had been bred in captivity and others that had been collected from the wild. To their surprise, they discovered that a small but significant number of the rodents had developed tumors, including malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Maria Barna, explained that the researchers had been looking for genetic mutations that might explain why naked mole rats are so resistant to cancer. \"We were expecting to find some kind of unique genetic mechanism that would allow them to avoid cancer, but what we found was something entirely different,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Barna, the tumors that developed in the naked mole rats were caused by genetic mutations that are similar to those found in humans. \"This suggests that the mechanisms that drive cancer in humans are likely to be similar to those that drive cancer in other animals, including rodents,\" she said.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of cancer and its causes. \"This study shows that even the most 'cancer-resistant' animals can still develop the disease, which means that we need to rethink our approach to cancer research,\" said Dr. Barna.\n\nThe researchers are now working to understand why some naked mole rats develop cancer while others do not. \"We're looking at the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the development of cancer in these animals, and we're hoping to learn more about the underlying mechanisms that drive the disease,\" said Dr. Barna.\n\nThe study's findings also raise questions about the use of naked mole rats as a model for cancer research. \"We've been using these animals as a model for studying cancer for years, but now we know that they're not as 'cancer-resistant' as we thought,\" said Dr. Barna. \"This means that we need to be more careful in our interpretation of the results and to consider the possibility that our findings may not be applicable to humans.\"\n\nOverall, the study's findings are a reminder that even the most unexpected animals can still develop cancer, and that we need to continue to study the disease to better understand its causes and how to prevent it.",

        "Text": "Trying to figure out why humans cry is exhausting. We cry about death, violence, breakups, abandoned puppies, sweet kisses and words charged with all kinds of meanings. We don't cry when we should, and we cry for no reason. ...and yet, despite the complexity of human emotions, scientists have made significant progress in understanding the biology behind crying. According to Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading researcher in the field of emotional psychology, \"Crying is a universal human behavior that serves multiple purposes, including emotional release, social communication, and even physical health benefits.\"\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of crying is its connection to our brain's emotional centers. Studies have shown that crying triggers the release of endorphins, also known as \"feel-good\" hormones, which can help to reduce stress and anxiety. This is why, for many people, crying can be a cathartic experience, allowing them to release pent-up emotions and feel a sense of relief.\n\nBut crying is not just a solo activity. Research has also shown that crying can be a powerful social signal, conveying emotions and intentions to others. In fact, a study published in the journal \"Emotion\" found that when people cry in front of others, it can increase feelings of empathy and compassion in those around them. This is because crying is often seen as a vulnerable and authentic expression of emotion, which can help to build stronger social bonds.\n\nDespite the benefits of crying, many people struggle to express themselves in this way. According to Dr. Taylor, \"Crying is often stigmatized in our society, particularly for men, who may feel pressure to suppress their emotions and maintain a tough exterior.\" This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection, as people struggle to find healthy ways to express their emotions.\n\nIn recent years, however, there has been a growing movement to normalize and celebrate crying. Social media platforms have become a hub for people to share their emotional experiences, with many using hashtags like #CryingIsOkay and #TearsAreOkay to promote emotional expression. This shift in cultural attitudes has helped to create a more supportive and accepting environment for people to cry, without fear of judgment or shame.\n\nAs we continue to explore the mysteries of human emotions, it's clear that crying is an essential part of the human experience. Whether we're crying tears of joy, sadness, or relief, this universal behavior plays a vital role in our emotional well-being and social connections. So the next time you find yourself reaching for a tissue, remember that crying is not only okay, but also a powerful and necessary expression of our humanity.",

At its peak, the chain had nearly 200 stores in 15 countries and more than $1 billion in annual sales, before debt and shifting consumer habits forced it to close in 2006. Starting at his father's drugstore in Sacramento, where he sold used jukebox records as a teenager, Mr. Solomon built a retail empire that became known as much for its selection -- vast by brick-and-mortar standards -- as for the culture that surrounded it. Employees were opinionated aficionados, and Tower stores, open till midnight, were gathering places for fans. The locations on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood and on Broadway in Greenwich Village became tourist meccas. Russ Solomon's Legacy Lives On: Tower Records' Impact on Music Industry\n\nThe news of Russ Solomon's passing at the age of 92 has sent shockwaves through the music industry, with many paying tribute to the visionary entrepreneur who revolutionized the way people consumed music.

The chain's iconic yellow-and-red color scheme and \"No Music, No Life\" slogan became synonymous with the thrill of the hunt for new music and the sense of community that came with discovering shared passions.\n\nSolomon's vision was to create a space where music enthusiasts could connect, share their knowledge, and explore new sounds. He achieved this by hiring staff who were passionate about music and giving them the autonomy to curate the store's inventory. The result was a treasure trove of music that catered to every taste and genre, from rock and pop to jazz and classical.\n\nTower Records' influence extended far beyond its physical stores. The chain played a significant role in shaping the music industry, providing a platform for emerging artists to showcase their talents and for established acts to connect with their fans. The stores' midnight hours made them a hub for live performances, album signings, and exclusive events, fostering a sense of excitement and anticipation that was unmatched by other retailers.\n\nSolomon's legacy extends beyond the walls of Tower Records, however. His impact on the music industry can be seen in the many independent record stores that have followed in his footsteps, offering a unique shopping experience that combines music discovery with community engagement. The rise of streaming services has also led to a renewed appreciation for the tactile experience of physical music, with many fans seeking out vinyl records and CDs as a way to connect with their favorite artists on a deeper level.\n\nAs the music industry continues to evolve, Russ Solomon's legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving the human touch in music retail. His commitment to quality, selection, and customer service set a high standard that continues to inspire music enthusiasts and entrepreneurs alike.\n\nIn the words of Solomon himself, \"The most important thing is to love what you do, and I loved music. I loved the excitement of finding a new artist, of introducing people to new music, of being part of the music business.\" As the music world mourns the loss of a true pioneer, it is clear that Russ Solomon's love for music will continue to inspire generations to come.",

But in Montana, the governor has used the stroke of a pen to bring the rules to broad parts of his state. Governor Steve Bullock signed an executive order on Wednesday, directing the Montana Department of Commerce to establish a net neutrality policy that prohibits internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking or throttling online content. The move comes as a response to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) repeal of net neutrality regulations last year, which allowed ISPs to prioritize certain online traffic over others.\n\nThe executive order applies to all state-funded internet infrastructure, including public libraries, schools, and government buildings. It also encourages private ISPs operating in the state to adopt similar policies. The move is seen as a significant step towards preserving an open internet in Montana, where many residents rely on the state's rural internet infrastructure for access to essential services, education, and healthcare.\n\n\"This is a critical step towards ensuring that Montanans have access to the internet without interference from big corporations,\" said Governor Bullock. \"We're not going to let the federal government's decision to roll back net neutrality protections stand in the way of our state's progress.\"\n\nThe move is not without its challenges, however. The Montana Department of Commerce will need to work with ISPs to implement the policy, which could take several months. Additionally, the policy may not be enforceable, as ISPs could potentially challenge it in court.\n\nDespite these obstacles, net neutrality advocates are hailing the move as a significant victory. \"Governor Bullock's executive order is a beacon of hope for net neutrality in the United States,\" said Tim Mulligan, executive director of the Montana Broadband Coalition. \"It shows that even in the face of federal inaction, states can take bold action to protect the open internet.\"\n\nThe move is also seen as a potential model for other states looking to preserve net neutrality. As the FCC's repeal of net neutrality regulations continues to face legal challenges, states like Montana may be able to use executive orders or legislation to establish their own policies.\n\nIn the meantime, net neutrality advocates are urging Congress to pass legislation that would restore the FCC's net neutrality regulations. \"While Governor Bullock's executive order is a step in the right direction, it's not a substitute for federal action,\" said Jessica Rosenworcel, a former FCC commissioner. \"We need Congress to pass a bill that would restore the open internet and protect consumers' rights.\"",

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation, the professional body for the recruitment industry, says the public sector, including the NHS and schools, face up to seven more years of skills shortages, based on current demand. On Thursday the Office for National Statistics said the number of EU citizens coming to the UK for work had fallen to a six-year low. According to the latest figures, the number of EU citizens moving to the UK for work has plummeted to its lowest level since 2014, with the number of EU nationals registering to work in the UK decreasing by a staggering 25% compared to the same period last year. This decline is having a significant impact on various industries, including healthcare, education, and hospitality, which are already struggling to fill vacant positions.\n\nThe Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) has warned that the skills shortage is not limited to the private sector alone, with the public sector also facing severe challenges in recruiting and retaining staff. The NHS, in particular, is struggling to fill vacancies, with many hospitals reporting difficulties in recruiting doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals.\n\nExperts attribute the decline in EU workers to a combination of factors, including the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, changes in immigration policies, and the weakening pound. \"The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has made it difficult for EU citizens to plan their future in the UK, and many have chosen to seek opportunities elsewhere,\" said a spokesperson for the REC.\n\nThe consequences of this skills shortage are far-reaching, with many businesses forced to turn down new contracts or scale back operations due to a lack of staff. The CBI has called on the government to take immediate action to address the issue, including introducing a more streamlined and efficient immigration system that allows businesses to access the skills they need.\n\nIn response to the crisis, the government has announced plans to introduce a new visa scheme for low-skilled workers, which is expected to come into effect next year. However, many experts have expressed concerns that this scheme will not address the root causes of the skills shortage and may even lead to a further decline in the number of EU workers coming to the UK.\n\nAs the UK continues to navigate the complexities of Brexit, businesses and policymakers are faced with the daunting task of finding a solution to the skills shortage. With the public sector already feeling the strain, it is clear that urgent action is needed to address this critical issue and ensure that the UK's economy remains competitive and thriving in the years to come.",

Those who believe 11-year-olds are inherently of two types, academic sheep and practical goats, should consider some real-life examples. Is the child who excels at maths but finds it hard to string two sentences together a sheep or a goat? What about the one who likes reading and writing but loves drawing and making things? The notion that children can be neatly categorized into two distinct groups - those who excel academically and those who excel practically - is a simplistic and outdated concept. In reality, children are complex individuals with diverse interests, strengths, and learning styles. The idea that an 11-year-old's aptitude can be accurately predicted by a single test or assessment is not only unscientific but also misleading.\n\nMoreover, this binary approach to education ignores the fact that children's interests and abilities can evolve over time. What may seem like a strength in one area may not necessarily translate to another. For instance, a child who excels in maths may struggle with language arts, while another who shows promise in reading and writing may struggle with problem-solving. By pigeonholing children into predetermined categories, we risk stifling their creativity, curiosity, and potential for growth.\n\nFurthermore, the emphasis on academic achievement has led to a culture of high-stakes testing, where children are often forced to conform to a narrow set of expectations. This can result in a lack of autonomy, creativity, and joy in learning. By promoting a more nuanced understanding of children's abilities and interests, we can create a more inclusive and supportive educational environment that fosters a love of learning and a sense of purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea that children can be divided into \"clever\" and \"practical\" categories is not only unscientific but also detrimental to their educational experience. By recognizing and valuing the diversity of children's strengths and interests, we can create a more comprehensive and effective approach to education that prepares them for success in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world.",

According to Dr Mehmet Hakan Ozdener, his findings open up the possibility of using smells to trick us into healthier eating, for example by adding a low-concentration odour to food to make it taste sweeter and thereby reduce sugar intake. Blinded by the lights It is believed that we all experience a form of motion-induced blindness while driving at night, when the red lights of the cars in front temporarily disappear if we move our eyes to the oncoming traffic. Researchers in Philadelphia revealed last week that tastebuds also bear odour-detecting proteins, calling into question the idea that smell and taste come together in the brain to produce flavour. According to Dr Mehmet Hakan Ozdener, his findings open up the possibility of using smells to trick us into healthier eating, for example by adding a low-concentration odour to food to make it taste sweeter and thereby reduce sugar intake.\n\nThe concept of using smells to influence our perception of taste is not new, but the discovery of odour-detecting proteins on tastebuds takes it to a whole new level. The study, published in the journal Chemical Senses, found that the proteins are responsible for detecting volatile molecules in food and drinks, which are then transmitted to the brain to influence our sense of taste.\n\nThis breakthrough has significant implications for the food industry, particularly in the development of low-calorie or low-sugar products. Imagine being able to add a natural, harmless ingredient to a food product that would make it taste sweeter without adding any extra sugar. This could be a game-changer for people with dietary restrictions or those who are simply looking to make healthier choices.\n\nBut the discovery of odour-detecting proteins on tastebuds also raises questions about the way we perceive flavour. If our sense of smell plays a more significant role in our perception of taste than previously thought, does that mean that our brains are tricking us into thinking that certain foods taste a certain way? And what about the role of emotions and nostalgia in our food choices? Do our brains associate certain smells with certain memories or emotions, which can influence our desire to eat certain foods?\n\nMeanwhile, back on the roads, a different kind of blindness is taking place. It is believed that we all experience a form of motion-induced blindness while driving at night, when the red lights of the cars in front temporarily disappear if we move our eyes to the oncoming traffic. This phenomenon, known as \"blindsight,\" is a result of the way our brains process visual information and has been observed in various forms of motion-induced blindness.\n\nResearchers have found that when we move our eyes quickly between two points, our brains can take a few milliseconds to catch up and process the visual information. During this brief period, the visual information is lost, and we experience a temporary blindness. In the case of driving at night, this can lead to a momentary loss of visibility, which can be hazardous if we are not paying attention.\n\nWhile this may not seem directly related to the discovery of odour-detecting proteins on tastebuds, it highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of our senses. Both the study on taste and the phenomenon of motion-induced blindness demonstrate the incredible complexity of our brains and the many ways in which they can be influenced by external factors. As we continue to learn more about the intricacies of our senses, we may uncover new ways to manipulate and influence our perceptions, leading to breakthroughs in fields such as food technology, psychology, and even medicine.",

For some, there may be other feelings, too: a pang in the back, a kick to the lower abdomen, an urgency in the bladder. These are symptoms that often come with passing a kidney stone -- an event that may not be entirely unexpected on certain roller coasters, according to a new study. A silicone cast of the inside of a kidney researchers used to study kidney stones and roller coasters. The authors found that moderate-intensity, rattling coasters might be effective at dislodging little kidney stones in the outer ducts of the kidney and propelling them toward the ureter, the tube connecting the kidneys and bladder. Their report, published last week in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, suggests that riding these roller coasters might help patients who have kidney stones that are five millimeters or less in diameter. The study, led by Dr. Michael Silberstein, a urologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, aimed to investigate the potential relationship between roller coasters and kidney stones. Silberstein and his team created a silicone cast of the inside of a kidney, complete with tiny kidney stones, and then simulated the experience of riding a roller coaster using a specialized machine.\n\nThe researchers found that the moderate-intensity roller coasters, characterized by sudden drops and sharp turns, were most effective at dislodging the small kidney stones from the outer ducts of the kidney and propelling them towards the ureter. The study suggests that this gentle jostling could potentially help patients who have small kidney stones, measuring five millimeters or less in diameter, pass them more easily.\n\nAccording to Silberstein, the idea behind the study was to explore unconventional methods for treating kidney stones, which affect approximately 10% of the global population. \"We know that kidney stones can be painful and debilitating, and current treatments often involve invasive procedures or medication,\" he said in a statement. \"We wanted to investigate whether something as simple as riding a roller coaster could be a viable alternative.\"\n\nWhile the study's findings are promising, it's essential to note that kidney stones can be caused by a range of factors, including dehydration, diet, and genetics. The study's authors emphasize that roller coasters should not be used as a primary treatment for kidney stones, but rather as a potential adjunctive therapy for patients who have small stones.\n\nThe research also raises questions about the potential benefits of incorporating roller coasters into kidney stone treatment. For instance, could roller coasters be used as a diagnostic tool to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from this type of therapy? Could the study's findings lead to the development of new, roller coaster-inspired treatments for kidney stones?\n\nAs the medical community continues to explore the potential applications of roller coasters in kidney stone treatment, patients and thrill-seekers alike can't help but wonder: could the next big breakthrough in kidney stone research come from the thrill of the ride?",

The Competition and Markets Authority has been investigating whether sites are misleading consumers since October and identified a number of areas of concern. The CMA did not name the companies it was investigating, but leading sites include Expedia and Booking.com. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised concerns that hotel booking websites may be engaging in unfair and misleading practices, potentially harming consumers. The investigation, which began in October, has uncovered several areas of concern that could have significant implications for the online travel industry.\n\nOne of the main issues identified by the CMA is the use of tactics to create a false sense of urgency. Websites may claim that only one room is left at a certain price, encouraging customers to make a hasty decision. However, the CMA believes that this could be a way for hotels to manipulate consumers into paying more for their rooms.\n\nAnother area of concern is the way that commission is paid to hotels. The CMA has found that some websites may be giving more prominence to hotels that pay the highest commission rates, rather than those that offer the best value to customers. This could lead to consumers being directed towards more expensive options, even if they are not the best choice for their needs.\n\nThe CMA has also raised concerns about the lack of transparency around hotel prices. Some websites may not clearly display the total cost of a room, including any additional fees or charges. This could make it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions about their booking.\n\nThe investigation has not yet identified any specific companies that are in breach of the law, but it has sent warning letters to several leading hotel booking websites, including Expedia and Booking.com. The CMA is now giving these companies an opportunity to respond to its concerns and take steps to address them.\n\nIf the companies fail to comply, the CMA may take further action, including issuing fines or taking legal action. The regulator is also considering introducing new rules to ensure that hotel booking websites operate in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nThe CMA's investigation is part of a wider effort to protect consumers in the online travel industry. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of consumers being misled or ripped off by travel companies. The regulator is determined to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and that they have access to accurate and transparent information when booking their holidays.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation is likely to have significant implications for the hotel booking industry. If the CMA's concerns are upheld, it could lead to changes in the way that websites operate, including the way that they display prices and the way that they promote hotels to consumers.",

According to the latest snapshot from the Confederation of British Industry's monthly distributive trades survey, retail businesses raised the ratio of their stocks to expected sales in January to the highest level since February 2008. The report, which is closely monitored by the Bank of England for early warning signs from the UK economy, said retailers expected demand to fall and had built up stocks in case the UK exits the EU without a deal. A growing number of companies have begun ramping up their plans for a potentially disruptive no-deal Brexit at the end of March, with Westminster still gridlocked since Theresa May suffered the biggest government defeat in history over her Brexit plan. The survey, which polled over 100 retailers and wholesalers, found that the stock-to-sales ratio rose to 3.3% in January, the highest level since February 2008. This indicates that retailers are preparing for a potential disruption in supply chains and are stockpiling goods in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe report also highlighted that retailers are increasingly concerned about the impact of Brexit on their businesses, with 60% of respondents citing it as a major concern. This is up from 40% in December, suggesting that the uncertainty surrounding Brexit is taking a toll on retailers' confidence.\n\nThe CBI's report comes as the UK Parliament remains deadlocked over Brexit, with lawmakers unable to agree on a plan to leave the EU. The lack of clarity has led to a surge in stockpiling, as retailers and wholesalers seek to mitigate the risks associated with a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"Retailers are taking a cautious approach to stockpiling, as they seek to prepare for all eventualities,\" said Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the British Retail Consortium. \"While we hope that a deal can be reached, we are also preparing for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and the potential disruption that could bring.\"\n\nThe stockpiling efforts are not limited to food and drink retailers, with clothing and homeware retailers also increasing their stock levels. This is likely to lead to increased costs for consumers, as retailers pass on the costs of stockpiling to customers.\n\nThe CBI's report is the latest indication of the growing concerns over Brexit's impact on the UK economy. The Bank of England has already warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a recession, and the CBI's report suggests that retailers are taking a similar view.\n\nAs the Brexit deadline looms, retailers and wholesalers are bracing themselves for the worst. With little more than 60 days to go, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit is set to continue, and retailers are taking steps to prepare for the potential disruption that could bring.",

        "Text": "In the latest chapter of the debit card fee wars, the banks and Federal Reserve were dealt a victory on Friday when a federal appeals court overturned a lower court's decision. The ruling means that the amount banks collect from retailers when consumers swipe debit cards can remain as is, and not be reduced further. The takeaway message for consumers: Nothing much will change, at least for now. The decision was a major blow to the National Retail Federation, which had argued that the fees charged by banks were unfair and anti-competitive. The NRF had been seeking a reduction in the fees, which it claimed were driving up costs for retailers and ultimately consumers.\n\nThe fees in question are known as interchange fees, and they are the amounts that banks charge merchants every time a consumer uses a debit card to make a purchase. The fees can range from 1% to 3% of the transaction amount, and they are typically passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe Federal Reserve had previously capped interchange fees at 12 cents per transaction, but the banks had appealed that decision, arguing that it was an overreach of the Fed's authority. The appeals court agreed, ruling that the Fed had exceeded its authority in setting the fee cap.\n\nThe ruling is a victory for the banks, which had been fighting to maintain their ability to set interchange fees. The banks argued that the fees were necessary to cover the costs of processing debit transactions, and that a reduction in the fees would harm their ability to provide services to consumers.\n\nHowever, the NRF and other retailers are vowing to continue fighting the issue. \"Today's decision is a setback, but we will not give up,\" said NRF President Matthew Shay. \"We will continue to advocate for a fair and transparent payment system that benefits consumers and retailers alike.\"\n\nThe ruling is also likely to have implications for the broader payment industry. The rise of mobile payments and other alternative payment methods has led to a decline in the use of traditional debit cards, and the interchange fee wars have been seen as a key factor in this trend.\n\nFor consumers, the ruling means that they will continue to see the same fees when they use their debit cards. However, the NRF and other retailers are urging consumers to be aware of the fees and to shop around for the best deals. \"Consumers have the power to make a difference,\" said Shay. \"By choosing to shop at retailers that offer lower prices and better deals, they can help drive change in the payment industry.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the battle over interchange fees is likely to continue. The NRF and other retailers are expected to continue advocating for a reduction in the fees, while the banks will likely continue to fight to maintain their ability to set the fees. The outcome of the battle will depend on a variety of factors, including the outcome of future court cases and the actions of regulators and lawmakers.",

        "Text": "In an era of revivals and reboots, this may have been inevitable. NBC announced on Wednesday that it was bringing back its celebrated comedy \"Will & Grace\" for 10 episodes during the 2017-18 TV season. The show's original cast -- Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally -- will all return, as will the show's director, James Burrows, and the show's creators, Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. The announcement sent shockwaves through the television industry, with fans and critics alike rejoicing at the news. The original series, which aired from 1998 to 2006, followed the lives of Will Truman (Eric McCormack), a gay lawyer, and his best friend, Grace Adler (Debra Messing), a straight interior designer, as they navigated their careers and personal relationships in New York City.\n\nThe show was known for its witty banter, relatable characters, and groundbreaking portrayal of LGBTQ+ issues. During its initial run, \"Will & Grace\" became a cultural phenomenon, earning 16 Emmy nominations and winning 16 awards, including two Golden Globes. Its influence extended beyond television, with the show's catchphrases and characters becoming a part of the pop culture lexicon.\n\nThe revival, which will premiere on September 21, 2017, will explore the characters' lives eight years after the original series ended. In a statement, Eric McCormack said, \"We're thrilled to be back and to have the opportunity to continue the story of these beloved characters.\" Debra Messing added, \"We're grateful to NBC for giving us the chance to revisit these characters and to explore new themes and storylines.\"\n\nThe new episodes will be written by the original creators, Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, who are excited to revisit the world they created. \"We're looking forward to exploring the characters' lives in the present day, while still maintaining the spirit and humor of the original series,\" Mutchnick said.\n\nThe revival marks a significant shift in the television landscape, as networks increasingly turn to revivals and reboots to attract audiences. However, \"Will & Grace\" is one of the few shows that has been given a second chance, rather than being revived solely for financial gain.\n\nThe announcement has sparked a flurry of excitement among fans, with many taking to social media to express their enthusiasm. The show's return is expected to be a major ratings draw for NBC, and the network is likely to capitalize on the nostalgia and goodwill surrounding the revival.\n\nAs the show prepares to return to television, fans are eagerly anticipating what's to come. Will the new episodes capture the same magic as the original series, or will they fall flat? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the return of \"Will & Grace\" is a major event in the world of television, and fans are eagerly counting down the days until its premiere.",

Community activists from those cities and 15 others are scheduled to meet Tuesday with Education Secretary Arne Duncan to urge a moratorium on school-closing plans until agreements can be reached on alternatives. The meeting, which is expected to be a tense and emotional one, comes as the three cities are grappling with significant budget crises and declining student enrollment. Philadelphia, in particular, is facing a severe budget shortfall, with some estimates suggesting that the city's schools may be forced to close up to 20 schools in the coming year.\n\nCommunity activists from Philadelphia, Detroit, and Newark have been vocal in their opposition to the school-closing plans, arguing that they disproportionately affect low-income and minority students. They claim that the closures will not only lead to a loss of educational opportunities for these students but also exacerbate existing segregation and achievement gaps.\n\n\"This is not just about closing schools, it's about closing the door on the future of our children,\" said Helen Gym, a Philadelphia parent and activist who will be attending the meeting with Secretary Duncan. \"We're not asking for special treatment, we're asking for equal treatment. We want to see a moratorium on school closures until we can find alternative solutions that prioritize the needs of our students.\"\n\nThe Department of Education's investigation into the complaints is ongoing, but officials have acknowledged that the agency is reviewing data on the potential impact of the school closures on minority and disabled students.\n\n\"We take these allegations very seriously and are committed to ensuring that all students, regardless of their background or disability, have access to a high-quality education,\" said a Department of Education spokesperson. \"We look forward to meeting with community activists and discussing ways to address their concerns.\"\n\nThe meeting with Secretary Duncan is expected to be a critical moment in the debate over school closures. While some city officials have expressed support for the closures as a necessary step to address budget shortfalls, community activists argue that there are alternative solutions that do not involve closing schools.\n\n\"We're not against reform, we're against reform that is not inclusive and does not prioritize the needs of our students,\" said Maria Cabot, a Detroit parent and activist. \"We want to work with Secretary Duncan and other officials to find solutions that benefit all students, not just some.\"\n\nThe outcome of the meeting is uncertain, but community activists are hopeful that Secretary Duncan will take their concerns seriously and work with them to find alternative solutions.

        "Text": "Tobacco companies Philip Morris and Altria are discussing a merger that would reunite the Marlboro maker with the parent company that sold it off a decade ago. The two companies confirmed they were discussing an all-stock merger but said there was no guarantee a deal would be reached. They added they would \"make no further comment regarding the discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so\". Altria spun off Philip Morris International (PMI) in 2008. It sells Marlboro cigarettes in the US and has largely focused on its domestic market while PMI has focused on selling cigarettes overseas. PMI was valued at $121bn before the news and Altria at $88bn. A possible merger has been predicted by analysts who have speculated the two companies could get back together as they fight falling cigarette sales and the rise of vaping. The potential merger has sent shockwaves through the tobacco industry, with many analysts speculating about the implications of such a deal. If the merger were to go through, it would reunite the two companies that were once one entity before Altria spun off Philip Morris International in 2008.\n\nOne of the main drivers behind the potential merger is the declining sales of traditional cigarettes. According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of cigarette smokers in the US has decreased by more than 40% since 2005. This decline has led to a significant drop in revenue for tobacco companies, making it increasingly difficult for them to maintain their market share.\n\nIn addition to declining cigarette sales, the rise of vaping has also posed a significant threat to the tobacco industry. E-cigarettes and other vaping products have become increasingly popular, particularly among younger generations. This shift towards alternative nicotine products has forced tobacco companies to adapt and diversify their product offerings.\n\nPhilip Morris International has been at the forefront of this shift, investing heavily in its iQOS heated tobacco product. The company has reported significant success with the product, which has been adopted by millions of smokers worldwide. Altria, on the other hand, has been slower to adapt, focusing primarily on its traditional cigarette business.\n\nA merger between the two companies could potentially allow them to leverage each other's strengths and weaknesses. Philip Morris International could bring its expertise in heated tobacco products to the table, while Altria could provide its knowledge of the US market and its strong brand recognition.\n\nThe potential merger has also raised concerns about the impact it could have on the competitive landscape of the tobacco industry. If the two companies were to merge, it could potentially create a dominant player in the market, making it more difficult for smaller companies to compete.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential merger between Philip Morris and Altria is a significant development in the tobacco industry. While there are many uncertainties surrounding the deal, it is clear that the two companies are looking to adapt to the changing market landscape and capitalize on each other's strengths. The outcome of the merger will likely have far-reaching implications for the industry and its stakeholders, and it will be closely watched by investors and analysts in the coming months.",

They appear to be belching, or singing, or screaming out the catch phrase of their cousin in Hollywood -- \"Feed me Seymour.\" This is Nepenthes ampullaria, an unusual pitcher plant found on the islands of Southeast Asia and the Malay Peninsula. And its \"Seymour\" is the worm larva of Xenoplatyura beaveri, a species of fungus gnat that develops inside the plant's mouth. When grown, it looks like a mosquito with big biceps. The pitcher plant's unique relationship with the fungus gnat larva has long fascinated scientists, who have been studying the symbiotic relationship for decades. Dr. Emily Tan, a botanist at the National University of Singapore, has dedicated her career to understanding the intricacies of this unusual partnership.\n\n\"Pitcher plants have evolved to capture and digest insects, but they've also developed a way to coexist with these fungus gnats,\" Dr. Tan explained. \"It's a mutually beneficial relationship - the plant gets a source of nutrients, and the fungus gnat gets a safe place to develop.\"\n\nThe fungus gnat larva, which resembles a mosquito with bulging muscles, is attracted to the sweet, sticky nectar produced by the pitcher plant. Once it lands on the plant's surface, it is unable to fly away due to the plant's sticky secretion, and is slowly digested by the plant's enzymes.\n\nMeanwhile, the fungus gnat larva is feeding on the plant's nutrients, which allows it to grow and develop. As it grows, it begins to produce a chemical signal that triggers the plant to produce a specialized nutrient-rich broth within its pitcher. This broth provides the fungus gnat larva with the necessary sustenance to complete its life cycle.\n\nThe relationship between the pitcher plant and the fungus gnat larva is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation, where both species have evolved to rely on each other for survival. While it may seem unusual to humans, this symbiotic relationship is just one of the many fascinating examples of the intricate web of life found in the natural world.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the remaining intact forests on the island nation of Singapore, where the Nepenthes ampullaria can be found. The Singaporean government has established several nature reserves and conservation areas, which provide a safe habitat for the pitcher plant and its fungus gnat larva to thrive.\n\nFor Dr. Tan and her team, the study of the pitcher plant and its fungus gnat larva is not only a fascinating area of research, but also an important step in understanding the delicate balance of ecosystems. As she puts it, \"The relationship between these two species is a reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of life on our planet, and the importance of preserving it for future generations.\"",

While rates on home loans are likely to remain modest by traditional standards, the ultralow borrowing costs that encouraged millions of homeowners to refinance and helped revive the moribund housing market are quickly becoming a memory. As yields on 10-year government bonds rise amid signs that the economy is improving and that the Federal Reserve will reduce bond purchases, mortgage rates have quickly followed. The impact of this shift is already being felt, with mortgage applications plummeting by 15% over the past month alone. According to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including the rising costs of borrowing and a decrease in the number of homeowners seeking to refinance their mortgages.\n\nFor many homeowners, the prospect of higher mortgage rates is a daunting one. With rates expected to rise to around 4.5% by the end of the year, homeowners who have been taking advantage of historically low rates to refinance their mortgages are now faced with the possibility of higher monthly payments.\n\n\"This is a major shift in the market,\" said Sarah Johnson, a mortgage broker with over a decade of experience. \"For the past few years, homeowners have been able to refinance their mortgages at incredibly low rates, which has helped to stimulate the housing market. But with rates on the rise, we're starting to see a slowdown in refinancing activity.\"\n\nThe rise in mortgage rates is also expected to have a significant impact on the housing market as a whole. As rates increase, the demand for homes is likely to decrease, which could lead to a slowdown in home sales and a decrease in housing prices.\n\n\"This is a concern for the housing market, as higher mortgage rates can make it more difficult for people to afford homes,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"If rates continue to rise, we could see a decrease in home sales and a slowdown in the overall housing market.\"\n\nDespite the challenges posed by rising mortgage rates, many experts believe that the housing market is still in a strong position. The economy is growing, and employment rates are at historic lows, which has led to increased demand for housing.\n\n\"I think the housing market is still in a good place,\" said Johnson. \"While higher mortgage rates may make it more difficult for some people to afford homes, the overall demand for housing is still strong. I think we'll see a continued steady pace of home sales, even as rates rise.\"\n\nAs the mortgage market continues to evolve, it's clear that the days of ultralow borrowing costs are behind us.

P doesn't measure reliability, for a start. Neither does it measure how unlikely the observed result would be. What would be expected, by chance alone, will always vary, each time an experiment is done. This is especially so if the experimental numbers are small, so that samples are less representative of their source. In reality, the p-value is often misinterpreted as a measure of the probability that the observed result is due to chance, when in fact it represents the probability of obtaining the observed result (or a more extreme result) under the null hypothesis. This subtle distinction is crucial, as it can lead to incorrect conclusions and over-interpretation of results.\n\nFor instance, a p-value of 0.05 does not necessarily mean that there is only a 5% chance that the observed result is due to chance. Rather, it means that if the null hypothesis were true, we would expect to see results at least as extreme as the one we observed, by chance alone, in about 5% of cases. This is often referred to as the \"false positive rate\".\n\nMoreover, the p-value does not take into account the power of the study, which is the probability of detecting a true effect if it exists. A study with low power may produce a p-value that is not statistically significant, even if the effect is real. Conversely, a study with high power may produce a statistically significant p-value, even if the effect is small or trivial.\n\nIn addition, the p-value is sensitive to the sample size of the study. As the sample size increases, the p-value will tend to decrease, even if the effect size remains the same. This can lead to a situation where a study with a large sample size produces a statistically significant p-value, but the effect is actually very small or clinically insignificant.\n\nIt is essential to consider these limitations when interpreting p-values and to use them in conjunction with other measures of effect size, such as confidence intervals and standardized mean differences. By doing so, researchers can gain a more nuanced understanding of their results and avoid the pitfalls of misinterpreting the p-value.\n\nUltimately, the p-value is a useful tool for statistical inference, but it is not a magic bullet that can answer all questions about the reliability and significance of a study's findings. By acknowledging its limitations and using it in a thoughtful and informed manner, researchers can improve the accuracy and transparency of their results, and ultimately advance our understanding of the world around us.",

        "Text": "PARIS -- European finance ministers said on Saturday that they had moved closer to a comprehensive solution for the debt crisis during a two-day gathering of officials from the Group of 20 industrial nations, despite a number of unresolved problems that could still widen the scope of the crisis. The ministers, who met in Paris on Friday and Saturday, acknowledged that significant progress had been made in recent weeks to address the debt crisis, which has been weighing heavily on the global economy. However, they also warned that the situation remained precarious and that further work was needed to stabilize the financial markets.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the discussions, the ministers agreed on a number of key measures aimed at reducing the debt burden on heavily indebted countries, such as Greece and Portugal. These measures include the creation of a new European financial stabilization fund, which would provide emergency loans to countries facing financial difficulties, and the establishment of a European debt restructuring mechanism, which would allow for the restructuring of debt in a more efficient and orderly manner.\n\nThe ministers also discussed the need for a more coordinated approach to addressing the debt crisis, with a focus on promoting economic growth and job creation in the affected countries. They emphasized the importance of fiscal discipline and structural reforms, as well as the need for international cooperation to address the crisis.\n\nDespite the progress made, however, the ministers acknowledged that a number of key issues remained unresolved. These include the need for a more robust financial safety net to protect against future crises, and the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing the underlying causes of the debt crisis, such as the unsustainable levels of government debt and the lack of competitiveness in some European economies.\n\nThe ministers also expressed concerns about the impact of the debt crisis on the global economy, including the potential for a slowdown in economic growth and the risk of a global recession. They emphasized the need for a coordinated response to address these risks and to promote a more sustainable and stable global economy.\n\nIn a statement released after the meeting, the European finance ministers said that they would continue to work together to address the debt crisis and to promote economic stability and growth in Europe and around the world. They also emphasized the need for international cooperation and coordination to address the crisis, and called on other countries to join them in this effort.\n\nThe meeting in Paris was the latest in a series of high-level gatherings aimed at addressing the debt crisis. The next major meeting is expected to take place in the coming weeks, when the leaders of the G20 countries will gather in Cannes, France, to discuss the crisis and to agree on a comprehensive plan to address it.",

Swordfish are among the fastest fish in the ocean, and now scientists may have found at least one reason: The fish secrete a performance-enhancing grease.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, San Diego, have discovered that swordfish produce a unique substance in their skin that helps to reduce friction and improve their swimming efficiency. The team, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a marine biologist, made the breakthrough after analyzing the skin secretions of several species of fish, including the swordfish.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rodriguez, the substance, which has been dubbed \"swordfish grease,\" is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is secreted by the fish's skin glands. When the fish swims, the grease is released onto its body, creating a thin layer that reduces the friction between the fish's skin and the water.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for our understanding of how fish swim,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"For years, we've been studying the physical characteristics of fish, such as their shape and size, but we've never really looked at the role of skin secretions in their swimming ability. This discovery opens up a whole new area of research.\"\n\nThe team's findings, published in the journal Science, suggest that the swordfish grease could have significant implications for the design of underwater vehicles and equipment. For example, engineers could use the grease to reduce the drag on submarines or other underwater vehicles, allowing them to swim faster and more efficiently.\n\nThe discovery also raises questions about the evolutionary advantages of the swordfish grease. Why do swordfish produce this substance, and how does it help them to outcompete other fish for food and mates?\n\nAccording to Dr. Rodriguez, the answer may lie in the swordfish's unique lifestyle. Swordfish are apex predators that feed on deep-sea fish and squid, and they need to be able to swim quickly and efficiently to catch their prey. The swordfish grease may have evolved as a way to help them to do just that.\n\n\"This is a great example of how studying the natural world can inspire innovation and improve our understanding of the world around us,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"Who knows what other secrets the ocean is hiding? We're excited to continue exploring and discovering the wonders of the underwater world.\"",

Directors of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies have spent more than £18.5m buying shares in their own firms since the 23 June vote, according to data compiled for FT Money by the broker Olivetree Financial. \"This is the largest amount of individual director buys in at least 10 years,\" Olivetree said. The sectors that were hardest hit by the news of Brexit – banks, housebuilders, retailers and travel companies – saw the biggest director purchases. The surge in share buying by company directors has sparked debate among analysts and investors about their confidence in the future of their businesses. Some have interpreted the move as a sign that directors believe their companies are undervalued in the wake of the Brexit vote, while others have suggested that it may be a defensive measure to protect their personal wealth.\n\nAccording to Olivetree Financial, the top five companies with the most director buying activity since the EU referendum are HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, British Airways owner IAG, and retailers Marks & Spencer and Next. The data shows that directors of these companies have spent a combined total of over £5m buying shares in their firms.\n\nHSBC's chairman, Mark Tucker, has been particularly active, buying over £1.2m worth of shares in the bank since the referendum. Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive, Ross McEwan, has also been a significant buyer, purchasing over £700,000 worth of shares.\n\nThe director buying spree has been seen as a positive sign by some investors, who believe that it may indicate a buying opportunity for others. \"When directors are buying, it's often a sign that they believe the company is undervalued,\" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \"It's a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects, and could be a good signal for investors to follow suit.\"\n\nHowever, others have expressed caution, pointing out that the Brexit vote has created significant uncertainty for many businesses, and that directors may be buying shares simply to protect their personal wealth. \"It's possible that directors are buying shares to reduce their exposure to potential volatility in the company's share price,\" said Russ Mould, a director at AJ Bell. \"This doesn't necessarily mean that they believe the company is undervalued, but rather that they want to lock in their gains and reduce their risk.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Brexit, many analysts believe that the director buying spree is a sign of resilience and confidence in the UK's economy. \"The fact that directors are buying shares in their own companies suggests that they believe in their businesses and are confident about their future prospects,\" said David Buik, a market analyst at Jeffrey Evans & Co. \"This is a positive sign for the UK economy, and could be a good indication that the country is better placed to weather the challenges of Brexit than some people might think.\"",

A growing number of businesses in New York and cities around the country have adopted cashless policies, refusing to accept paper currency and requiring customers to pay with debit or credit cards. The trend has spread from hipster coffee shops to popular burrito and salad chains, with business owners saying it's quicker and easier to dispense with cash. However, the proposed legislation aims to reverse this trend, citing concerns that cashless policies disproportionately affect low-income individuals who may not have access to credit or debit cards. According to the city's Comptroller, Scott Stringer, the bill would require businesses to accept cash payments in order to operate in New York City.\n\nThe legislation has been praised by advocates for low-income communities, who argue that the cashless trend is exacerbating economic inequality. \"Cashless businesses are essentially pricing out low-income New Yorkers who can't afford to carry credit cards,\" said Rachel Haot, executive director of the nonprofit organization, New York City for Change. \"This legislation is a crucial step towards ensuring that all New Yorkers have access to basic goods and services, regardless of their financial situation.\"\n\nBusiness owners, on the other hand, are concerned about the increased costs and administrative burdens that accepting cash payments would bring. \"We understand the concerns, but we also have to think about the bottom line,\" said the owner of a popular coffee shop in Manhattan. \"Accepting cash would require us to hire additional staff and invest in new equipment, which would eat into our profits.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, proponents of the legislation argue that the benefits to low-income communities outweigh the costs. \"This is not about punishing businesses, but about ensuring that everyone has access to the same opportunities,\" said City Council Speaker, Corey Johnson. \"We need to think about the impact that these policies have on our most vulnerable populations, and take steps to address it.\"\n\nThe proposed legislation is expected to face opposition from some business groups, but it has already gained support from several major retailers, including a leading grocery chain and a popular clothing store. The bill is expected to be voted on by the City Council in the coming months, and if passed, would take effect in 2024.\n\nIn the meantime, the debate over cashless businesses continues to rage on, with proponents on both sides presenting their arguments.

When Darwin visited the islands, it was the wide variety of finch beaks that helped him understand how one species could evolve into many. Now the Galapagos cormorants, the only species of cormorant to have lost the ability to fly, have enabled scientists to pin down the genes that led to this species' split from all other cormorants about two million years ago. They are genes that are present in birds, mammals and most animals, including even the worm often studied in laboratories: C. elegans. Scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the Galapagos Conservancy have made a groundbreaking discovery that sheds new light on the evolutionary history of the Galapagos cormorant. By analyzing the DNA of the flightless cormorant, researchers were able to identify the specific genes that led to the species' divergence from its flying ancestors.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead author of the study, \"The Galapagos cormorant is a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation. Its unique characteristics, such as its inability to fly, have allowed us to pinpoint the genetic changes that occurred during its evolution.\"\n\nThe research team used a combination of genetic and morphological analysis to identify the key genes responsible for the cormorant's flightlessness. They found that the genes responsible for wing development and flight were mutated in the cormorant, resulting in the loss of its ability to fly.\n\nInterestingly, the same genes are present in other animals, including birds, mammals, and even the humble C. elegans worm, which is often studied in laboratories. This suggests that the genetic changes that led to the cormorant's flightlessness may have occurred through a similar process in other species.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of evolution and the mechanisms that drive species adaptation. \"This study shows that even in a species that has lost a critical trait like flight, the genetic machinery is still present,\" said Dr. John Smith, co-author of the study. \"It highlights the importance of studying evolutionary history and the genetic changes that occur during adaptation.\"\n\nThe research team plans to continue studying the Galapagos cormorant and its relatives to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary processes that have shaped the species. The findings have also sparked new questions about the role of genetic variation in adaptation and the potential for similar genetic changes to occur in other species.\n\nAs the Galapagos Islands continue to inspire scientific discovery, the birds that call this unique ecosystem home remain a vital part of our understanding of evolution and the natural world.",

        "Text": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Hello, readers! I'm Jack Nicas, a Times reporter covering technology in San Francisco. As we kick off our weekly tech roundup, I have to say, it's been a wild ride this past week. From the latest updates on the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China to the growing concerns about social media's impact on our mental health, there's been no shortage of big stories to unpack.\n\nLet's start with the trade front. The US and China have been engaged in a heated trade war for months now, and it seems like things are only getting more complicated. Just this week, the US announced plans to impose new tariffs on a range of Chinese goods, including electronics and textiles. China, of course, has vowed to retaliate, and the two sides are now locked in a game of economic brinksmanship.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech industry is getting increasingly caught in the crossfire. Companies like Apple and Google are already feeling the pinch, with their supply chains and revenue streams affected by the tariffs. And it's not just the US and China – other countries are starting to take sides, too. The EU, for example, has been trying to negotiate its own trade deal with China, but it's unclear how that will play out.\n\nBut enough about trade wars – let's talk about something a little more fun: social media. Have you seen the latest studies on the impact of social media on our mental health? It's not pretty. Researchers have found that excessive social media use can lead to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and even loneliness. And it's not just the content itself – it's the way we're using these platforms that's the problem. We're constantly comparing ourselves to others, and feeling like we're not good enough. It's a vicious cycle, and one that's hard to break.\n\nSo what's the solution? Well, some experts are calling for more regulation – maybe even a new set of \"digital rights\" that would give users more control over their online experience. Others are advocating for more education – teaching kids and adults alike how to use social media responsibly. And then there are those who say we just need to take a step back and rethink the way we're using these platforms in the first place.\n\nIt's a complex issue, to say the least. But one thing is clear: the tech industry has a responsibility to do better. And that's why we're seeing more and more companies taking steps to address these issues. Facebook, for example, has been working on a new feature that would allow users to track how much time they're spending on the platform. And Twitter has been experimenting with new ways to reduce the spread of misinformation.\n\nSo that's a wrap for this week's tech roundup. It's been a wild ride, to say the least. But one thing is clear: the tech industry is changing fast, and we need to be paying attention. Thanks for joining me, and we'll see you next week!",

        "Text": "There it was in the night sky as Sunday stretched into Monday: a total lunar eclipse. Where people had clear conditions and unobstructed views, the moon took on a coppery red color. It was the only such eclipse of 2019, and it occurred just before midnight Eastern time. The rare and awe-inspiring sight was a treat for astronomy enthusiasts and casual observers alike. The total lunar eclipse, also known as a \"blood moon,\" occurred when the Earth passed between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the lunar surface. This phenomenon is relatively rare because the Earth, moon, and sun must align in a straight line, a process known as syzygy.\n\nThe eclipse was visible from much of the world, including North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. In the United States, the eclipse was visible from the eastern half of the country, with the best views coming from the eastern seaboard and the Gulf Coast. The eclipse lasted for approximately 62 minutes, with the moon taking on a reddish hue as it passed through the Earth's shadow.\n\nThe coppery red color of the moon is caused by the Earth's atmosphere scattering shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, and bending longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, towards the moon. This is why the moon often takes on a reddish appearance during a lunar eclipse.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse was a significant event for astronomers, who use these eclipses to study the Earth's atmosphere and the moon's surface. Scientists were eager to observe the eclipse to gather data on the Earth's atmosphere and the moon's composition. The eclipse also provided an opportunity for astronomers to test new technologies and equipment, such as advanced cameras and telescopes.\n\nFor many people, the total lunar eclipse was a rare and unforgettable experience. With the increasing use of technology and the constant glow of city lights, it's becoming increasingly rare to see the night sky in its full glory. The eclipse served as a reminder of the beauty and wonder of the natural world, and the importance of preserving our ability to observe and appreciate it.\n\nIn the days following the eclipse, many people took to social media to share their photos and experiences of the event. The hashtag #BloodMoon was trending on Twitter, with people sharing their own photos and videos of the eclipse. The event also sparked a renewed interest in astronomy and space exploration, with many people turning to online resources and educational institutions to learn more about the science behind the eclipse.\n\nOverall, the total lunar eclipse was a spectacular event that captivated audiences around the world. Whether you were an experienced astronomer or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of the night sky, the eclipse was a reminder of the awe-inspiring power and wonder of the universe.",

        "Text": "Our Milky Way galaxy is strewn with billions of planets, alien worlds still unseen by human eyes -- at least for now. Only three decades ago we didn't know if there were planets beyond our own solar system. In 1995, astronomers discovered that a star in the constellation Pegasus was wobbling back and forth, tugged by the gravity of an unseen planet, an exoplanet, a hot and hellish world unfit for life as we know it. The wobble method of planet hunting relies on sensitive spectroscopes. As an orbiting planet tugs on its star, the starlight we see shifts from blue to red and back again. The discovery of this exoplanet marked the beginning of a new era in astronomy, as scientists began to realize that planets were not unique to our own solar system. Since then, the field of exoplanet hunting has grown exponentially, with thousands of planets discovered orbiting stars other than our own.\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs in exoplanet hunting came with the launch of the Kepler space telescope in 2009. Designed to monitor the brightness of hundreds of thousands of stars, Kepler was able to detect the subtle dimming of light that occurs when a planet passes in front of its star. This method, known as the transit method, allowed scientists to identify planets as small as Earth and as large as Jupiter.\n\nThe Kepler space telescope was a game-changer for exoplanet hunting, and its findings have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of the universe. According to NASA, Kepler has discovered over 2,600 exoplanets, with many more expected to be discovered in the coming years.\n\nBut exoplanet hunting is not just about finding new planets; it's also about understanding their characteristics and potential for supporting life. Astronomers use a range of techniques to study exoplanets, including spectroscopy, which involves analyzing the light that passes through an exoplanet's atmosphere. This can reveal information about the planet's composition, temperature, and even its potential for hosting life.\n\nOne of the most exciting areas of research in exoplanet hunting is the search for exoplanets that are similar to Earth. Known as \"Earth-like\" exoplanets, these planets are thought to have conditions similar to those of our own planet, making them potential candidates for supporting life. Astronomers are using a range of techniques, including the transit method and spectroscopy, to study these exoplanets and learn more about their characteristics.\n\nAs we continue to explore the universe and discover new exoplanets, we are reminded of the vastness and complexity of the cosmos. The discovery of exoplanets has opened up new avenues of research and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe and our place within it.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of exoplanets has come a long way since the first exoplanet was discovered in 1995. From the wobble method to the transit method, scientists have developed a range of techniques to study exoplanets and learn more about the universe. As we continue to explore the cosmos, we are reminded of the importance of continued research and the potential for new discoveries that could change our understanding of the universe forever.",

It's not just about the grades, though – it's about building confidence and a love of learning that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nMeanwhile, individual students have achieved remarkable results despite facing significant challenges. Take 17-year-old Emily Wilson, who has been diagnosed with dyslexia and has always struggled with reading and writing. Despite this, Emily has worked incredibly hard to overcome her difficulties and has achieved a string of top grades, including an A* in her beloved art subject. Her teacher, Mrs. Patel, praised Emily's determination, saying, \"Emily's success is a testament to her perseverance and creativity. She's an inspiration to us all, and we're so proud of her.\"\n\nFor students who may not have achieved the grades they had hoped for, it's essential to remember that GCSEs are just one step on the journey to academic success.

It announced on Thursday that it would broadcast a daily half-hour Vice newscast. HBO, the premium entertainment network, is strengthening its relationship with Vice, the maverick media company and news organization. It announced on Thursday that it would broadcast a daily half-hour Vice newscast.\n\nThe new program, titled \"Vice News Tonight,\" will debut on October 5th and will be broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:00 PM ET. The show will feature a team of experienced journalists and correspondents who will deliver in-depth reporting on current events, politics, and social issues.\n\nThis move marks a significant expansion of HBO's news programming, which has traditionally focused on documentaries and original series. By partnering with Vice, HBO is tapping into the younger demographic that Vice has successfully targeted with its online content.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be partnering with Vice to bring a new type of news programming to our audience,\" said Casey Bloys, President of HBO Programming. \"Vice's innovative approach to storytelling and their commitment to in-depth reporting align perfectly with our values at HBO.\"\n\nVice News has built a reputation for its fearless reporting and unflinching coverage of global issues, from the refugee crisis in Europe to the war in Syria. The company's founders, Shane Smith, Suroosh Alvi, and Gavin McInnes, are known for their irreverent style and willingness to take risks in their reporting.\n\nThe newscast will be hosted by Vice News correspondents, including Isobel Yeung, who has reported from the front lines of the war in Ukraine, and Ben Anderson, who has covered the conflict in Libya. The show will also feature investigative reporting, in-depth profiles, and analysis from Vice's team of experts.\n\nThe partnership between HBO and Vice is seen as a major coup for both companies. For HBO, it marks a significant expansion into the news genre, which has traditionally been the domain of cable news networks like CNN and MSNBC. For Vice, it provides a major platform to reach a wider audience and expand its influence beyond its online presence.\n\nThe move is also seen as a sign of the changing media landscape, where traditional boundaries between news and entertainment are blurring. As audiences increasingly turn to online sources for their news, traditional broadcast networks are looking for new ways to engage with their audiences and stay relevant.\n\nWith the launch of \"Vice News Tonight,\" HBO is betting that its audience will respond to a more innovative and edgy approach to news programming. The show's irreverent style and fearless reporting are likely to appeal to a younger demographic that is increasingly skeptical of traditional news sources.\n\nAs the news industry continues to evolve, the partnership between HBO and Vice is a significant development that could have far-reaching implications for the way we consume news in the future.",

During a total lunar eclipse, the moon passes through the Earth's shadow. A total lunar eclipse will be visible over most of Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America on July 27. Only North America misses the show this time. During a total lunar eclipse, the moon passes through the Earth's shadow, taking on a reddish hue due to the way the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight.\n\nAccording to astronomers, the eclipse will be visible from 11:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on July 26 to 4:22 AM EDT on July 27. The eclipse will reach its peak at 2:21 AM EDT, when the moon will be fully immersed in the Earth's shadow.\n\n\"This is a rare opportunity for people in many parts of the world to witness a total lunar eclipse,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, an astronomer at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"It's a great chance for people to get out and enjoy the night sky, and to learn more about the moon and its place in our solar system.\"\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be the first of three lunar eclipses this year, with the next one occurring on August 11 and the third on November 30. However, this eclipse is particularly special because it will be visible from so many different parts of the world.\n\nTo witness the eclipse, people will need to find a location with a clear view of the horizon. It's also important to dress warmly, as it will be a chilly night. Binoculars or a telescope can enhance the viewing experience, but they are not necessary to see the eclipse.\n\nIn addition to the scientific significance of the eclipse, many people are also looking forward to the cultural and symbolic significance. In some cultures, lunar eclipses are seen as a sign of good luck or a time for reflection and introspection.\n\nFor those who won't be able to see the eclipse in person, there are many ways to experience it remotely. NASA and other space agencies will be broadcasting live footage of the eclipse, and many astronomy websites will be providing updates and commentary.\n\nOverall, the total lunar eclipse on July 27 is an event that should not be missed. Whether you're an astronomy enthusiast or just someone who appreciates the beauty of the night sky, this is an opportunity to experience something truly special.",

But behind the scenes, there is a never-ending contest over ticketing, with promoters, venues and technology companies making deals for the sales as well as the customer data that comes with them. Last year, Pandora Media paid $450 million for Ticketfly, an online ticketing service that competes with Ticketmaster to sign up clubs and theaters and has deals with 1,200 clients, including promoters and venues. The acquisition marked a significant shift in the ticketing landscape, as Pandora sought to expand its reach beyond its core music streaming business. Ticketfly's vast network of clients, including prominent promoters and venues, provided Pandora with a unique opportunity to tap into the live music industry's lucrative ticketing market.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that Pandora's move was a strategic response to the growing importance of data-driven decision making in the live music business. With Ticketfly's vast repository of customer data, Pandora gained a valuable asset that could help it better understand the preferences and behaviors of its users.\n\n\"This acquisition is a game-changer for Pandora,\" said industry analyst, Michael Smith. \"By gaining access to Ticketfly's data, Pandora can now tailor its music recommendations to individual users based on their concert-going habits. This could lead to a more personalized and engaging music experience for users.\"\n\nThe deal also sent shockwaves through the industry, with many wondering what this meant for Ticketmaster, the long-dominant player in the ticketing market. Ticketmaster, a subsidiary of Live Nation, has traditionally been the go-to ticketing solution for large-scale events and festivals.\n\nHowever, some industry experts believe that Ticketmaster's dominance is beginning to erode, as smaller, more agile ticketing companies like Ticketfly and Eventbrite gain traction. \"The ticketing market is becoming increasingly fragmented, with multiple players vying for market share,\" said concert promoter, Mark Cohen. \"This acquisition by Pandora is just the latest example of how the landscape is shifting.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty, one thing is clear: the live music business is becoming increasingly data-driven, and companies that can harness the power of customer data will be well-positioned to succeed in the years to come. As Pandora continues to integrate Ticketfly's technology and data into its operations, it remains to be seen how this will impact the ticketing market and the live music industry as a whole.",

Did I want to sit in it, or did I want to race? The cabin is spacious but beset with tiny inconveniences. The gear housing was a bit lax, so when you put it in neutral, it would transpire you'd left it in second. You could never catch it in the act, so you never knew whether it was your fault, and had to fall back on \"But this has never happened to me in any other car\", like a bad relationship. The frame design is strange, with big wedges of plastic at the back; if you parked on a curve, the road was effectively all blind spot. Despite these initial impressions, I found that the Fiat Tipo's quirks were largely overshadowed by its impressive performance. The 1.6-liter Multijet diesel engine, which produces 120 horsepower, provided a smooth and quiet ride, making it an excellent choice for daily commuting. The six-speed manual transmission was also a delight to use, with precise gear shifts and a responsive clutch.\n\nOn the road, the Tipo proved to be surprisingly agile and fun to drive. The suspension was well-tuned, absorbing bumps and potholes with ease, and the steering was precise and communicative. The car's weight distribution was also well-balanced, making it easy to corner and brake with confidence.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the Tipo's exterior design may not be to everyone's taste. The angular lines and chunky plastic trim give it a somewhat utilitarian appearance, which may not be as stylish as some of its competitors. Additionally, the car's relatively small size and high driving position can make it feel a bit like a compact MPV, rather than a traditional saloon.\n\nIn terms of safety, the Tipo comes equipped with a range of advanced features, including six airbags, electronic stability control, and a suite of sensors to monitor and adjust the car's systems in real-time. It also received a five-star rating in Euro NCAP crash tests, giving owners peace of mind on the road.\n\nOverall, the Fiat Tipo is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable and practical family car. While it may not be the most stylish or exciting vehicle on the market, its impressive performance, comfortable ride, and generous standard equipment make it an excellent value for money. With a starting price of around $20,000, it's an attractive option for those on a budget, and its low running costs and strong fuel economy make it an excellent choice for commuters and families alike.",

Can we start again? I think we just have. What are we actually talking about? We are talking, my friend, about a trend. More specifically, about an Instagram trend. Oh God, these things never make any sense to me. The latest obsession to take over the world of social media, #GeneBragging, has left many scratching their heads. But what is it, exactly? And why are people going wild for it?\n\nFor the uninitiated, #GeneBragging is a peculiar phenomenon where individuals share photos of their genetic makeup, showcasing their unique DNA profiles. Yes, you read that right – people are sharing pictures of their genes. It's a trend that has taken the Instagram world by storm, with thousands of users sharing their genetic blueprints, often accompanied by witty captions and hashtags.\n\nSo, why the sudden fascination with genes? According to experts, it all boils down to the rise of direct-to-consumer genetic testing. With companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA offering affordable and accessible genetic testing kits, people are now more curious than ever about their genetic makeup. And what better way to share that information than on social media?\n\nBut #GeneBragging is more than just a fun fad – it's also a way for people to connect with others who share similar genetic traits. For those with rare or unique genetic conditions, sharing their story can be a powerful way to raise awareness and build a sense of community.\n\nOf course, not everyone is thrilled about the trend. Some have raised concerns about the potential risks of sharing genetic information online, citing concerns about privacy and security. And let's be real – there's also the issue of aesthetics. Let's just say that a photo of a person's DNA profile might not be the most visually appealing thing to look at.\n\nDespite these concerns, #GeneBragging shows no signs of slowing down. As the summer months approach, expect to see even more people sharing their genetic makeup on Instagram. And who knows – you might just find yourself joining the ranks of the #GeneBraggarts.",

Chappell's comments come as a scathing rebuke of Green, who had previously owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to Chappell's company, Retail Acquisitions, in 2015. Green had promised to provide financial support to the chain, but Chappell claims that Green reneged on this agreement, leaving the company with insufficient funds to stay afloat.\n\nAccording to Chappell, Green had assured him that he would ensure the backing of credit insurers, which would have provided a vital lifeline to the struggling retailer. However, when the credit insurers pulled out of the deal, BHS was left without the necessary financial support to continue trading.\n\n\"We were told that the credit insurers were going to back us, but they didn't,\" Chappell said. \"Philip Green never stood good for his word. We worked so hard, but it was all for nothing.\"\n\nChappell's allegations have sparked outrage among former BHS employees and customers, who are still reeling from the shock of the chain's sudden collapse.

The troubled retailer said it had been \"a very difficult year\" for the firm as it reported a 3.6% fall in sales at its established UK stores in the year to 28 April. Carpetright said trading in the first eight weeks of the current financial year had been heavily disrupted by its restructuring programme, particularly because some suppliers had withdrawn products. The hot weather had also kept customers away, the firm said. Despite the challenging trading conditions, Carpetright remains committed to its turnaround strategy, which includes the closure of underperforming stores and a significant reduction in its store estate. The company believes that this will enable it to focus on its strongest locations and improve its overall profitability.\n\nIn a statement, Carpetright's Chief Executive, Wilf Walsh, said: \"We have made significant progress in implementing our turnaround plan, but it's clear that we still have a lot of work to do. The first eight weeks of this financial year have been particularly tough, with trading heavily disrupted by our restructuring programme and the hot weather keeping customers away.\"\n\nWalsh added that the company is working closely with its suppliers to resolve the issue of withdrawn products, and is exploring alternative sources to ensure that its stores remain fully stocked. He also expressed confidence that the business will start to show signs of improvement in the coming months.\n\nCarpetright's financial results for the year to 28 April also revealed that the company's debt had increased to £143.8m, up from £123.8m the previous year. However, the company said that it has a solid financial position and is well-placed to navigate the current challenges.\n\nThe retailer's woes are not unique, as the UK's high street is facing significant challenges due to the rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits.

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use next month's spring statement to announce the results of a consultation launched by the Treasury in November, on how to update the tax system to reflect the nature of online businesses. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, told the BBC on Thursday that digital companies should pay \"fair\" levels of tax. He suggested that could mean a system in which tax is levied according to where those companies earn their revenues – rather than simply taxing profits, which are easier to shift from one jurisdiction to another. The proposal has been met with a mixed response from the tech industry, with some companies expressing concerns about the potential impact on their business models. A spokesperson for Facebook said that the company is committed to paying its fair share of taxes, but warned that any new tax regime must be carefully designed to avoid unintended consequences.\n\nMeanwhile, Google has called for a more nuanced approach to taxation, arguing that the current system is outdated and fails to recognize the unique nature of digital businesses. \"We believe that a fair and sustainable tax system should take into account the global nature of our business and the value we create for users around the world,\" said a Google spokesperson.\n\nThe proposal has also been welcomed by some anti-poverty groups, who argue that digital companies have a moral obligation to contribute more to the public purse. \"For too long, digital companies have been able to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, while ordinary people and small businesses are left to pick up the bill,\" said a spokesperson for the anti-poverty charity, Oxfam.\n\nThe consultation process, which ran from November to January, gathered feedback from a range of stakeholders, including businesses, charities, and experts. The Treasury is expected to publish its findings and recommendations in the spring statement, which will set out the government's plans for the upcoming financial year.\n\nThe proposal is part of a broader effort to address the growing concern about tax avoidance and evasion by multinational companies. The OECD, a global economic organization, has been working on a project to develop a new framework for taxing digital companies, which is expected to be completed later this year.\n\nThe UK government is also working with other countries to develop a global consensus on digital taxation. The Treasury has been in talks with the French government, which has been pushing for a digital tax on tech companies, and is expected to make a joint announcement in the coming weeks.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant step towards creating a more level playing field for businesses and ensuring that digital companies contribute their fair share to the public purse. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how the tech industry will respond to the proposed changes and whether they will ultimately be implemented.",

Analysts at RBC have been looking as satellite communication specialist Inmarsat and run the rule over the business as a possible bid target. In a new note, RBC's Wilton Fry said: Given Inmarsat's lower share price (especially in US dollar terms), rapid evolution of the industry's competitive landscape, and historical precedents (e.g., Sky Terra approach in 2009), we believe it is appropriate to consider potential M&A activity. In this note we assess whether there is any rationale for Echostar, or Dish, to approach Inmarsat. RBC's Analysts Explore Potential M&A Opportunities for Inmarsat\n\nIn a recent note, RBC's Wilton Fry highlighted Inmarsat as a potential takeover target, citing the company's lower share price and the rapidly evolving competitive landscape of the satellite communication industry. Fry's analysis suggests that companies such as Echostar and Dish may be interested in acquiring Inmarsat, given the company's unique strengths and the historical precedents of similar deals.\n\nInmarsat, a UK-based satellite communication specialist, has been a major player in the industry for over three decades. The company provides a range of services, including satellite-based broadband connectivity, voice and data services, and IoT solutions. With a global footprint and a diverse customer base, Inmarsat has established itself as a reliable and innovative provider of satellite communication solutions.\n\nSo, what makes Inmarsat an attractive target for potential acquirers? Fry points to the company's lower share price, which has been impacted by a number of factors, including increased competition and regulatory challenges. Additionally, the analyst notes that the satellite communication industry is undergoing a significant transformation, with new technologies and business models emerging that could disrupt the traditional market.\n\nHistorically, companies such as Sky Terra have successfully acquired satellite communication specialists to expand their offerings and gain a foothold in new markets. Fry suggests that Echostar and Dish, two major players in the US satellite television market, may be interested in acquiring Inmarsat to gain access to the company's global network and expertise.\n\nEchostar, the parent company of Dish Network, has been actively expanding its satellite communication capabilities in recent years. The company has acquired several satellite communication companies, including Hughes Network Systems, and has launched a range of new services, including satellite-based broadband and IoT solutions. With Inmarsat, Echostar would gain access to a global network and a diverse customer base, allowing the company to expand its offerings and compete more effectively in the global market.\n\nDish, on the other hand, has been focused on expanding its wireless capabilities, including the launch of its 5G network. However, the company has also been exploring opportunities in the satellite communication market, including the acquisition of several satellite communication companies. With Inmarsat, Dish would gain access to a global network and expertise in satellite-based communication solutions, allowing the company to expand its offerings and compete more effectively in the global market.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that Echostar or Dish will make a bid for Inmarsat, Fry's analysis suggests that the company's unique strengths and the rapidly evolving competitive landscape make it an attractive target for potential acquirers. As the satellite communication industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how companies such as Inmarsat, Echostar, and Dish respond to the changing market dynamics and whether any of them will make a move to acquire the UK-based satellite communication specialist.",

I had written about the wonders of F.M.R.I. for years, but never had the opportunity to experience it firsthand. Professor Nancy Kanwisher, a renowned expert in the field of neuroscience, had agreed to let me witness a scan being performed, and I was eager to see the process up close.\n\nThe machine's loud hum filled the room as the technician, a friendly and experienced woman named Rachel, carefully positioned me inside the scanner. I closed my eyes, trying to relax, as Rachel explained the procedure. \"Don't worry, you won't feel a thing,\" she reassured me. \"Just lie still and breathe normally.\"\n\nAs the machine began to whir and hum, I felt a slight tingling sensation in my head. It was a strange, but not unpleasant, feeling. I opened my eyes to see Rachel checking the machine's settings and making sure everything was in order.\n\nThe scan itself was surprisingly quick, lasting only about 10 minutes. During that time, I was asked to perform a series of tasks, such as listening to music, solving simple math problems, and even watching a short video clip. The machine was capturing my brain activity in real-time, mapping the different regions that were engaged as I performed each task.\n\nAs the scan came to an end, I felt a sense of accomplishment and awe. I had always known that F.M.R.I. was a powerful tool for understanding the human brain, but experiencing it firsthand had given me a new appreciation for the technology.\n\nProfessor Kanwisher joined us in the room, beaming with excitement. \"How was it?\" she asked, as she reviewed the scan's results on the computer screen. I described the sensation of being inside the machine, and she nodded enthusiastically. \"It's amazing, isn't it?\" she said. \"F.M.R.I. has revolutionized the field of neuroscience, allowing us to non-invasively study the brain's function and structure in unprecedented detail.\"\n\nAs we discussed the possibilities and limitations of the technology, I couldn't help but think about the potential applications of F.M.R.I. in fields beyond neuroscience. From improving our understanding of neurological disorders to developing more effective treatments for mental health conditions, the potential benefits of this technology were vast.\n\nAs I left the lab that day, I felt grateful for the opportunity to experience F.M.R.I. firsthand. It was a reminder of the incredible advances being made in the field of neuroscience, and the potential for these discoveries to improve our lives.",

The high street challenger also revealed that it is under investigation by City regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority, over a major accounting failure first disclosed last month. The announcements were made alongside the bank's annual results on Tuesday night. Metro Bank's share price slumped once again on Wednesday and was down more than 26% at about 950p shortly before the London market closed. The bank's shares have been under intense pressure since January, when it was forced to issue a statement confirming that it had discovered a major accounting error in its 2019 financial statements. The mistake, which related to the bank's treatment of a complex financial instrument, resulted in an unexpected £140m hit to its profits.\n\nThe latest developments have raised concerns among investors about the bank's financial health and the effectiveness of its management team. Metro Bank's CEO, Craig Donaldson, has come under fire for his handling of the crisis, with some analysts questioning his ability to turn the bank around.\n\nThe bank's decision to raise an additional £350m in capital has been seen as a sign of weakness, rather than a sign of strength. The move is expected to dilute the value of existing shares and further erode investor confidence.\n\nThe investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority is also likely to be a major concern for investors. The regulators are examining the bank's accounting practices and its compliance with regulatory requirements, and the outcome of the investigation is likely to have significant implications for the bank's future.\n\nIn a statement, Metro Bank said that it was cooperating fully with the regulators and was confident that it would be able to resolve the issues quickly. However, the bank's shares continued to fall on Wednesday, with some analysts predicting that the stock could fall further in the coming days.\n\nThe collapse of Metro Bank's share price has also had a knock-on effect on the wider banking sector, with other high street lenders seeing their shares fall in response. The incident has raised concerns about the resilience of the UK's banking system and the ability of regulators to protect consumers.\n\nIn a statement, the Financial Conduct Authority said that it was \"monitoring the situation closely\" and would take \"swift and decisive action\" if necessary. The Prudential Regulation Authority also said that it was \"working closely with the bank to ensure that it is able to address the issues quickly and effectively\".\n\nThe crisis at Metro Bank is a major setback for the bank and its investors, and it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold in the coming weeks and months.",

The dinosaur had a longer nose horn than Triceratops, and two small horns above its eyes. ...and two small horns above its eyes. The discovery was announced by a team of researchers from the University of Alberta, who published their findings in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nThe new dinosaur, named Wendiceratops, lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 75 million years ago, in what is now the Canadian province of Alberta. According to the study, Wendiceratops was a member of the Ceratopsidae family, which includes Triceratops, one of the most well-known horned dinosaurs.\n\nWendiceratops was estimated to be around 9 meters (30 feet) long and weighed around 2-3 tons. Its distinctive features included a longer nose horn than Triceratops, measuring around 1.5 meters (5 feet) long, as well as two small horns above its eyes. The horns were made of bone and were likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals.\n\nThe researchers believe that Wendiceratops was a herbivore, feeding on plants and fruits. Its diet was likely similar to that of Triceratops, which was also a herbivore.\n\nThe discovery of Wendiceratops provides new insights into the evolution of horned dinosaurs. According to Dr. David Evans, lead author of the study, \"Wendiceratops is a key find because it shows us that the evolution of horns in ceratopsians was more complex than we previously thought. It also highlights the diversity of horned dinosaurs during the Late Cretaceous period.\"\n\nThe team used a combination of fossil evidence and computer simulations to reconstruct the appearance and behavior of Wendiceratops. The fossil remains were found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, a geological formation known for its rich deposits of dinosaur fossils.\n\nThe discovery of Wendiceratops is a significant addition to the field of paleontology, and it provides a new window into the evolution of these fascinating creatures. As Dr. Evans noted, \"Wendiceratops is a reminder that there is still much to be learned about the ancient world, and that new discoveries can shed light on the mysteries of the past.\"",

        "Text": "Mortgage lending surged dramatically in March, returning to the peak levels last seen before the financial crash, as buy-to-let speculators and second home buyers rushed to beat the stamp duty tax deadline. Total lending rose to £17.1bn, 64% higher than the same month a year ago, and the highest figure since April 2008, according to the British Bankers Association. Buyers frantically closed property deals ahead of the introduction of a 3% hike in stamp duty for buy-to-let and second homes that began in April. Remortgaging by existing home owners also leapt, with households taking advantage of cheap mortgage deal amid the widespread belief that interest rates will stay low for an extended period of time. The average mortgage loan taken out reached a record high, hitting £184,200, compared to £158,000 at the peak of the previous lending cycle in April 2008. The surge in mortgage lending has raised concerns among economists and policymakers about the potential for another housing bubble. While the current market is different from the pre-crash era, some experts warn that the rapid growth in lending could lead to a correction in the future.\n\n\"Rushing to beat the stamp duty deadline is not a sustainable way to fuel the housing market,\" said Dr. Sarah Jones, an economist at the University of Cambridge. \"We need to be cautious and ensure that lending is not outpacing economic growth. The last thing we want is another housing bubble that could lead to a crash.\"\n\nDespite the concerns, the British Bankers Association (BBA) has defended the surge in lending, citing the need for homeowners to take advantage of low interest rates. \"Mortgage lending is a vital part of the economy, and the BBA is committed to ensuring that lenders operate responsibly,\" said a spokesperson for the organization.\n\nThe rush to remortgage has also been driven by the widespread expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. The Bank of England has kept interest rates at 0.5% since 2009, and many experts believe that they will remain low for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"Low interest rates have made borrowing cheaper, and many homeowners are taking advantage of the opportunity to remortgage and reduce their monthly payments,\" said Mark Harris, a mortgage broker at SPF Private Clients. \"However, it's essential that homeowners are aware of the risks and are not over-extending themselves.\"\n\nThe surge in mortgage lending has also raised questions about the impact on the wider economy. Some experts warn that the rapid growth in lending could lead to a surge in household debt, which could have negative consequences for the economy if interest rates rise in the future.\n\n\"The key issue is that household debt has been rising steadily over the past decade, and the surge in mortgage lending could exacerbate this trend,\" said Dr. John Smith, an economist at the University of Oxford. \"If interest rates rise, households could struggle to meet their debt repayments, which could have a negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nDespite the concerns, the government has welcomed the surge in mortgage lending, citing the need to boost the economy. \"The housing market is a vital part of the economy, and we welcome any measures that help to stimulate growth,\" said a spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government.\n\nIn conclusion, while the surge in mortgage lending has raised concerns about the potential for another housing bubble, it is also a sign of confidence in the economy. As the housing market continues to evolve, it is essential that policymakers and lenders work together to ensure that lending is responsible and sustainable.",

        "Text": "HONG KONG -- The Chinese central bank reassured investors worried about a lingering credit squeeze and declared that it had already been selectively supporting bank liquidity, as Chinese stock markets swung wildly again Tuesday after several days of volatility. The central bank, People's Bank of China, eager to rein in soaring lending growth and financial risk, initially refrained from intervening as bank-to-bank interest rates soared last week, but then apparently released more money for lenders. The sudden injection of liquidity by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) sent shockwaves through the financial markets, calming fears of a credit crunch and sparking a rally in Chinese stocks. The Shanghai Composite Index, which had plummeted by as much as 5.5% earlier in the day, ended the session with a modest gain of 0.2%.\n\nMarket analysts attributed the PBOC's sudden intervention to concerns over the rapid growth of lending in China, which has been fueled by a surge in demand for credit from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The PBOC has been keen to rein in this growth, fearing that it could lead to a buildup of financial risks and potentially destabilize the entire banking system.\n\nThe central bank's decision to release more money for lenders was seen as a clear signal that it is willing to take action to prevent a credit crunch from developing. This move is likely to provide relief to banks, which had been struggling to access funding due to the high demand for credit and the resulting surge in bank-to-bank interest rates.\n\nThe PBOC's actions have also been seen as a sign of its commitment to maintaining financial stability in China. The central bank has been working closely with other regulatory bodies, including the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, to monitor the financial markets and prevent any potential risks from materializing.\n\nDespite the PBOC's efforts, however, concerns over the credit squeeze and the potential risks it poses to the Chinese economy remain. Many analysts believe that the central bank's actions may not be enough to fully address the underlying issues driving the credit squeeze, and that further measures may be needed to prevent a more severe credit crunch from developing.\n\nIn the meantime, investors are likely to remain cautious, with many choosing to wait on the sidelines until the situation becomes clearer. The PBOC's actions, while welcome, have done little to alleviate concerns over the sustainability of China's economic growth, and many are still waiting to see whether the central bank will be able to achieve its goals of reining in lending growth while still supporting economic activity.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the PBOC's actions have sent a strong signal that it is committed to maintaining financial stability in China, and that it is willing to take decisive action to prevent a credit crunch from developing. Whether this will be enough to restore confidence in the Chinese financial markets remains to be seen.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- The Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday amid tentative signs that Britain's economic recovery is strengthening. The central bank held its interest rate at 0.5 percent, already a record low, and also made no change to its program of economic stimulus, leaving the target at 375 billion pounds, or about $570 billion. The British government had reported last week that the economy in the second quarter had grown 0.6 percent from the previous quarter and that all main industries were reporting faster growth for the first time in three years. The decision to maintain the status quo was widely expected by economists and financial analysts, who had been monitoring the UK's economic indicators closely. Despite the slight uptick in growth, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) remains cautious, citing ongoing uncertainties and risks in the global economy.\n\nIn a statement, the Bank of England said that while the economy is showing signs of improvement, it is still \"subject to significant downside risks\" from factors such as Brexit uncertainty, global trade tensions, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The MPC also noted that inflation remains below its 2% target, and that wage growth is still sluggish, which could continue to weigh on consumer spending and overall economic activity.\n\nDespite the lack of rate changes, the Bank of England did offer some positive assessments of the economy. The committee noted that the UK's labor market has continued to improve, with unemployment falling to its lowest level in over five years. Additionally, consumer confidence has risen, and business investment has picked up, suggesting that companies are becoming more optimistic about the future.\n\nThe Bank of England's decision to maintain its stimulus program also sent a signal to the markets, with investors reacting positively to the news. The pound sterling rose against the US dollar, and UK stocks edged higher, with the FTSE 100 index gaining 0.2%.\n\nEconomists were generally pleased with the Bank of England's decision, saying that it was a prudent move given the uncertain economic environment. \"The Bank of England is taking a cautious approach, which is sensible given the risks and uncertainties facing the global economy,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nHowever, some analysts argue that the Bank of England may need to act sooner rather than later to address the risks of inflation and asset bubbles. \"While the economy is showing signs of improvement, the Bank of England needs to be mindful of the risks of inflation and asset price bubbles,\" said Michael Saunders, chief UK economist at Citigroup. \"If the economy continues to grow at a strong pace, the Bank of England may need to start thinking about raising interest rates sooner rather than later.\"\n\nOverall, the Bank of England's decision to maintain its interest rate and stimulus program is seen as a cautious and prudent move, aimed at supporting the UK's economic recovery while also managing the risks and uncertainties facing the global economy.",

        "Text": "For centuries scientists, even Darwin, couldn't make sense of it: Tropical water contains so few nutrients, you can see right through it. And yet coral reefs are oases that support about a quarter of all known species on Earth. How could that be? Despite the seemingly inhospitable conditions, coral reefs have evolved to thrive in these nutrient-poor waters. The key to their success lies in their unique relationship with tiny plants called phytoplankton.\n\nPhytoplankton are the primary producers of the ocean, using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. However, they are incredibly small, ranging from 2-20 micrometers in size, making them difficult to spot with the naked eye. In tropical waters, phytoplankton are the primary food source for many marine animals, including coral.\n\nCoral polyps, the tiny animals that make up coral reefs, have formed a symbiotic relationship with these tiny plants. They capture phytoplankton using specialized structures called peduncles, which are covered in tiny hairs called cilia. These hairs help to trap the phytoplankton, allowing the coral to feed on them.\n\nBut how do coral reefs support such a vast array of species? The answer lies in the complexity of the reef itself. Coral reefs are not just simple structures, but rather intricate ecosystems that provide a multitude of habitats for different species.\n\nThe coral itself provides a framework for other animals to live on, with nooks and crannies for fish to hide and hunt, and crevices for crustaceans to scavenge for food. The reef also provides a source of food for many species, with coral polyps providing a snack for fish and other animals.\n\nThe reef's structure also creates a unique environment that allows for the coexistence of different species. The coral's hard surface provides a barrier between different species, allowing them to coexist without competing for the same resources. This diversity of species is what makes coral reefs so resilient, as they are able to adapt and respond to changes in their environment.\n\nDespite their importance, coral reefs are facing numerous threats, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are causing coral bleaching, where the coral expels its algal symbionts, turning white and often leading to the coral's death.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect these vital ecosystems, including the establishment of marine protected areas and the development of sustainable fishing practices. However, more needs to be done to address the scale and complexity of the threats facing coral reefs.\n\nAs scientists continue to study these incredible ecosystems, they are uncovering new insights into the importance of coral reefs and the role they play in supporting biodiversity. The discovery of new species and the development of new technologies are also helping to advance our understanding of these complex systems.\n\nIn conclusion, the seemingly paradoxical relationship between coral reefs and tropical water is a testament to the incredible diversity and resilience of life on Earth. As we continue to learn more about these ecosystems, we are reminded of the importance of preserving and protecting them for future generations.",

        "Text": "Rupert Murdoch is likely to lose nearly all of the $100m he invested in Theranos, the blood testing startup beset by scandals exposed by the Wall Street Journal, his flagship business newspaper. Murdoch is reported to have invested $100m in Theranos between 2014 and 2015, when its valuation was soaring thanks to the promise of being able to revolutionize blood testing by replacing needles with low-cost finger pricks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Murdoch was part of a group of wealthy families and individuals who invested $632m in Theranos's latest funding round at about $17 a share, giving the Silicon Valley company a valuation of nearly $9bn, and making it the highest-valued private healthcare startup in the US. However, the fortunes of Theranos have since taken a dramatic turn for the worse. In October 2015, the Wall Street Journal published a series of investigative articles exposing the company's alleged fraudulent practices, including claims that its technology was not capable of conducting accurate blood tests.\n\nThe articles, written by journalist John Carreyrou, revealed that Theranos's proprietary technology, dubbed the Edison device, was not able to perform the range of tests it claimed to, and that the company was relying on third-party machines to conduct most of its testing. The articles also alleged that the company's founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, had made false claims about the technology's capabilities and had misled investors and regulators.\n\nThe fallout from the articles has been swift and severe. In March 2016, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ordered Theranos to cease operating its blood-testing laboratory in Newark, California, citing \"deceptive\" and \"misleading\" practices. The company was also forced to recall its products and to destroy its remaining inventory.\n\nTheranos has since faced numerous lawsuits and regulatory investigations, including a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into its fundraising practices. In June 2018, the company agreed to pay a $500,000 fine to settle the SEC's charges, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.\n\nAs a result of the scandals, Theranos's valuation has plummeted, and the company is now reportedly worth less than $1 billion. Rupert Murdoch, who had invested $100 million in the company, is likely to lose nearly all of his investment. The exact amount of his loss is unclear, but it is estimated that he will likely take a hit of around $90 million.\n\nThe failure of Theranos serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of investing in companies without thoroughly vetting their claims and practices. It also highlights the importance of robust regulatory oversight and the need for greater transparency in the healthcare industry.\n\nFor Murdoch, the loss is a significant setback, but it is not the first time he has faced financial losses as a result of his investments. In 2013, he wrote off a $1.5 billion loss on his investment in the social media platform, MySpace. However, the Theranos debacle is likely to be a more significant blow, given the company's high valuation and the level of scrutiny it received.\n\nAs the dust settles on the Theranos saga, investors and regulators alike are left to ponder the lessons learned from the company's collapse. While the exact extent of Murdoch's losses remains unclear, one thing is certain: the failure of Theranos will serve as a reminder of the importance of due diligence and the need for greater transparency in the healthcare industry.",

The Great Red Spot has never looked bigger. NASA's Juno spacecraft has been making repeated swoops just above the cloud tops of Jupiter. During the latest flyby, on Monday, the spacecraft passed about 5,600 miles over the Great Red Spot, a 10,000-mile-wide storm that has swirled for at least 350 years.\n\nAs Juno flew by, its instruments gathered a wealth of new data about the storm's structure and behavior. According to NASA scientists, the Great Red Spot is actually a giant anticyclonic storm, meaning that it is a high-pressure region with clockwise rotation. This is in contrast to hurricanes on Earth, which are low-pressure systems with counterclockwise rotation.\n\nThe new data also reveals that the storm is much deeper than previously thought, extending from about 30 miles below the cloud tops to as deep as 100 miles. This suggests that the Great Red Spot is not just a surface phenomenon, but is driven by complex atmospheric processes that involve Jupiter's internal heat and rotation.\n\n\"The Great Red Spot is an incredible feature of Jupiter's atmosphere, and Juno's close flybys have given us a unique perspective on its behavior,\" said Scott Bolton, the principal investigator for the Juno mission. \"By studying the storm's structure and dynamics, we can gain insights into the underlying processes that drive Jupiter's atmosphere and the solar system as a whole.\"\n\nThe Great Red Spot has been a source of fascination for scientists and the public alike for centuries. It was first observed in 1831 by astronomer Samuel Heinrich Schwabe, and has been the subject of numerous studies and observations since then. Despite its size and longevity, the storm is actually shrinking, with its diameter decreasing by about 100 miles over the past 150 years.\n\nThe Juno spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, and has made numerous close flybys of the planet's cloud tops. The spacecraft is equipped with a range of instruments designed to study Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic field, and interior. The data collected by Juno has greatly expanded our understanding of Jupiter and its place in the solar system.\n\nIn the coming months, Juno will continue to make close flybys of Jupiter, gathering even more data about the planet's atmosphere and interior. The mission is expected to continue until 2025, when it will conclude its primary mission and begin a extended mission to study the planet's polar regions.",

A new study suggests Aesop was right about the geographical differences in rodent diets. By analyzing the remains of brown rats that lived in and around Toronto between 1790 and 1890, researchers have determined that city rats enjoyed a higher-quality and more stable diet than rural rats did. The study, published in the Journal of Mammalian Evolution, provides a unique glimpse into the dietary habits of brown rats in the past. The researchers analyzed the skeletal remains of over 100 brown rats found in Toronto's city center, as well as in rural areas surrounding the city. By examining the rat bones, the team was able to reconstruct the rodents' diets and identify patterns of consumption.\n\nAccording to the study, city rats had access to a wider variety of food sources, including human waste, grain, and other scraps. This diversity of food sources allowed them to thrive in the urban environment, with many city rats living well into old age. In contrast, rural rats were forced to rely on a more limited diet of seeds, fruits, and insects, which was less reliable and more susceptible to fluctuations in availability.\n\nThe researchers also found that city rats had a higher percentage of protein in their diets, which is likely due to their access to human waste and other high-protein food sources. This is in contrast to rural rats, which had a diet that was more focused on carbohydrates.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of urban-rural differences in the past. \"This study shows that even in the 19th century, there were significant differences in the diets of urban and rural rodents,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, the study's lead author. \"These differences likely had a significant impact on the health and well-being of the rats, and may have even influenced the spread of diseases.\"\n\nThe study's results also provide a fascinating glimpse into the lives of brown rats in the past. \"Rats have often been viewed as pests, but this study shows that they were also an important part of the urban ecosystem,\" said Dr. Smith. \"By studying their diets, we can gain a better understanding of the complex relationships between humans and animals in the past.\"\n\nThe study's findings are likely to be of interest to historians, anthropologists, and biologists alike. As researchers continue to uncover new insights into the lives of brown rats in the past, we may gain a greater appreciation for the complex and fascinating world of urban rodents.",

        "Text": "Damian Hinds claims \"the overwhelming majority of academies tell a positive story … we've come a long way in the past eight years\" (53,000 pupils trapped in 'zombie' academy schools, Labour says, 15 April). Try telling that to the increasing proportion of children and young people (and their families) permanently excluded from academies. Government figures show that in 2009-10, of the 5,740 children and young people permanently excluded from schools, 590 (10%) were from academies. The most recent figures (2016-17) show that not only has the total number risen to 7,720 (in itself a scandal), but also that the number of young people permanently excluded from academies has risen disproportionately, to 4,620 (60% of all who were permanently excluded in that year). The stark contrast between Damian Hinds' optimistic assessment of academy schools and the reality faced by thousands of children and young people is a worrying trend that demands attention. The figures speak for themselves: between 2009-10 and 2016-17, the total number of permanent exclusions from schools has increased by 34%, while the proportion of those exclusions from academies has skyrocketed by 680%.\n\nThis alarming trend raises serious concerns about the quality of education and support provided by academies. It is unacceptable that a significant proportion of young people are being pushed out of education, often with long-term consequences for their future prospects. The impact on these individuals, their families, and the wider community is devastating.\n\nMoreover, the fact that academies are disproportionately represented among the schools with high rates of permanent exclusion suggests that there may be systemic issues at play. The lack of accountability and oversight that often accompanies academy status may be contributing to a culture of exclusions, rather than a focus on supporting students who are struggling.\n\nThe Labour Party's claims that 53,000 pupils are trapped in \"zombie\" academy schools may seem hyperbolic, but the evidence suggests that there is a serious problem that requires urgent attention. The government must take immediate action to address the root causes of permanent exclusions, rather than simply touting the successes of academy schools.\n\nThis includes providing additional support for schools to help them manage challenging behaviors and develop more effective strategies for inclusion. It also means holding academies accountable for their performance and ensuring that they are providing a high-quality education to all students, regardless of their background or ability.\n\nUltimately, the future of our education system depends on our ability to provide a supportive and inclusive environment for all students. The government must take a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to addressing the issue of permanent exclusions, rather than simply relying on platitudes and spin. The consequences of inaction will be devastating, and it is up to us to ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed.",

The JPMorgan boss, Jamie Dimon, and the Goldman Sachs chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, enjoyed rises of more than $150m (£115m) each in the value of their stock and options in the banks they run, according to an annual review of bank CEO pay by Equilar for the Financial Times (paywall). The other 18 best-paid bank chief executives in the world fared less well, with average gains of $4m in their stock-related holdings last year. Dimon was also the best-paid banking boss in the world for the second year running, raking in $28.2m of pay, bonus and pension contributions last year. The Morgan Stanley chief executive, James Gorman, came second at $22.5m, followed by Blankfein at $22.3m. The figures highlight the significant windfalls enjoyed by the top bankers in the wake of Trump's election victory in November 2016. The stock market surge that followed was driven by expectations of tax cuts, deregulation, and infrastructure spending, which boosted investor confidence and sent stock prices soaring.\n\nThe review by Equilar, a leading provider of executive compensation data, found that Dimon's total compensation package was comprised of a base salary of $1.5 million, a bonus of $10.5 million, and pension contributions of $16.2 million. The JPMorgan boss's stock and option holdings, which are tied to the bank's performance, rose in value by $153.8 million last year, making him the biggest winner among the top 20 highest-paid bank CEOs.\n\nBlankfein, who has been at the helm of Goldman Sachs since 2006, saw his total compensation package total $22.3 million, including a base salary of $2 million, a bonus of $10 million, and pension contributions of $10.3 million. His stock and option holdings rose in value by $151.1 million, making him the second-highest paid bank CEO in the world.\n\nThe review also found that the average total compensation package for the top 20 highest-paid bank CEOs was $12.8 million, with the median total compensation package standing at $9.5 million. The average bonus paid to the top 20 bank CEOs was $3.4 million, with the median bonus standing at $2.5 million.\n\nThe figures have sparked criticism from some quarters, with some arguing that the massive pay packages are out of touch with the struggles faced by ordinary Americans. However, proponents of the system argue that the high pay is necessary to attract and retain top talent in a highly competitive industry.\n\nThe review comes as banks are facing increased scrutiny over their compensation practices, with some lawmakers calling for greater transparency and accountability. The issue is likely to remain a contentious one in the coming years, as the banking industry continues to evolve and adapt to changing regulatory environments and market conditions.",

Designed by someone actually called Berk, the idea behind the mirror is that smiling, even if faked, can make us genuinely feel better (known as the facial feedback hypothesis), and that laughter can improve immune function and even ostensibly make us live longer. The evidence for the effect is dubious, but more to the point … it is possible to smile when looking into a normal mirror. The product is a screen fitted with a camera that uses facial recognition to tell when an individual is smiling, which turns the screen reflective. The \"Smile Mirror\" was unveiled at a recent technology conference, where it received a mixed reaction from attendees. While some praised the innovative approach to mental health, others questioned the practicality and effectiveness of the product.\n\nCritics argue that the mirror's reliance on facial recognition technology may not accurately detect smiles, particularly in individuals with certain medical conditions or facial paralysis. They also point out that the mirror's reflective surface only appears when the user is smiling, which may not be a feasible solution for those who struggle to muster a genuine smile.\n\nProponents of the \"Smile Mirror\", however, believe that it has the potential to bring joy and positivity to cancer patients during a difficult time. Berk, the designer of the mirror, claims that the product is not meant to replace traditional therapy or treatment, but rather to provide a unique tool for patients to practice smiling and laughing.\n\nThe company behind the \"Smile Mirror\" is planning to conduct clinical trials to test the product's effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes for cancer patients. If the results are positive, the mirror may become a valuable addition to the arsenal of tools available to healthcare professionals.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the \"Smile Mirror\", it has sparked an important conversation about the role of technology in mental health care. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see more innovative products and solutions aimed at improving patient well-being.\n\nIn the meantime, the \"Smile Mirror\" remains a thought-provoking example of the power of technology to shape our understanding of mental health and wellness. Whether or not it becomes a mainstream success, it has undoubtedly sparked a valuable discussion about the importance of smiling and laughter in our lives.",

Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting. The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent. The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitter's reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russia's efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide. Twitter's latest revelation has sparked fresh concerns about the company's ability to accurately measure its user base, just as it is facing intense scrutiny over its handling of misinformation and abuse on its platform. The admission that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 is likely to raise questions about the company's transparency and accountability.\n\nThe mistake, which was attributed to a mistake in counting data from third-party applications, is significant because it means that Twitter's reported user growth has been artificially inflated. The company's daily active users rose 14 percent in the third quarter, but it is unclear how many of those users were actually active on the platform.\n\nTwitter's struggles to accurately measure its user base come as the company is facing increasing pressure to address concerns about the spread of misinformation and abuse on its platform. The company has been criticized for its slow response to the spread of false information during the 2016 presidential election, and for its failure to adequately address the problem of harassment and abuse on its platform.\n\nThe company's latest quarterly report also highlighted the challenges it is facing in terms of user growth. While Twitter's daily active users rose 14 percent in the third quarter, the company's monthly active users declined by 2 million to 330 million. The company's user growth has been slowing in recent years, and some investors are becoming increasingly skeptical about Twitter's ability to reverse this trend.\n\nTwitter's struggles are likely to be a major focus for investors and analysts in the coming weeks, as the company prepares to report its full-year results. The company's stock has been under pressure in recent months, and any further signs of slowing user growth or increased competition from other social media platforms could lead to further declines.\n\nIn the meantime, Twitter is facing increasing scrutiny over its handling of misinformation and abuse on its platform. The company has been accused of failing to adequately address the problem of harassment and abuse on its platform, and of being too slow to respond to the spread of false information during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe company has taken some steps to address these concerns, including the introduction of new rules and policies aimed at reducing the spread of misinformation on its platform. However, many critics argue that these efforts are not going far enough, and that the company needs to do more to address the problem of abuse and harassment on its platform.\n\nAs Twitter continues to grapple with these challenges, it is clear that the company's reputation is at stake. The company's latest revelation has sparked fresh concerns about its ability to accurately measure its user base, and its struggles to address concerns about misinformation and abuse on its platform are likely to continue to dominate the headlines in the coming weeks.",

Vinay Kumar, a scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) India programme, captured the puffing pachyderm while visiting camera traps in the Nagarahole national park in Karnataka state. The 48-second video shows the elephant picking up something with its trunk and putting it in its mouth, then blowing out a gust of smoke. Biologists from the WCS said the footage, shot in April 2016 but only recently posted online, was \"the first known video documentation of a wild elephant exhibiting such behaviour, and has scientists and experts puzzled\". The video has sparked widespread interest and debate among wildlife enthusiasts and experts, with many trying to explain the unusual behavior. Some have speculated that the elephant may have accidentally ingested a plant or insect that produced the smoke, while others believe it could be a form of communication or even a playful behavior.\n\nDr. Kumar, who has spent years studying the behavior of Asian elephants in the region, said that the footage was \"completely unexpected\" and has raised more questions than answers. \"We've never seen anything like this before,\" he said. \"We've studied the behavior of Asian elephants for years, and this is a completely new phenomenon.\"\n\nThe WCS has launched an investigation into the behavior, and experts are analyzing the footage to determine what may have caused the elephant to produce the smoke. The organization is also reviewing data from camera traps in the area to see if there are any other instances of similar behavior.\n\nThe Nagarahole national park, where the footage was captured, is home to a large population of Asian elephants, and the park is considered a critical habitat for the species. The park is also a popular tourist destination, and the unusual behavior has generated significant interest among visitors.\n\nWhile the exact cause of the elephant's behavior remains a mystery, the footage has highlighted the importance of continued research and conservation efforts for Asian elephants. The WCS is working to protect the habitat and migration routes of the species, and the organization is also involved in efforts to reduce human-wildlife conflict and promote coexistence between humans and elephants.\n\nThe footage has also sparked a wider conversation about the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. \"This footage is a reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of the natural world,\" said Dr. Kumar. \"It's a reminder of the importance of preserving and protecting these ecosystems, and the species that call them home.\"",

The age-old conundrum of choosing the perfect primary school for your child. It's a decision that can spark intense debate, compromise, and even a dash of desperation.

Adrian Hallmark, the chief executive of the luxury carmaker, told Reuters it was stockpiling some components ahead of Brexit and switching from the port of Dover to Immingham to bring in certain parts. The Volkswagen-owned marque makes about 11,000 cars a year in Crewe. If London and Brussels fail to reach an agreement by the end of the year, Bentley may stockpile more car parts and close its factory for a few extra days, said Hallmark, who joined Bentley from Jaguar Land Rover in February.

        "Text": "Home Retail Group boss John Walden will be in line for a windfall of more than £5m in cash and shares if the owner of Argos is sold to Sainsbury's. It is not clear if Walden will stay on if Sainsbury's finalises the £1.4bn takeover deal, but Home Retail Group's annual report published on Tuesday revealed that in either case the chief executive would be able to cash in more than 650,000 shares and options, which are not subject to performance conditions. Under the terms of Sainsbury's takeover deal – which offers 0.321 Sainsbury's shares and 55p in cash for every Home Retail Group share as well as a 25p windfall from the sale of the Homebase chain and a 2.8p dividend, that would be worth £1m. Walden's windfall could potentially be more than double that after he was awarded 785,000 shares and share options in May last year, which are subject to three-year performance criteria and worth £1.3m, and 143,000 which he received this year. The potential windfall for Walden comes as Sainsbury's continues to navigate a highly competitive retail landscape. The supermarket chain has been looking to expand its presence in the non-food sector, and the acquisition of Home Retail Group would provide a significant boost to its online and in-store offerings.\n\nIndustry analysts have praised the deal, citing the complementary nature of the two businesses and the potential for cost savings and increased efficiency. \"This deal makes a lot of sense for Sainsbury's,\" said retail expert, Helen Dickinson. \"Home Retail Group has a strong online presence and a loyal customer base, which would be a great addition to Sainsbury's existing operations.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the deal is a done deal. Some shareholders have expressed concerns about the potential impact on Home Retail Group's operations and the future of its employees. \"While the deal may make sense on paper, we need to see more detail about how Sainsbury's plans to integrate Home Retail Group's operations and what the future holds for its employees,\" said one shareholder.\n\nWalden's potential windfall has also raised eyebrows among some industry observers. While it is not uncommon for executives to receive significant payouts as part of a takeover deal, some have questioned whether it is fair for Walden to receive such a large sum of money, given the potential impact on Home Retail Group's employees and operations.\n\nDespite these concerns, it is clear that Sainsbury's is committed to the deal and is willing to pay a premium to acquire Home Retail Group. The company has offered a 14% premium to Home Retail Group's current share price, which has been welcomed by many investors.\n\nThe deal is expected to be completed in the coming months, pending regulatory approval. If successful, it would be one of the biggest retail deals of the year, and would mark a significant shift in the UK retail landscape.",

        "Text": "The fly agaric is the quintessential mushroom of fairy tales. Its big, bright fruiting bodies scatter in great numbers across mossy forests of North America and Europe. They emerge from the soil first like white eggs, abandoned by some mysterious creature of the woods. As the days pass, the eggs begin to crack open, releasing the vibrant red caps and white gills of the fly agaric mushroom. The caps, shaped like a crown or a hat, can grow up to 5 inches in diameter, making them a striking sight in the forest floor. The bright red color is a result of the mushroom's unique chemistry, containing a compound called gyromitrin, which is responsible for its distinctive hue.\n\nDespite their striking appearance, fly agaric mushrooms are not typically sought after for their culinary value. In fact, they are considered toxic to humans and can cause nausea, vomiting, and even hallucinations if ingested. However, they do have a long history of use in traditional medicine and folk remedies.\n\nIn many indigenous cultures, fly agaric mushrooms were used to treat a range of ailments, from fever and rheumatism to epilepsy and even mental health conditions. The mushrooms were often brewed into teas or used in tinctures, and their active compounds were believed to have a range of therapeutic effects.\n\nOne of the most fascinating uses of fly agaric mushrooms is in their connection to shamanic rituals. In some cultures, the mushrooms were used to induce a state of altered consciousness, allowing shamans to communicate with spirits and access other realms of consciousness. The fly agaric's psychoactive properties made it a sought-after ingredient in many traditional rituals and ceremonies.\n\nDespite their cultural significance, fly agaric mushrooms are facing threats to their survival. Habitat destruction and climate change are altering the delicate balance of the forest ecosystem, making it harder for the mushrooms to thrive. Additionally, overcollection by mushroom enthusiasts and commercial interests is putting pressure on wild populations.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the fly agaric and its habitat. Researchers are studying the mushrooms' life cycle and ecology to better understand how to manage their populations and protect their habitat. Additionally, educational programs are being implemented to raise awareness about the importance of sustainable mushroom harvesting and the need to respect these unique and fascinating organisms.\n\nAs we continue to learn more about the fly agaric and its many uses, it's clear that this humble mushroom is more than just a pretty face. Its unique chemistry and cultural significance make it a fascinating subject of study, and its importance to the ecosystem cannot be overstated. As we work to protect this iconic species, we are also working to preserve the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of the forests they call home.",

        "Text": "To fight the pestilence, the ants aligned themselves with a bacteria that produces a chemical capable of subduing the parasite. Now, Dr. Currie and his colleagues have found evidence that suggests that the partnership between ants and antimicrobial bacteria has existed for tens of millions of years. The key clues came from two 20-million-year-old ants that were discovered, trapped in amber, in the Dominican Republic. One of the fossilized ants had specialized pockets on its head, called crypts, that are also seen on modern ants. The discovery of the 20-million-year-old ants in amber has provided a fascinating glimpse into the ancient history of the ants' symbiotic relationship with antimicrobial bacteria. The crypts on the head of the fossilized ants are a striking similarity to those found on modern ants, which are believed to be used to harbor and protect the bacteria.\n\nAccording to Dr. Currie, the finding suggests that the partnership between ants and antimicrobial bacteria has been a long-standing and crucial component of ant evolution. \"The fact that we see these same specialized structures in ants that lived 20 million years ago is a strong indication that this partnership has been around for tens of millions of years,\" he said.\n\nThe discovery also sheds light on the evolutionary pressures that drove the development of this unique relationship. Dr. Currie and his team believe that the ants' reliance on the bacteria to fight off parasites was a key factor in their success. \"The ants' ability to form this partnership with bacteria allowed them to thrive in environments where other insects might have struggled to survive,\" he explained.\n\nThe finding has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of social insects, including bees, wasps, and termites. These insects also rely on symbiotic relationships with microorganisms to survive, and the discovery of the ancient ant-bacteria partnership provides a new perspective on the origins of these relationships.\n\nThe research team is now working to further analyze the fossilized ants and the bacteria they harbored. By studying the genetic makeup of the bacteria, they hope to gain a better understanding of how the partnership evolved over time and how it has been maintained over millions of years.\n\nThe discovery is also expected to have practical applications in the field of medicine. The bacteria used by the ants to fight off parasites could potentially be used to develop new treatments for diseases caused by parasites in humans. \"The fact that ants have been using this strategy for millions of years is a testament to its effectiveness,\" said Dr. Currie. \"By studying this partnership, we may be able to develop new ways to combat parasites and improve human health.\"",

But the tale that best sums up Hugh Hefner's den of iniquity, for a lot of women, comes from Sharan Magnuson, who arrived in Hollywood in 1980 to pursue an acting career and soon discovered a side of the Playboy Mansion that most people never discussed -- certainly not if they wanted to be invited back. \"At first, it was magical,\" Ms. Magnuson, who went on to become a senior executive at Warner Bros., said by phone on Thursday, a day after the death of Playboy's founder, Hugh Hefner. \"Glamorous. But as the months went by, Ms. Magnuson said she began to notice a darker side to the mansion's allure. She recalled being invited to join Hefner and his friends for parties, only to find herself surrounded by an atmosphere of objectification and exploitation.\n\n\"It was like being in a harem,\" Ms. Magnuson said, her voice laced with a mix of sadness and anger. \"You'd be treated like a piece of meat, and if you didn't go along with it, you'd be dismissed. It was all about the men's pleasure, and the women were just there to serve it.\"\n\nMs. Magnuson's experiences at the Playboy Mansion were not unique. Dozens of women have come forward in recent years with similar allegations of sexual harassment and assault, claiming that Hefner and his associates created a culture of entitlement and impunity.\n\nThe allegations have led to a re-evaluation of Hefner's legacy, with many critics arguing that his celebration of sexuality and freedom was often used as a cover for misogyny and exploitation. While Hefner's defenders point to his role in promoting women's rights and sexual liberation, his detractors argue that his actions and attitudes were fundamentally at odds with those values.\n\nFor Ms. Magnuson, the experience of being a young woman in Hollywood during the 1980s was a difficult and disillusioning one. She eventually left the acting business and went on to build a successful career in the film industry, but the memories of her time at the Playboy Mansion have stayed with her to this day.\n\n\"I'm just glad I got out when I did,\" Ms. Magnuson said. \"I'm grateful that I didn't get stuck in that world. But I'm also angry that it took so long for people to start talking about the harm that was being done. It's only now, with Hefner's death, that we're starting to confront the reality of what went on at that mansion.\"\n\nAs the entertainment industry continues to grapple with the fallout from the #MeToo movement, Ms. Magnuson's story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of accountability and transparency. It also highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of Hefner's legacy, one that acknowledges both his contributions to popular culture and his complicity in a culture of exploitation.",

We have two showers running off a hot water tank. A common conundrum for many households! Our reader is wondering how to optimize their hot water usage and reduce their energy bills. Let's dive into the solution.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to understand that having two showers running off a single hot water tank can indeed be challenging, especially during peak usage hours. However, with a few simple tweaks and strategies, our reader can make the most of their hot water supply.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to conserve hot water is to install a shower timer. This nifty device can be set to limit the shower time to a specific duration, usually between 4-6 minutes. This not only saves hot water but also encourages users to be more mindful of their water usage.\n\nAnother clever solution is to invest in a showerhead with a low-flow rate. These showerheads use significantly less water than traditional models, which means less hot water is required to fill the tank. Our reader can also consider upgrading to a low-flow showerhead with a built-in temperature control, which can help regulate the water temperature and reduce energy consumption.\n\nFor those who prefer a more luxurious shower experience, a thermostatic shower mixer can be a game-changer. This type of mixer maintains a consistent water temperature, ensuring that the shower remains comfortable and enjoyable, even when multiple users are sharing the same hot water tank.\n\nIn addition to these practical solutions, our reader can also consider implementing some simple habits to reduce their hot water usage.

The chain has also expanded its operations, opening 15 new branches in the first half of the year and announcing plans to open a further 20 sites in the coming months.\n\nPizza Express, meanwhile, is taking a more cautious approach, putting its expansion plans on hold and focusing on revamping its menu and improving the customer experience at its existing sites. The company is also investing in its digital presence, introducing a new mobile app and improving its online ordering and delivery service.\n\nIndustry analysts believe that Pizza Express' struggles are a result of its failure to adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences. \"Pizza Express has been slow to respond to the shift towards healthier and more exotic dining options,\" said one analyst. \"Franco Manca, on the other hand, has been quick to innovate and capitalize on the trend towards artisanal and plant-based food.\"\n\nThe contrasting fortunes of the two chains highlight the challenges facing the casual dining industry, as consumers increasingly demand more from their dining experiences. While Pizza Express struggles to maintain its market share, Franco Manca is poised to continue its rapid expansion and growth.\n\nIn the end, the battle for market share between Pizza Express and Franco Manca will come down to which chain can best adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences. As the competition continues to heat up, one thing is clear: the winner will be the chain that can deliver the most innovative and appealing dining experience to its customers.",

The committee, which includes members from the Conservative, Labour, and Liberal Democrat parties, has urged the BBC to continue providing a broad range of programming to cater to diverse audiences across the UK.\n\nThe committee's report, published today, also criticizes the deal between the BBC and the government to make it provide free TV licenses for over-75s. The peers argue that the arrangement is unfair and could lead to a significant increase in the BBC's costs, which could ultimately impact its ability to fund high-quality programming.\n\n\"We recognize the importance of the BBC's universal broadcasting role in providing a wide range of programming to audiences across the UK,\" said Baroness Hollins, the chair of the committee. \"We believe that the corporation should continue to prioritize this role and not be forced to scale back its services as a result of the funding settlement.\"\n\nThe report also calls on the government to provide more funding to the BBC to support its universal broadcasting role. The peers argue that the corporation's funding has been consistently eroded over the years, and that it is essential to provide a stable and sustainable funding model to ensure its long-term viability.\n\nThe BBC has welcomed the report and has reiterated its commitment to providing a broad range of programming to audiences across the UK. \"We are pleased that the committee has recognized the importance of our universal broadcasting role and has urged the government to provide more funding to support our services,\" said a BBC spokesperson. \"We will continue to work with the government and other stakeholders to ensure that we can continue to provide high-quality programming to audiences across the UK.\"\n\nThe report is likely to be welcomed by the BBC's supporters, who have been concerned about the impact of the funding settlement on the corporation's services.

Yes, but not only them. The US navy is reportedly preparing new guidelines that will encourage pilots to report any \"unexplained aerial phenomena\" they happen to come across, without fearing ridicule. You mean \"unidentified flying objects\"? The US Navy's move is a significant shift in the way it approaches these types of sightings, and it's not just limited to the realm of conspiracy theorists. The term \"unexplained aerial phenomena\" is a deliberate choice, avoiding the more sensationalized \"UFO\" label, which has often been met with skepticism and ridicule.\n\nAccording to sources, the new guidelines are aimed at encouraging pilots to report any unusual sightings, without fear of being ostracized or ridiculed by their peers. This change in approach is seen as a step towards taking these sightings more seriously, and potentially uncovering new information about the nature of these mysterious events.\n\nThe US Navy's decision to adopt this new approach is not without precedent. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of unidentified aerial phenomena being reported by military personnel and commercial pilots. In 2015, for example, the Pentagon released a video showing an unidentified flying object being tracked by a Navy F/A-18 fighter jet. The video, which was captured in 2004, showed a white, oval-shaped object moving rapidly through the air.\n\nSimilarly, in 2017, a group of commercial airline pilots reported seeing a strange, glowing object hovering in the sky while flying over the Pacific Ocean. The incident was widely reported and sparked widespread speculation about the nature of the sighting.\n\nWhile the US Navy's new guidelines are not necessarily a confirmation of the existence of extraterrestrial life, they do represent a significant shift in the way that these types of sightings are approached. By encouraging pilots to report unusual sightings without fear of ridicule, the Navy may be able to uncover new information about the nature of these events and potentially shed more light on the mystery surrounding them.\n\nThe implications of the US Navy's new guidelines are far-reaching, and could potentially have significant consequences for our understanding of the universe. Whether or not the sightings are ultimately attributed to extraterrestrial life, the fact that the US Navy is taking these sightings seriously is a significant development that could have a major impact on the way we approach the study of the unknown.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, it will be interesting to see how the US Navy's new guidelines play out, and what kind of information is uncovered as a result. One thing is certain, however: the US Navy's decision to take unidentified aerial phenomena more seriously is a significant step forward, and could potentially lead to some major breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe.",

        "Text": "As Tom Price, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, headed to a meeting at the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston on Tuesday, a reporter from the Public News Service trailed after him in a hallway. The reporter, Dan Heyman, wanted to ask about the health care legislation the House passed last week to replace the Affordable Care Act. With his Android smartphone in hand to use as an audio recorder, Mr. Heyman said in an interview on Wednesday, he reached over some of the staff and security members surrounding Mr. Price. ...and touched the secretary's arm to get his attention. According to eyewitnesses, Mr. Heyman asked Mr. Price, \"Have you reviewed the bill?\" as the secretary was walking towards the meeting room.\n\nHowever, the encounter was cut short when Capitol Police officers intervened, allegedly citing a \"physical obstruction\" and arresting Mr. Heyman on the spot. The reporter was taken away in handcuffs, sparking outrage among journalism advocates and free speech proponents.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the increasing trend of government agencies cracking down on reporters and whistleblowers who dare to ask tough questions. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has since issued a statement condemning the arrest, saying that it \"sets a dangerous precedent for the government to silence journalists and stifle public debate.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has since released a statement defending the actions of the Capitol Police, claiming that Mr. Heyman's behavior was \"aggressive\" and \"disruptive.\" However, many have questioned the necessity of the arrest, with some arguing that it was an overreaction on the part of the authorities.\n\nThe incident has also sparked a heated debate about the role of the media in holding government accountable. Many have taken to social media to express their support for Mr. Heyman and the importance of a free press in a democratic society.\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what consequences Mr. Heyman will face for his actions. The Public News Service has announced that it will continue to support its reporter and will fight any attempts to silence him. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of protecting the rights of journalists and the public's right to know.",

        "Text": "A young sperm whale that washed ashore on the southeast coast of Spain in February most likely died after being unable to digest more than 60 pounds of plastic trash, fish netting and garbage bags in its stomach and intestines, scientists said this month. The 33-foot-long whale was swept onto a rocky beach in Cape Palos, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, on Feb. 27. It was not yet fully grown but weighed just 13,000 pounds, an unusually scrawny size for a whale that can reach 120,000 pounds as an adult. The autopsy report, conducted by a team of marine biologists and veterinarians from the University of Murcia and the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, revealed a shocking amount of plastic debris lodged in the whale's digestive system. The team leader, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, explained that the whale's stomach and intestines were filled with a tangled mess of plastic trash, including fish netting, garbage bags, and other types of plastic waste.\n\n\"It's a tragic reminder of the devastating impact of plastic pollution on our oceans and its inhabitants,\" Dr. Rodriguez said. \"The whale's death is a stark illustration of the consequences of human carelessness and neglect.\"\n\nThe scientists believe that the whale, which was still in its juvenile stage, ingested the plastic debris while feeding on fish and squid in the Mediterranean Sea. The plastic waste likely got stuck in its digestive system, causing blockages and starvation, ultimately leading to the whale's death.\n\nThe autopsy also revealed that the whale had a severely underdeveloped digestive system, which made it even more vulnerable to the effects of plastic pollution. The team found that the whale's stomach was only about one-third the size of a normal adult sperm whale, indicating that it was not yet fully developed.\n\n\"This young whale was already struggling to survive due to its underdeveloped digestive system, and the plastic pollution was the final blow,\" Dr. Rodriguez said. \"It's a heartbreaking reminder of the urgent need to address the plastic pollution crisis in our oceans.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread outrage and calls for action to reduce plastic waste and protect marine life. The Spanish government has pledged to increase efforts to combat plastic pollution and has launched a campaign to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, the University of Murcia has launched an investigation into the whale's death and is working with local authorities to remove any remaining plastic debris from the beach and surrounding waters. The team is also conducting further research to better understand the impact of plastic pollution on marine life and to develop effective solutions to mitigate its effects.\n\nAs the world grapples with the plastic pollution crisis, the tragic death of this young sperm whale serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for collective action to protect our oceans and their inhabitants.",

Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have spied a previously undetected satellite around the solar system's eighth planet, bringing its total number to 14. The discovery, formally reported Wednesday in Nature, is a stark reminder that there is much more to be found in our own backyard, with implications for our understanding of worlds around other stars in our galaxy. The newly discovered moon, temporarily designated as S/2004 N 1, is a small and icy world that orbits Neptune at a distance of approximately 16 million miles (25.7 million kilometers). According to the research team, the moon is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) in diameter, making it one of the smallest moons in the Neptune system.\n\nThe discovery was made possible by the Hubble Space Telescope's ability to capture high-resolution images of the Neptune system. By analyzing the telescope's observations, the team was able to identify the faint, distant object as a new moon orbiting the planet.\n\n\"This is a great example of the power of combining cutting-edge technology with careful observation and analysis,\" said Dr. Heidi Hammel, a planetary scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute and a co-author of the study. \"The Hubble Space Telescope has allowed us to explore the Neptune system in unprecedented detail, and this discovery is a testament to its capabilities.\"\n\nThe discovery of S/2004 N 1 is significant not only because it adds to our understanding of the Neptune system, but also because it provides insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The moon's small size and icy composition suggest that it may have formed from a disk of material that surrounded Neptune as it formed, rather than being captured by the planet's gravity later in its history.\n\nThe discovery also has implications for the search for exomoons, or moons orbiting planets outside our solar system. By studying the properties of moons in our own solar system, astronomers can gain valuable insights into the types of moons that may exist around other stars.\n\n\"The discovery of S/2004 N 1 is a reminder that there is still much to be learned about our own solar system, and that the study of the outer planets is an active and exciting area of research,\" said Dr. Mark Showalter, a planetary scientist at the SETI Institute and a co-author of the study. \"We're excited to see what other secrets the Neptune system may hold, and we're already planning our next observations to learn more about this fascinating new moon.\"",

        "Text": "The big Tesla battery in South Australia is consistently working to serve the peak energy demand each day, taking the \"straw off the camel's back,\" according to the Australia Institute's latest national energy emissions audit. The report also finds emissions from the National Electricity Market [NEM] continued to drop in January, falling to their lowest levels since 2004, driven by the federal large-scale renewable energy target. Energy expert Hugh Saddler examined the consumption and output of electricity of the Hornsdale Power Reserve, analysing the patterns of charging and discharging of the Tesla battery. According to Saddler's analysis, the Hornsdale Power Reserve, located in South Australia, has been successfully managing the peak energy demand each day, thereby reducing the strain on the grid. The report highlights that the battery's ability to store and release energy has been instrumental in mitigating the impact of peak demand on the National Electricity Market.\n\nThe Hornsdale Power Reserve, which is owned by Neoen and operated by Tesla, has been in operation since 2017. It has a capacity of 129 megawatts and is designed to provide stability and reliability to the grid. The battery's performance has been closely monitored, and the data collected has provided valuable insights into its capabilities and limitations.\n\nSaddler's analysis revealed that the Hornsdale Power Reserve has been consistently discharging energy during peak demand periods, which typically occur in the late afternoon and early evening. This has helped to reduce the strain on the grid and prevent the need for fossil fuels to be burned to generate electricity.\n\nThe report also found that the battery has been able to absorb excess energy during off-peak periods, such as overnight, and store it for use during the day. This has helped to reduce the amount of energy lost during transmission and distribution, which is known as \"line loss.\"\n\nThe findings of the report are significant, as they demonstrate the potential for large-scale batteries like the Hornsdale Power Reserve to play a crucial role in the transition to a low-carbon energy system. The report's author, Hugh Saddler, emphasized the importance of continued investment in renewable energy and energy storage technologies to achieve this goal.\n\n\"The Hornsdale Power Reserve is a great example of how energy storage can be used to manage the grid and reduce emissions,\" Saddler said. \"As the grid continues to evolve, we can expect to see more of these types of projects being developed and deployed.\"\n\nThe report's findings are also significant in the context of the Australian government's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The federal large-scale renewable energy target, which was introduced in 2009, has been instrumental in driving the growth of the renewable energy sector in Australia. The target requires that at least 20% of Australia's electricity come from renewable sources by 2020.\n\nThe Hornsdale Power Reserve is one of several large-scale energy storage projects that have been developed in Australia in recent years. Other notable projects include the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro storage project in New South Wales and the Victorian Big Battery project, which is currently under construction.\n\nThe success of these projects demonstrates the potential for energy storage to play a critical role in the transition to a low-carbon energy system. As the world continues to transition away from fossil fuels, energy storage will be an essential component of the grid, enabling the efficient and reliable integration of renewable energy sources.",

Outside of Netflix, nobody knows the answer. For years, the streaming giant has been tight-lipped about its viewership numbers, leaving industry insiders and analysts to make educated guesses. However, a recent report by the streaming research firm, Ampere Analysis, has shed some light on the matter.\n\nAccording to Ampere's findings, Netflix's original series have garnered a significant following worldwide. The report estimates that \"House of Cards\" has been viewed by over 100 million households globally, while \"Master of None\" has reached around 50 million households. These numbers are impressive, considering the shows' niche appeal and the fact that they are not widely promoted through traditional advertising channels.\n\nThe report also found that Netflix's original content has been particularly popular among younger viewers. For example, the show \"Stranger Things,\" which premiered in 2016, has been viewed by over 70 million households worldwide, with a significant portion of those viewers falling within the 18-34 age range.\n\nThe lack of transparency around Netflix's viewership numbers has long been a source of frustration for industry observers. Many have argued that the company's refusal to release detailed viewership data makes it difficult to accurately assess the success of its original series.\n\nHowever, Netflix's CEO, Reed Hastings, has defended the company's decision to keep viewership numbers under wraps. In a recent interview, Hastings stated that the company prioritizes engagement and audience satisfaction over raw viewership numbers. \"We're not in the business of counting eyeballs,\" Hastings said. \"We're in the business of creating great content that resonates with our audience.\"\n\nDespite the lack of transparency, it's clear that Netflix's original series have had a significant impact on the television landscape. The company's willingness to take risks on unconventional content has helped to pave the way for other streaming services to do the same.\n\nAs the streaming wars continue to heat up, it will be interesting to see how Netflix and its competitors choose to approach the issue of viewership transparency. One thing is certain, however: the company's commitment to creating high-quality original content has helped to establish it as a major player in the world of television.",

        "Text": "It is August, the month when a new generation of black-legged ticks that transmit Lyme and other diseases are hatching. On forest floors, suburban estates and urban parks, they are looking for their first blood meal. And very often, in the large swaths of North America and Europe where tick-borne disease is on the rise, they are feeding on the ubiquitous white-footed mice and other small mammals notorious for harboring pathogens that sicken humans. As the ticks continue to feed and grow, they become vectors for the diseases they carry. Lyme disease, in particular, has seen a significant increase in cases over the past decade, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reporting a 10% rise in reported cases in the United States alone. The disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, can cause a range of symptoms including fever, headache, and joint pain, and if left untreated, can lead to more severe complications such as arthritis and neurological problems.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the rise in tick-borne disease is the increasing presence of white-footed mice and other small mammals in urban and suburban areas. These rodents are natural hosts for the ticks and can carry the pathogens that cause Lyme disease, as well as other diseases such as babesiosis and anaplasmosis. As the mice and other small mammals venture into human-dominated areas, they bring the ticks with them, increasing the risk of human exposure.\n\nIn response to the growing threat of tick-borne disease, public health officials and researchers are working to develop new strategies for prevention and treatment. One approach is the use of tick repellents and personal protective equipment, such as permethrin-treated clothing and insecticides, to reduce the risk of tick bites. Another approach is the development of vaccines and treatments for tick-borne diseases, with several promising candidates currently in clinical trials.\n\nIn addition to these efforts, researchers are also working to better understand the ecology and behavior of ticks and the diseases they carry. By studying the habitats and habits of ticks, scientists hope to identify areas where ticks are most likely to be present and to develop targeted prevention and control measures. For example, studies have shown that ticks are more likely to be found in areas with dense vegetation and high humidity, and that they are most active during the warmer months of the year.\n\nAs the summer months come to a close, it is clear that the threat of tick-borne disease will continue to pose a significant risk to public health in the coming years. However, by taking steps to prevent tick bites and by supporting research into new prevention and treatment strategies, individuals and communities can take steps to reduce their risk and protect themselves against these diseases.",

The group, one of at least three bringing claims related to the rights issue in 2008, said: \"We look forward to seeing Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March.\" The RBoS Shareholder Action Group's threat to take Royal Bank of Scotland to court over a £1.25 billion claim related to its 2008 cash call has sent shockwaves through the financial community. The group, which represents 27,000 retail investors, has been seeking compensation for losses suffered during the bank's rights issue in 2008, when it raised £12 billion to avoid a government bailout.\n\nThe RBoS Shareholder Action Group's claim is one of several related to the rights issue, which was seen as a desperate measure by the bank to avoid a state-led rescue. At the time, the bank's then-chief executive, Fred Goodwin, had been under intense pressure to raise capital to avoid a government takeover.\n\nHowever, the rights issue was heavily criticized by investors, who felt they were forced to buy more shares at a low price, resulting in significant losses. The RBoS Shareholder Action Group has argued that the bank's handling of the rights issue was \"fundamentally flawed\" and that investors were misled about the true state of the bank's finances.\n\nThe group's threat to take Royal Bank of Scotland to court comes as other shareholders are reportedly considering settling out of court. Sources close to the matter have indicated that some investors are willing to accept a smaller payout in order to avoid the uncertainty and costs associated with a court battle.\n\nHowever, the RBoS Shareholder Action Group has rejected any suggestion of a settlement, saying that it is committed to pursuing its claim through the courts. \"We look forward to seeing Fred Goodwin and RBS in court in March,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe case is set to be heard in the High Court in London in March, and could have significant implications for Royal Bank of Scotland and its shareholders. If the RBoS Shareholder Action Group is successful, it could lead to a significant payout for investors who suffered losses as a result of the 2008 rights issue.\n\nThe case has also raised questions about the accountability of bank executives and the role of regulators in preventing similar incidents in the future. The Financial Services Authority (FSA), which was the UK's financial regulator at the time of the rights issue, has faced criticism for its handling of the situation.\n\nIn a statement, Royal Bank of Scotland said it would \"vigorously defend\" itself against the RBoS Shareholder Action Group's claim. \"We believe that the rights issue was properly conducted and that we have a strong defense against these claims,\" the bank said.\n\nThe case is closely watched by investors and financial analysts, who are waiting to see how it will play out. If the RBoS Shareholder Action Group is successful, it could have significant implications for the banking industry and the way that regulators approach financial crises in the future.",

        "Text": "Ministers must act to end mobile signal \"not spots\" that mean some overseas visitors have better phone reception than people using UK networks, a cross-party group of almost 90 MPs said on Friday. The British Infrastructure Group (BIG), led by former Conservative chairman and minister Grant Shapps, said the time for excuses from the mobile network providers was over. In a report, the MPs said it was \"unacceptable that areas in Britain continue to have such poor mobile connectivity, and that overseas visitors can expect better mobile coverage than Britons stuck with a single provider\". They wrote: \"The time for excuses from the mobile sector is over. The report, titled \"Closing the Gap: Improving Mobile Coverage in the UK\", highlights the stark contrast between the mobile connectivity experienced by visitors from other countries and that of British residents. According to the MPs, this is due to the fact that many mobile networks have prioritized investing in infrastructure in popular tourist destinations and business hubs, leaving rural and urban areas with limited or no coverage.\n\nThe report cites several examples of areas in the UK where mobile signal strength is poor or non-existent, including rural villages, coastal towns, and even parts of major cities. The MPs argue that this not only affects the daily lives of residents but also has significant economic and social implications.\n\n\"Mobile connectivity is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity,\" said Grant Shapps, chair of the British Infrastructure Group. \"We're calling on the government to take action to ensure that all areas of the UK have reliable and consistent mobile coverage. It's unacceptable that visitors from other countries can get better signal strength than Britons.\"\n\nThe report makes several recommendations to address the issue, including increasing investment in mobile infrastructure, introducing measures to encourage competition among mobile network providers, and providing support for rural and urban areas to improve their mobile coverage.\n\nThe MPs are also calling on the government to set clear targets for improving mobile coverage across the UK and to hold mobile network providers accountable for meeting those targets. They argue that this will not only benefit residents but also support the country's economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nThe mobile network providers have been criticized for their slow progress in improving mobile coverage, with some arguing that they have prioritized profits over investment in infrastructure. The report suggests that the government must take a more active role in ensuring that mobile network providers are held accountable for their actions.\n\nThe British Infrastructure Group is urging the government to take immediate action to address the issue of mobile signal \"not spots\" and to work with mobile network providers to develop a comprehensive plan to improve mobile coverage across the UK. The report is expected to be debated in Parliament in the coming weeks, with the government facing pressure to take action to address the issue.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- Google said Thursday that it had reached a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board over complaints from multiple employees who say the company has stymied dissent, including one who has said he was fired for being an outspoken conservative. Google plans to explain to employees the rights they have as workers under federal law, like the ability to discuss workplace conditions, said Jenn Kaiser, a Google spokeswoman. The settlement, which was announced in a statement by Google, comes after the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed complaints against the company in 2020, alleging that it had engaged in unfair labor practices. The complaints were filed by multiple employees who claimed that Google had retaliated against them for speaking out about working conditions and company policies.\n\nAccording to the NLRB, Google had violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by prohibiting employees from discussing certain topics, including politics and social issues, in the workplace. The agency also alleged that the company had fired or disciplined employees for engaging in protected concerted activity, such as organizing or participating in protests.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Google has agreed to provide training to its employees on their rights under federal labor law, including their right to discuss workplace conditions and engage in protected concerted activity. The company has also agreed to provide a written policy statement to employees outlining their rights and responsibilities under the NLRA.\n\nGoogle's settlement with the NLRB is the latest in a series of controversies surrounding the company's treatment of employees who speak out about working conditions or company policies. In 2019, a former Google engineer named James Damore filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that he was fired for expressing his opinions about diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Damore's lawsuit was settled out of court in 2020.\n\nThe settlement with the NLRB is seen as a significant development in the ongoing debate over the rights of employees to speak out about working conditions and company policies. Labor advocates have long argued that employees have the right to engage in protected concerted activity, including discussing workplace conditions and organizing protests, without fear of retaliation from their employer.\n\nGoogle's settlement with the NLRB is seen as a victory for employees who have been silenced or disciplined for speaking out about working conditions or company policies. The company's agreement to provide training to employees on their rights under federal labor law is also seen as a positive step towards creating a more open and transparent workplace culture.\n\nHowever, some critics have argued that Google's settlement with the NLRB does not go far enough to address the company's treatment of employees who speak out about working conditions or company policies. They argue that the company's agreement to provide training to employees on their rights under federal labor law is not sufficient to prevent future violations of the NLRA.\n\nOverall, the settlement between Google and the NLRB is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the rights of employees to speak out about working conditions and company policies. It is a reminder that employees have the right to engage in protected concerted activity, including discussing workplace conditions and organizing protests, without fear of retaliation from their employer.",

Edinburgh, ranked 16th, is the only other UK city to make it into the top 20, with an estimated one in 67 of its inhabitants a millionaire. Consultancy company WealthInsight, who carried out the research in partnership with Spear's Magazine, said Dublin was the surprise entry into the top 10, beating Paris, Berlin and Moscow. The study, which analyzed data from 50 European cities, found that the top 10 cities with the highest proportion of millionaires are all located in Western Europe. After Monaco and Zurich, the top three cities are Luxembourg, Geneva, and Brussels. These cities are known for their strong financial sectors, low taxes, and high standard of living, which contribute to their high concentration of wealthy individuals.\n\nLondon, despite being home to many wealthy individuals, ranks fourth on the list. The city's high cost of living and property prices may be a deterrent for some high net worth individuals, which could explain why the proportion of millionaires is lower compared to Monaco. However, the city's financial sector and business hubs continue to attract wealthy individuals from around the world.\n\nEdinburgh, the only other UK city to make it into the top 20, has a relatively high proportion of millionaires due to its strong financial sector and tourism industry. The city's historic architecture and cultural attractions also make it a popular destination for wealthy individuals looking to invest in property or start a business.\n\nThe surprise entry into the top 10 is Dublin, which beat out cities like Paris, Berlin, and Moscow.

Extinction Rebellion, a direct action group that has recently shut down key London roads, has demand the BBC makes the environment its \"top editorial issue\". Broadcasting House was locked down early on Friday afternoon, with BBC staff and guests unable to enter or leave the building while security kept the peaceful but noisy protesters away from the entrance. Extinction Rebellion activists, who are demanding a meeting with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation had a duty to broadcast about climate change with \"the level of urgency placed on informing the public about the second world war\". The protesters, who were dressed in bright orange vests and carried signs reading \"System Change Not Climate Change,\" began gathering outside Broadcasting House around 10am on Friday. They chanted slogans and played music to draw attention to their cause, causing a stir among passersby and commuters.\n\nAs the day wore on, the number of protesters swelled to over 100, with many more supporters gathering outside the building to show their solidarity. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, police were called to the scene to maintain order and ensure public safety.\n\nA spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion said that the group was demanding a meeting with Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, to discuss the corporation's role in raising awareness about climate change. \"The BBC has a unique platform and a responsibility to inform the public about the most pressing issue of our time,\" said the spokesperson. \"We're calling on them to make the climate and ecological emergency their top editorial issue, just as they did with the second world war.\"\n\nThe protest has caused disruptions to BBC operations, with staff and guests unable to enter or leave the building.

The school will study its own facilities to find ways to reduce its carbon footprint and save energy costs, and reduce paper use and waste. The University of Sustainability: A Beacon of Environmental Awareness\n\nThe University of Sustainability, a newly established institution, is making waves in the academic world by prioritizing environmental sustainability in all aspects of its operations. The school's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly practices is a bold step towards a more sustainable future.\n\nAccording to Dr. John Smith, the university's Dean of Sustainability, the institution's focus on sustainability is multifaceted. \"That can mean something as seemingly small as creating processes for making clothing that minimize waste and transportation of materials, or planning urban environments that are more resilient and attuned to extreme weather events,\" he said. \"The school will study its own facilities to find ways to reduce its carbon footprint and save energy costs, and reduce paper use and waste.\"\n\nTo achieve this goal, the university has implemented several initiatives. One of the most notable is its green building program, which aims to design and construct buildings that are not only energy-efficient but also sustainable. The program involves using recycled materials, minimizing waste, and incorporating renewable energy sources into the building's design.\n\nThe university has also launched a recycling program, which encourages students, faculty, and staff to recycle paper, plastic, glass, and metal. Additionally, the school has implemented a composting program, which converts food waste into nutrient-rich soil that can be used in the university's gardens and green spaces.\n\nThe university's commitment to sustainability extends beyond its physical facilities. The school has also established a sustainability-focused curriculum, which includes courses on environmental science, ecology, and sustainability. The curriculum aims to educate students on the importance of sustainability and equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to make a positive impact on the environment.\n\nThe university's sustainability efforts have not gone unnoticed. The school has received recognition from various organizations and government agencies for its commitment to reducing its environmental impact. The university's green building program, for example, has been recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council, which has awarded the school a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.\n\nThe University of Sustainability's commitment to environmental sustainability is a beacon of hope for a more eco-friendly future. By prioritizing sustainability in all aspects of its operations, the school is setting a high standard for other institutions to follow. As Dr. Smith noted, \"The school will study its own facilities to find ways to reduce its carbon footprint and save energy costs, and reduce paper use and waste.\" The university's efforts are a testament to the importance of sustainability and the role that institutions can play in promoting environmental awareness and action.",

        "Text": "Q. I am satisfied with Windows 7 and don't wish to upgrade to Windows 10. Would a problem arise if I continue to use Windows 7, even after Microsoft stops sending updates for Windows 7? A. Microsoft stopped all official sales of the last available version of Windows 7 on Oct. 30 and began counting down to the end of its support for the operating system, originally released in 2009. While Microsoft has ceased sending updates for Windows 7, it's still possible to use the operating system without experiencing any significant issues. However, users should be aware that they will no longer receive security patches, which can leave their systems vulnerable to potential threats.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the lack of security updates, which can expose users to malware, viruses, and other cyber threats. Without these updates, Windows 7 will not be able to detect and fix newly discovered vulnerabilities, making it more susceptible to attacks. This is particularly concerning for businesses and organizations that rely heavily on Windows 7, as it can compromise sensitive data and disrupt operations.\n\nAnother issue users may face is the lack of support for newer hardware and software. As technology advances, newer devices and applications are designed with compatibility in mind. Without updates, Windows 7 may not be able to recognize or function properly with these newer components, leading to compatibility issues and potential system crashes.\n\nDespite these risks, users can still use Windows 7 without experiencing major problems. However, it's essential to take additional steps to ensure the security and stability of their systems. This includes installing third-party antivirus software, keeping software up-to-date, and being cautious when downloading and installing new applications.\n\nFor businesses and organizations that are still using Windows 7, it's recommended to start planning an upgrade to a newer operating system, such as Windows 10 or 11. This will provide access to the latest security patches, features, and support, ensuring a more secure and reliable computing environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while Microsoft has stopped sending updates for Windows 7, users can still continue to use the operating system. However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to mitigate them. For those who are unable or unwilling to upgrade, it's essential to prioritize security and stability by installing third-party antivirus software and keeping software up-to-date.",

Laura Ingraham, the right-wing radio host and commentator who was an early supporter of President Trump, is negotiating a deal with the network to take over its 10 p.m. time slot, according to two people briefed on the matter who requested anonymity to describe private discussions. The move would mark a significant shift in Fox News's prime-time lineup, which has been a staple of the network's success since its inception. Ingraham's potential new show would replace \"The Greg Gutfeld Show,\" a program that has been airing in the 10 p.m. slot since 2015.\n\nIf the deal is finalized, Ingraham would join a lineup that already features Tucker Carlson at 8 p.m. and Sean Hannity at 9 p.m. Both Carlson and Hannity are known for their conservative commentary and have been vocal supporters of President Trump.\n\nIngraham, who has been a fixture on Fox News since 2008, has built a loyal following with her sharp wit and incisive commentary on politics and current events. She has also been a frequent guest on other Fox News programs, including \"Hannity\" and \"The Five.\"\n\nThe potential deal comes as Fox News is facing increased competition from other cable news networks, including MSNBC and CNN. The network has been working to revamp its lineup and attract new viewers, and Ingraham's addition could be a major coup.\n\nIngraham's move to the 10 p.m. slot would also give her a chance to expand her reach and build on her existing audience. Her current show, \"The Ingraham Angle,\" airs at 10 p.m. Eastern Time on weeknights, but it is not as widely watched as some of the other programs in Fox News's prime-time lineup.\n\nIt's worth noting that Ingraham has been a vocal supporter of President Trump, and her addition to the Fox News lineup could be seen as a move to further bolster the network's ties to the White House. Trump has been a frequent critic of the media, and his supporters have been known to tune in to Fox News for their news and commentary.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, Ingraham's move to the 10 p.m. slot is not without its risks.

This staggering number is a result of the sponge's porous structure, which provides a perfect environment for bacteria to thrive.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) discovered that the majority of these bacteria are harmless, but some species can cause serious health issues, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems. The study found that sponges used to clean countertops, sinks, and faucets were particularly contaminated, with some samples containing as many as 1.5 million bacteria per square inch.\n\nThe findings have sparked concerns about the potential risks associated with using sponges to clean kitchen surfaces. \"Sponges are often used to clean areas where food is prepared and consumed, which can lead to the transfer of bacteria to food and potentially cause illness,\" said Dr. Jennifer Roberts, lead author of the study.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of proper cleaning and maintenance of sponges. Researchers found that sponges that were regularly washed and sanitized had significantly lower bacterial counts than those that were not. \"It's essential to wash your sponge frequently and sanitize it regularly to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination,\" Dr. Roberts emphasized.\n\nIn light of the study's findings, many experts are recommending the use of alternative cleaning tools, such as dishcloths or microfiber cloths, which are less likely to harbor bacteria. Additionally, some companies are developing new, antibacterial sponges that are designed to reduce the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms.\n\nWhile the study's findings may be unsettling, they serve as a reminder of the importance of maintaining good hygiene practices in the kitchen.

Ten was forced into a trading halt and then voluntary administration last month when financial backers Lachlan Murdoch and Bruce Gordon failed to guarantee a new $250m loan. On Monday, after the first creditors' meeting was held in Sydney, Ten's administrators said leading shareholders Gordon and Murdoch, who now jointly own 22.5% of Ten, and James Packer, have agreed to provide the funds needed to keep the network on air. \"We have adequate cash resources at the present time but, by the end of this week, the shareholder guarantors will put a financing facility in place to ensure Ten has sufficient cash to continue to operate,\" partner Mark Korda said. The agreement between the administrators and the billionaire shareholders is expected to provide a temporary reprieve for Ten, which has been struggling to stay afloat amidst declining advertising revenue and increased competition from streaming services.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, the financing facility will be used to cover Ten's immediate cash flow requirements, including payment of employee salaries, vendor invoices, and other essential expenses. The facility is expected to be in place by the end of this week, providing a much-needed injection of capital to keep the network operational.\n\nThe move is seen as a crucial step in ensuring Ten's continued viability, as the network works to find a new owner or restructure its debt. The administrators have been holding talks with potential buyers and lenders, and the injection of cash from the shareholder guarantors is expected to make the network more attractive to potential suitors.\n\n\"We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the shareholder guarantors, which will enable Ten to continue operating while we work to find a long-term solution,\" said Mark Korda, partner at KordaMenthe. \"This is a critical step in ensuring the network's continued viability and we are grateful for the support of our major shareholders.\"\n\nThe news has been welcomed by Ten's employees, who have been anxiously awaiting news on the network's financial situation. \"We are relieved to hear that the network has secured the necessary funding to continue operating,\" said a spokesperson for the Ten Employees Association. \"We are committed to working with the administrators and the new owner to ensure the continued success of the network.\"\n\nThe future of Ten remains uncertain, but the agreement with the shareholder guarantors has provided a much-needed lifeline for the network. As the administrators continue to work towards finding a new owner or restructure the network's debt, Ten's employees and stakeholders will be keeping a close eye on developments.",

The premium cable channel announced on Friday that it would make a pilot for one of the five \"Game of Thrones\" prequels it has in development. According to sources, the pilot is based on George R.R. Martin's book \"Fire & Blood,\" which explores the history of House Targaryen and the events that led to the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty. The show is expected to delve into the mythology of the White Walkers, also known as the Others, and their role in the ancient wars that shaped Westeros.\n\nThe prequel is being developed by Ryan Condal, a writer and producer who has worked on shows such as \"Colony\" and \"Hercules,\" in collaboration with George R.R. Martin and Jane Goldman, who is known for her work on shows like \"Kingsman\" and \"St. Trinian's.\" The pilot is expected to be a significant departure from the original \"Game of Thrones\" series, which focused on the wars of the Seven Kingdoms and the struggle for the Iron Throne.\n\nThe announcement comes as a surprise to fans of the original series, who have been eagerly awaiting news on the prequels. The show's creators had hinted at the possibility of exploring the origins of the White Walkers in previous interviews, but the development of the pilot marks the first concrete step towards bringing this story to life.\n\nThe prequel is expected to explore the mythology of the White Walkers and the ancient wars that shaped Westeros. According to Martin, the show will delve into the history of the First Men and the Children of the Forest, who are believed to have created the White Walkers to fight against the First Men. The show will also explore the rise and fall of the Targaryen dynasty, which is believed to have played a significant role in the downfall of the White Walkers.\n\nThe pilot is expected to be a significant departure from the original \"Game of Thrones\" series, which focused on the wars of the Seven Kingdoms and the struggle for the Iron Throne.

Consumer body Which? wrote to nine airlines in December, warning they may be breaking consumer laws by keeping clauses that cancel the second leg of a return flight if a passenger misses the first leg of the same booking, forcing some customers to pay hundreds of pounds for replacement flights. In many cases airlines can sell on the same tickets, doubling their earnings for one seat. Of the nine airlines, only Flybe told Which? it would change the clauses, although it has not removed them completely. The airline industry has faced intense scrutiny in recent years, with passengers increasingly frustrated by the lack of transparency and flexibility in their travel arrangements. The \"no-show\" clauses, which allow airlines to cancel the second leg of a return trip if a passenger misses the first leg, have been a particular source of contention.\n\nDespite the criticism, airlines such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have maintained that the clauses are necessary to ensure that flights operate efficiently and on schedule. However, consumer advocates argue that the clauses are unfair and often result in passengers being left stranded and facing significant additional costs.\n\nWhich?, a leading consumer organization, has been vocal in its criticism of the airline industry's approach to \"no-show\" clauses.

For example, a passenger was recently forced to pay over £1,000 to replace a flight after missing the first leg of his return trip. The passenger had booked a round-trip ticket with a major airline, but was left stranded when the airline cancelled the second leg of the flight.\n\nThe airline industry has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including rising fuel costs, increased competition, and changing consumer behavior.

The editorial was an extraordinarily harsh rebuke of President Trump, calling him \"his own worst political enemy\" and asserting that he was damaging his presidency \"with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods.\" The editorial, titled \"The President's Toxic Behavior,\" went on to criticize Trump's behavior as \"a threat to the country's stability and a stain on the presidency.\" The authors argued that Trump's constant stream of misinformation and attacks on his political opponents has created a toxic atmosphere in Washington, making it difficult for lawmakers to work together to address the country's pressing issues.\n\nThe editorial also took aim at Trump's tendency to use social media to spread misinformation and attack his critics. \"The president's tweets are often a mix of fact-free claims, personal attacks, and conspiracy theories,\" the editorial stated. \"They are a reflection of his own insecurity and lack of confidence in his own abilities, and they are having a corrosive effect on the country.\"\n\nThe authors of the editorial, who are not identified, argue that Trump's behavior is not only damaging to his own presidency, but also to the country as a whole. \"The president's toxic behavior is a threat to the country's stability and a stain on the presidency,\" they write. \"It is a reminder that the presidency is not a platform for personal grievances, but rather a symbol of national unity and stability.\"\n\nThe editorial concludes by calling on Trump to change his behavior and to work towards a more constructive and respectful tone in his interactions with the public and his political opponents. \"The president has the power to change the tone of the country,\" the editorial states. \"He can choose to use his platform to bring people together, or he can continue to use it to divide and distract. The choice is his, but the consequences will be ours to bear.\"\n\nThe publication of this editorial is a significant departure from the Wall Street Journal's typical tone and approach. While the newspaper has occasionally criticized Trump's policies, it has rarely taken such a harsh and personal tone in its editorials. The publication of this editorial suggests that even some of Trump's most stalwart supporters are growing increasingly frustrated with his behavior and are calling on him to change his ways.",

A report on China's official Xinhua News Agency late Wednesday said that the authorities would summon Apple to urge it to \"tighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.\" The move is seen as the latest salvo in a growing dispute between Beijing and Apple over the content available on its popular app store in China. In recent months, Chinese authorities have been cracking down on online platforms, accusing them of spreading \"vulgar\" or \"obscene\" content, and Apple has come under increasing scrutiny.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, the authorities are particularly concerned about the availability of video streaming services on Apple's app store, which they claim are violating Chinese laws and regulations. The report on Xinhua News Agency did not specify which services are under scrutiny, but industry insiders suggest that popular platforms such as Netflix and YouTube may be among those targeted.\n\nApple has faced similar pressure from Chinese authorities in the past, and has been forced to remove several apps and games from its app store in order to comply with local regulations. However, the company has consistently maintained that it is committed to providing a platform for developers to share their content with Chinese users, while also ensuring that the content available on its store is in compliance with local laws and regulations.\n\nThe dispute between Apple and Chinese authorities is just the latest example of the growing tensions between Beijing and foreign technology companies operating in China. In recent months, Chinese authorities have been increasingly assertive in their demands for greater control over online content, and have used a range of tactics to pressure companies into complying with their demands.\n\nIndustry experts say that the dispute is likely to have significant implications for Apple's business in China, which is one of the company's most important markets. \"Apple has a huge following in China, and any disruption to its services could have significant consequences for the company,\" said one analyst. \"However, the company also has a strong track record of navigating complex regulatory environments, and it is likely that it will find a way to resolve the issue.\"\n\nIn a statement, Apple said that it was \"cooperating fully\" with Chinese authorities and was \"committed to providing a platform for developers to share their content with Chinese users.\" The company did not provide further details on the nature of the dispute or the steps it was taking to address the concerns of Chinese authorities.\n\nThe dispute is likely to be closely watched by other foreign technology companies operating in China, which are increasingly facing pressure from Beijing to comply with its demands for greater control over online content.

Some of us remember life before Ticketmaster when we could ring the box office of a theatre or concert hall and reserve a ticket for the price of the ticket and no more. The nostalgia is palpable, but the reality is that those days are long gone. The rise of online ticketing platforms has changed the way we buy and sell event tickets, often to the detriment of consumers. However, in a rare move, Ticketmaster has announced that it will be shutting down its resale sites, a decision that has been met with a mix of relief and skepticism.\n\nFor years, Ticketmaster's resale sites have been a thorn in the side of fans and artists alike. The platforms, which allowed users to buy and sell tickets at inflated prices, have been accused of perpetuating a culture of price-gouging and profiteering. Many fans have been left feeling frustrated and ripped off, unable to secure tickets to their favorite events at a fair price.\n\nBut why has Ticketmaster decided to close down its resale sites? According to the company, the move is part of a broader effort to focus on its core business of providing ticketing services to venues and promoters. In a statement, Ticketmaster said that it will instead be investing in new technologies and features that will help fans find and purchase tickets more easily and at a fairer price.\n\nWhile some fans may be breathing a sigh of relief at the news, others are skeptical about the motivations behind Ticketmaster's decision. Some have pointed out that the company has a history of using its dominance in the ticketing market to stifle competition and drive up prices. Others have expressed concerns that the closure of the resale sites may simply push the problem elsewhere, with fans and scalpers turning to other online platforms to buy and sell tickets.\n\nDespite these concerns, the news is likely to be welcomed by many fans who have been frustrated by the lack of transparency and fairness in the ticketing market. As the music and entertainment industries continue to evolve, it's clear that there is a need for greater accountability and regulation in the way that tickets are sold and resold.\n\nIn the meantime, fans will be keeping a close eye on Ticketmaster's new initiatives and features, hoping that they will bring about a more level playing field and a fairer deal for all. As one fan put it, \"It's about time someone took a stand against the scalpers and price-gougers. Let's hope this is the start of a new era in ticketing.\"",

The new model comes as Snapchat attempts to recover from the disappointing long-term fate of the first generation, which gathered attention – and long queues – when they were launched in extremely limited quantities in November 2016, but failed to sell in large numbers when they were eventually released on general sale. Over the lifetime of the product, Snap sold just 220,000 units, the company says, eventually writing off unsold inventory worth almost $40m. Snap's new Spectacles 2 model aims to rectify the mistakes of its predecessor by offering a more robust and feature-rich experience. The new camera has a higher resolution and improved low-light performance, allowing users to capture clearer and more vibrant images. The addition of still image capabilities also addresses one of the main criticisms of the original Spectacles, which were only able to record video.\n\nAnother significant improvement is the water resistance of the new model, which is rated IPX7, meaning it can withstand being submerged in water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. This feature is likely to be a major selling point for users who enjoy water sports or activities, such as surfing, skiing, or hiking.\n\nDespite the disappointing sales of the first generation, Snap is not giving up on its hardware business. The company is hoping that the new Spectacles 2 model will resonate with consumers and help to establish a loyal customer base. To achieve this, Snap is also introducing a range of new accessories and software features, including a new app that allows users to edit and share their Spectacles content more easily.\n\nThe new Spectacles 2 model is available for pre-order today, with a retail price of $199.99. Snap is also offering a special promotion for early adopters, who can get a free pair of Spectacles 2 lenses with their purchase. The new model is expected to start shipping in late March, just in time for the summer season.\n\nIn an effort to learn from its mistakes, Snap is taking a more cautious approach to the launch of the new Spectacles 2 model. The company is releasing the product in limited quantities initially, with a focus on quality over quantity. This approach is designed to ensure that the new model meets the high standards of Snap's customers, while also allowing the company to gauge demand and adjust production accordingly.\n\nOverall, the new Spectacles 2 model represents a significant improvement over its predecessor and a major step forward for Snap's hardware business. With its improved camera, water resistance, and new software features, the new model is poised to appeal to a wider range of consumers and help Snap to establish a foothold in the competitive wearable technology market.",

Nearly 39% of investors voted against the pharmaceutical group's 2016 remuneration report at its annual meeting in London, similar to the rebellion it faced three years ago. Support for the new pay policy was much stronger, with 96% of investors backing it. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, received a total pay package of £13.4m last year because a long-term incentive plan and other rewards paid out. The vote against the remuneration report is a significant setback for AstraZeneca's management, coming just a year after the company's shareholders had initially approved the pay package for Soriot. The rebellion is a reflection of growing concerns among investors about the rising cost of executive compensation, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry where profits have been boosted by patent expirations and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAstraZeneca's pay policy has been criticized for being overly generous, with some investors arguing that the company's executives are being rewarded for performance that is not directly tied to the company's financial performance. The company's long-term incentive plan, which is designed to reward executives for achieving specific targets, has been particularly criticized for being overly complex and difficult to understand.\n\nDespite the strong support for the new pay policy, some investors have expressed concerns about the company's governance practices. AstraZeneca's remuneration committee has been criticized for being dominated by insiders, with several members having close ties to the company's management. This has led some investors to question whether the committee is truly independent and able to make objective decisions about executive compensation.\n\nAstraZeneca's annual meeting was also marked by controversy over the company's handling of its failed cancer drug, Lynparza. The company had previously announced that it would be discontinuing the development of the drug due to disappointing clinical trial results, but some investors have questioned whether the company had adequately disclosed the true extent of the drug's failures.\n\nDespite these controversies, AstraZeneca's management remains confident in the company's prospects. Soriot has been credited with turning around the company's fortunes, and the company's pipeline of new drugs is expected to drive future growth. However, the company will need to work to regain the trust of its shareholders, particularly in the wake of the latest shareholder revolt.",

In a follow-up email it insisted there is nothing we can do to change the decision and that it will not give us a reason. Searchlight has campaigned against racism and fascism for 52 years, published a magazine since 1975, and is well respected. HSBC's Decision to Close Accounts Sparks Outrage from Searchlight Campaign Group\n\nThe recent announcement by HSBC to close the accounts of the long-standing campaign organisation Searchlight has sent shockwaves through the community. The decision, made without explanation, has left many questioning the bank's motives and commitment to upholding values of inclusivity and social responsibility.\n\nSearchlight, a well-respected organisation that has been fighting against racism and fascism for 52 years, has been a vocal advocate for human rights and social justice. Its magazine, published since 1975, has been a platform for voices of dissent and a beacon of hope for those fighting against discrimination.\n\nThe closure of the accounts, which have been held by Searchlight since 1964, has been met with widespread condemnation from supporters of the organisation. Many have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment, with some calling for a boycott of HSBC.\n\n\"This is a clear example of corporate greed and a lack of commitment to social responsibility,\" said John, a long-time supporter of Searchlight. \"HSBC's decision to close the accounts of an organisation that has dedicated its life to fighting against racism and fascism is a betrayal of the values that we hold dear.\"\n\nOthers have questioned the timing of the decision, with some suggesting that it may be linked to the organisation's recent campaigns against far-right groups. Searchlight has been vocal in its criticism of extremist ideologies and has called for greater action to be taken to combat hate crimes.\n\nHSBC's decision has also raised questions about the bank's own commitment to social responsibility. In recent years, the bank has faced criticism for its involvement in tax avoidance schemes and its role in perpetuating financial inequality.\n\nIn response to the backlash, HSBC has maintained that the decision to close the accounts was made after a \"review\" and that there is nothing that Searchlight can do to change the decision. However, many have called for the bank to reconsider its decision and to provide a clear explanation for the closure of the accounts.\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, Searchlight remains committed to its mission of fighting against racism and fascism. The organisation has vowed to continue its work, despite the setback, and has called on its supporters to stand with it in its fight for social justice.\n\nThe closure of HSBC's accounts is a stark reminder of the importance of standing up against discrimination and promoting inclusivity and social responsibility. As the debate rages on, it is clear that the values of Searchlight and its supporters will not be silenced by the actions of a corporation.",

The investment bank said most of the cost would come from Trump's \"repatriation tax\" designed to encourage multinationals to bring back the trillions of dollars they hold overseas to avoid tax. Goldman, which made profits of $7.4bn last year, said: \"The enactment of the tax legislation will result in a reduction of approximately $5bn in the firm's earnings for the fourth quarter and year ending 31 December 2017, approximately two-thirds of which is due to the repatriation tax. \"The remainder includes the effects of the implementation of the territorial tax system and the remeasurement of US deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates,\" the bank said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Last week Congress approved the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years, which includes big tax cuts for companies and wealthy people. The impact of the tax changes on Goldman Sachs' profits is not unique to the investment bank. Many multinational corporations, including technology giants like Apple and Google, have significant amounts of cash held overseas and are expected to repatriate some of those funds to avoid paying the new 21% tax rate on foreign earnings.\n\nThe repatriation tax is a key component of the tax overhaul, aimed at encouraging companies to bring back funds they have been holding in foreign accounts to invest in the US economy. However, the tax change has been criticized by some for being too generous to corporations and not doing enough to address the country's infrastructure and social spending needs.\n\nGoldman Sachs' announcement comes as the investment bank is preparing to report its fourth-quarter and full-year results. The bank's profits have been under pressure in recent years due to a decline in trading revenue and increased regulatory costs. The impact of the tax changes is likely to add to the bank's challenges in the coming year.\n\nThe tax overhaul is expected to have a significant impact on the US economy, with estimates suggesting it could add up to 0.5 percentage points to GDP growth in the coming year. However, the benefits of the tax changes are not expected to be evenly distributed, with the wealthy and corporations likely to benefit the most.\n\nThe impact of the tax changes on Goldman Sachs' profits is a reminder of the complex and often contentious nature of tax policy. The bank's announcement is likely to be closely watched by investors and analysts, who will be looking for any signs of how the tax changes are affecting the bank's operations and financial performance.",

In April, Mr. Zappa, a guitarist and one of the four children of the rock composer Frank Zappa, changed the name of his project Zappa Plays Zappa -- a tribute to his father's music -- to Dweezil Zappa Plays Frank Zappa. Clunky, perhaps, but he said it was necessary to avoid legal conflict with his brother, Ahmet, who controls the Zappa intellectual property through a family trust. The rebranding effort was a response to a long-standing dispute between Dweezil and his brother Ahmet over the rights to their father's music. Ahmet, who serves as the executor of Frank Zappa's estate, has been fiercely protective of the family's intellectual property, and has previously taken legal action against Dweezil for using the Zappa name in his performances and merchandise.\n\nDweezil, who has been touring and performing his father's music for over two decades, has long been at odds with Ahmet over the issue. He has accused his brother of trying to stifle his creativity and limit his ability to share his father's music with fans. Ahmet, on the other hand, has maintained that he is simply protecting the family's legacy and ensuring that the music is presented in a way that is respectful to their father's vision.\n\nDespite the controversy, Dweezil remains committed to keeping his father's music alive. His latest tour, which kicked off in April, features a mix of Frank Zappa's classic songs and some of his own original compositions. Dweezil has also been working on a new album, which is expected to be released later this year.\n\nIn an interview, Dweezil expressed his frustration with the ongoing dispute with his brother. \"It's been a real challenge to navigate the whole situation,\" he said. \"But at the end of the day, my goal is to share my father's music with the world, and to keep his legacy alive.

The petition will be delivered to Green's Arcadia business on Wednesday by John Hannett, the general secretary of the shopworkers' trade union Usdaw. The group, consisting of former BHS workers and trade union representatives, will converge on Arcadia's headquarters in London to demand that Sir Philip Green takes immediate action to address the significant shortfall in the pension scheme.

(When you have as many users as Facebook, finding new ones requires some ingenuity.) On Wednesday, the ambitious effort was halted. Facebook announced in a blog post that it would no longer build the drones. Facebook's ambitious effort to beam internet access to underserved communities through its solar-powered drones, known as Aquila, has come to an abrupt halt. The company announced on Wednesday that it would no longer be building the drones, marking the end of a project that was touted as a potential game-changer in the quest to connect the world's most remote areas to the internet.\n\nThe decision to halt the project was met with surprise and disappointment from many in the tech industry, who had been following the development of Aquila with great interest. Facebook's announcement came as a blow to the many people around the world who were eagerly awaiting the launch of the drones, which were designed to fly at high altitudes and beam internet access to people who could not otherwise get online.\n\nAccording to Facebook, the decision to end the project was made after a thorough review of the company's priorities and resources. In a blog post, the company stated that while Aquila had shown promise, it had become clear that the project was not the most effective way to achieve its goals of increasing internet access around the world.\n\nInstead, Facebook plans to focus on other initiatives aimed at connecting the world's most underserved communities to the internet. The company has already made significant progress in this area through its efforts to deploy fiber-optic cables and other infrastructure in remote areas.

Daub Alderney was hit with a fine of £7.1m, previously announced. The enforcement action, which was launched in 2019, was the largest of its kind undertaken by the Gambling Commission to date. It followed a series of concerns raised by the regulator about the companies' anti-money laundering and social responsibility measures.\n\nAccording to the Commission, Casumo, Videoslots, and Daub Alderney had all failed to implement adequate systems to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. The companies were also found to have inadequate processes in place to identify and support problem gamblers.\n\nThe Commission's investigation found that Casumo had failed to conduct adequate customer due diligence, allowing some customers to gamble without being properly verified.

        "Text": "The American trade deficit shrank unexpectedly in April after the United States sold $175.6 billion in goods and services overseas, the most exports on record, the government reported on Thursday. The Commerce Department report said that exports of goods were $126.4 billion and services $49.1 billion, while total imports were $219.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $43.7 billion, the lowest since December. The surprise decline in the trade deficit comes as a welcome respite for the Trump administration, which has been under pressure to address the growing trade imbalance. The administration has implemented several trade policies, including tariffs on imports from China and other countries, in an effort to reduce the trade deficit and promote American exports.\n\nEconomists were caught off guard by the sharp decline in the trade deficit, with many expecting a larger deficit due to the ongoing global trade tensions. \"This is a very positive surprise,\" said Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist at Barclays. \"The strong export numbers suggest that the U.S. economy is still growing, and the trade tensions are not having as big of an impact as we thought.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department report also showed that the U.S. trade deficit with China, the country's largest trading partner, decreased to $23.2 billion in April, down from $25.9 billion in March. The deficit with the European Union also narrowed to $14.8 billion, from $15.5 billion in March.\n\nThe strong export numbers were driven by a surge in sales of American-made goods, including aircraft, autos, and machinery. The value of U.S. exports to the European Union rose 14.4% in April, while exports to China increased 10.1%. The strong demand for American goods was also driven by the weakness of the U.S. dollar, which made U.S. exports more competitive in the global market.\n\nThe decline in the trade deficit is likely to be welcomed by President Trump, who has made reducing the trade deficit a key goal of his trade policies. The administration has been pushing for a reduction in the trade deficit through a combination of tariffs, trade agreements, and other measures.\n\nHowever, some economists caution that the decline in the trade deficit may not be sustainable in the long term. \"While the decline in the trade deficit is welcome, it's important to note that it's largely due to a decline in imports, rather than an increase in exports,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"If global trade tensions continue to escalate, we could see the trade deficit widen again.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department report also showed that the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, a key trading partner, increased to $6.4 billion in April, up from $5.5 billion in March. The deficit with Japan also widened to $5.6 billion, from $4.8 billion in March.\n\nOverall, the decline in the trade deficit is a positive sign for the U.S. economy, but it's important to monitor the situation closely to ensure that the trend continues.",

That was the main message of the economic data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which included the first piece of hard evidence of how the UK performed after the 23 June vote to leave the EU. The ONS said the service sector, which makes up around 80% of the UK economy, expanded by 0.4% in July, a month in which surveys showed business and consumer confidence crashing and the financial markets in turmoil. Despite the uncertainty and volatility that followed the Brexit vote, the UK's service sector, which accounts for a significant chunk of the country's economic output, showed surprising resilience in July. The 0.4% growth rate reported by the ONS was a welcome surprise, as many economists had predicted a sharp contraction in the sector.\n\nThe service sector's performance was driven by a strong expansion in the business and professional services sub-sector, which grew by 0.6% in July. This was largely due to an increase in demand for services such as accountancy, law, and consulting, as companies sought to navigate the complex and rapidly changing post-Brexit landscape.\n\nThe retail sector, which had been expected to suffer in the wake of the Brexit vote, also showed signs of life, with a 0.2% increase in July. While this growth was modest, it was still a welcome development, given the widespread concerns about the impact of the vote on consumer spending.\n\nHowever, not all sectors of the service industry were immune to the post-Brexit uncertainty. The tourism and travel sector, which had been a major beneficiary of the pound's depreciation in the run-up to the vote, suffered a 0.3% contraction in July, as the uncertainty surrounding the UK's future relationship with the EU took its toll on bookings and travel plans.\n\nThe ONS data also showed that the construction sector, which had been a major driver of growth in the UK economy in recent years, contracted by 0.5% in July. This was largely due to a decline in new housing starts and a slowdown in infrastructure projects, as companies delayed major investments in the face of the Brexit uncertainty.\n\nDespite these mixed signals, the overall picture painted by the ONS data is one of relative stability and resilience in the UK economy. While the Brexit vote has undoubtedly created uncertainty and disruption, it appears that the UK's economy has so far been able to absorb the shock and continue growing.\n\nHowever, the ONS data also serves as a reminder that the UK economy is still facing significant challenges, and that the road ahead will be fraught with uncertainty. The government and businesses will need to continue to work together to navigate the complexities of the Brexit process and ensure that the UK economy remains competitive and dynamic.\n\nIn the meantime, the ONS data provides a glimmer of hope that the UK economy may be able to avoid the worst-case scenarios that had been predicted in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. But as the UK economy continues to evolve and adapt to the changing global landscape, it will be essential to remain vigilant and proactive in order to ensure that the country's economic prospects remain bright.",

His son, Peter, confirmed the news, stating that Shapley had broken his hip several weeks prior to his passing.\n\nBorn on February 13, 1923, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Shapley grew up with a passion for mathematics and economics. He earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in 1944 and later received his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1953.\n\nShapley's groundbreaking work in game theory, a field that studies strategic decision-making, has had a profound impact on various disciplines, including economics, sociology, and computer science. His most notable contribution was the development of the Shapley value, a mathematical concept that helps to allocate costs and benefits fairly among individuals or groups in situations where multiple parties are involved.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, Shapley collaborated with some of the most prominent economists and mathematicians of his time. One of his most notable collaborations was with economist David Gale, with whom he developed the Gale-Shapley algorithm, a method used to match individuals or items based on their preferences.\n\nShapley's work has been applied in a wide range of fields, including labor economics, public policy, and even online dating. His theories have helped policymakers and businesses make informed decisions about resource allocation, and his research has shed light on the complex dynamics of human interaction.\n\nShapley was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 2012, along with economist Alvin Roth, for their work on game theory and its applications. The Nobel Committee praised Shapley's contributions, stating that his work had \"provided a unified framework for the analysis of a wide range of economic situations.\"\n\nShapley's legacy extends beyond his academic achievements.

Money news Hospice charity 'locked into fundraising deal that misleads public' Housebuilders must halt leasehold sale of new houses, says minister Home ownership among 25-year-olds in England and Wales has halved in 20 years Government pledges £400m broadband fund to help 600,000 homes UK house price growth will slow to 3% in 2017, say surveyors Money blog 2016: the year Britain got (a little bit) richer\nIn pictures Homes for Christmas walks\nIn the spotlight Many firms have had the steam coming out of your ears this year. It's been a tumultuous year for many businesses, with several high-profile companies facing scrutiny over their practices. One charity, in particular, has come under fire for its fundraising tactics. According to an investigation by the charity watchdog, a hospice charity has been locked into a fundraising deal that misleads the public.\n\nThe charity, which has been left unnamed, has been accused of using misleading language in its appeals, leading many donors to believe that their money is going directly towards patient care. However, it's alleged that a significant portion of the funds are actually being used to cover administrative costs.\n\nThe charity watchdog has launched an investigation into the matter and has called for the charity to come clean about its fundraising practices. This development has left many questioning the transparency of charitable organizations and the importance of proper governance.\n\nIn other news, the government has announced a £400m broadband fund to help 600,000 homes across the UK gain access to faster internet speeds. The fund is part of a broader effort to improve digital connectivity across the country, particularly in rural areas where access to high-speed internet is limited.\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by many, including small business owners who rely heavily on online connectivity to operate. However, some have expressed concerns about the lack of detail surrounding the plan, including how the funds will be allocated and who will be responsible for implementing the project.\n\nIn the world of housebuilding, the government has announced that housebuilders must halt the sale of new houses with leasehold agreements. The move comes after a growing number of homeowners have been left with significant costs and restrictions on their properties due to the complex and often unfair nature of leasehold agreements.\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by many, including consumer groups who have long campaigned for greater protections for homeowners. However, some have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the housing market, including the potential for a shortage of new homes.\n\nFinally, a survey of surveyors has predicted that UK house price growth will slow to just 3% in 2017. The prediction comes as the UK property market continues to face uncertainty following the Brexit vote.\n\nThe slowdown in house price growth is expected to be driven by a combination of factors, including reduced demand and increased supply. However, some have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the wider economy, including the potential for a slowdown in consumer spending.\n\nThat's all for this week's Money Talks. We'll be back next week with more news and analysis on the world of business and finance.",

        "Text": "Q. I installed ad-blocking software on my computer, but I still see advertisements on some pages, even though the site did not ask me to turn off the blocker. Why is this? A. Even when you have the software enabled, browser utilities like AdBlock or AdBlock Plus may still display less-intrusive advertisements from companies that have been approved by the independent Acceptable Ads Committee. The Acceptable Ads initiative was started by AdBlock Plus, which makes money by allowing the ads through its filters. The Acceptable Ads Committee, a non-profit organization, reviews and approves ads that meet certain criteria, such as being non-intrusive and not disrupting the user experience. These approved ads are then whitelisted, allowing them to bypass the ad-blocking software. The committee's goal is to strike a balance between user privacy and the need for websites to generate revenue through advertising.\n\nAccording to the committee's guidelines, ads must meet certain standards to be considered acceptable. These include being non-animated, not taking up more than 12.5% of the screen, and not making noise or playing audio. Additionally, ads must not collect user data without explicit consent, and must not be misleading or deceptive.\n\nWebsites that want to display approved ads must apply to the Acceptable Ads Committee and meet the guidelines. The committee then reviews the ad and decides whether it meets the criteria. If approved, the ad is whitelisted, and the ad-blocking software will allow it to be displayed.\n\nWhile the Acceptable Ads initiative aims to provide a compromise between ad-blocking and advertising, some users may still choose to disable the feature altogether. This is because even approved ads can be annoying or distracting, and some users may prefer a completely ad-free browsing experience.\n\nIn response to concerns about the initiative, AdBlock Plus has implemented a feature that allows users to customize their ad-blocking settings. This includes the option to disable approved ads or to only allow ads from specific websites or categories. This added control gives users more flexibility in managing their online experience.\n\nThe Acceptable Ads initiative has sparked debate among users, with some praising the compromise and others criticizing the inclusion of any ads at all. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how ad-blocking software and advertising companies adapt to changing user preferences and regulations.",

        "Text": "The Observer and Guardian journalist, Carole Cadwalladr, has won the Foreign Press Association media award for print and web story of the year for her reporting on the links between Cambridge Analytica, the UK's pro-Brexit campaigners and Donald Trump presidential election team. Also among the nominees was Cadwalladr's Guardian colleague, Amelia Gentleman, for an article on the Windrush scandal, as well as Stephen Bleach of the Sunday Times, who revealed the abuse he suffered at the hands of the Catholic church, and Reuters' Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were jailed for their reporting on the massacre of Rohingyas in Myanmar. Cadwalladr's award-winning article showed the world the face of the whistleblower who created a tool used by the former Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, to harness data to target political advertising at voters. Christopher Wylie, after choosing to waive his anonymity, said he helped to put together \"Steve Bannon's psychological warfare mindfuck tool\" while working for the political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica. Cadwalladr's investigative reporting exposed the extent to which Cambridge Analytica, a company founded by Alexander Nix, had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent. The company then used this data to create sophisticated psychological profiles of voters, which were used to target them with political advertising during the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThe award-winning article shed light on the close ties between Cambridge Analytica and Steve Bannon, who was a key strategist in Trump's presidential campaign. Wylie's revelations sparked widespread outrage and raised serious concerns about the impact of social media on democracy.\n\nThe Foreign Press Association's media award is one of the most prestigious honors in the journalism industry, and Cadwalladr's win is a testament to her tireless efforts to uncover the truth behind the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Her reporting has had a significant impact on the public's understanding of the issue, and has led to calls for greater transparency and accountability in the use of personal data.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Cadwalladr praised the bravery of Christopher Wylie, who came forward to reveal the details of Cambridge Analytica's activities. She also acknowledged the importance of a free and independent press in holding those in power accountable.\n\nThe win is a fitting recognition of Cadwalladr's outstanding journalism, and serves as a reminder of the crucial role that investigative reporting plays in exposing wrongdoing and promoting transparency. As the media landscape continues to evolve, Cadwalladr's work serves as a beacon of excellence, inspiring a new generation of journalists to pursue the truth and hold those in power accountable.",

A team of paleontologists in China announced on Wednesday the discovery of a dinosaur that sported the same kinds of fleshy wings bats use to flit through the air. Imagine an animal that looks like a dinosaur, and you probably will not imagine a bat. But that may change. A team of paleontologists in China announced on Wednesday the discovery of a dinosaur that sported the same kinds of fleshy wings bats use to flit through the air.\n\nThe remarkable find, announced in the journal Nature, is a species of dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period, around 125 million years ago. Dubbed Ambopteryx longibrachium, the dinosaur's wings were made up of a thin membrane of skin and other tissues, similar to those found in modern bats.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the discovery challenges the traditional view that dinosaurs were exclusively terrestrial animals, and instead suggests that some species may have evolved to become semi-aquatic or even aerial. The finding also raises questions about the evolution of flight in animals, and whether dinosaurs may have played a role in the development of this complex trait.\n\nThe fossilized remains of Ambopteryx longibrachium were discovered in the Liaoning province of northeastern China, a region known for its rich deposits of Jurassic and Cretaceous-era fossils. The team, led by Dr. Xing Lida of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, analyzed the remains using advanced imaging techniques and found evidence of wing bones, as well as other features that suggest the dinosaur was capable of flight.\n\nWhile the discovery is certainly exciting, it is not without its limitations. The fossilized remains of Ambopteryx longibrachium are fragmentary, and it is unclear whether the dinosaur was capable of sustained flight or simply used its wings for gliding. Additionally, the team's findings are based on a single fossil, and further research is needed to confirm the discovery and better understand the biology and behavior of this remarkable creature.\n\nDespite these limitations, the discovery of Ambopteryx longibrachium is a significant one, and has the potential to rewrite our understanding of the evolution of flight in animals. As Dr. Xing noted in a statement, \"This discovery shows that the evolution of flight is more complex and diverse than we previously thought, and that dinosaurs may have played a more important role in the development of flight than we previously believed.\"",

        "Text": "All year long as Earth revolves around the sun, it passes through streams of cosmic debris. The resulting meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse. The next shower you might be able to see is known as the Lyrids. Active between April 16 and 28, the show peaks around Sunday night into Monday morning, or April 21-22. The Lyrids meteor shower is one of the oldest and most reliable annual events in the sky, with records of the shower dating back to 687 BC. It's caused by the Earth passing through the trail of debris left behind by the Comet Thatcher, which was discovered in 1861. The comet's orbit brings it close to Earth every 415 years, and its path crosses the planet's orbit, creating a trail of tiny particles that burn up in the atmosphere, producing the bright streaks of light we see as meteors.\n\nThe Lyrids are known for their bright and fast-moving meteors, with some reaching speeds of up to 45 miles per second. This means that the meteors can appear to be quite large and bright, making them a treat for astronomers and stargazers alike. The shower is also notable for its high rate of producing bright fireballs, which can be seen from great distances and are often accompanied by a loud sonic boom.\n\nTo catch a glimpse of the Lyrids, find a dark location with minimal light pollution and dress warmly, as it can get chilly while waiting for the shower to peak. Bring binoculars or a star chart to help you locate the constellations and spot the meteors. The best viewing time is usually around midnight to 4am, when the Earth is facing the direction of the comet's debris trail.\n\nThe Lyrids meteor shower is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get outside and enjoy the night sky. It's a chance to connect with nature and experience the awe-inspiring beauty of the universe. So mark your calendars for April 21-22 and get ready to witness one of the most spectacular celestial events of the year.",

The struggling Nightly Show, hosted by Trevor Noah, has been facing a downward spiral in viewership since its debut in 2015. Despite its initial promise to bring a fresh perspective to the late-night talk show landscape, the program has failed to resonate with audiences, resulting in a significant decline in ratings.\n\nAccording to recent Nielsen ratings, the Nightly Show has slipped below the 1 million viewer mark, a benchmark previously set by the long-running News at Ten program. This marks a stark contrast to the show's peak in 2016, when it attracted an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode.\n\nIndustry insiders attribute the decline to a combination of factors, including a shift in viewer preferences towards more online content and a lack of distinctive programming on the show. Critics have also pointed to Noah's perceived lack of charisma and the show's inability to generate buzzworthy topics or memorable moments.\n\nThe struggling ratings have led to speculation about the show's future, with some predicting that it will be cancelled altogether. While Comedy Central has yet to officially confirm the show's demise, insiders suggest that the network is re-evaluating its programming strategy and may be looking to revamp the show or replace it with something new.\n\nIf the Nightly Show does come to an end, it will mark a significant change in the late-night television landscape. Noah, who was handpicked by Comedy Central to succeed Jon Stewart, has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and has used his platform to address social and political issues. His departure would leave a void in the late-night landscape, and it remains to be seen who would be next to fill the gap.\n\nIn the meantime, fans of the show are holding onto hope that Noah and his team can turn things around. With the 2020 presidential election cycle already underway, the show could potentially capitalize on the increased interest in politics and current events. However, with ratings continuing to decline, it remains to be seen if the Nightly Show will be able to find its footing and regain its footing in the competitive late-night television landscape.",

Ms. Egan, who is also Facebook's chief privacy officer, was responsible for lobbying and government relations as head of policy for the last two years. The move comes as Facebook faces increasing pressure from lawmakers and regulatory bodies over its handling of user data, election interference, and other issues. The company has been under intense scrutiny since the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, which exposed the unauthorized harvesting of millions of users' personal data.\n\nFacebook's new head of policy in the United States is a seasoned executive with deep experience in government relations and public policy. The company has not yet publicly announced the identity of the new appointee, but sources close to the matter indicate that the individual is well-respected in Washington D.C. and has a strong track record of working with lawmakers and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe departure of Erin Egan, who has been a key figure in Facebook's policy efforts for several years, is seen as a significant shake-up for the company. Egan was a prominent voice on Capitol Hill, testifying before Congress on issues related to privacy, data protection, and online harassment. Her departure may signal a shift in Facebook's approach to policy and government relations, as the company seeks to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape.\n\nFacebook's struggles with regulators and lawmakers have been well-documented in recent years. The company has faced multiple investigations and hearings over issues such as its handling of user data, its role in spreading disinformation and propaganda, and its impact on the mental health and well-being of users.\n\nIn addition to the policy shake-up, Facebook is also facing increased scrutiny over its handling of misinformation and disinformation on its platform. The company has been accused of failing to adequately address the spread of false information, which has been linked to real-world consequences such as political polarization, social unrest, and even violence.\n\nAs Facebook seeks to rebuild trust with users and regulators alike, the appointment of a new head of policy will be closely watched. The individual will be tasked with navigating the complex web of federal and state regulations, while also working to address the company's numerous policy challenges.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook said that the company is committed to transparency and accountability, and that it is working to build trust with users and regulators through increased transparency and accountability. The company also emphasized its commitment to protecting user privacy and security, and to using its platform to promote positive social change.\n\nThe appointment of a new head of policy is seen as a critical step in Facebook's efforts to reboot its policy efforts and rebuild trust with users and regulators. As the company continues to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, it will be important to monitor the progress of this new appointee and the impact that they have on the company's policy efforts.",

        "Text": "HONG KONG -- The Chinese Communist Party's drive against corruption moved into the powerful and politically delicate oil sector this week, as the authorities announced that four executives of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation were under investigation. On Tuesday, the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of China said on its Web site that three oil executives -- Li Hualin, a deputy general manager of China National Petroleum; Ran Xinquan, a vice president of PetroChina, the company's listed unit; and Wang Daofu, the chief geologist of PetroChina -- were \"suspected of grave violations of discipline and are currently undergoing investigation,\" by an anti-corruption agency. The announcement sent shockwaves through the oil industry, with many analysts speculating about the potential implications for the sector's operations and the country's energy security. The investigation is seen as a significant escalation of the Communist Party's anti-corruption campaign, which has already ensnared high-ranking officials and business leaders across various industries.\n\nThe four executives under investigation are all senior officials at China National Petroleum Corporation, one of the country's largest and most influential state-owned enterprises. Li Hualin, the deputy general manager, has been with the company for over 20 years and has played a key role in its international expansion. Ran Xinquan, the vice president of PetroChina, has been instrumental in the company's efforts to increase its oil production and reserves. Wang Daofu, the chief geologist, has been a leading expert in the field of oil exploration and has worked on several high-profile projects.\n\nThe investigation is believed to be related to allegations of embezzlement, bribery, and other forms of corruption. According to sources, the anti-corruption agency has been gathering evidence for several months and has already uncovered significant irregularities in the company's financial dealings.\n\nThe investigation is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the oil industry in China. The sector has long been plagued by corruption and inefficiencies, which have hindered its ability to meet the country's growing energy demands. The Communist Party has been seeking to reform the sector and increase its transparency and accountability, and the investigation into China National Petroleum Corporation is seen as a key step in this process.\n\nThe impact of the investigation is also being felt globally, with oil prices fluctuating in response to the news. The investigation has raised concerns about the stability of China's oil supply and the potential for disruptions to global energy markets.\n\nAs the investigation continues, many are watching to see how it will unfold and what consequences the executives will face if found guilty of corruption. The case is seen as a test of the Communist Party's commitment to combating corruption and ensuring transparency and accountability in the oil sector.",

When the glaziers showed up they said two of our windows needed safety glass (something not mentioned on the phone) and that they would have to come back. I was taken aback by the unexpected twist. I had already agreed to the initial quote and was expecting the work to be completed in one visit. The glaziers, however, insisted that the additional safety glass requirement would add to the overall cost. They explained that the windows in question were located in areas where there was a risk of breakage, such as near stairs or in high-traffic zones, and that the safety glass was a necessary safety precaution.\n\nI was frustrated by the sudden change in plans and the additional expense. I had already committed to the original quote and was expecting a straightforward installation process. The glaziers, however, were adamant that the safety glass was essential and that it would not be possible to complete the job without it.\n\nAfter some negotiation, we agreed on a compromise. The glaziers would install the safety glass in the two windows that required it, and then return to complete the installation of the remaining four windows. The additional cost would be £150, which would be added to the original quote. I was left feeling a bit annoyed but also relieved that the work would still be completed in a timely manner.\n\nThe glaziers returned a few days later and completed the installation of the remaining four windows. The safety glass was installed in the two windows that required it, and the entire job was finally finished. The total cost ended up being £550, which was £150 more than the original quote.\n\nWhile I was initially frustrated by the unexpected twist, I was pleased with the final result. The windows look great, and the safety glass provides an added layer of security. I just wish that the glaziers had been more transparent about the additional cost and requirements from the beginning. In hindsight, I might have done some additional research or sought quotes from other companies to compare prices and services.\n\nThe experience has left me with a valuable lesson: always be prepared for unexpected twists and turns when dealing with contractors and service providers. It's essential to stay calm, communicate clearly, and be willing to negotiate to get the best possible outcome.",

Williamson, the conservative writer whose hiring last month angered liberals and sparked an online debate about what views are considered acceptable in mainstream publications. It was Mr. Williamson's hard-line stance on abortion -- namely, that it should be treated as premeditated homicide and punished accordingly, perhaps by hanging -- that generated the initial controversy over his hiring. The decision to terminate Williamson's contract comes after a series of public statements and writings that many deemed offensive and divisive. The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, released a statement explaining the decision, citing Williamson's views on abortion as \"incompatible with the values of The Atlantic.\"\n\nGoldberg stated that while Williamson's hiring was intended to spark debate and discussion, his extreme views on the topic had crossed a line. \"We believe that the issue of abortion is a deeply personal and complex one, and that it is not appropriate for us to take a stance on it,\" Goldberg said. \"However, we also believe that our writers should be able to express their opinions without fear of reprisal or censorship.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Williamson's hiring began shortly after his appointment was announced.

Many have argued that the publication's decision to hire Williamson was a mistake, and that his views were always going to be a liability. Others have defended Williamson's right to express his opinions, even if they are unpopular or offensive.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Williamson's hiring and departure has also raised questions about the role of social media in shaping public opinion. Many have argued that the online debate surrounding Williamson's views was unfair and disproportionate, and that it was fueled by a desire to silence conservative voices.

Barricades went up several days ago outside a retail space in the high-end mall at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, with a sign saying an Amazon bookstore would open there soon. Amazon's First Bookstore in Manhattan: A New Chapter in Brick-and-Mortar Retail\n\nThe news sent shockwaves through the retail industry: Amazon, the e-commerce giant, is expanding its brick-and-mortar presence in New York City. The company has been testing its retail concepts in various locations, including its 4-star store in SoHo and a cashierless convenience store in Seattle. Now, it's bringing one of its most unique experiments, an Amazon bookstore, to the Time Warner Center in Manhattan.\n\nThe barricades went up several days ago outside the retail space, with a sign announcing the upcoming arrival of the Amazon bookstore. The store is expected to open soon, although an exact date has not been disclosed. The location is a prime spot, nestled in the heart of Manhattan's upscale shopping district.\n\nAmazon's bookstore concept is designed to be a more curated and personalized shopping experience compared to its online platform. The store will feature a wide selection of books, as well as a section dedicated to Amazon's own publishing imprint, Amazon Original Stories. The store will also offer events and workshops, including author readings, book clubs, and children's storytime sessions.\n\nThe move is seen as a strategic play by Amazon to expand its physical presence in a key market. New York City is one of the largest and most competitive retail markets in the world, and Amazon's decision to establish a foothold there sends a clear message about its commitment to the city.\n\nIndustry experts believe that Amazon's bookstore concept has the potential to disrupt the traditional bookstore model. \"Amazon is using its physical stores to create a unique experience that complements its online platform,\" said retail analyst, Neil Saunders. \"By offering a curated selection of products and hosting events, Amazon is able to create a sense of community and engagement that is difficult to replicate online.\"\n\nThe Amazon bookstore at the Time Warner Center is expected to be a flagship location, with plans to expand to other cities in the future.

The inquiry concerns a practice unearthed in April in which Facebook harvested the email contact lists of a portion of new users who signed up for the network after 2016, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiry had not been officially announced. The investigation, which is expected to be led by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, is likely to focus on whether Facebook's practice of collecting email address books without users' consent violates state and federal privacy laws. The two people briefed on the matter said that the inquiry is still in its early stages and that no formal charges have been filed yet.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Facebook's email collection practice came to light in April, when a security researcher discovered that the social media giant was scraping the email contact lists of new users who signed up for the network after 2016. The practice, which was reportedly used to help users find friends and connect with others on the platform, was criticized by privacy advocates and lawmakers, who argued that it was a violation of users' privacy and a potential security risk.\n\nFacebook has faced numerous privacy scandals in recent years, including the Cambridge Analytica data breach, which affected millions of users. The company has faced scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators around the world, and has been fined millions of dollars for its privacy violations.\n\nThe New York State attorney general's office has been a vocal critic of Facebook's privacy practices in the past. In 2019, James launched an investigation into Facebook's data collection practices, which led to a $5 billion settlement with the company. The settlement was the largest ever paid by a tech company to settle a privacy-related claim.\n\nThe latest investigation is likely to be closely watched by regulators and lawmakers around the world, who are increasingly scrutinizing the privacy practices of tech companies. The incident highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability from companies like Facebook, which have access to vast amounts of personal data.\n\nFacebook has not commented on the investigation, but the company has faced criticism from lawmakers and privacy advocates for its handling of user data. The incident has also raised questions about the company's commitment to protecting user privacy and its willingness to prioritize profits over user trust.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Facebook will face any consequences for its unauthorized collection of email address books. However, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting user privacy and the need for greater transparency and accountability from tech companies.",

Scientists took the extraordinary footage after stalking the shy and elusive Cape York palm cockatoos for seven years through the unspoilt wilderness of the peninsula in far north Queensland. The recordings show 18 males knocking out more than 130 drum solos which sometimes start with a flourish and nearly always contain a signature pattern distinct to each bird. The footage, captured by a team of researchers from the University of Queensland, provides a rare glimpse into the secretive world of the Cape York palm cockatoo, a species known for its striking plumage and distinctive crest.\n\nAccording to Dr. Emma Greig, lead researcher on the project, the drumming displays are a crucial part of the cockatoos' mating ritual. \"We've been studying these birds for years, and it's clear that the drumming is a way for the males to showcase their skills and attract a mate,\" she explained. \"Each bird has its own unique drumming pattern, which is like a fingerprint – no two are alike.\"\n\nThe researchers used camera traps and observation hides to capture the footage, which shows the cockatoos perched on branches, sticks, or even rocks, using their beaks to tap out complex rhythms on a variety of surfaces. Some birds used seedpods, while others employed sticks or even pieces of bark.\n\nThe drumming displays can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, and the researchers observed that the males would often repeat their patterns several times, as if to emphasize their skills. In some cases, the birds would even interrupt each other's drumming, as if engaging in a musical competition.\n\nDr. Greig believes that the drumming displays serve multiple purposes, including attracting a mate and defending territory. \"The cockatoos are very particular about their territory, and the drumming is a way for them to mark their boundaries and warn off potential rivals,\" she said.\n\nThe research team plans to continue studying the Cape York palm cockatoo, with a focus on understanding the intricacies of their drumming displays and how they relate to the birds' social behavior. The findings could have important implications for conservation efforts, as the species is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation.\n\nThe extraordinary footage has generated widespread excitement among bird enthusiasts and scientists alike, offering a rare glimpse into the fascinating world of avian behavior. As Dr. Greig noted, \"The drumming displays of the Cape York palm cockatoo are a truly unique and captivating aspect of their behavior, and we're thrilled to be able to share this discovery with the world.\"",

But when the work began we applied for an optional certificate of lawfulness from Lambeth council. It didn't review our application until September when it was rejected. It turned out that the planning department had unilaterally reinterpreted the rules in August 2018 without notifying residents, builders or architects. The Repercussions of Unilateral Rule Change: A Loft Conversion Nightmare\n\nThe rejection of the certificate of lawfulness by Lambeth council has left homeowners and builders in a state of confusion and frustration. The standard L-shaped dormer, which was initially deemed to be under permitted development rights, has now been deemed non-compliant with the new interpretation of the rules.\n\nThe unilateral change to the rules, made by the planning department in August 2018 without any prior notification, has raised questions about the transparency and accountability of the council. Homeowners who had already begun their loft conversion projects, like our readers, were left in the dark about the new interpretation, and were forced to stop work and reapply for planning permission.\n\nThe consequences of this change have been far-reaching. Many homeowners have been left with significant financial losses, as they had already invested a substantial amount of money in their projects. Others have been forced to abandon their plans altogether, leaving their properties in a state of disarray.\n\nThe architects and builders involved in the project are also feeling the impact. They have had to redirect their resources and time to reapply for planning permission, which has resulted in delays and additional costs. The reputation of the council has also taken a hit, as the lack of transparency and communication has led to mistrust among residents and businesses.\n\nThe situation has also raised questions about the effectiveness of the permitted development rights system. The system is designed to streamline the planning process and reduce bureaucracy, but the unilateral change to the rules has highlighted the need for greater clarity and communication.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Lambeth council has promised to review the rules and provide greater clarity on the interpretation of the permitted development rights. However, many residents and builders are calling for more concrete action, including compensation for those affected by the change.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that the unilateral change to the rules has caused significant disruption and uncertainty. The need for greater transparency and accountability is clear, and it is up to the council to ensure that the interests of residents and businesses are protected.",

The FTSE 250-listed firm said it was in active discussions to offload more than £900m of assets, far exceeding its £500m target for 2019. Last year it sold off £570m of property, with the average price 7% below the book value in December 2017. Hammerson's decision to sell off a significant portion of its property portfolio comes as no surprise, given the challenging conditions faced by the retail sector in the UK. The company's portfolio includes some of the country's most iconic shopping centers, but even these prime locations have not been immune to the decline of traditional bricks-and-mortar retail.\n\nAccording to Hammerson's own estimates, the UK retail sector has seen a decline of around 10% in footfall over the past year, with many retailers struggling to stay afloat in the face of increasing competition from online retailers. This has led to a surge in store closures, with many high-street brands such as Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, and House of Fraser all announcing significant reductions in their physical presence.\n\nAs a result, Hammerson has been forced to re-evaluate its own strategy, and the decision to sell off a significant portion of its portfolio is seen as a pragmatic move to shore up its finances. The company has already made significant progress in this regard, having sold off £570m of property in 2019, with the average price achieved being 7% below the book value in December 2017.\n\nThe £900m target set by Hammerson for 2019 is significantly higher than the £500m target it had initially set, and the company's willingness to offload assets at a discount to book value suggests that it is willing to be flexible in order to achieve its goals. This could be seen as a sign of the company's commitment to maintaining its financial stability, even if it means taking a hit on the value of its assets.\n\nThe sale of Hammerson's assets is likely to be closely watched by the wider retail industry, as it provides a glimpse into the challenges faced by even the most well-established players. As the retail landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Hammerson's strategy plays out, and whether the company is able to adapt to the changing market conditions.",

I have to travel from London to Durham on Good Friday and am so broke I'm considering ditching the train in favour of a coach. As the Easter weekend approaches, many Brits are facing the daunting task of planning their travels, and for one Guardian Money reader, the cost of getting to Durham is proving to be a major hurdle. With limited funds, they are weighing up the pros and cons of taking the train versus a coach, and we've got some expert advice to help them make an informed decision.\n\nFirstly, let's take a look at the train options. National Rail operates frequent services from London King's Cross to Durham, with journey times ranging from approximately 2.5 to 3.5 hours, depending on the type of train and the time of day. A standard class ticket on a peak hour train can cost anywhere from £50 to £70, while off-peak tickets can be found for around £30 to £50.\n\nOn the other hand, coach companies such as National Express and Megabus offer services from London Victoria Coach Station to Durham Bus Station. Journey times can be longer, typically around 4-5 hours, but prices are significantly cheaper, with fares starting from as little as £10.\n\nSo, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each option? Taking the train offers a more comfortable and convenient journey, with more legroom and the option to book a seat with more legroom. However, it's also more expensive and may not be the most environmentally friendly option.\n\nCoach travel, on the other hand, is a more budget-friendly option, but it may not be as comfortable, with limited legroom and the potential for delays. However, coach companies are continually improving their services, with many offering free Wi-Fi, power sockets, and reclining seats.\n\nUltimately, the decision comes down to personal preference and priorities. If you're looking for a more comfortable journey and are willing to pay a premium, the train may be the better option. However, if you're on a tight budget and don't mind sacrificing a bit of comfort, the coach could be the way to go.\n\nAs our reader is considering ditching the train in favour of a coach, they may want to consider booking in advance to secure the cheapest fares. National Express and Megabus often offer discounts for advance bookings, so it's worth checking their websites for the best deals.\n\nBy weighing up the pros and cons and considering their priorities, our reader can make an informed decision about how to get to Durham on Good Friday. Whether they choose the train or the coach, with a bit of planning and research, they can have a stress-free and enjoyable journey.",

The feature has been known to suggest users who have no or few mutual friends on the network – and, reportedly, nothing in common beyond having shared the same physical space – prompting concerns about how it works. These were resurrected on Tuesday when Fusion reported that Facebook was drawing from the location of users' smartphones to inform its suggestions – a \"privacy disaster\", it said. It quoted a spokesperson as saying that location information was \"only one of the factors\" Facebook used to determine people who may know each other. Facebook's response has sparked a heated debate about the social media giant's handling of user privacy. Critics argue that the company's use of location data to suggest potential friends is a breach of trust and raises serious concerns about the potential for abuse.\n\nThe feature, which has been a staple of Facebook's algorithm for years, is designed to suggest users who may have common interests or connections. However, the company's admission that location data is used as one of the factors in determining these suggestions has led to concerns that the feature may be more invasive than previously thought.\n\nFacebook's use of location data has been a topic of controversy in the past. In 2011, the company was accused of collecting location data from users' smartphones without their knowledge or consent. The company later admitted to collecting this data, but claimed it was only used to provide location-based services such as weather updates and traffic information.\n\nHowever, the latest revelations have raised concerns that Facebook may be using location data for more sinister purposes. Critics argue that the company may be using the data to build a detailed profile of users' movements and activities, which could be used to target them with ads or even track their physical location.\n\nFacebook has denied any wrongdoing, stating that the location data is only used to provide more accurate suggestions for users. However, many are skeptical of the company's claims, given its history of privacy breaches and its lack of transparency in how it handles user data.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a renewed call for greater transparency and accountability from Facebook. Many are demanding that the company provide more information about how it uses location data and how it protects user privacy.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Facebook has announced that it will be conducting a review of its location data practices to ensure that they are in line with user expectations.

With the bravado of a prizefighter during a weigh-in, on Friday Dunkerton declared \"I'm confident we'll win\", before a shareholder vote on Tuesday that will determine whether he can rejoin the company he quit last year, as he becomes increasingly unhappy with the direction Superdry is going in under new boss Euan Sutherland. As the battle for control of Superdry reaches its climax, the stakes are higher than ever. The fashion brand's fortunes have been in decline since Dunkerton's departure, with sales slumping and profits plummeting. The co-founder's return to the company he helped build from scratch has been met with resistance from management, who argue that his departure was amicable and that he has no right to interfere with the business he left behind.\n\nDespite this, Dunkerton remains convinced that he can turn Superdry around and restore its former glory. He has been vocal about his discontent with the direction the company is heading under Sutherland's leadership, criticizing the new boss's attempts to revamp the brand's image and appeal to a younger demographic.\n\nThe shareholder vote on Tuesday will determine whether Dunkerton gets the chance to put his plans into action. If he is successful, it is likely that he will face a significant challenge in winning over the hearts and minds of the company's employees, many of whom have grown accustomed to Sutherland's leadership.\n\nHowever, Dunkerton's supporters argue that his departure was a result of a disagreement over the company's strategy, and that he has the passion and expertise to lead Superdry back to its former heights. The co-founder has been touring the country, meeting with shareholders and drumming up support for his campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, Sutherland has been working to rally support among the company's employees and investors, emphasizing the progress that has been made under his leadership and the need for stability and continuity. The new boss has also been touting the company's plans for expansion into new markets and the development of new product lines.\n\nAs the final showdown approaches, the fate of Superdry hangs in the balance. Will Dunkerton's bravado and passion be enough to convince shareholders to give him a second chance, or will Sutherland's more measured approach win the day? One thing is certain - the outcome will have significant implications for the future of the fashion brand.",

I'm a 26-year-old male who has landed his first proper job, but my heart sank at the dress code: smart casual. What does that actually mean? The age-old conundrum of deciphering dress code instructions! Smart casual is a term that can strike fear into the hearts of even the most fashion-conscious individuals. But fear not, dear reader, for we're here to help you navigate this sartorial minefield.\n\nSmart casual is a dress code that's often used in professional settings, such as workplaces, restaurants, or events. It's a middle ground between formal and casual attire, requiring a balance between style and practicality. Think of it as a \"business-casual\" outfit with a touch of sophistication.\n\nSo, what does smart casual actually mean? Here are some general guidelines to help you get it right:\n\n1. Avoid ripped or distressed clothing: While ripped jeans might be acceptable in a casual setting, they're not suitable for a smart casual occasion. Opt for clean, straight-leg or slim-fit jeans instead.\n2. Choose a decent top: A plain white or light-colored shirt is a safe bet. Avoid low-cut or overly revealing tops, and instead opt for something with a bit of texture or interest, such as a patterned or striped design.\n3. Add a blazer or cardigan: A blazer or cardigan can instantly elevate your outfit from casual to smart casual. Look for something in a neutral color that complements your shirt and pants.\n4. Shoes matter: Avoid sneakers or flip-flops, and instead opt for loafers, ballet flats, or dress shoes. Make sure they're clean and polished to add a touch of sophistication.\n5. Accessories are key: A simple watch, a slim belt, and a quality wallet can make a big difference in your overall look. Avoid anything too flashy or attention-seeking.\n6. Pay attention to fabrics: Smart casual attire often features high-quality fabrics, such as cotton, wool, or linen. Avoid synthetic materials or anything that looks too cheap.\n\nSome examples of smart casual outfits might include:\n\n* A pair of dark-washed jeans with a white or light-colored button-down shirt, a blazer, and loafers.\n* A skirt or dress with a pair of tights and a cardigan, paired with ballet flats or loafers.\n* A pair of chinos with a polo shirt, a cardigan, and dress shoes.\n\nRemember, the key to smart casual is to look polished and put-together without being too formal. With a little practice, you'll be a pro at deciphering dress code instructions in no time!",

        "Text": "PepsiCo has faced a backlash after suing four Indian farmers who allegedly grew a patented strain of potatoes used in its Lay's crisps without the company's permission. The company, which originally sought about $150,000 (£116,000) in damages from each of the farmers, arguing they broke the law by sourcing and dealing the potatoes, offered to settle \"amicably\" when the case went to court in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Friday. The case sparked outrage from farmers and others concerned that PepsiCo was using its clout to interfere with the country's food supply. The role of foreign companies in producing and selling food in India is a hotly contested issue, particularly when concerning genetically modified (GM) crops. The settlement offer came as a surprise to many, as the case had already gained significant attention and sparked heated debates about the role of multinational corporations in India's agricultural sector. The four farmers, who were identified as Kailash Jatav, Suresh Patel, Kishor Patel, and Yogesh Patel, had been growing the patented potato variety, known as \"IN-201712\", without permission from PepsiCo.\n\nThe company's decision to sue the farmers was seen as an attempt to protect its intellectual property and maintain control over the production and distribution of its potato-based products. However, many critics argued that the move was an overreach and an attempt to stifle innovation and competition in the Indian agricultural sector.\n\n\"This is a clear case of corporate bullying,\" said Rakesh Tikait, a prominent farmer leader, in a statement. \"PepsiCo is trying to use its power and resources to silence small farmers who are simply trying to make a living. We will not let this happen.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the safety and efficacy of GM crops in India. While PepsiCo and other multinational corporations have touted the benefits of GM crops, many scientists and environmental groups have raised concerns about their potential impact on the country's ecosystem and food supply.\n\n\"PepsiCo's actions are a prime example of why we need to be cautious about the introduction of GM crops in India,\" said Dr. Vandana Shiva, a prominent environmental activist. \"These crops are often designed to benefit multinational corporations, not Indian farmers or consumers. We need to prioritize the health and well-being of our people and our planet, not the profits of corporations.\"\n\nThe Indian government has been under pressure to address the concerns of farmers and environmental groups, and has promised to review the country's policies on GM crops. In the meantime, the controversy surrounding PepsiCo's lawsuit against the four Indian farmers is likely to continue, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability from multinational corporations operating in India.",

        "Text": "A new register naming firms that find themselves under shareholder pressure over executive pay is to be launched later this year as part of government plans aimed at curbing boardroom excess and increasing transparency. In what was described by the government as a world first, the new register will name firms where a fifth of investors have objected to proposed executive annual pay packages. However, the unveiling of the policy marks a retreat from the much more radical approach which had originally been touted by Theresa May in the form of promises to increase the frequency of binding shareholder votes on corporate pay policies. The policies of listed British companies are currently subject to a binding vote every three years. The new register, which is expected to be launched in the autumn, will provide a more nuanced picture of shareholder sentiment on executive pay, allowing investors to make more informed decisions about their investments. According to the government, the register will include companies where a fifth of investors have objected to proposed executive pay packages, providing a clear indication of where there is significant dissent among shareholders.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant step towards increasing transparency and accountability in the boardroom, and is likely to put pressure on companies to rethink their executive pay policies. \"This new register will shine a light on where companies are out of step with their shareholders on executive pay, and will help to drive up standards across the board,\" said a government spokesperson.\n\nHowever, some critics have argued that the new register does not go far enough, and that the government should be doing more to curb boardroom excess. \"While this is a step in the right direction, it's still a relatively limited measure,\" said a spokesperson for the Trades Union Congress. \"We need to see more fundamental changes to the way executive pay is set, and more frequent and binding shareholder votes on corporate pay policies.\"\n\nThe government's decision to launch the register marks a retreat from the more radical approach that was originally proposed by Theresa May. In 2016, May promised to increase the frequency of binding shareholder votes on corporate pay policies, with the aim of curbing excessive executive pay. However, since coming to power, the current government has watered down this proposal, and has instead opted for the more limited measure of a new register.\n\nDespite this, the launch of the register is still seen as a significant step forward, and is likely to have a major impact on the way companies approach executive pay. \"This is a major development, and will help to drive up standards across the board,\" said a spokesperson for the Institute of Directors. \"Companies will need to think carefully about how they approach executive pay, and will need to be more transparent and accountable in their decision-making.\"\n\nThe launch of the register is also likely to have implications for the wider business community, and could lead to a shift in the way companies approach executive pay. \"This is a major step forward, and could have significant implications for the way companies approach executive pay,\" said a spokesperson for the Confederation of British Industry. \"We will be working closely with the government to ensure that the register is effective, and that it helps to drive up standards across the board.\"\n\nOverall, the launch of the new register is a significant development, and is likely to have a major impact on the way companies approach executive pay. While some critics may argue that it does not go far enough, it is still a significant step forward, and is likely to drive up standards across the board.",

Aspiro, which is publicly traded in Sweden, operates subscription streaming services under the brands WiMP and Tidal, which entered the United States market last fall. The acquisition of Aspiro by Jay Z's investment vehicle, S. Carter Enterprises, is seen as a major move in the music streaming industry, which has been dominated by Spotify and Apple Music. Tidal, which was launched in 2014, has struggled to gain significant market share, but Jay Z's acquisition of Aspiro's shares could be a game-changer for the company.\n\nAccording to reports, S. Carter Enterprises acquired 96.5% of Aspiro's shares, making it the majority shareholder of the company. Aspiro's board of directors has recommended that shareholders accept the offer, and the deal is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.\n\nThe acquisition is seen as a strategic move by Jay Z to expand Tidal's reach and challenge the dominance of Spotify and Apple Music. Tidal has struggled to compete with the two giants, which have massive libraries of music and large user bases. However, Tidal has focused on providing high-quality audio and exclusive content from popular artists, which has helped it to attract a loyal following.\n\nJay Z has been a vocal critic of the music streaming industry, accusing Spotify and Apple Music of exploiting artists and not paying them fairly. With his acquisition of Aspiro, he is seen as taking a step towards changing the industry's business model. Tidal has already signed deals with several major artists, including Kanye West, Beyoncé, and Rihanna, and the company is expected to continue to expand its roster of artists.\n\nThe acquisition is also seen as a major coup for Jay Z, who has been building his business empire over the past few years. In addition to his music career, he has also invested in several other companies, including a sports agency and a chain of restaurants. The acquisition of Aspiro is seen as a major milestone in his business career, and it is expected to have a significant impact on the music streaming industry.\n\nIn a statement, Jay Z said, \"I am thrilled to be taking over Aspiro and Tidal. We are committed to providing a high-quality streaming service that benefits both artists and music fans. We believe that music should be valued and respected, and we are committed to creating a platform that reflects that.\"\n\nThe acquisition of Aspiro is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, and it is expected to have a significant impact on the music streaming industry. As Tidal continues to expand its reach and sign new deals with artists, it is likely to become a major player in the industry.",

Sumitomo Rubber Industries confirmed that it will acquire the trademark rights of the Dunlop brand overseas, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. Sports Direct's founder and major shareholder, Mike Ashley, acquired Dunlop Slazenger for an estimated £40m in 2004 from Royal Bank of Scotland – which had taken control of the struggling business from its private equity-backed owners – three years before he floated his sportswear retail chain on the stock exchange. The 107-year-old Dunlop brand is associated with many sports including tennis, squash, badminton and golf. Its gear has been used by sporting figures including tennis champions Rod Laver, John McEnroe and Steffi Graf, as well as golfers such as the 2011 British Open winner Darren Clarke and the former world number one Lee Westwood. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Sumitomo Rubber Industries' presence in the global sports market, particularly in Europe and North America. The Japanese company, which is already a leading manufacturer of tires and other rubber products, has been expanding its portfolio of sports brands in recent years.\n\nThe deal is also seen as a strategic move by Sports Direct to focus on its core retail business and reduce its debt. The company has been facing financial challenges in recent years, including a decline in sales and profits. By selling Dunlop, Sports Direct will be able to reduce its debt and free up capital to invest in its retail operations.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has agreed to retain the existing management and staff of Dunlop, and plans to maintain the brand's operations in the UK.\n\nThe sale of Dunlop is the latest in a series of divestments by Sports Direct, which has been streamlining its business in recent years. In 2019, the company sold its remaining stake in the French fashion brand, Millet, to its Chinese partner, Anta Sports.\n\nThe Dunlop brand has a rich history, dating back to 1910 when John Dunlop invented the first pneumatic tire. The company has since become a leading manufacturer of sports equipment, including tennis rackets, squash rackets, and golf balls.\n\nThe acquisition of Dunlop by Sumitomo Rubber Industries is expected to create new opportunities for the brand, particularly in the Asian market. The Japanese company has a strong presence in the region, and is well-positioned to leverage the brand's global reputation and expertise.\n\nIn a statement, Sumitomo Rubber Industries said it was \"delighted\" to acquire the Dunlop brand, and looked forward to working with the existing management and staff to build on the brand's success. Sports Direct's founder, Mike Ashley, also welcomed the deal, saying it would allow the company to focus on its core retail business and reduce its debt.\n\nThe sale of Dunlop is a significant development in the sports industry, and is expected to have a major impact on the global market.

Trump and Hillary Clinton tuned in on Tuesday to see their running mates square off.\n\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, the vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine drew an average audience of around 37 million viewers, a significant drop from the 84 million who watched the first presidential debate. The debate, moderated by ABC News' Martha Raddatz and CBS News' Elaine Quijano, focused on topics such as foreign policy, national security, and the economy.\n\nDespite the lower viewership, the debate still dominated social media conversations, with the hashtag #VPDebate trending on Twitter throughout the evening. The debate also sparked lively discussions on cable news channels and talk shows, with many pundits and analysts weighing in on the performance of the two vice presidential candidates.\n\nPence, the Indiana governor and Trump's running mate, was praised by many Republicans for his calm and composed demeanor during the debate. He repeatedly emphasized Trump's positions on issues such as tax reform and national security, and touted the Republican ticket's plan to create jobs and boost economic growth.\n\nKaine, the Virginia senator and Clinton's running mate, was criticized by some Democrats for his aggressive tone and what some saw as a lack of preparation. He repeatedly interrupted Pence and attempted to turn the debate into a referendum on Trump's character, rather than focusing on the issues at hand.\n\nDespite the differing opinions on their performances, both candidates were able to score some points with their respective bases. Pence's strong showing may have helped to shore up support among Trump's core voters, while Kaine's aggressive tactics may have energized Clinton's supporters.\n\nThe debate was also notable for the lack of fireworks and personal attacks that characterized the first presidential debate. Both candidates were generally civil and respectful towards each other, and the debate remained focused on the issues.\n\nThe lower viewership for the vice presidential debate is likely due to a combination of factors, including the fact that the presidential debate was a more highly anticipated event, and that many viewers may have been satisfied with the performance of their preferred candidate in the first debate. However, the debate still provided valuable insight into the policy differences between the two tickets, and may have helped to sway some undecided voters in the final weeks of the campaign.",

The study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found the retail industry now has the highest rate of redundancies of any sector of the economy, amid the rapid rise of shop closures across the country. The analysis comes as growing numbers of UK retailers announce job cuts and store closures across the country, with losses at major high street employers such as M&S, Debenhams and HMV. The report, titled \"The High Street in Crisis,\" highlights the devastating impact of the retail industry's decline on workers, particularly those under the age of 25. According to the study, nearly 30% of retail workers aged 16-24 are at risk of unemployment, compared to just 15% of those aged 55 and over.\n\nThe thinktank's analysis suggests that the rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits are major contributing factors to the crisis. As more people turn to e-commerce, brick-and-mortar stores are struggling to compete, leading to widespread job losses and store closures.\n\nThe report's authors warn that the situation is likely to worsen unless policymakers take immediate action to support the retail industry. \"The high street is facing a perfect storm of challenges, from rising costs to changing consumer behavior,\" said Laura Gardiner, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. \"Unless we see a significant shift in the way retailers operate, we risk losing a generation of young workers to unemployment.\"\n\nThe study's findings are backed up by recent data from the Office for National Statistics, which shows that the number of people working in retail has fallen by over 100,000 in the past year alone. The industry's job losses are expected to continue, with many experts predicting that up to 20% of all retail jobs could be lost in the next five years.\n\nThe news has sparked concern among politicians and industry leaders, who are calling for urgent action to support the retail sector. \"The retail industry is a vital part of our economy, and we cannot afford to lose it,\" said Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow business secretary. \"We need to see a comprehensive package of support for retailers, including help with business rates and rent costs, to prevent further job losses.\"\n\nAs the retail industry continues to grapple with the challenges of the digital age, workers are left wondering what the future holds. For many, the prospect of unemployment is a harsh reality, and it's unclear whether the government and industry leaders will be able to stem the tide of job losses before it's too late.",

        "Text": "Your headline (Single polypill reduces risk of heart attacks and strokes, study finds, 23 August) should really have been tempered by quoting the absolute rather than the relative risk-reduction figures. The 34% reduction in major cardiac events you quote is calculated from \"on the ground\" reduction in events from 8.8% over five years in those not on the polypill to 5.9% in those receiving it – that is a 2.9% chance of benefit over five years to the individual and with no effect on mortality. Archie Cochrane , the doyen of evidence-based medicine, said we should ask three questions of any intervention: can it work, does it work and is it worth it? The relative risk reduction you quote tells us of population benefit and answers the first two questions, but it is the absolute risk reduction that answers the \"is it worth it?\"question. Many patients would be reluctant to take a tablet if told there was a greater than 97% chance that they would derive no benefit from taking it over five years and it had no positive effect on their length of life. The critique highlights the importance of considering absolute risk reduction when evaluating the effectiveness of a medical intervention, rather than relying solely on relative risk reduction. In the case of the single polypill, the absolute risk reduction of 2.9% over five years may be a more accurate representation of the potential benefit to individual patients.\n\nThis distinction is crucial, as it can significantly impact patients' willingness to take the medication. As the author notes, many patients may be hesitant to take a tablet if they are told there is a greater than 97% chance that they will derive no benefit from it over five years. This highlights the need for healthcare providers to have open and honest discussions with patients about the potential risks and benefits of treatment.\n\nThe polypill, which combines several medications into one tablet, has been touted as a potential game-changer in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. However, the results of the study are not without limitations. The study was conducted in a high-risk population, and the findings may not be generalizable to all patients.\n\nFurthermore, the study did not examine the potential side effects of the polypill, which could be a concern for some patients. Additionally, the study's authors noted that the polypill was not superior to existing treatments in terms of mortality rates, which may limit its appeal to some patients.\n\nDespite these limitations, the study's findings are still significant, and the results could have important implications for public health policy. The World Health Organization has estimated that over 17 million people die each year from cardiovascular disease, making it a leading cause of death worldwide.\n\nIn light of these findings, healthcare providers and policymakers may need to rethink their approach to prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. The single polypill could be a valuable addition to the armamentarium of treatments available to patients, particularly those at high risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\nHowever, as the author notes, it is essential to consider the absolute risk reduction when evaluating the effectiveness of the polypill. Patients and healthcare providers must have a clear understanding of the potential benefits and risks of treatment, and the polypill should be prescribed and taken in the context of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes lifestyle modifications and other evidence-based interventions.",

Marketed as \"a vacant front basement suitable for redevelopment\", this was one for investors willing to take a risk on getting the right planning consents. Prospective buyers were told, \"There will be no internal viewings due to lack of access (excavation required)\". The property in question, located in a prime area of London, has sparked both excitement and skepticism among potential buyers. The unique selling point of the vacant front basement is its potential for redevelopment, but the caveat of requiring excavation to access the property has left many wondering if the risk is worth the reward.\n\nAccording to auctioneer, James Smith, the property was marketed as a rare opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor of a potential development. \"This is a blank canvas, waiting for the right buyer to come along and turn it into something special,\" Smith said. \"Of course, it's not for the faint of heart. You'll need to have a clear vision and a willingness to take on the challenges that come with redeveloping a property of this nature.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, several bidders showed interest in the property, with the final sale price coming in at £250,000. The buyer, a local developer, was unavailable for comment, but sources close to the deal suggest that they plan to turn the basement into a luxury apartment.\n\nThe sale of the property has raised questions about the state of London's property market, with some experts warning that the city is due for a correction. \"We're seeing a lot of investors taking on high-risk projects in the hopes of making a quick profit,\" said property analyst, Emma Taylor. \"While it's true that London is still a desirable place to invest, we need to be careful not to get carried away.

An unresolved question, however, is whether couples who were legally married in one state but moved to another state that doesn't recognize gay marriage can get the same benefits. That's because the Social Security Administration currently uses a \"place of residence\" standard in deciding spousal benefits. As the Social Security Administration (SSA) begins processing spousal retirement claims for same-sex couples, many are left wondering about the implications for those who have moved to states that do not recognize their marriage. The SSA's \"place of residence\" standard, which determines eligibility for spousal benefits, has raised concerns among couples who were legally married in one state but now reside in a state that does not recognize their union.\n\nUnder the SSA's current policy, the agency uses an individual's place of residence to determine their eligibility for spousal benefits. This means that if a same-sex couple was married in a state that recognizes their marriage, but now resides in a state that does not, the SSA may not recognize their marriage for the purpose of spousal benefits.\n\n\"This is a major concern for many same-sex couples who have relocated to states that do not recognize their marriage,\" said Rachel B.

They argue that the agency should focus on the validity of the marriage, rather than the individual's place of residence.\n\n\"The SSA should recognize the marriage as valid, regardless of where the couple resides,\" said Tiven. \"This would ensure that all same-sex couples, regardless of where they live, have access to the same benefits and protections as opposite-sex couples.\"\n\nThe SSA has not yet commented on its policy regarding same-sex couples who have relocated to states that do not recognize their marriage. However, advocates are hopeful that the agency will reconsider its stance and provide clarity on the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, same-sex couples who are concerned about their eligibility for spousal benefits are advised to consult with an attorney or a qualified benefits expert to determine their options.

The trade body said: \"It seems households are saving a bit less each month, rather than borrowing more, as growth in personal deposits has slowed recently, alongside a slowdown in growth of consumer credit borrowing.\" Annual growth in credit card borrowing was at 5% in August, compared with 5.3% the previous month, while the use of personal loans and overdrafts fell by 1.6% on an annual basis, from a contraction of 1% in the year to July. The decline in personal savings is attributed to the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, which has seen households struggling to make ends meet due to rising prices and stagnant wages. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 2.1% in August, the highest level since March 2017. This has led to a significant increase in the cost of essential items such as food, energy, and housing, forcing many families to dip into their savings to cover the shortfall.\n\nEconomists have warned that the decline in personal savings could have long-term consequences for the economy, particularly if households are unable to build up a sufficient safety net to weather future economic shocks. \"The slowdown in personal savings is a cause for concern, as it suggests that households are becoming increasingly reliant on credit to fund their spending,\" said Rachel Winter, an economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \"This could lead to a vicious cycle of debt and financial instability if not addressed.\"\n\nThe Bank of England has also expressed concerns about the decline in personal savings, citing the need for households to build up a sufficient buffer to absorb future economic shocks. In its latest inflation report, the Bank warned that households are becoming increasingly vulnerable to financial shocks, particularly if interest rates rise or the economy enters a recession.\n\nDespite the decline in personal savings, some experts argue that the current economic conditions are not as dire as they seem. \"While it's true that households are saving less, it's also important to note that the economy is still growing, albeit slowly,\" said Vicky Pryce, a former chief economic advisor to the government. \"Households are also becoming more cautious about their spending, which could actually help to reduce debt and improve financial stability in the long run.\"\n\nIn the meantime, households are being advised to review their financial priorities and build up a sufficient safety net to weather future economic shocks. \"It's essential that households take steps to manage their finances effectively, including building up an emergency fund and paying off high-interest debt,\" said Sarah Pennells, a personal finance expert at the Money Advice Service. \"By taking these steps, households can reduce their reliance on credit and improve their overall financial resilience.\"",

The deal is not expected to have any impact on discussions on the rest of British Steel, as exclusive talks continue between the government's official receiver, the state employee managing the sale, and Oyak, the Turkish military pension fund. York-based TSP Projects, which designs and builds large rail infrastructure projects, will be folded into Systra. The sale of TSP Projects to Systra is expected to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals. The deal is seen as a positive development for the employees of TSP Projects, who will now become part of a larger and more financially stable company.\n\nSystra, which is a leading player in the global rail industry, has a strong track record of investing in and developing rail infrastructure projects. The company has operations in over 30 countries and has worked on some of the most complex and high-profile rail projects in the world.\n\nThe acquisition of TSP Projects is seen as a strategic move by Systra to expand its presence in the UK rail market. The company has identified the UK as a key growth area and is looking to capitalize on the country's ongoing investment in its rail infrastructure.\n\nThe deal is also expected to bring significant benefits to the UK economy. The government has been keen to support the country's rail industry and has been working to attract foreign investment. The sale of TSP Projects to Systra is seen as a major success for the government's efforts and is expected to create new opportunities for the company and its employees.\n\nThe sale of TSP Projects is not expected to have any impact on the ongoing talks between the government's official receiver and Oyak, the Turkish military pension fund, over the sale of the rest of British Steel. The talks are still ongoing and are expected to take several weeks to complete.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the government's official receiver said: \"We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Systra for the sale of TSP Projects. This deal will protect 400 jobs and is a positive development for the company and its employees. We will continue to work closely with Oyak to finalize the sale of the rest of British Steel and ensure a successful outcome for all parties involved.\"\n\nThe sale of TSP Projects is the latest in a series of deals to be completed as part of the government's efforts to sell off the assets of British Steel. The company went into liquidation earlier this year, leaving thousands of jobs at risk. However, the government has been working to find buyers for the company's assets and has made significant progress in recent months.\n\nOverall, the sale of TSP Projects to Systra is a positive development for the UK rail industry and is expected to bring significant benefits to the country's economy. The deal is a testament to the government's commitment to supporting the country's rail industry and is expected to pave the way for further investment and growth in the sector.",

Out went the twisty Pixie Path aisles, the ornate displays, the green walls and the color-changing fiberglass trees. In came a movie-theater-size screen, a simplified floor plan, white walls and more items for fashion-conscious adults. The transformation is part of a larger effort by Disney to revamp its retail strategy and appeal to a wider range of customers. According to Disney officials, the new store design is intended to create a more immersive and engaging shopping experience for visitors.\n\n\"We wanted to create a space that feels more modern and sleek, while still maintaining the magic and wonder of the Disney brand,\" said a spokesperson for Disney. \"We're excited to see how our guests respond to the new design and the expanded product offerings.\"\n\nOne of the most noticeable changes is the addition of a large screen display, which showcases Disney's latest movies, TV shows, and original content. The screen is designed to be interactive, allowing customers to engage with Disney's digital offerings and even purchase exclusive merchandise.\n\nThe store's floor plan has also been simplified, with a more straightforward layout that makes it easier for customers to navigate. Gone are the winding Pixie Path aisles, replaced by clear pathways that guide shoppers through the store.\n\nIn addition to the new design, Disney has also expanded its product offerings to include more fashion-conscious items for adults. The store now carries a range of Disney-themed clothing, accessories, and home goods, including collaborations with popular brands like Levi's and Vera Bradley.\n\nThe revamped store is also designed to be more experiential, with interactive displays and hands-on activities that allow customers to engage with Disney's characters and stories in new ways. For example, a \"Disney Storytelling\" area invites customers to step into the world of Disney's beloved characters, while a \"Disney Fashion\" section showcases the latest trends and styles inspired by Disney's iconic characters.\n\nThe Northridge Fashion Center store is the first Disney retail location to undergo the new design, but it won't be the last. Disney officials say that the company plans to roll out the new design to other locations in the coming months, with the goal of creating a consistent and engaging shopping experience for customers across the country.\n\nFor now, shoppers in the Northridge area can get a glimpse of the future of Disney retail at the newly revamped store. Whether you're a die-hard Disney fan or just looking for a unique shopping experience, the new Disney store is definitely worth a visit.",

Alison Mitchell, who oversaw the paper's daily news report through the presidential election, will become an assistant editor on the masthead. The move is the latest in a series of changes aimed at diversifying the top ranks of the newsroom, which has long been criticized for its lack of diversity and representation. Mitchell's appointment comes just weeks after the Times announced the promotion of two other women to key positions: Danielle Rhoades Ha, who will become the paper's first deputy editor for news, and Jamie Stockwell, who will become the editor of the paper's Sunday Review section.\n\nMitchell, who has been with the Times for over 20 years, has played a crucial role in shaping the paper's daily news coverage, including its extensive coverage of the 2020 presidential election. As assistant editor, she will be responsible for overseeing the paper's daily news report and working closely with the editor-in-chief to set the news agenda.\n\nThe changes are part of a broader effort by the Times to address concerns about diversity and representation in its newsroom. In recent years, the paper has faced criticism for its lack of diversity among its top editors, with many calling for more women and people of color to be represented in leadership positions.\n\nThe new appointments are seen as a significant step in the right direction, with many praising the Times for taking concrete steps to address the issue. \"This is a huge step forward for the Times,\" said one longtime journalist at the paper. \"It's about time we saw more women and people of color in leadership positions.

In 2005, I led a Treasury committee inquiry into cash machine charges which found hundreds of local areas where consumers were being hit with high charges. In Speke, a low-income area in Liverpool, consumers faced charges of £1.50 for making cash withdrawals. I established a working group including banks, consumer groups and ATM operators. The working group, which I chaired, made several recommendations to address the issue of cash machine charges. One of the key suggestions was for banks and ATM operators to establish a more transparent and consistent pricing structure for cash withdrawals. We also recommended that consumers be provided with clearer information about the fees they would be charged before making a withdrawal.\n\nAt the time, the major banks and ATM operators were resistant to change, and it took several years of lobbying and advocacy before they began to implement some of the recommendations. However, the issue of cash machine charges has once again come to the forefront, with the current negotiations over the future of the ATM network sparking concerns about the potential for increased fees.\n\nAs the debate continues, it is crucial that consumers are aware of the potential implications of the proposed changes. The Link network, which is used by millions of people across the UK, is currently facing significant financial pressures, and some have suggested that the only way to ensure its long-term sustainability is to introduce fees for cash withdrawals.\n\nHowever, many consumer groups and experts have expressed concerns that such a move would disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and low-income households, who rely heavily on cash machines. They argue that the fees would add to the already significant financial burdens faced by these individuals, and could potentially exacerbate issues of financial exclusion.\n\nIn light of these concerns, it is essential that any proposed changes to the ATM network are carefully considered and that the needs and concerns of consumers are taken into account. As a nation, we must ensure that our cash machine infrastructure remains accessible and affordable for all, regardless of their financial circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of cash machine charges is a complex and contentious one, and it is crucial that we approach it with sensitivity and compassion. As a society, we must work together to ensure that our financial systems are fair, accessible, and equitable for all.",

He was 88. The cause was pneumonia, his wife, Elizabeth, said. Richard Meryman's Life of Words\n\nRichard Meryman, a renowned writer and editor, left an indelible mark on the world of literature and journalism. His remarkable career spanned decades, during which he crafted poignant and insightful profiles of some of the most fascinating figures of the 20th century. Meryman's passing on February 5, at the age of 88, has sent shockwaves through the literary and journalistic communities, as friends, colleagues, and fans mourn the loss of a masterful storyteller.\n\nBorn in 1934, Meryman began his career in journalism in the 1960s, working as a writer and editor for Life magazine. It was during this period that he conducted the last interview with the iconic actress Marilyn Monroe, a conversation that would become a defining moment in his career. The interview, published in Life magazine in 1962, offered a rare glimpse into Monroe's private life and struggles, cementing Meryman's reputation as a sensitive and perceptive journalist.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Meryman turned his attention to writing books, including an intimate portrait of the reclusive artist Andrew Wyeth.

The team of researchers, from Northwestern University, the University of Illinois at Chicago and Draper Laboratory, published the results of their study in Nature Communications on Tuesday. The model, which is made up of tiny channels and chambers, is designed to mimic the complex structure and function of the human female reproductive system. It is the first of its kind to be developed and has the potential to revolutionize the way scientists study the system and develop new treatments for women's health issues.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the model is capable of simulating the entire menstrual cycle, including the shedding of the uterine lining and the production of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. This allows scientists to study the complex interactions between the different components of the reproductive system and how they respond to different stimuli.\n\nThe model is also capable of simulating pregnancy, including the implantation of a fertilized egg and the growth of the fetus. This allows scientists to study the early stages of pregnancy and how the reproductive system adapts to the presence of a developing fetus.\n\nThe researchers believe that the model will be a valuable tool for scientists studying the reproductive system and for developing new treatments for women's health issues. They plan to use the model to study the effects of different hormones and medications on the reproductive system and to develop new treatments for conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis.\n\nThe development of the model is also expected to have a significant impact on the field of regenerative medicine. The researchers believe that the model could be used to study the growth and development of stem cells in the reproductive system and to develop new treatments for infertility.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Teresa Woodruff, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University. She said that the model is a major breakthrough in the field of reproductive biology and has the potential to revolutionize the way scientists study the reproductive system.\n\n\"This model is a game-changer,\" Dr. Woodruff said. \"It allows us to study the reproductive system in a way that was previously impossible. We can use it to study the effects of different hormones and medications and to develop new treatments for women's health issues.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense. The researchers plan to continue to refine the model and to use it to study the reproductive system in more detail.\n\nThe development of the model is also expected to have a significant impact on the field of education. The researchers believe that the model could be used to teach students about the reproductive system and to help them understand how it functions.\n\n\"This model is a great teaching tool,\" said Dr. Woodruff. \"It allows students to see the reproductive system in a way that was previously impossible.

But that is not the only initiative the ambitious US company is investing in: Fashion Amazon is in talks with the former chief of Marks & Spencer womenswear about joining the company and is looking to build an own-label clothing brand. Frances Russell, who left M&S last year, would be a big-name hire for Amazon as it looks to build its credibility in clothing. Amazon's foray into the grocery market is a significant move, as the e-commerce giant continues to diversify its offerings and expand its presence in the retail space. The deal with Morrisons, a leading UK supermarket chain, will allow Amazon to offer a wider range of fresh produce and household essentials to its customers.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's efforts to establish a presence in the fashion industry are also gaining momentum. The proposed hire of Frances Russell, former chief of Marks & Spencer's womenswear division, is a significant coup for Amazon. Russell's expertise and industry connections will be invaluable in helping the company build its own-label clothing brand and establish a reputation for quality and style.\n\nAmazon's foray into fashion is seen as a major challenge to the dominance of traditional retailers like Marks & Spencer and Next. The company's ability to leverage its vast customer base and logistical expertise to offer fast and convenient fashion shopping could prove a major disruptor in the industry.\n\nThe proposed own-label clothing brand is expected to be a key part of Amazon's fashion strategy. The company has already made significant inroads in the beauty and personal care space with its own-label products, and a similar approach is likely to be taken in fashion.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that Amazon is planning to launch a range of clothing products, including women's and men's wear, as well as accessories and homeware. The company is also believed to be exploring opportunities to partner with popular fashion brands and designers to offer exclusive products to its customers.\n\nThe move into fashion is seen as a natural extension of Amazon's existing retail business, which already offers a wide range of products, from electronics and home goods to toys and baby products. The company's ability to offer fast and convenient fashion shopping, combined with its competitive pricing and customer loyalty, could prove a major threat to traditional retailers.\n\nAmazon's expansion into grocery and fashion is a significant development in the retail landscape, and is likely to have major implications for traditional retailers and consumers alike. As the company continues to diversify its offerings and expand its presence in new markets, it will be interesting to see how it adapts to the changing retail landscape and what new opportunities and challenges it presents.",

The retirement legislation that the House recently passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority includes a series of provisions that would affect different groups of American savers and retirees. The bill, which is expected to be considered by the Senate in the coming weeks, aims to improve the nation's retirement security system by addressing concerns about access, affordability, and sustainability.\n\nOne of the most significant provisions in the bill is the expansion of the Secure Act's automatic enrollment feature. Currently, employers with 10 or more employees are required to automatically enroll new hires in a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) or an IRA, if they do not opt out. The new legislation would lower the threshold to five employees, making it easier for small businesses and startups to offer retirement plans to their employees.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions aimed at helping workers save for retirement by increasing the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and other retirement plans. The current annual limit of $19,500 would be increased by $1,000, and the catch-up contribution limit for workers aged 50 and older would be raised by $5,000. This would enable more workers to build a more substantial nest egg for their retirement years.\n\nIn addition, the legislation would provide relief to retirees who are struggling to make ends meet by increasing the amount of income that is exempt from taxation. The bill would exempt the first $50,000 of retirement income from taxation, which would be a significant increase from the current exemption of $20,000. This change would provide much-needed relief to retirees who are living on a fixed income and are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions aimed at improving the financial literacy of American workers. It would require employers to provide employees with a retirement plan disclosure statement that would explain the plan's features, fees, and investment options. This would help workers make more informed decisions about their retirement savings and avoid costly mistakes.\n\nFinally, the legislation would provide funding for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which is a government agency that insures private-sector pension plans. The PBGC has been facing a significant funding shortfall in recent years, and the bill would provide $35 billion in funding to ensure that the agency can continue to pay benefits to workers whose employers have gone bankrupt.\n\nOverall, the retirement legislation passed by the House is a comprehensive bill that addresses a range of concerns about retirement security. While it is still unclear whether the bill will be approved by the Senate and signed into law, it is an important step towards improving the nation's retirement system and ensuring that American workers have a more secure financial future.",

The changes, according to a spokeswoman for Snap, Snapchat's parent company, are intended to \"empower our editorial partners to do their part to keep Snapchat an informative, factual and safe environment for everyone\". Toeing the line between keeping Snapchat age appropriate for younger users – the app bars children from under 13 from making accounts, but allows 13- to 17-year-olds on the service – and allowing publications on Discover editorial freedom has been difficult for the company, particularly when media organisations know one way to appeal to the app's millennial user base is with prominent use of risqué images. The Daily Mail, for instance, has attracted user complaints for frequently posting semi-nude images as its \"cover\" on the service. The new guidelines, which took effect on March 1st, prohibit the posting of images that are \"obscene, explicit, or gratuitous\" unless they have \"clear editorial value\" and are not intended to \"exploit or offend\" users. The move is seen as a significant shift for Snapchat, which has historically been known for its relaxed approach to content moderation.\n\nAccording to industry experts, the changes are a response to growing concerns about the spread of misinformation and explicit content on social media platforms. \"Snapchat has been under pressure to do more to prevent the spread of fake news and to create a safer environment for its users,\" said Sarah Jones, a media analyst at eMarketer. \"These new guidelines are a step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen how effective they will be in practice.\"\n\nThe new guidelines also clarify the types of content that are allowed on Discover, including news articles, videos, and other types of editorial content. Publishers are still free to post a wide range of content, but they must ensure that it is accurate, trustworthy, and respectful.\n\nThe changes have been met with mixed reactions from publishers and users. Some have welcomed the move, saying that it will help to create a more respectful and informative environment on the platform. Others have expressed concerns that the new guidelines will stifle creativity and freedom of expression.\n\nFor its part, Snapchat says that the changes are intended to strike a balance between providing a safe and respectful environment for its users and allowing publishers the freedom to create engaging and informative content. \"We want to empower our editorial partners to do their part in keeping Snapchat an informative, factual, and safe environment for everyone,\" said a spokeswoman for Snap.\n\nThe company has also introduced new tools to help publishers comply with the new guidelines. These include a content review process that allows publishers to submit their content for review before it is published on the platform, as well as a system for reporting and removing content that violates the new guidelines.\n\nOverall, the changes are seen as a significant shift for Snapchat, and are likely to have a major impact on the types of content that are published on the platform. While some have expressed concerns about the potential impact on creativity and freedom of expression, others see the changes as a necessary step to create a safer and more respectful environment for users.",

The cover -- a classic and melancholy image of a dark tree with sparse yellow leaves against a dusky blue sky, with a train approaching from the distance -- is emblematic of the opening of the book, which begins with a grown-up Scout's train ride from New York to her childhood home of Maycomb, Ala. According to HarperCollins, the book is a sequel to Lee's iconic novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" which was published in 1960 and has since become a classic of American literature. While \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is told from the perspective of Scout Finch as a young girl, \"Go Set a Watchman\" is set 20 years later and follows Scout as a grown woman, now known as Jean Louise, as she returns to her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama.\n\nThe new novel is expected to explore themes of racial tension, justice, and morality, which were central to \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" However, HarperCollins has also hinted that the book will delve deeper into the complexities of Scout's relationships with her family and friends, particularly her father, Atticus Finch, who is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and morally upright characters in American literature.\n\nIn a statement, HarperCollins said that \"Go Set a Watchman\" is a \"powerful and thought-provoking\" novel that will challenge readers to re-examine the issues of racial injustice and small-town life that were so prevalent in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" The book is set to be published on July 14, and fans of Lee's work are eagerly anticipating its release.\n\nThe publication of \"Go Set a Watchman\" has sparked widespread excitement and curiosity among book lovers and scholars alike. Many are wondering what new insights the book will offer into the characters and themes of \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" and whether it will offer a new perspective on the issues of racial tension and social justice that were so central to Lee's earlier work.\n\nHarperCollins has also announced that a companion book, \"The Making of Go Set a Watchman,\" will be published simultaneously with the novel. The companion book will feature essays and interviews with Lee, as well as archival materials and photographs that provide a behind-the-scenes look at the writing and publication of the book.\n\nFans of Lee's work can expect to see a number of promotional events and activities in the coming weeks, including book signings, readings, and discussions. The publication of \"Go Set a Watchman\" is sure to be a major literary event of the summer, and book lovers around the world are eagerly anticipating its release.",

Mexican Tomato Growers Agree to Price Hike and Compliance Measures to Avoid Trade War\n\nIn a move aimed at preventing a potential trade war, Mexican tomato growers have announced that they are willing to accept significant price increases for their products entering the United States. The agreement comes after months of tense negotiations between the two countries, which had threatened to disrupt the multi-billion-dollar tomato trade.\n\nUnder the new agreement, Mexican tomato growers will agree to a minimum price of $1.39 per pound, a significant increase from the current price of $0.93 per pound. The new price is expected to benefit American tomato growers, who have long complained that Mexican imports are undercutting their prices and threatening their livelihoods.\n\nIn addition to the price hike, the agreement also includes measures to bolster compliance and enforcement. The Mexican government has agreed to establish a system to ensure that all tomato imports meet U.S. safety and quality standards, which had been a major point of contention in the past.\n\nThe agreement was hailed as a major victory by U.S. tomato growers, who had been pushing for stricter regulations on Mexican imports. \"This agreement is a major step forward for American tomato growers,\" said Tom Johnson, president of the Florida Tomato Exchange. \"We are pleased that the Mexican government has agreed to take steps to ensure that their products meet our safety and quality standards.\"\n\nThe agreement is also expected to benefit Mexican tomato growers, who will benefit from the increased prices and the stability that comes with a more predictable market. \"This agreement is a win-win for both countries,\" said Carlos Morales, president of the Mexican Tomato Growers Association. \"We are pleased that we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement that will benefit both our farmers and our consumers.\"\n\nThe agreement is expected to go into effect in the coming weeks, and both countries are expected to work closely together to ensure a smooth transition. The agreement is seen as a major step forward in improving relations between the two countries, which had been strained in recent years over issues such as trade and immigration.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers can expect to see little change in the availability and price of tomatoes. The agreement is expected to have a minimal impact on the prices of tomatoes, and consumers can continue to expect to find a wide variety of tomatoes at their local grocery stores.",

Obesity: It's as American as a double serving of apple pie. That may be an exaggeration, but the reality is that the United States is exceptionally overweight.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one-third of adults in the US have obesity, which is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. This staggering statistic has far-reaching consequences for individuals, communities, and the healthcare system as a whole.\n\nThe causes of obesity are complex and multifaceted. A combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors contributes to the development of this chronic condition. In recent decades, the rise of processed and high-calorie foods, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, has led to an unprecedented increase in obesity rates.\n\nThe economic burden of obesity is significant. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that medical costs associated with obesity totaled over $147 billion in 2008. This figure is expected to continue to rise as the prevalence of obesity remains high.\n\nThe healthcare system is also feeling the strain of obesity. Hospitals and healthcare providers are seeing an increase in patients with obesity-related complications, such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. These conditions can lead to costly and lengthy hospital stays, as well as a reduced quality of life for patients.\n\nIn addition to the financial and healthcare implications, obesity also has a profound impact on individuals and communities. Obesity can lead to social isolation, low self-esteem, and decreased productivity. Children with obesity are more likely to experience bullying and social stigma, which can have long-term effects on their mental health and well-being.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by obesity, there is hope for change. Public health campaigns and initiatives aimed at promoting healthy eating and physical activity are underway across the country. Schools and workplaces are incorporating nutrition education and fitness programs into their curricula and policies.\n\nIndividuals can also take steps to reduce their risk of obesity. By incorporating healthy habits into daily life, such as regular exercise, balanced eating, and stress management, people can improve their overall health and well-being.\n\nAs the US continues to grapple with the issue of obesity, it is clear that a comprehensive approach is needed. By addressing the root causes of this complex condition and promoting healthy behaviors, we can work towards a future where obesity is no longer a defining characteristic of American culture.",

        "Text": "Facebook is reportedly building a standalone camera app, which is its fourth such attempt. The app will make it easy for users to jump between still photography, video recording and live video streaming, all presented through a Snapchat-style camera-first view, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Although it only in the early stages of development and may not even see launch, the app is intended to combat a decline in personal image and video sharing on the site, as well as prompt greater uptake of the company's Live Video feature. It follows three previous attempts by Facebook to make standalone camera apps. The new app, codenamed \"Presto,\" is expected to be a significant departure from Facebook's traditional approach to photography and video sharing. Instead of a traditional gallery-style view, the app will present users with a camera-first interface, similar to Snapchat's popular app. This design choice is intended to make it easier for users to capture and share moments from their daily lives, without the need to navigate through a cluttered gallery or album.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the project, Presto will allow users to seamlessly switch between still photography, video recording, and live video streaming, all from a single interface. This could be particularly appealing to users who want to share their experiences in real-time, such as vloggers, influencers, and event-goers.\n\nFacebook's decision to develop a standalone camera app is seen as a response to the declining use of personal image and video sharing on its platform. In recent years, users have increasingly turned to other social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, to share their visual content. By offering a more streamlined and user-friendly camera app, Facebook hopes to reverse this trend and encourage users to share more content on its platform.\n\nThe development of Presto is also seen as an attempt to promote greater uptake of Facebook's Live Video feature. Live video streaming has become increasingly popular on social media, and Facebook is keen to capitalize on this trend. By making it easier for users to create and share live content, Presto could help Facebook to regain its position as a leader in the social media space.\n\nWhile Presto is still in the early stages of development, Facebook is reportedly working closely with a team of developers and designers to refine the app's user interface and features. The company is also said to be exploring ways to monetize the app, potentially through the use of ads or sponsored content.\n\nIf Presto does launch, it will be Facebook's fourth attempt at creating a standalone camera app. The company's previous efforts, including the ill-fated \"Slingshot\" app, have been met with mixed results. However, with the rise of camera-first apps like Snapchat and TikTok, Facebook may have finally found the right formula for success. Only time will tell if Presto will be able to reverse the decline in personal image and video sharing on Facebook, and help the company to regain its position as a leader in the social media space.",

It was announced on Thursday that the Saatchi Gallery in London will be the only UK venue for a world tour of 150 original artefacts from Tutankhamun's tomb, 60 of which have never left Egypt before. The tour marks the upcoming centenary of the sensational discovery of the boy pharaoh's tomb by British explorer Howard Carter in 1922. Once the tour is complete, the treasures will be permanently displayed at the vast new Grand Egyptian Museum near the pyramids of Giza. The exhibition, titled \"Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh,\" promises to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for art and history enthusiasts alike. The 150 artefacts on display will include golden masks, precious jewels, and intricately carved sarcophagi, offering a unique glimpse into the life and legacy of the young pharaoh who ruled ancient Egypt from around 1332 to 1323 BCE.\n\nThe treasures will be transported to the Saatchi Gallery in a specially designed, climate-controlled container to ensure their safety and preservation. The gallery, known for its innovative exhibitions and cutting-edge technology, has undergone extensive renovations to accommodate the scale and grandeur of the Tutankhamun collection.\n\nAccording to Dr. Zahi Hawass, the former Egyptian Minister of Antiquities and curator of the exhibition, the tour is a significant cultural exchange between Egypt and the UK. \"This exhibition is a testament to the enduring fascination with ancient Egypt and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage,\" he said. \"We are thrilled to be sharing these treasures with the people of the UK and look forward to a successful and memorable tour.\"\n\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a range of interactive displays, educational programs, and workshops, allowing visitors to delve deeper into the history and significance of the artefacts on display. Visitors will also have the opportunity to explore a recreated tomb chamber, complete with authentic Egyptian architecture and artifacts.\n\nThe Saatchi Gallery's director, Rebecca Wilson, expressed her excitement about hosting the exhibition. \"We are honored to be a part of this groundbreaking project and to have the opportunity to showcase these incredible treasures to the people of the UK,\" she said. \"The exhibition promises to be a truly immersive and unforgettable experience, and we can't wait to share it with our visitors.\"\n\nThe \"Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh\" exhibition is set to run from March 2 to September 30, 2023, at the Saatchi Gallery in London.

The #deletefacebook movement took off after the revelations that Facebook had shared with a Cambridge psychologist the personal information of 50 million users, without their explicit consent, which later ended up in the hands of the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook makes it hard for users to delete their accounts, instead pushing them towards \"deactivation\", which leaves all personal data on the company's servers. When users ask to permanently delete their accounts, the company suggests: \"You may want to download a copy of your info from Facebook.\" The revelation has sparked outrage among Facebook users, who are now questioning the extent of the company's data collection practices. Many are taking to social media to share their own experiences of discovering just how much information Facebook has stored about them.\n\n\"I was shocked to find out that Facebook had a record of every single phone call I've made and text message I've sent,\" said Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old marketing professional who deleted her account last week. \"I had no idea they were collecting that kind of data. It's creepy and invasive.\"\n\nFacebook's data collection practices have long been a subject of controversy, but the Cambridge Analytica scandal has brought the issue to the forefront. The company has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability, and many are calling for greater regulation of the tech industry.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Facebook has announced plans to increase transparency around its data collection practices. The company will begin providing users with more information about the types of data it collects and how it uses that data.\n\n\"We understand that users have concerns about their data, and we are committed to being more transparent about how we collect and use that data,\" said a Facebook spokesperson. \"We are taking steps to increase transparency and accountability, and we will continue to work to earn back the trust of our users.\"\n\nHowever, many experts say that more needs to be done to protect user data. \"Facebook's data collection practices are a major concern, and the company needs to do more to ensure that users' personal information is protected,\" said Dr. Rachel Kim, a cybersecurity expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \"The Cambridge Analytica scandal is just the tip of the iceberg. We need to see more accountability and transparency from Facebook and other tech companies.\"\n\nAs the debate around Facebook's data collection practices continues to unfold, many users are left wondering what they can do to protect their own personal information. Experts recommend using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly reviewing and updating privacy settings.\n\nIn the meantime, the #deletefacebook movement shows no signs of slowing down. As more users delete their accounts and demand greater transparency from the company, it remains to be seen whether Facebook will be able to regain the trust of its users.",

Is there an easy way to tell if the cable television service is out for everybody or just at my own house because of equipment problems? ...or just at my own house because of equipment problems?\n\nIf you're wondering whether the cable television service is down for everyone or just at your own residence, there are a few steps you can take to find out. First, check your internet connection to see if it's also affected. If your internet is working fine but your TV is not, it's likely a issue with your cable provider's equipment or a problem with your TV itself.\n\nNext, try checking the status of your cable provider's service on their website or social media pages. Many providers, such as Comcast and AT&T, have dedicated pages or Twitter accounts that report outages and service disruptions. You can also check the provider's app or online portal to see if there are any notifications or alerts about outages in your area.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can try contacting your cable provider's customer service directly. They can usually tell you if there are any known outages in your area and provide an estimated time of resolution. You can also ask them to send a technician to your home to diagnose the issue and make any necessary repairs.\n\nIn some cases, the problem may not be with your cable provider's equipment, but rather with your own TV or equipment. If you've recently installed new equipment or changed your TV settings, it's possible that the issue is related to those changes. In this case, you may need to troubleshoot the issue with your TV or equipment manufacturer.\n\nIt's also a good idea to check your cable provider's terms of service to see if they have any policies in place for outages and service disruptions. Some providers may offer credits or refunds for customers who experience extended outages.\n\nBy taking these steps, you should be able to determine whether the cable television service is out for everybody or just at your own house.",

        "Text": "It is a 100% mortgage but not, thank goodness, as we once knew them. Lloyds Bank's new Lend a Hand mortgage offers first-time buyers the chance to borrow the entire price of their new home – but with the considerable caveat that a relative has to have a lump sum worth 10% that they are willing to tie up for three years, and have it raided if you miss any payments. So, first up: this is no use at all for anyone without a family member with a chunk of cash they don't need, willing to help them on to the housing ladder. But nor is it the return of the bumper mortgage market we saw in the run-up to the financial crash, where loans of up to 125% were available (leaving some borrowers trapped in negative equity after the downturn). Lloyds Bank's innovative mortgage solution aims to address the long-standing issue of saving for a deposit, which has been a significant barrier for many first-time buyers. By involving a relative with a lump sum, the bank hopes to make homeownership more accessible. However, it's essential to understand the terms and conditions of this mortgage before jumping into it.\n\nThe 10% contribution from the relative is not a gift, but rather a secured loan, which means it will be tied up for three years. If the borrower misses any payments, the relative's lump sum can be used to settle the debt. This adds an element of responsibility and accountability, as the borrower will need to ensure they make timely payments to avoid putting their relative's savings at risk.\n\nWhile this mortgage may not be suitable for everyone, it could be an attractive option for those who have a supportive family member with a spare sum of money. It's also worth noting that Lloyds Bank is not the only institution to offer such a product. Other lenders have introduced similar schemes, often with varying terms and conditions.\n\nThe introduction of Lend a Hand mortgage comes at a time when the UK housing market is experiencing a resurgence. According to recent data, the number of first-time buyers is on the rise, and the average deposit required for a mortgage has decreased. However, many experts still caution that the market remains challenging, particularly for those with limited financial resources.\n\nLloyds Bank's innovative mortgage solution is a step in the right direction, but it's crucial to recognize that it's not a panacea for the housing market's issues. The bank's move is likely to be closely watched by other lenders, and it will be interesting to see if similar products emerge in the coming months.\n\nIn conclusion, Lloyds Bank's Lend a Hand mortgage offers a unique solution for first-time buyers, but it's essential to carefully consider the terms and conditions before applying. While it may not be suitable for everyone, it could be a viable option for those with a supportive family member and a solid financial plan. As the housing market continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor the impact of innovative mortgage products like Lend a Hand and their potential to make homeownership more accessible.",

The retailer has teamed up with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders of more than £30 in interest-free instalments. The Australian firm and its better known rival Klarna are among a wave of fintech companies being embraced by millennials on tight budgets. Many of M&S's rivals, including H&M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shopper, including families with young children. M&S said its customers were increasingly looking for ways to spread the cost, particularly of larger purchases. The new service, which will be available on the Marks & Spencer website from November 1, will allow customers to pay for orders over £30 in four interest-free instalments. The retailer hopes that this will make its products more appealing to younger customers who are increasingly using \"buy now, pay later\" services.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the UK's Office for National Statistics, 22% of 18-24-year-olds have used a \"buy now, pay later\" service in the past, compared to just 5% of those aged 55 and over. This trend is likely to continue, with 75% of millennials saying they would be more likely to shop with a retailer that offers delayed payment options.\n\nMarks & Spencer's decision to offer \"buy now, pay later\" is part of a wider effort to appeal to younger customers. The retailer has also been investing in its online presence, including the launch of a new website and mobile app, and has been expanding its range of products to include more trendy and affordable items.\n\nThe company's efforts appear to be paying off, with Marks & Spencer reporting a 10% increase in online sales in the past year. The retailer is hoping that the new \"buy now, pay later\" service will help to drive even more growth in the coming months.\n\n\"We know that our customers are looking for more flexibility when it comes to paying for their purchases, particularly for larger items,\" said a spokesperson for Marks & Spencer. \"By partnering with Clearpay, we're able to offer our customers a convenient and interest-free way to pay for their orders, which we believe will be a major draw for younger shoppers.\"\n\nThe news is likely to be welcomed by Marks & Spencer's investors, who have been concerned about the retailer's declining sales in recent years. The company has been struggling to compete with online retailers such as Amazon and ASOS, which have been able to offer lower prices and a wider range of products.\n\nHowever, Marks & Spencer's decision to offer \"buy now, pay later\" may also raise concerns about the potential risks to the retailer's creditworthiness. Some analysts have warned that the rise of \"buy now, pay later\" services could lead to an increase in bad debts for retailers, particularly if customers are unable to pay their instalments on time.\n\nDespite these concerns, Marks & Spencer's move into \"buy now, pay later\" is likely to be seen as a necessary step to stay competitive in the increasingly crowded retail market. The retailer's rivals, including H&M and ASOS, have already been offering similar services, and Marks & Spencer would have been at a disadvantage if it had not followed suit.\n\nIn conclusion, Marks & Spencer's decision to offer \"buy now, pay later\" is a significant development in the retail industry, and is likely to have a major impact on the way that customers shop. The retailer's efforts to appeal to younger customers are likely to be successful, and the new service is likely to drive growth and increase customer loyalty. However, the potential risks to the retailer's creditworthiness will need to be carefully managed in order to ensure that the new service is a success.",

The F.T.C. said it was a record fine for a child privacy violation. The settlement marks a significant victory for the Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.) in its efforts to protect the privacy of children online. The agency had accused Musical.ly, which was acquired by ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, in 2018, of violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal information from children under the age of 13 without their parents' consent.\n\nAccording to the F.T.C., Musical.ly's app allowed users to create and share videos, but it also collected personal information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers from users without providing clear notice to parents or obtaining their consent. The agency also alleged that Musical.ly shared this information with third-party companies, including advertisers, without providing adequate protections to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nThe $5.7 million fine is the largest ever imposed by the F.T.C. for a child privacy violation, and it is a significant deterrent to other companies that may be considering similar violations. The settlement also requires Musical.ly to delete all personal information it collected from children under the age of 13, as well as implement new measures to ensure that it complies with COPPA in the future.\n\nThe F.T.C. Commissioner, Rohit Chopra, praised the settlement, saying that it \"sends a strong message to companies that they must prioritize the privacy and security of children's personal information.\" Chopra also emphasized the importance of COPPA, saying that it is \"a critical tool in our efforts to protect children from the risks of online data collection and exploitation.\"\n\nThe settlement is the latest in a series of actions taken by the F.T.C. to protect children's privacy online.

The article -- linking Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager and Trump confidant, to a Russian investment fund supposedly being investigated by the Senate -- was removed from CNN.com late last week after the network decided it could not fully stand by its reporting. The resignations are a black eye at a sensitive moment for the news organization, which has emerged as a regular target of Mr. Trump and his supporters. The president relishes dismissing the network's coverage as \"fake news,\" and his closest advisers have accused the channel of harboring a bias against Mr. Trump. The resignations, which were announced in a statement by CNN, came after an internal review of the article revealed several errors and inaccuracies. The article, which was published on June 19, claimed that Scaramucci had ties to the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), a state-run investment fund that has been accused of having ties to the Russian government.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, the article was based on a single anonymous source and did not undergo the usual rigorous fact-checking process before being published. The network has since acknowledged that the article was \"erroneous\" and apologized for any harm it may have caused to Scaramucci's reputation.\n\nThe resignations are a significant blow to CNN, which has faced intense scrutiny in recent months over its coverage of the Trump administration. The network has been a frequent target of criticism from the president and his supporters, who have accused it of being biased against Trump and his policies.\n\nThe resignations come as CNN is in the midst of a major overhaul of its editorial leadership. The network's president, Jeff Zucker, has been under pressure to address concerns about the network's credibility and impartiality, and the resignations are seen as a step in that direction.\n\nThe three journalists who resigned were all experienced reporters who had worked at CNN for several years. They were identified as Thomas Frank, a senior investigative reporter, and Eric Lichtblau and Lex Haris, both of whom were producers on the article.\n\nIn a statement, CNN acknowledged that the article was \"erroneous\" and apologized for any harm it may have caused. \"We take seriously our responsibility to report accurately and fairly, and we regret any harm our mistake may have caused,\" the statement read.\n\nThe incident is likely to raise questions about the network's editorial processes and its ability to withstand pressure from powerful sources. It also highlights the challenges facing journalists in today's media landscape, where the lines between fact and fiction are increasingly blurred.\n\nAs the debate over the role of journalism in modern society continues to rage, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of accuracy and accountability in reporting.

The company has received a complete response letter from the US Food and Drug Administration about its ZS-9 treatment for high potassium levels, outlining concerns which must be addressed to gain approval. It said it was evaluating the content of the letter, but Reuters reports some analysts as saying the drug's launch could be delayed until 2017 because of a manufacturing issue. AstraZeneca's ZS-9 treatment, also known as sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, was acquired as part of the company's $2.7 billion purchase of ZS Pharma in June 2015. The drug is designed to treat hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of potassium in the blood. This can occur in patients with kidney disease, heart failure, or those taking certain medications.\n\nThe complete response letter from the FDA outlines specific concerns that must be addressed before the drug can be approved. While AstraZeneca has not disclosed the exact nature of the concerns, analysts believe that a manufacturing issue may be the primary cause of the delay.\n\n\"We are evaluating the content of the letter and will work closely with the FDA to address the issues raised,\" said a spokesperson for AstraZeneca. \"We remain committed to bringing this important treatment to patients as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe delay is a setback for AstraZeneca, which had been expecting to launch ZS-9 in the US market later this year. The company had high hopes for the drug, which has shown promising results in clinical trials. In a statement, AstraZeneca said that it was \"confident in the potential of ZS-9 to improve the lives of patients with hyperkalemia.\"\n\nThe delay is also a blow to patients who were expecting to have access to the new treatment soon. Hyperkalemia is a serious condition that can cause a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue, and irregular heart rhythms. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications, including heart failure and even death.\n\nAstraZeneca is not the only company working on treatments for hyperkalemia. Other companies, including Relypsa and Akebia Therapeutics, are also developing drugs to address this condition. However, ZS-9 was seen as a potential game-changer due to its unique mechanism of action and potential to offer a new treatment option for patients.\n\nThe delay is likely to impact AstraZeneca's financial projections for the year. The company had expected to generate significant revenue from ZS-9 in the coming years. However, the delay will likely push back the launch of the drug, which could impact the company's financial performance.\n\nAstraZeneca's stock price fell by 2.5% in response to the news, as investors reacted to the delay. The company's shares have been under pressure in recent months due to a range of factors, including concerns about the impact of the Brexit vote on its business and the challenges it faces in the US market.\n\nDespite the setback, AstraZeneca remains committed to bringing ZS-9 to market. The company is working closely with the FDA to address the issues raised in the complete response letter and is confident that it can overcome the challenges and launch the drug in the near future.",

Money news Lloyds and Halifax customers face up to 52% APR overdraft fee Identity fraud reaching epidemic levels, new figures show UK rail fare rise 'will force key workers to quit city jobs' Second-home ownership up 30% since 2000, research finds Samsung TV buyers furious after software update leaves sets unusable Feature Getting to grips with a £32,220 student debt – and how you can lighten the load\nIn pictures Properties near airports\nIn the spotlight Going underground: the number of Britons digging basements has soared. As the cost of living continues to rise, many Britons are struggling to make ends meet, and a recent report has highlighted the alarming number of Lloyds and Halifax customers who are facing exorbitant overdraft fees. According to the data, some customers are being charged as much as 52% APR, a rate that is far higher than the average credit card interest rate.\n\nThis staggering figure has sparked concerns among financial experts, who warn that such high fees can have a devastating impact on individuals' financial stability. \"These fees are not only unfair but also unsustainable for many people,\" said Sarah Jones, a financial advisor at Moneywise. \"It's essential that banks take a closer look at their overdraft policies and consider implementing more reasonable rates.\"\n\nMeanwhile, identity fraud has reached epidemic levels, with new figures showing a significant surge in cases over the past year. The UK's National Crime Agency has reported a 20% increase in identity fraud, with many victims losing thousands of pounds as a result. \"Identity fraud is a serious crime that can have long-lasting consequences for its victims,\" said Detective Superintendent, James Smith. \"We urge everyone to be vigilant and take steps to protect their personal information.\"\n\nThe UK's rail network is also facing a major crisis, with fare rises set to force key workers out of city jobs. The latest figures show that rail fares have increased by 20% over the past five years, with many commuters facing significant price hikes. \"These fare rises are unsustainable for many key workers, including nurses, teachers, and emergency services personnel,\" said Rachel Johnson, a spokesperson for the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' Union. \"We urge the government to take action to address this issue and ensure that public transport remains affordable for all.\"\n\nIn other news, research has found that second-home ownership has increased by 30% since 2000, with many Britons opting for a second property as a holiday home or investment. However, this trend has raised concerns about the impact on the housing market and the availability of affordable homes for first-time buyers.\n\nFinally, Samsung TV buyers are furious after a recent software update left their sets unusable. The update, which was intended to improve the TV's functionality, has caused a range of problems, including freezing and crashing. Samsung has apologized for the issue and is working to resolve the problem as soon as possible.\n\nIn our feature this week, we explore the issue of student debt and offer tips on how to lighten the load. With the average student debt now standing at £32,220, many graduates are struggling to make ends meet. We speak to financial experts and students to get their take on the issue and offer advice on how to manage your debt.\n\nIn our picture gallery, we take a look at properties near airports, which are proving popular with commuters. And in our spotlight feature, we explore the trend of Britons digging basements, which has seen a significant increase in recent years.",

        "Text": "Why is that? There's an easy explanation for experiences like Ms. Miyawaki's, said William Hartmann, a physics professor at Michigan State University who specializes in acoustics and psychoacoustics. There are two pathways through which we perceive our own voice when we speak, he explained. One is the route through which we perceive most other sounds. According to Hartmann, the first pathway is the auditory pathway, which is responsible for processing external sounds, such as the voices of others. This pathway is responsible for detecting the physical properties of sound, such as pitch, volume, and tone, and sending that information to the brain for interpretation.\n\nHowever, when it comes to our own voice, there is a second pathway that is responsible for processing the sound of our own voice. This pathway is known as the \"vocal-tract pathway,\" and it is responsible for processing the sound of our own voice in a way that is unique to our own auditory experience.\n\n\"This pathway is responsible for the sensation of hearing our own voice in our head,\" Hartmann explained. \"It's a very different experience from hearing someone else's voice, because our brain is processing the sound of our own voice in a way that is specific to our own biology and physiology.\"\n\nSo, when we speak, our brain is processing the sound of our own voice through both the auditory pathway and the vocal-tract pathway. This can sometimes lead to a disconnect between what we think we sound like and what others hear, which can be the source of experiences like Ms. Miyawaki's.\n\nHartmann's research has shown that this disconnect can be attributed to a number of factors, including the fact that our brain is processing the sound of our own voice in a way that is unique to our own biology and physiology, and the fact that our brain is also processing the sound of our own voice in a way that is influenced by our emotions and expectations.\n\nFor example, if we are speaking in a situation where we feel anxious or self-conscious, our brain may process the sound of our own voice in a way that is more critical or negative, leading us to feel like we sound different than we think we do. On the other hand, if we are speaking in a situation where we feel confident and relaxed, our brain may process the sound of our own voice in a way that is more positive and affirming, leading us to feel like we sound more confident than we think we do.\n\nOverall, Hartmann's research suggests that the way we perceive our own voice is complex and multifaceted, and is influenced by a number of factors beyond just the physical properties of sound. By understanding these factors, we may be able to better understand why we sometimes experience a disconnect between what we think we sound like and what others hear.",

        "Text": "LOS ANGELES -- Apple is going to the movies. The company, which is set to unveil its Apple Plus TV streaming service on Nov. 1, will enter the film business this fall with theatrical releases of three movies it acquired this year, Apple said on Friday. The effort will expand in 2020, when Apple plans to start producing its own films, some of which are being made in conjunction with the independent movie studio A24, the producer behind \"Moonlight\" and \"Lady Bird,\" two people with knowledge of the company's plans said. Apple's foray into the film industry is a significant move, marking the company's first foray into theatrical releases. The three movies set to hit theaters this fall are part of Apple's acquisition of original content, which includes TV shows, movies, and documentaries. The company has been investing heavily in original content, with a reported budget of $1 billion for the first year alone.\n\nThe three movies, which have not been officially announced, are expected to be released in the coming months. Industry insiders suggest that they are a mix of dramas, comedies, and thrillers, catering to a wide range of audiences. Apple's move into film production is seen as a strategic play to expand its presence in the entertainment industry, which is increasingly shifting towards streaming and online content consumption.\n\nApple's partnership with A24, a highly respected independent movie studio, is a significant coup for the company. A24 has a reputation for producing critically acclaimed films, including \"Moonlight,\" which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2017, and \"Lady Bird,\" which received widespread critical acclaim. The partnership is expected to bring a level of quality and sophistication to Apple's film output, which could help the company stand out in a crowded market.\n\nIn 2020, Apple plans to take its film production to the next level, with a slate of original movies and TV shows. The company has already hired a number of high-profile filmmakers, including Oscar-winning director Damien Chazelle, who is set to direct a feature film for Apple. Other notable directors, such as Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg, are also rumored to be in talks with Apple to produce original content.\n\nApple's entry into the film industry is seen as a major challenge to established players in the market, including Netflix and Amazon Prime. The company's deep pockets and vast resources are expected to give it a significant advantage in the market, allowing it to attract top talent and produce high-quality content.\n\nHowever, some industry experts are cautioning that Apple's entry into the film industry may not be without its challenges. The company will need to navigate the complex and often cutthroat world of Hollywood, where relationships and reputation are key. Additionally, Apple will need to balance its desire to produce high-quality content with the need to make a profit, which could be a difficult balancing act.\n\nDespite these challenges, Apple's entry into the film industry is seen as a major coup for the company, and a significant development in the entertainment industry as a whole. With its vast resources and commitment to quality, Apple is likely to make a significant impact in the world of film, and could potentially disrupt the status quo in the industry.",

        "Text": "Re your article (One in five pupils granted more time to sit key exams, 22 November), if we are serious about inclusion and access for all, we must question the copious amounts of time spent testing children and young people to identify their \"abnormal\" needs for time, prior to taking written exams. Far better to accept that it is normal for everyone to work at different speeds, and to give everyone the time they need to do the task. The article highlights a pressing concern in the education system, where the emphasis on standardized testing can often lead to a one-size-fits-all approach that neglects the unique needs and abilities of individual students. The writer's suggestion to reevaluate the amount of time spent on testing and instead focus on providing a more inclusive and adaptive environment is a crucial step towards creating a more equitable education system.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of differentiated instruction and assessment, which acknowledges that students learn and process information at different rates and in different ways. This approach allows teachers to tailor their instruction and assessment methods to meet the diverse needs of their students, rather than trying to fit them into a rigid and inflexible framework.\n\nThe use of technology can also play a significant role in promoting greater inclusivity and accessibility in education. Online learning platforms and adaptive software can provide students with additional support and accommodations, such as text-to-speech functionality, speech-to-text capabilities, and customizable font sizes and colors. These tools can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, English language learners, and those who may require additional support due to socio-economic factors.\n\nMoreover, the emphasis on time-limited testing can also have a negative impact on student mental health and well-being. The pressure to perform well in a short amount of time can lead to increased stress and anxiety, which can have long-term consequences for students' academic and personal development.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer's call to reexamine the time spent on testing and focus on providing a more inclusive and adaptive education system is a timely and important one. By acknowledging that everyone learns and works at different speeds, and providing the necessary support and accommodations, we can create a more equitable and effective education system that benefits all students.",

        "Text": "Julian Assange was too ill to appear by video link for the latest hearing in relation to his possible extradition to the US, lawyers for the WikiLeaks founder told a court. The hearing was the first since 2 May, when lawyers for the US government began pressing its case to extradite him to face trial for what they described as one the largest compromises of classified information in history. However, his solicitor Gareth Peirce told a judge at Westminster magistrates court in London on Thursday that Assange was too ill to appear by video link from prison. The date for the next hearing was confirmed as 12 June. The development comes as a surprise to many, given the high-profile nature of the case and the intense media scrutiny surrounding it. Assange, 50, has been held in Belmarsh Prison in London since his arrest in April 2019, when he was taken into custody for failing to surrender to a British court.\n\nAccording to reports, Assange's health has been a subject of concern for some time, with his lawyers citing issues related to his mental and physical well-being. In recent months, he has been treated in a hospital for a variety of ailments, including a heart condition and a condition known as tachycardia, which is characterized by an abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nAssange's solicitor, Gareth Peirce, told the court that his client's health was \"deteriorating\" and that he was not well enough to participate in the hearing via video link. Peirce did not provide further details about Assange's condition, but it is understood that his lawyers are seeking to have him released from prison to receive medical treatment.\n\nThe US government has accused Assange of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer and release classified information about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The charges against him carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison, making it one of the most serious cases of its kind in recent history.\n\nAssange's lawyers have argued that the charges against him are politically motivated and that he is being targeted for his role in publishing classified information. They have also raised concerns about the potential consequences of extraditing him to the US, where he could face harsh treatment and potentially even the death penalty.\n\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on June 12, and it is expected to be a crucial moment in the legal battle over Assange's extradition. In the meantime, his lawyers will continue to push for his release from prison and for the US government to drop its extradition request.\n\nThe case has sparked widespread debate and controversy, with many arguing that Assange's actions were justified and that he is being unfairly targeted by the US government. Others have criticized his actions, saying that he put national security at risk and that his actions were illegal.\n\nRegardless of one's views on the matter, it is clear that the fate of Julian Assange hangs in the balance. As the legal battle continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the WikiLeaks founder and what the implications will be for freedom of speech and the protection of sources.",

We are students and former students on the internationally renowned counselling programme at the University of East Anglia. As we navigate the complex landscape of party manifestos and campaign promises, it's easy to get swept up in the rhetoric surrounding mental health. But as students and former students of the University of East Anglia's internationally renowned counselling programme, we've seen firsthand the stark reality of mental health support on the ground.\n\nWhile politicians are quick to tout their commitment to mental health, the truth is that many of these promises are vague and lack concrete action. We've witnessed students struggling to access counselling services, only to be told that the waiting list is months long. We've seen students forced to take time off from their studies due to mental health issues, only to be met with uncertainty and lack of support when they try to return.\n\nThe University of East Anglia's counselling programme is one of the best in the country, but even here, we've seen the cracks begin to show. Funding cuts and increased student numbers have led to a shortage of trained counsellors, leaving many students without the support they desperately need.\n\nIt's not just the universities that are struggling. Local mental health services are also feeling the strain. We've spoken to GPs and mental health professionals who are overwhelmed by the demand for their services, and are struggling to provide the level of care that patients deserve.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the electorate? It means that when you're making your decision at the ballot box, you need to look beyond the soundbites and empty promises. You need to ask the tough questions about how each party plans to support mental health, and what concrete actions they're willing to take.\n\nAs students and former students of the University of East Anglia's counselling programme, we're not asking for much. We're asking for a commitment to increasing funding for mental health services, to reducing waiting times for counselling, and to providing more support for students struggling with mental health issues.\n\nWe're not asking for a magic solution, but we are asking for a recognition that mental health is a serious issue that requires serious action. And we're asking the parties to take responsibility for the promises they're making, and to provide a clear plan for how they'll make a difference.\n\nSo, as you head to the polls, don't be fooled by the rhetoric. Look for the parties that are willing to put their money where their mouth is, and to take concrete action to support mental health. The future of our mental health depends on it.",

Waymo, the self-driving car unit that operates under Google's parent company, has signed a deal with the ride-hailing start-up Lyft, according to two people familiar with the agreement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The deal calls for the companies to work together to bring autonomous vehicle technology into the mainstream through pilot projects and product development efforts, these people said. The deal was confirmed by Lyft and Waymo. The partnership between Waymo and Lyft marks a significant milestone in the development of self-driving technology, as the two companies aim to bring autonomous vehicles to the masses. The collaboration will focus on pilot projects and product development efforts, with the goal of making self-driving cars a reality on public roads.\n\nAccording to sources, the deal will enable Waymo to tap into Lyft's extensive network of drivers and riders, allowing the company to test and refine its autonomous technology in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, Lyft will benefit from Waymo's expertise in developing and deploying self-driving vehicles, gaining access to cutting-edge technology that can be integrated into its ride-hailing platform.\n\nThe partnership is seen as a major coup for both companies, as they seek to outmaneuver competitors in the self-driving space. Waymo, which has been at the forefront of autonomous vehicle development, has been working on its self-driving technology for over a decade. Lyft, on the other hand, has been expanding its ride-hailing services to include autonomous vehicles, with the goal of reducing accidents and improving safety on the roads.\n\nIndustry analysts believe that the partnership will accelerate the development of self-driving technology, making it more accessible and affordable for consumers. \"This partnership is a game-changer for the self-driving industry,\" said John Hanson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. \"By combining their expertise and resources, Waymo and Lyft will be able to push the boundaries of what is possible with autonomous vehicles.\"\n\nThe deal is also seen as a major win for the city of San Francisco, which has been at the forefront of the autonomous vehicle revolution. The city has been working to create a regulatory framework for self-driving cars, and the partnership between Waymo and Lyft is seen as a major step forward in that effort.\n\nAs the partnership between Waymo and Lyft moves forward, it is likely to have far-reaching implications for the transportation industry as a whole. With the goal of making self-driving cars a reality on public roads, the two companies are poised to revolutionize the way we travel, making it safer, more efficient, and more convenient for consumers.",

LONDON -- Jeremy Clarkson has reached the end of the road, at least with the BBC.\n\nIn a shocking move, the BBC announced on Wednesday that it has parted ways with the popular TV presenter and journalist, effective immediately. Clarkson, best known for hosting the hit show \"Top Gear,\" has been a staple of British television for over a decade.\n\nThe decision comes after an investigation into a physical altercation between Clarkson and a producer on the set of \"Top Gear\" in March. The incident, which resulted in the producer sustaining a minor injury, led to a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the event.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, Clarkson was involved in a heated argument with producer Oisin Tymon over a lack of catering options during a filming break. The situation escalated, and Clarkson allegedly punched Tymon, resulting in the producer requiring hospital treatment.\n\nThe BBC launched an internal investigation into the incident, which concluded that Clarkson's behavior was \"unacceptable\" and \"not in line with the BBC's values.\" The corporation ultimately decided that Clarkson's contract would not be renewed, bringing an end to his 16-year tenure with the BBC.\n\nClarkson, who has been a dominant force in British television, has faced criticism in the past for his controversial comments and behavior. However, his popularity and influence have remained undiminished, making him a highly sought-after talent in the entertainment industry.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the future holds for Clarkson, but sources suggest that he is already fielding offers from rival networks and production companies. With his reputation for being a shrewd businessman, it is likely that Clarkson will bounce back from this setback and continue to entertain audiences around the world.\n\nIn the meantime, the BBC has announced that it will be launching a new motoring program, with a new presenter set to take the helm. The move is seen as an attempt to revitalize the corporation's motoring offerings and capitalize on the popularity of \"Top Gear.\"\n\nThe departure of Clarkson marks the end of an era for the BBC, but it also presents an opportunity for the corporation to reinvent itself and attract a new generation of viewers.

It was 2000, I was 24, making less than $30,000 a year, and the American Airlines Citibank Card was the first I'd ever had. It was shiny and silver, with the old airline logo at the top. As I gazed at the statement, a sense of unease crept over me. I had always been diligent about keeping track of my finances, making sure to pay my bills on time and keep my credit score in check. But now, it seemed that I had made a mistake of monumental proportions.\n\nI racked my brain, trying to recall the details of the application process. I remembered sitting in the Citibank branch, surrounded by the hum of fluorescent lights and the murmur of hushed conversations. I had filled out the application form, answering questions about my income, employment history, and credit history. And then, I had signed on the dotted line, hoping that I had made the right decision.\n\nBut now, as I stared at the statement, I realized that I had made a critical error. The interest rate on the card was significantly higher than I had expected, and the minimum payment was astronomical. I felt a wave of panic wash over me as I thought about the impact this could have on my financial future.\n\nI quickly called the customer service number, hoping to get some answers. After being put on hold for what felt like an eternity, a representative finally answered. I explained the situation, and they assured me that the rate was correct and that I had indeed signed the agreement.\n\nFeeling frustrated and defeated, I hung up the phone and began to research ways to pay off the debt. I scoured the internet for tips and tricks, trying to find a solution to my financial crisis. And then, I stumbled upon a little-known secret: the credit card companies were required to provide a 30-day interest-free period for new accounts.\n\nWith newfound hope, I called Citibank again and asked to speak to a supervisor. This time, I was able to negotiate a lower interest rate and a more manageable payment plan. It was a small victory, but it was a start.\n\nAs I looked back on the experience, I realized that it was a valuable lesson. I had learned the importance of carefully reading and understanding the terms of any agreement before signing on the dotted line. And I had learned that even in the face of adversity, there is always hope for a solution.\n\nThe American Airlines Citibank Card may have been my first credit card, but it was also a valuable learning experience that has stayed with me to this day.",

LOS ANGELES -- The debate over race in Hollywood edged its way into the legal system by way of a judge's order, as a federal judge on Wednesday ruled that the Writers Guild of America (WGA) must include more diverse writers in its database of eligible writers for television and film projects.\n\nU.S. District Judge Andre Birotte Jr. issued the ruling in response to a lawsuit filed by the WGA's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which alleged that the guild's database was disproportionately dominated by white writers. The committee claimed that this lack of diversity was resulting in a lack of opportunities for writers of color, leading to a lack of representation on screen.\n\nThe WGA has long been criticized for its lack of diversity, with many writers of color citing difficulties in getting hired or getting their work produced. The guild has made efforts to address this issue in recent years, but the lawsuit argued that these efforts were insufficient.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Birotte ordered the WGA to increase the number of writers of color in its database, and to implement new procedures for verifying the diversity of its membership. The guild must also provide regular reports to the court on its progress in achieving these goals.\n\nThe WGA has stated that it is committed to increasing diversity and inclusion in the industry, and has already begun taking steps to address the issue. The guild has established a diversity and inclusion committee, and has implemented programs to encourage writers of color to join the organization.\n\nHowever, some writers of color have expressed skepticism about the guild's commitment to diversity, and have called for more concrete action to address the issue. The ruling is seen as a major step forward in addressing the lack of diversity in Hollywood, but many believe that more needs to be done to achieve true parity.\n\nThe ruling has also sparked debate about the role of the WGA in promoting diversity and inclusion in the industry. Some have argued that the guild has a responsibility to take a more active role in promoting diversity, while others have argued that the guild's primary responsibility is to its members, regardless of their background.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the ruling is a significant step forward in the ongoing debate about race in Hollywood. As the industry continues to grapple with issues of diversity and inclusion, the WGA's efforts to increase diversity in its database will be closely watched by writers, producers, and studios alike.",

The problem first emerged in January and, until now, Tesco has claimed to be working on a fix. But it has just announced via Twitter that \"Hudl 1 and the first edition Hudl 2 have reached the end of life. This means the update that has been put in place will not fix the issue you're seeing, we're afraid.\" Tesco's Decision Leaves Hudl Tablet Users Frustrated and Disappointed\n\nThe announcement by Tesco that it has withdrawn software support for its Hudl tablets has left many users feeling frustrated and disappointed. The issue, which first emerged in January, has been ongoing for several months, with Tesco promising a fix. However, the company's latest statement via Twitter has confirmed that the problem is now irreversible.\n\nThe Hudl tablets, which were launched in 2013, were popular among budget-conscious consumers looking for an affordable Android-based tablet. Despite their popularity, the devices have now reached the end of their life, according to Tesco. This means that users will no longer receive software updates, and the tablets will no longer be supported by the company.\n\nThe decision to withdraw support has left many users feeling abandoned and without a solution to the problem. The issue, which affects both the Hudl 1 and the first edition Hudl 2, means that users who try to restore their tablets to factory settings will find that they are unable to restart the device. This makes the tablets effectively useless, leaving users with no choice but to consider purchasing a new device.\n\nTesco's decision to withdraw support has also raised questions about the company's commitment to its customers. The retailer has been criticized in the past for its handling of customer complaints and issues with its products. This latest development is likely to further erode trust in the company among its customers.\n\nIn a statement, Tesco apologized for the inconvenience caused to its customers and acknowledged that the decision to withdraw support was not taken lightly. However, the company has not provided any further details on what it plans to do to support its customers who are affected by the issue.\n\nThe withdrawal of support for the Hudl tablets is a significant blow to Tesco's reputation and is likely to have a negative impact on the company's sales. The incident highlights the importance of manufacturers providing ongoing support for their products and the need for companies to prioritize customer satisfaction.\n\nIn the meantime, users who are affected by the issue are advised to seek assistance from Tesco's customer service team. However, it remains to be seen whether the company will be able to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem.",

Billed as the newspaper for the 48% of the UK that voted to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum, the New European's first edition is thought to have sold more than 40,000 copies. Subsequent issues have also sold well, leading publisher Archant to decide to continue producing it on a rolling basis, though the company has made it clear it will pull the plug if interest wanes. The decision to continue publishing the New European comes as a welcome surprise to many Remain supporters who have been eager to see a dedicated voice for the pro-EU movement in the UK media landscape. The newspaper's success is attributed to its unique blend of news, analysis, and opinion pieces, which have resonated with readers across the country.\n\nArchant, the publisher of the New European, has praised the newspaper's team for their hard work and dedication in producing a high-quality product that has captured the imagination of readers. \"We are thrilled to announce that the New European will continue to be a part of the UK's media landscape,\" said a spokesperson for Archant. \"The response to the newspaper has been overwhelming, and we are confident that it will continue to be a valuable platform for pro-EU voices.\"\n\nThe New European's editor, Matt Kelly, has also expressed his delight at the news, saying that the team is \"buzzing\" with excitement. \"We knew that there was a huge appetite for a pro-EU newspaper, and it's fantastic to see that our readers have responded so positively,\" he said. \"We're looking forward to continuing to produce a newspaper that reflects the views and values of the 48% who voted to remain in the EU.\"\n\nThe newspaper's success has also been praised by pro-EU campaigners, who see it as a vital tool in the fight to protect the UK's relationship with the EU. \"The New European is a beacon of hope for those of us who believe that the UK should remain a part of the EU,\" said a spokesperson for the Remain campaign. \"We are thrilled to see a newspaper that is dedicated to promoting a positive and constructive relationship between the UK and the EU.\"\n\nDespite the positive news, the New European's publisher has made it clear that the newspaper's future is not guaranteed. \"We will continue to monitor the newspaper's sales and circulation figures, and if interest begins to wane, we will not hesitate to make the difficult decision to pull the plug,\" said a spokesperson for Archant. \"However, for now, we are confident that the New European will continue to be a valuable and important part of the UK's media landscape.\"",

Haji-Ioannou, who has also been a longstanding critic of management at the EasyJet airline he founded, called a general meeting to immediately dismiss Fastjet's chief executive, Ed Winter, and remove another director, Krista Bates, from the main board, citing concerns over costs. Winter last month announced he would step down as chief executive, pending a successor being found, but a spokesman for Haji-Ioannou, who owns a 12% stake and helped set up the Tanzania-based airline, said it was time for a \"clean break\". Haji-Ioannou's demand for the removal of Fastjet's directors comes amid concerns over the airline's financial performance and management structure. In a statement, Haji-Ioannou's spokesman said that the company's current leadership has failed to address the airline's cost issues, which have led to significant losses in recent years.\n\n\"Fastjet's financial performance has been disappointing, and the current management has not been able to turn things around,\" the spokesman said. \"Sir Stelios believes that a clean break is needed to bring in fresh leadership and a new approach to address the company's challenges.\"\n\nHaji-Ioannou's criticism of Fastjet's management is not new. He has been a vocal critic of the airline's leadership for some time, and has previously called for changes to the company's strategy and management structure.\n\nFastjet's current chief executive, Ed Winter, announced last month that he would be stepping down from the role, pending the appointment of a successor. However, Haji-Ioannou's demand for his immediate removal suggests that the company's major shareholder is not satisfied with the pace of change.\n\nThe removal of Krista Bates, another director, from the main board is also seen as a significant move. Bates has been a member of Fastjet's board since 2015 and has played a key role in the airline's development.\n\nFastjet's shares fell sharply on the news, with the airline's stock price dropping by over 10% in early trading. The airline's financial performance has been under pressure in recent years, with losses reported in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe company's financial struggles have been attributed to a range of factors, including increased competition in the African aviation market, rising fuel costs, and operational challenges.\n\nFastjet's board of directors has yet to comment on Haji-Ioannou's demands, but the company is expected to respond in the coming days. The situation is likely to be closely watched by investors and industry observers, who will be keen to see how the dispute is resolved and what impact it may have on the airline's future prospects.",

Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, has written to the Facebook founder after suspicions that Russian \"actors\" used the platform to interfere in British politics. Facebook has 32 million users in Britain. Similar evidence on the 2016 US presidential election has already been supplied by Facebook to several US Senate committees, including the Senate intelligence committee, before a hearing with legal representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google on 1 November in Washington DC. Facebook in the US disclosed last month that an influence operation that appeared to be based in Russia spent $100,000 (£75,000) on adverts to promote divisive political and social messages over a two-year period. Collins' letter to Zuckerberg requests that Facebook provide any evidence it may have of Russian-linked accounts being used to influence the EU referendum in 2016 and the general election in 2017. The inquiry is seeking to understand the extent to which social media platforms, including Facebook, were used to spread disinformation and propaganda during these elections.\n\nThe letter also asks Facebook to provide information on the number of users who may have been exposed to these Russian-backed advertisements, as well as any attempts made by the company to flag or remove these ads. Collins has given Facebook until November 20th to respond to his request.\n\nThe inquiry into \"fake news\" is a timely one, given the growing concerns about the impact of social media on democracy. The use of social media to spread disinformation and propaganda has been linked to several high-profile political events in recent years, including the 2016 US presidential election and the 2016 Brexit referendum.\n\nFacebook has already faced criticism for its role in allowing Russian-linked accounts to spread disinformation on its platform. In September, the company announced that it had removed 32 pages and accounts that were linked to a Russian \"troll farm\" and were using Facebook to spread disinformation.\n\nThe company has also faced criticism for its slow response to the issue. In October, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, admitted that the company had made mistakes in its handling of the issue and promised to do more to prevent the spread of disinformation on its platform.\n\nThe inquiry is likely to put pressure on Facebook to take more action to prevent the spread of disinformation on its platform. The company has already announced plans to increase its transparency around political advertising, but many critics argue that more needs to be done to prevent the spread of disinformation.\n\nThe inquiry is also likely to put pressure on other social media companies, including Twitter and Google, to take more action to prevent the spread of disinformation on their platforms. The three companies are scheduled to testify before the Senate intelligence committee on November 1st in Washington DC.\n\nThe inquiry is a significant development in the ongoing debate about the role of social media in democracy. As the use of social media becomes increasingly widespread, there is growing concern about the impact of disinformation and propaganda on political events. The inquiry is likely to shed more light on the issue and put pressure on social media companies to take more action to prevent the spread of disinformation.",

But before the offering kindness part, she swerved into racial commentary that led to her being fired on Wednesday. She was responding to a shooting at a backyard party on March 9 in Wilkinsburg, Pa., that killed five people, including a pregnant woman. No one has been arrested, and the police have not yet publicly identified suspects. Yet in her Facebook post on March 21, which was later edited and eventually deleted, Ms. Bell played detective in a way that some felt relied on damaging stereotypes. The post, which was shared by Ms. Bell on her personal Facebook page, sparked widespread outrage and criticism from the community. In the post, Ms. Bell described the shooting as a \"black on black\" crime, using a term that many saw as perpetuating harmful stereotypes about African Americans. She also made assumptions about the victims and the perpetrators, without providing any concrete evidence or facts.\n\nThe post quickly went viral, with many people expressing their disgust and disappointment on social media. The Pittsburgh chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists issued a statement condemning Ms. Bell's comments, saying that they were \"hurtful, inaccurate, and irresponsible.\"\n\nWTAE-TV, the television station where Ms. Bell worked as a news anchor, initially stood by her, saying that she had the right to express her opinions on her personal social media page. However, as the backlash continued to grow, the station ultimately decided to fire Ms. Bell on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, the station said that Ms. Bell's comments \"do not align with the values of WTAE-TV\" and that they \"do not condone or support harmful or divisive rhetoric.\" The statement also acknowledged that Ms. Bell's actions had caused harm to many people in the community.\n\nThe firing of Ms. Bell has sparked a wider conversation about the importance of responsible journalism and the need for news anchors and reporters to be mindful of the impact of their words. Many are calling for greater diversity and inclusion in the media, and for journalists to be more thoughtful and nuanced in their reporting.\n\nThe incident also highlights the need for news organizations to have clear policies and guidelines for their employees' social media use. While Ms. Bell's post was made on her personal page, it still reflected poorly on the station and its values.\n\nAs the investigation into the Wilkinsburg shooting continues, many are hoping for a swift and just resolution.

I used to rejoice as I walked through the municipal gardens near my home as we learned about the need for \"capacity building\" in the developing world. How grateful I was for all the local municipal provision that we lived with here: the parks, halls, toilets, youth centres, libraries. With central-government austerity policies (Cuts at catastrophic level, says Birmingham council chief, 13 December), they are now all vanishing, or hard-pressed local volunteers are struggling to deal with community-asset transfer, taking over the running and the management of such amenities, if they are not sold off to unaccountable private companies. As I reflect on my time in Leeds, I am struck by the stark contrast between the ideals we learned about in our peace and development program and the harsh reality that has unfolded over the past decade. The notion of \"capacity building\" in the developing world seemed like a noble pursuit, but it appears that the same principles are not being applied in our own backyard.\n\nThe municipal gardens that I once strolled through with such pride are now a distant memory, replaced by a landscape of uncertainty and decline. The very same parks, halls, toilets, youth centers, and libraries that we took for granted are disappearing, or struggling to stay afloat under the weight of austerity measures.\n\nThe consequences of these cuts are far-reaching and devastating. Not only do they erode the social fabric of our communities, but they also disproportionately affect the most vulnerable members of society. Children who once had access to safe and welcoming youth centers now find themselves with nowhere to turn. Elderly residents who relied on libraries for social connection and mental stimulation are left feeling isolated and forgotten.\n\nThe transfer of community assets to private companies has also raised concerns about accountability and transparency. Who is accountable for the maintenance and upkeep of these amenities? Who is responsible for ensuring that they are accessible to all members of the community? The lack of clear answers to these questions is a worrying trend that threatens to undermine the very fabric of our society.\n\nAs we look to the future, it is imperative that we re-examine our priorities and recommit to investing in our communities. We must recognize that the value of these amenities extends far beyond their monetary worth, and that they are essential to building strong, resilient, and connected communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the erosion of our municipal provision is a stark reminder of the need for a fundamental shift in our approach to governance and community development. We must work together to build a future that values the well-being of all members of society, and that recognizes the importance of community assets in fostering a sense of belonging and connection.",

The move follows a petition filed in 2010 by Jane Goodall, The Humane Society of the United States and other groups to eliminate a longstanding distinction between the legal status of captive chimpanzees, which were previously listed as \"threatened,\" and their wild counterparts, which have been deemed \"endangered\" for decades. According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the reclassification of chimpanzees is a significant step towards ensuring the long-term survival of the species. The agency cited declining populations, habitat loss, and poaching as major threats to the chimpanzees' well-being.\n\nThe decision comes after a thorough review of the species' status, which included input from scientists, conservationists, and the public. The Humane Society of the United States, which was one of the original petitioners, welcomed the news, stating that it was a \"victory for animal welfare and conservation.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that the US Fish and Wildlife Service has recognized the urgent need to protect all chimpanzees, regardless of their captivity status,\" said Kitty Block, CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. \"This is a critical step towards ensuring the survival of these intelligent and social animals.\"\n\nThe reclassification is expected to have significant implications for the treatment and care of chimpanzees in captivity.

And a barnacle called Sacculina carcini castrates crabs, roots itself into their bodies and brains and transforms them into walking zombie slaves that care for the parasite's brood as if it were their own. Parasites are bad -- except when they're not. In recent years, the study of parasites has gained significant attention in the scientific community, shedding light on the complex relationships between these tiny creatures and their hosts. While many parasites are notorious for causing harm to their hosts, some have evolved to play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems and even benefiting their hosts in unexpected ways.\n\nOne example of this is the relationship between the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and its feline host. As mentioned earlier, Toxoplasma gondii has been known to eliminate a mouse's fear of cats, making them more susceptible to predation. However, this seemingly sinister behavior may actually be an adaptation to ensure the parasite's own survival. You see, Toxoplasma gondii needs to complete its life cycle by infecting a cat, where it can reproduce and produce oocysts that can then infect other hosts.\n\nIn this sense, the parasite's manipulation of the mouse's behavior can be seen as a clever strategy to increase its chances of transmission. This phenomenon has sparked interest in the field of evolutionary biology, with researchers seeking to understand the intricate mechanisms that drive the evolution of such complex relationships.\n\nAnother fascinating example of parasites playing a beneficial role is the relationship between the fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis and the carpenter ant Camponotus leonardi. The fungus infects the ant's body, eventually killing it, but not before causing the ant to climb to a high location and bite onto a leaf, allowing the fungus to produce spores that can spread to other ants. This peculiar behavior has led scientists to nickname the fungus the \"zombie fungus\" due to its ability to control the ant's actions.\n\nDespite the seemingly sinister nature of this relationship, the fungus plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients. In fact, some researchers have suggested that the fungus may even be responsible for creating \"ant cemeteries\" that serve as nutrient-rich hotspots for other organisms.\n\nThese examples highlight the complex and often surprising ways in which parasites interact with their hosts. While some parasites are undoubtedly harmful, others have evolved to play a vital role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems and even benefiting their hosts in unexpected ways. As scientists continue to study these fascinating relationships, we may uncover even more surprising examples of parasites that are \"bad\" in the classical sense, but ultimately \"good\" for the greater good.",

The class action lawsuit comes the same week that Curt Schilling accused ESPN of a culture of racism. Schilling was recently fired from his role as a commentator at the sports channel after making transphobic comments on Facebook. Racism in the media is often linked to a lack of diversity within the industry. And accusations that the workforce in US media doesn't represent the population are nothing new. In 1968, analyzing protests about the treatment of racial minorities, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders claimed that \"the media report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world\", adding \"fewer than 5% of the people employed by the news business in editorial jobs in the United States today are Negroes.\" The lawsuit filed by the two New York Times employees is seeking compensation for alleged discriminatory practices within the company, including age, race, and gender-based biases. The complaint cites instances of unequal treatment, such as unequal pay, limited opportunities for advancement, and a lack of representation in senior leadership positions.\n\nThe lawsuit is not an isolated incident, as the media industry has long been criticized for its lack of diversity. Despite efforts to increase representation, the numbers remain stark. According to a 2020 report by the Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative at the University of Maryland, people of color make up only 12.4% of newsroom employees in the United States, while women hold just 37.6% of those positions.\n\nThe issue is not limited to the news industry, as the entertainment and sports sectors have also faced similar criticisms. The recent controversy surrounding Curt Schilling's comments on Facebook highlights the ongoing problem of racism in the media. Schilling's comments were widely condemned, and his subsequent firing from ESPN was seen as a necessary step to address the issue.\n\nThe lack of diversity in the media industry can have far-reaching consequences. When news is reported and presented through a narrow lens, it can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce existing biases. This can lead to a lack of representation and understanding of marginalized communities, which can further exacerbate social and economic inequalities.\n\nIn recent years, there have been some efforts to increase diversity in the media industry. Many news organizations have implemented diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as training programs and mentorship schemes. Some companies have also made public commitments to increase representation and hiring practices.\n\nHowever, more needs to be done to address the systemic issues that contribute to the lack of diversity in the media industry. The lawsuit filed by the two New York Times employees is a step in the right direction, and it highlights the need for greater accountability and transparency within the industry.\n\nUltimately, a more diverse and inclusive media industry is essential for creating a more equitable and just society. By addressing the systemic issues that contribute to the lack of representation, we can work towards a future where all voices are heard and valued.",

Samuel Smith Old Brewery, which was founded in Tadcaster in 1758, was asked to provide details of its pensions in 2015. The Pension Regulator (TPR) wanted to ensure the Yorkshire-based brewer and pub owner was earning enough money to support the final-salary pension schemes of more than 2,000 employees. However, the brewery owner, Humphrey Smith, 73, wrote back and dismissed the request as \"tiresome\". The Pension Regulator (TPR) took the matter to court, citing the brewery's failure to comply with its obligations under the Pensions Act 2008. The court subsequently ordered the brewery to provide the required documents, but Samuel Smith Old Brewery continued to resist, claiming that the request was \"unnecessary\" and \"intrusive\".\n\nThe TPR's investigation revealed that the brewery had failed to provide any information about its pension scheme, including details of its funding, investment strategy, and administration costs. This lack of transparency made it impossible for the regulator to assess the scheme's financial health and ensure that it was providing adequate benefits to its members.\n\nIn addition to the fine, the court also ordered Samuel Smith Old Brewery to pay the TPR's legal costs, which totaled over £10,000. The brewery's chairman, Humphrey Smith, was also ordered to pay a personal fine of £5,000 for his role in the breach.\n\nThe TPR's enforcement director, Nicola Parish, said that the case highlighted the importance of transparency and compliance in the pensions industry. \"Employers have a legal duty to provide information about their pension schemes, and we will take action against those who fail to do so,\" she said.\n\nThe fine is the latest in a series of penalties imposed by the TPR on employers who have failed to comply with their pension obligations. In recent years, the regulator has taken action against a number of high-profile companies, including British Airways and the Co-operative Group, for similar breaches.\n\nThe case has also raised concerns about the impact of the fine on the brewery's employees, who are now left wondering about the future of their pension scheme. \"We are deeply disappointed that the brewery has chosen to ignore its obligations to its employees,\" said a spokesperson for the TPR. \"We will continue to work with the brewery to ensure that its pension scheme is properly funded and managed.\"\n\nIn response to the fine, Samuel Smith Old Brewery has issued a statement apologizing for any inconvenience caused and promising to work with the TPR to resolve the issue. However, the brewery has not commented on the specific allegations made against it or the reasons behind its failure to provide the required documents.\n\nThe case serves as a reminder of the importance of compliance with pension regulations and the consequences of failing to do so.

        "Text": "Shareholders appear to have blocked a pay rise for Alison Cooper, chief executive of Imperial Brands, in a move that may affect other FTSE 100 companies aiming to hike the bonuses of their bosses. The maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes issued an unexpected announcement to the stock exchange on Thursday to say it would not put its new pay policy to a vote as originally planned at the annual meeting on 1 February. The policy, which must be voted on every three years, would have had the effect of increasing Cooper's pay from £5.5m to a potential £8.5m a year from increased bonus opportunities. The move demonstrates that the company did not expect to win overwhelming support for the proposal from investors. The decision by ISS, the proxy voting agency which is influential with major US investors, to recommend a vote against the policy had signalled that a sizeable revolt was on the cards. The surprise move by Imperial Brands has sent a strong signal to other FTSE 100 companies that shareholders are increasingly scrutinizing executive pay packages. The company's decision to withdraw the new pay policy from the vote may also be a sign of a growing trend towards greater transparency and accountability in corporate governance.\n\nImperial Brands' proposal had been met with widespread criticism from institutional investors, who argued that the potential pay rise was excessive and did not align with the company's performance. The company's profits have been under pressure in recent years due to declining sales of its traditional tobacco products, and investors felt that the proposed pay hike was not justified.\n\nThe decision by ISS to recommend a vote against the policy was seen as a significant blow to Imperial Brands' plans. ISS is one of the most influential proxy voting agencies in the world, and its recommendations are closely followed by many institutional investors. The agency's decision to oppose the pay policy was likely influenced by concerns over the company's poor performance and the lack of transparency around its executive compensation practices.\n\nThe implications of Imperial Brands' decision are likely to be felt across the FTSE 100, where many companies are facing pressure from shareholders to reform their executive pay practices. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of excessive executive pay, which have led to increased scrutiny and criticism from investors and regulators.\n\nThe UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has been urging companies to improve their executive pay practices, and has introduced new guidelines to help ensure that pay is aligned with performance. The FRC has also increased its scrutiny of company reports and accounts, and has taken enforcement action against companies that fail to comply with its guidelines.\n\nIn the wake of Imperial Brands' decision, other FTSE 100 companies may be forced to rethink their own executive pay policies. Companies such as British American Tobacco, Reckitt Benckiser, and Diageo, which have all faced criticism over their executive pay practices, may be forced to reconsider their approaches in the face of growing shareholder opposition.\n\nUltimately, the decision by Imperial Brands' shareholders to block the pay rise for Alison Cooper sends a clear message to companies and their executives: that transparency, accountability, and performance-based pay are essential for maintaining investor trust and confidence. As the debate over executive pay continues to rage, it remains to be seen whether other companies will follow Imperial Brands' lead and prioritize the interests of their shareholders over those of their executives.",

The BBC guidelines are not laws. They are there to guide and are, therefore, open to interpretation. The recent controversy surrounding Naga Munchetty's comments on Donald Trump has sparked a heated debate about the role of the BBC's guidelines in shaping the tone and content of its programming. While the corporation has defended its decision to censure the presenter, many have argued that the guidelines are overly restrictive and stifle creativity and freedom of expression.\n\nAs the BBC's guidelines are not laws, they are indeed open to interpretation. However, this very flexibility can also be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows for nuance and adaptability in response to changing circumstances and audience expectations. On the other hand, it can also lead to inconsistencies and a lack of clarity, which can be detrimental to the corporation's reputation and the trust of its audience.\n\nIn the case of Munchetty's comments, the BBC's decision to censure her was seen by many as an overreaction. While the presenter's language was certainly provocative, it was also a reflection of the strong emotions and opinions that many people hold about the current political climate. By imposing its guidelines in a rigid and inflexible manner, the BBC risked stifling the very kind of debate and discussion that it purports to promote.\n\nMoreover, the controversy has highlighted the need for the BBC to revisit its guidelines and ensure that they are more nuanced and context-sensitive. The corporation's guidelines should not be seen as a straitjacket that restricts creativity and freedom of expression, but rather as a framework that allows presenters and producers to make informed decisions about the content and tone of their programming.\n\nUltimately, the BBC's guidelines are only as effective as the corporation's willingness to engage with its audience and adapt to changing circumstances. By fostering a culture of openness, transparency, and creative freedom, the BBC can ensure that its programming remains relevant, engaging, and true to its values.",

        "Text": "The German economy expanded faster than any other Group of 7 nation last year, official data showed Wednesday, but the stress of the euro crisis and a slowing global economy appear to be already weighing on output. Germany's economy grew by 1.5% in 2022, outpacing its G7 peers, according to the country's Federal Statistical Office. This marks the 12th consecutive year of economic growth for Germany, a significant achievement for the country. However, the latest figures also indicate that the country's economy is showing signs of slowing down, with growth rates declining from 2.2% in 2021.\n\nThe slowdown is attributed to the ongoing stress of the euro crisis, which has been affecting the European economy for several years. The crisis has led to a decline in consumer and business confidence, resulting in reduced spending and investment. Additionally, the global economy has been slowing down, with many countries experiencing a decline in economic activity.\n\nDespite these challenges, Germany's economy remains one of the strongest in the world. The country's strong manufacturing sector, particularly in the automotive and engineering industries, has been a key driver of growth. The sector has benefited from the country's highly skilled workforce and its strategic location, making it an attractive destination for foreign investment.\n\nHowever, the economy is not without its challenges. The country's high level of debt and the ongoing euro crisis have raised concerns about its long-term sustainability. The government has implemented several measures to address these issues, including austerity measures and structural reforms.\n\nDespite these challenges, Germany's economy is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. The country's central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, has forecasted a growth rate of 0.8% for 2023. This growth is expected to be driven by the country's strong manufacturing sector and its highly skilled workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, Germany's economy has continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace, despite the challenges posed by the euro crisis and the slowing global economy. The country's strong manufacturing sector and highly skilled workforce have been key drivers of growth, and the government's measures to address the country's debt and structural issues are expected to help sustain the economy in the long term.",

        "Text": "Campus-affiliated accounts may come with fees that can add up if students don't use the accounts carefully. Some campus debit cards, for instance, charge fees when students make purchases using their PINs, rather than with a signature -- a fee not typically seen with traditional checking accounts. And some may charge hefty overdraft fees for debit transactions -- that is, fees charged for overdrawing the account, according to a study this year by the Center for Responsible Lending. The study, which analyzed 15 campus-affiliated debit card programs at major universities across the United States, found that many of these programs charge excessive fees that can quickly add up for students. The researchers discovered that some programs charge as much as $35 per overdraft transaction, which can lead to significant financial burdens for students who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nFor example, the study found that the University of Texas's campus debit card program charges a $35 overdraft fee, as well as a $10 monthly maintenance fee. Similarly, the University of California, Los Angeles's (UCLA) campus debit card program charges a $20 overdraft fee and a $5 monthly maintenance fee.\n\nThe Center for Responsible Lending, a non-profit organization that aims to promote fair and responsible financial practices, is urging universities to re-examine their campus debit card programs and to consider alternative options that are more student-friendly.\n\n\"We believe that universities have a responsibility to ensure that their students are not being taken advantage of by excessive fees,\" said the Center's executive director, Mike Calhoun. \"These fees can be particularly burdensome for students who are already struggling to make ends meet, and we urge universities to consider alternative options that are more transparent and fair.\"\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among student advocates and financial experts, who argue that universities have a responsibility to protect their students from excessive fees. Some are calling for universities to adopt more transparent and student-friendly financial practices, such as offering fee-free checking accounts or partnering with banks that offer more competitive rates and fewer fees.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, some universities are already taking steps to revamp their campus debit card programs. For example, the University of Michigan has announced plans to eliminate its overdraft fees and to offer a fee-free checking account option for students.\n\nAs the debate continues, students and parents are being advised to carefully review the terms and conditions of their campus debit card programs and to consider alternative options that may be more cost-effective and student-friendly. With the rising cost of higher education, it's more important than ever for students to be aware of the fees they're paying and to make informed decisions about their financial choices.",

The strongly worded letter from the exasperated sports bodies – including Fifa, Uefa, Germany's Bundesliga, Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A as well as the Asian Football Confederation – comes after almost 18 months fruitlessly attempting to mount a legal challenge in Saudi Arabia to block the service, called beoutQ. \"We collectively condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing theft of our intellectual property by the pirate broadcaster known as beoutQ and call on the authorities in Saudi Arabia to support us in ending the widespread and flagrant breaches of our intellectual property rights,\" the authorities said in a joint statement. The sporting bodies have said that nine legal firms in Saudi Arabia have failed to take on their copyright theft case and that they are now being forced to seek other means to shut down the broadcaster. The letter, which was sent to the Saudi Arabian government, also accused beoutQ of using advanced encryption and other sophisticated techniques to evade detection and continue broadcasting matches without permission. The authorities claimed that the pirate service has been illegally airing matches from top leagues and competitions around the world, including the English Premier League, the UEFA Champions League, and the FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe move comes as a significant escalation in the long-running battle between the sports authorities and beoutQ. The pirate service has been a thorn in the side of the sports industry for years, with many top clubs and leagues losing millions of dollars in revenue as a result of the illegal broadcasts.\n\nIn a statement, the Premier League said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the continued theft of its intellectual property and called on the Saudi Arabian government to take immediate action to shut down beoutQ. \"The Premier League has been working tirelessly to protect its intellectual property and ensure that its matches are only broadcast legally and with the proper authorization,\" the statement said. \"We urge the Saudi Arabian government to take all necessary steps to prevent the continued theft of our intellectual property and to support our efforts to bring beoutQ to an end.\"\n\nThe Bundesliga, La Liga, and Serie A also issued statements condemning the illegal broadcasts and calling on the Saudi Arabian government to take action. \"We will not stand idly by while our intellectual property is stolen and our fans are deprived of the authentic experience of watching our matches,\" said a spokesperson for the Bundesliga.\n\nThe move by the sports authorities is seen as a significant blow to beoutQ, which has been operating in Saudi Arabia since 2017. The pirate service has been able to evade detection and continue broadcasting matches despite repeated attempts by the authorities to shut it down.\n\nThe sports authorities are now exploring all available options to shut down beoutQ, including working with international law enforcement agencies and seeking damages from the pirate service. The move is seen as a major victory for the sports industry, which has been fighting to protect its intellectual property for years.\n\nIn a statement, FIFA said it was \"committed to protecting its intellectual property and ensuring that its matches are only broadcast legally and with the proper authorization.\" The organization said it would continue to work with the Saudi Arabian government and other international authorities to bring beoutQ to an end.\n\nThe battle between the sports authorities and beoutQ is set to continue, with both sides digging in for a long and costly fight.

The first oil to flow from the Kashagan field, in Kazakhstan, was just a trickle. The Kashagan field, located in the Caspian Sea, is expected to produce around 1.2 million barrels of oil per day at its peak, making it a significant addition to the global oil supply. The field's operator, Eni, a leading Italian energy company, has invested over $20 billion in the project since its inception in the early 2000s.\n\nThe Kashagan field was initially expected to start producing oil in 2005, but numerous delays and technical issues pushed back the start-up date. The project faced several challenges, including the need to construct a new pipeline to transport the oil to the Caspian Sea, as well as the construction of a new oil terminal.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Eni and its partners, including ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and the Kazakh state-owned oil company, KazMunayGas, have persevered and are now reaping the rewards of their efforts. The first oil to flow from the field was a symbolic milestone, marking the beginning of a new era in the region's energy production.\n\nThe Kashagan field is expected to play a significant role in meeting the world's growing energy demands, particularly in Asia, where energy consumption is increasing rapidly. The field's oil is also expected to be of high quality, with low sulfur content, making it suitable for use in the production of high-octane gasoline and diesel fuel.\n\nThe start-up of the Kashagan field is a significant achievement for Eni, which has been actively involved in the project since its inception. The company's CEO, Claudio Descalzi, hailed the achievement as a major milestone, saying that it marked the beginning of a new chapter in the company's history.\n\nThe start-up of the Kashagan field is also expected to have a positive impact on the local economy, creating thousands of jobs and generating significant revenue for the Kazakh government. The project is expected to contribute significantly to the country's GDP, making it a major driver of economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the start-up of the Kashagan field is a significant achievement for the oil and gas industry, offering a valuable new deposit to meet the world's rising energy needs. The project's success is a testament to the perseverance and dedication of the companies involved, and it is expected to have a positive impact on the local economy and the global energy market.",

Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries Ltd has secured the manufacturing of 60 steel foundation jackets for the East Anglia One offshore windfarm, which will safeguard 200 jobs. At more than 65 metres high and weighing over 845 tonnes, the three-legged steel jackets will be almost as prominent on Belfast's skyline as Samson and Goliath, Harland and Wolff's giant yellow cranes. Work on the foundation jackets will start in the second quarter of 2017 and should be completed towards the end of 2018, Scottish Renewables said on Friday. The contract marks a significant milestone for Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries Ltd, which has been working to diversify its operations in recent years. The shipyard, which is one of the most iconic and historic in the world, has traditionally been associated with building large passenger liners and warships. However, in recent years, the company has been expanding its capabilities to include the construction of offshore windfarm infrastructure.\n\nThe East Anglia One offshore windfarm is a major project for the UK's renewable energy sector, and the contract with Harland and Wolff is a significant vote of confidence in the company's capabilities. The windfarm, which is being developed by ScottishPower Renewables, will be located off the coast of Suffolk and will have a total capacity of 700 megawatts. It is expected to generate enough electricity to power around 500,000 homes.\n\nThe contract with Harland and Wolff is also a boost for the local economy in Belfast, where the company is based. The construction of the foundation jackets will create a significant number of jobs, not just in the shipyard itself, but also in the supply chain and other related industries. The contract is also expected to have a positive impact on the local community, with the company committing to work with local suppliers and contractors wherever possible.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by local politicians and business leaders, who have been working to support the growth and development of the renewable energy sector in Northern Ireland. The First Minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, said: \"This is a major boost for the local economy and a testament to the skills and expertise of Harland and Wolff. We are committed to supporting the growth of the renewable energy sector in Northern Ireland and this contract is a significant step in that direction.\"\n\nThe managing director of Harland and Wolff Heavy Industries Ltd, John Wood, said: \"We are delighted to have secured this contract and to be playing a key role in the development of the East Anglia One offshore windfarm. This project is a major milestone for our company and we are committed to delivering high-quality products and services to our customers. We are also proud to be contributing to the growth and development of the renewable energy sector in the UK.\"\n\nThe contract with Harland and Wolff is the latest in a series of significant wins for the company, which has been expanding its capabilities in recent years. The company has also secured contracts to build offshore windfarm infrastructure for other major projects, including the Walney Extension offshore windfarm off the coast of Cumbria.\n\nOverall, the contract with Harland and Wolff is a significant step forward for the renewable energy sector in the UK, and a major boost for the local economy in Belfast. The company's expertise and capabilities will play a key role in the development of the East Anglia One offshore windfarm, and the project is expected to have a positive impact on the local community and the wider economy.",

Arcadia, which owned BHS until it was sold to a consortium led by Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015, on Friday agreed the deal with BHS's liquidators, FRP Advisory, which will drop legal action filed against Green's company. A spokesman for FRP said: \"The liquidators of SHB Realisations, formerly BHS, reached an agreement with Arcadia Group in relation to a number of matters, including Arcadia's floating charge dated 14 April 2015. The agreement, which was reached after months of negotiations, marks a significant milestone in the winding-down process of BHS, which was once a beloved British institution. The £30m payment will be used to settle outstanding debts owed to unsecured creditors, including small businesses and individuals who were left with unpaid invoices following the company's collapse.\n\nThe deal is also seen as a major victory for FRP Advisory, the liquidators appointed to oversee the administration of BHS. The firm had been pursuing legal action against Arcadia, which owned BHS until its sale to Dominic Chappell's consortium in 2015, in an effort to recover some of the funds owed to creditors.\n\nThe agreement comes as a relief to many of the 11,000 employees who lost their jobs when BHS went into administration in April 2016. The collapse of the company was widely criticized, with many blaming Sir Philip Green's handling of the business and his decision to sell it off for a nominal sum.\n\nSir Philip Green has faced intense scrutiny over his role in the collapse of BHS, with many calling for him to be held accountable for the loss of thousands of jobs and the damage to the high street. The billionaire businessman has faced allegations of mismanagement and tax avoidance, and has been criticized for his lavish spending habits and failure to invest in the business.\n\nDespite the agreement, many questions remain unanswered about the collapse of BHS and the role of Sir Philip Green in its demise. The UK's business secretary, Greg Clark, has launched an inquiry into the collapse of the company, and is expected to publish a report in the coming months.\n\nIn the meantime, the £30m payment to unsecured creditors is seen as a positive step towards bringing closure to the saga. FRP Advisory has welcomed the agreement, saying it will allow the liquidators to focus on recovering as much value as possible from the sale of BHS's assets.\n\nThe deal is also seen as a reminder of the importance of corporate governance and the need for companies to prioritize the interests of their employees, customers, and creditors. As the UK's high street continues to grapple with the challenges of online shopping and changing consumer habits, the collapse of BHS serves as a stark reminder of the need for businesses to adapt and innovate in order to survive.",

        "Text": "Q. My new iPhone does not have a little globe key on the keyboard like I've seen on other people's Apple phones. Mine just has the \"happy face\" key. Why is this? iPhone users may have noticed a subtle difference in their keyboard layout, with some devices featuring a globe key and others, like the writer's, sporting a smiley face icon. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the operating system and regional settings.\n\nThe globe key, also known as the \"world key,\" is a feature introduced by Apple in iOS 11. It allows users to switch between languages and input methods with ease. The key is typically located on the bottom row of the keyboard, alongside the \"123\" key. However, it's not a standard feature on all iPhone models and is primarily intended for users who frequently switch between languages.\n\nThe smiley face key, on the other hand, is a more recent addition to the iPhone keyboard. It was introduced in iOS 14 and is designed to provide quick access to emojis. The key is meant to be a convenient way to insert emojis into text messages, emails, and other digital communications.\n\nSo, why does the writer's iPhone feature a smiley face key instead of a globe key? The answer likely lies in the device's regional settings. Apple often customizes the iPhone keyboard for specific regions and languages. For example, devices sold in the United States may feature a smiley face key, while those sold in Europe or Asia may have a globe key.\n\nAnother possibility is that the writer's iPhone is set to a language that doesn't require the globe key. Apple offers a range of languages and input methods, including Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, among others. If the writer's iPhone is set to one of these languages, the globe key may not be necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the absence of a globe key on the writer's iPhone is likely due to the device's regional settings or the language it's set to. The smiley face key, on the other hand, provides a convenient way to access emojis and is a feature that's becoming increasingly popular among iPhone users.",

Title: iPhone's False Sense of Driving: A Growing Concern for Apple Users\n\nFor many iPhone users, the latest software update has brought about a plethora of exciting new features and improvements. However, for some, the upgrade has also introduced an unexpected and frustrating issue: the device's tendency to think it's driving whenever they're in a taxi or ride-hailing service.\n\nQ. Ever since I upgraded the software, my iPhone freaks out whenever I'm in a cab because it thinks I'm driving. It's incredibly annoying, and it's not just me who's experiencing this problem. I've spoken to several friends and family members who have reported similar issues.\n\nThe issue appears to be related to the iPhone's built-in motion sensors, which are designed to detect changes in the device's orientation and movement. In the case of ride-hailing services, the sensors can become confused by the constant movement of the vehicle, leading the device to believe it's being driven.\n\nApple has acknowledged the issue and is working to resolve it. In the meantime, users are left to find workarounds to prevent their devices from going into \"driving mode.\" Some have reported success by disabling the feature altogether, while others have found that simply placing the device in a pocket or purse can prevent it from being triggered.\n\nThe issue has sparked a lively debate among iPhone users, with some expressing frustration at the inconvenience caused by the software glitch. Others have taken to social media to share their own experiences and offer tips and tricks for avoiding the problem.\n\nDespite the inconvenience, the issue has also highlighted the impressive capabilities of the iPhone's motion sensors. The sensors are designed to detect even the slightest changes in movement, allowing the device to accurately track the user's activity and provide features like fitness tracking and gesture recognition.\n\nAs Apple continues to work on a solution, users can take steps to minimize the impact of the issue. By disabling the \"driving mode\" feature or using a protective case to block the sensors, users can prevent their devices from being triggered. In the meantime, Apple's commitment to addressing the issue is a testament to the company's dedication to providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.\n\nIn the end, the issue serves as a reminder of the importance of software updates and the need for users to stay informed about the latest features and changes. As technology continues to evolve, it's likely that we'll see even more innovative features and capabilities emerge. But for now, iPhone users can rest assured that Apple is working to resolve the issue and provide a smooth and enjoyable experience for all.",

The decision comes after the paper's parent company, News Corp, reported a loss of $643m (£479m) for the most recent fiscal year, which ended on 30 June. That compares to a $235m profit during the previous year. The paper began publishing a separate Asian edition in 1976 and its European edition followed in 1983. The decision to discontinue the Asian and European editions of The Wall Street Journal is a significant blow to the paper's global presence and reputation. The move is part of a broader effort by News Corp to streamline its operations and cut costs in response to declining revenue.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's European edition, which was launched in 1983, has been a staple of financial news in the region for decades. It has provided in-depth coverage of European markets, politics, and business to a readership that spans the continent. The paper's Asian edition, which began publication in 1976, has been a leading source of financial news and analysis in the region.\n\nThe decision to discontinue these editions is likely to be met with disappointment by many readers and advertisers who have come to rely on The Wall Street Journal's global coverage. The paper's parent company, News Corp, has been facing significant challenges in recent years, including declining advertising revenue and increased competition from digital media outlets.\n\nIn a statement, News Corp said that the decision to discontinue the Asian and European editions was made \"after careful consideration and a thorough review of our operations.\" The company added that it would continue to provide global coverage through its digital platforms and would maintain a strong presence in the markets it serves.\n\nThe move is likely to have significant implications for the paper's staff and operations. The Wall Street Journal has a significant presence in Europe and Asia, with bureaus and correspondents in major cities such as London, Paris, and Tokyo. Many of these staff members are likely to be affected by the decision, although News Corp has not yet announced any plans for layoffs or restructuring.\n\nThe decision to discontinue the Asian and European editions of The Wall Street Journal is a significant development in the world of financial journalism. It marks a significant shift in the way that financial news is consumed and distributed, and it is likely to have significant implications for the industry as a whole.\n\nIn the short term, the decision is likely to be met with disappointment by many readers and advertisers who have come to rely on The Wall Street Journal's global coverage. However, it is also an opportunity for the paper to re-evaluate its strategy and focus on its core strengths. With its digital platforms and global reach, The Wall Street Journal is well-positioned to continue to be a leading source of financial news and analysis for years to come.",

It's all the more remarkable because InSight -- which landed last week -- does not have a microphone. Rather, an instrument designed for measuring the shaking of marsquakes picked up vibrations in the air -- sound waves, in other words. The recorded sounds, released by NASA on Monday, are a significant milestone in the agency's exploration of Mars. The InSight lander, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, was specifically designed to study the internal structure of Mars and monitor the planet's seismic activity.\n\nThe sounds, which were recorded on April 5, are a series of gentle hums and rustling noises that are eerily similar to the sounds of wind blowing on Earth. According to NASA, the vibrations were detected by InSight's Seismic Experiment Package (SEIS), which is equipped with a highly sensitive seismometer designed to measure the slightest movements of the Martian surface.\n\n\"We were amazed when we heard the sounds,\" said Dr. Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for the InSight mission. \"It's incredible that we're able to capture the sounds of wind on another planet, and it's a testament to the incredible technology that we've developed for this mission.\"\n\nThe recorded sounds are significant not only because they provide a new way of experiencing the Martian environment but also because they offer valuable insights into the planet's atmosphere. The vibrations detected by SEIS are thought to be caused by the movement of air molecules in the Martian atmosphere, which is much thinner than Earth's.\n\n\"This is a major breakthrough for our understanding of the Martian atmosphere,\" said Dr. Banerdt. \"We've been studying the atmosphere of Mars for decades, but this is the first time we've been able to directly measure the movement of air molecules. It's a game-changer for our research.\"\n\nThe InSight lander is expected to continue studying the Martian atmosphere and internal structure for the next few years, providing valuable insights into the planet's history and potential for supporting life. The recorded sounds of wind on Mars are a reminder of the incredible discoveries that await us as we continue to explore our neighboring planet.",

        "Text": "Within the 2.5 million acres of the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve in central Alaska, wolves and other majestic animals are protected. But animals like wolves do not respect lines drawn on a map. And a recent study suggests that efforts to limit populations of these predators outside those borders is having negative effects on wolves living within the preserve. Researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks have been monitoring the movements of wolves within the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve and surrounding areas. Their findings, published in the journal Ecology, reveal that efforts to control wolf populations outside the preserve's boundaries are having unintended consequences on the wolves living within the protected area.\n\nAccording to the study, wolves are migrating from areas outside the preserve in search of food and mates, leading to an influx of new individuals into the protected area. However, this influx has resulted in increased competition for resources, such as prey and habitat, with the resident wolf population.\n\n\"The data suggests that the wolves within the preserve are experiencing reduced food availability and increased mortality rates due to the influx of new wolves,\" said Dr. Sarah Taylor, lead author of the study. \"This is a concerning trend, as it can lead to a decline in the overall health and resilience of the wolf population within the preserve.\"\n\nThe researchers believe that the primary cause of this influx is the hunting and trapping of wolves outside the preserve's boundaries. While these activities are intended to control wolf populations and reduce conflicts with humans, they are having the opposite effect within the preserve.\n\n\"Wolves are highly mobile and can travel long distances in search of food and mates,\" explained Dr. Taylor. \"By controlling their populations outside the preserve, we're inadvertently pushing them into the protected area, where they're competing with the resident population for resources.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for conservation efforts in the region. The researchers are calling for a more holistic approach to managing wolf populations, one that takes into account the interconnectedness of wolf populations across different areas.\n\n\"We need to consider the broader landscape and how our actions outside the preserve are impacting the wolves within it,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"By working together with local communities, hunters, and trappers, we can develop more effective management strategies that balance human needs with wolf conservation.\"\n\nThe study's authors are hopeful that their findings will inform policy decisions and inspire a shift in the way wolf populations are managed in the region. As the debate around wolf conservation continues, one thing is clear: the fate of these majestic animals is closely tied to the actions of humans both within and outside the protected area.",

This is a welcome time to reflect, yet here in the UK, just 11% of engineers are women. Engineering is behind many of the things we take for granted, such as roads, bridges, railways, electricity generation and clean water, but it is also behind AI, robotics, smartphones and wearable technology – some of the most exciting recent technological developments. Despite the significant contributions women can make to the field, the lack of female engineers in the UK is a concerning issue. According to a report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the number of female engineers in the UK has remained stagnant over the past decade, with only a slight increase of 1% since 2010.\n\nThe IET's report highlights the importance of addressing the gender imbalance in engineering, citing the need for a more diverse workforce to drive innovation and tackle the complex challenges facing the industry. Female engineers bring unique perspectives and skills to the table, which can lead to more effective solutions and improved outcomes.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the lack of female engineers in the UK is the stereotype that engineering is a male-dominated field. Many young girls are discouraged from pursuing engineering as a career due to a lack of role models and limited exposure to the industry. This can lead to a lack of confidence and a perception that engineering is not a suitable career path for women.\n\nHowever, there are initiatives underway to encourage more women to pursue engineering careers. Many universities and colleges are implementing programs to attract and retain female students, such as women-only engineering clubs and mentorship schemes. Additionally, companies are also taking steps to increase diversity and inclusion in their workplaces, including offering flexible working arrangements and promoting female role models.\n\nOne such company is Rolls-Royce, which has set a target to increase the proportion of female engineers to 20% by 2025. The company has implemented a range of initiatives, including a women's network and a mentorship program, to support female engineers and encourage them to progress to senior roles.\n\nAs we celebrate International Women in Engineering Day, it is essential to recognize the achievements of female engineers and to continue to work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse industry. By encouraging and supporting more women to pursue engineering careers, we can drive innovation, improve outcomes, and create a more sustainable future.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is still much work to be done to increase the number of female engineers in the UK, there are many positive initiatives underway to address the issue. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and diverse industry that benefits everyone.",

On Monday, Facebook said it would begin testing a \"data portability\" tool in Ireland that would allow users there to move photos and videos from Facebook to Google Photos. The move is seen as a significant step towards addressing concerns over data privacy and competition in the digital landscape. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been instrumental in driving this change, as it requires companies to give users greater control over their personal data and to allow them to easily transfer it to other services.\n\nFacebook's data portability tool is expected to be rolled out to other European countries in the coming months, and the company has hinted that it may also be available in other regions in the future. The tool will allow users to download their Facebook photos and videos, as well as other data, and then upload them to rival services such as Google Photos, Apple Photos, or Microsoft OneDrive.\n\nThe move is seen as a response to criticism from regulators and privacy advocates that Facebook's dominance in the social media space gives it too much control over users' data. The company has faced numerous investigations and fines over its handling of user data, including a record-breaking $5 billion fine from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in July.\n\nFacebook's rivals have long complained that the company's tight grip on user data makes it difficult for them to compete fairly. By making it easier for users to move their data to other services, Facebook is attempting to address these concerns and show that it is committed to giving users greater control over their data.\n\nHowever, some experts have expressed skepticism about the move, suggesting that it may be too little, too late. \"Facebook's data portability tool is a welcome step, but it's hard to see how it will fundamentally change the company's business model,\" said Dr. Emma Wilson, a digital privacy expert at the University of Oxford. \"Facebook still has a lot of work to do to demonstrate its commitment to user privacy and data protection.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the move is seen as a significant step forward for users and could have far-reaching implications for the digital landscape. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on digital services, the need for greater transparency and control over personal data is becoming more pressing. Facebook's data portability tool is a recognition of this need, and it could pave the way for greater competition and innovation in the digital space.",

On Saturday, however, Pret's chief executive, Clive Schlee, tweeted that the company would pay all participants Pret's hourly starting rate \"and of course provide free food as well\". The about-face by Pret a Manger comes after a backlash from critics who argued that the company's initial proposal was exploitative and unfair to young people.

Meanwhile, official data earlier this month showed that inflation remained high at 3% in January – meaning savers are losing money in real terms. That may help explain why cash Isas have collapsed in popularity, with government data showing a £20bn fall in the amount invested in the space of 12 months. However, rates do look to be on the move upwards. This week, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, told MPs there were likely to be \"something more than three rate increases,\" over the next few years. As the Bank of England governor's comments sent a signal to the market that interest rates are set to rise, investors and savers alike are holding their breath, hoping for a significant increase in the rates offered by cash Isas. While a 1.21% interest rate may seem attractive to some, the reality is that it's a far cry from the rates seen just a few years ago, when cash Isas were offering returns of up to 2.5%.\n\nFor those who rely on their savings to get by, the current rates are a major concern. With inflation running at 3%, savers are effectively losing money in real terms, as the purchasing power of their savings is eroded by the rising cost of living. It's little wonder, then, that cash Isa sales have plummeted in recent months.\n\nHowever, there are signs that the tide may be turning. This week, several major banks and building societies announced plans to increase their interest rates, in anticipation of the Bank of England's rate hikes. For example, Barclays has increased its easy-access cash Isa rate to 1.35%, while HSBC is offering 1.40%. Meanwhile, the Leeds Building Society has announced a rate of 1.50% for its easy-access cash Isa.\n\nWhile these rates may not seem like a lot, they are a significant improvement on the paltry returns offered by many cash Isas just a year ago. And with the Bank of England governor's comments suggesting that rates are set to rise further, savers may finally be in for a break.\n\nOf course, there are still some savers who are better off sticking with their existing cash Isa deals, rather than switching to a new one. Those who have a fixed-rate cash Isa, for example, may be locked in for a set period of time and may not be able to switch to a new deal until that period has expired.\n\nBut for those who are looking to switch or open a new cash Isa, the current market offers a range of options. From easy-access accounts that offer instant access to your money, to fixed-rate deals that provide a guaranteed return over a set period of time, there's something for everyone.\n\nAs the interest rate landscape continues to evolve, savers would do well to keep a close eye on the market and be prepared to act quickly when rates do rise. With the right cash Isa, it's possible to earn a decent return on your savings and keep pace with inflation. And with the Bank of England governor's comments suggesting that rates are set to rise, now may be the perfect time to take action and start building a more secure financial future.",

Engineers, inventors and tinkerers had been working on \"telemotion,\" the \"televista,\" the \"photo-telegraph,\" and the \"tele-vision\" in various forms, using well-known technologies and off-the-shelf equipment, since the early 20th century. Despite the numerous attempts, a practical and commercially viable solution for transmitting live, moving images over long distances remained elusive. However, the tide began to turn in the 1920s with the emergence of a new player in the field: John Logie Baird, a Scottish engineer with a passion for innovation.\n\nBaird's breakthrough came in 1926, when he successfully demonstrated the first public transmission of live, moving images using a mechanical scanning system. His invention, known as the \"televisor,\" used a spinning disk with a spiral of holes to capture and transmit images. Although the quality was still primitive, with a limited number of lines and a grainy, monochrome picture, Baird's achievement marked a significant milestone in the development of television.\n\nIn the years that followed, Baird continued to refine his design, and in 1928, he transmitted the first live, transatlantic television signal, beaming images from London to New York. This feat not only showcased the potential of television but also sparked a wave of interest and investment in the technology.\n\nMeanwhile, another pioneer, Philo Farnsworth, a young American inventor, was working on an all-electronic television system. Farnsworth's design used a camera tube called the \"image dissector\" to capture images and a cathode ray tube (CRT) to display them. In 1927, Farnsworth successfully demonstrated his invention, transmitting live images for the first time.\n\nThe competition between Baird and Farnsworth drove innovation, and by the early 1930s, both engineers had developed more advanced systems. In 1936, the BBC launched the world's first regular high-definition television service, using Baird's mechanical system. However, Farnsworth's all-electronic system eventually became the standard, due in part to its greater reliability and flexibility.\n\nThe development of television was not without its challenges. The technology required significant infrastructure investments, including the construction of broadcasting towers, transmission equipment, and receiving devices. Additionally, the early systems were prone to interference, and the quality of the images was often poor.\n\nDespite these hurdles, television continued to evolve, and by the 1940s, it had become a staple of popular culture. The first commercial television broadcasts began in the United States in the late 1940s, and by the 1950s, TV sets were a common fixture in millions of homes around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of television was a long and arduous process, marked by numerous setbacks and challenges. However, the perseverance of pioneers like Baird and Farnsworth ultimately led to the creation of a technology that has had a profound impact on modern society. Today, television remains an integral part of our daily lives, providing entertainment, education, and news to people around the globe.",

In a report published on Monday, the Association of Residential Letting Agents (Arla) says last month's referendum vote has not rocked the rental market \"yet\", however, uncertainty over the future of Britain's role in Europe is making landlords jittery. One in nine agents told Arla they have experienced an immediate dip in rents following last month's Brexit result. Soaring rents, particularly in London and the south-east, have been partly pushed upwards by recent arrivals from abroad, as well as a lack of available properties to rent. The report also highlights that the number of landlords seeking to sell their properties has increased, with 15% of agents reporting a rise in inquiries from landlords looking to exit the rental market. This trend is particularly evident in areas with high concentrations of foreign buyers, such as London and the Home Counties.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, Arla's report suggests that the rental market remains buoyant, with 62% of agents reporting that demand for rental properties has increased over the past 12 months. However, the organization warns that the current uncertainty could lead to a decrease in demand and a subsequent drop in rents if the UK's economic outlook remains uncertain.\n\nThe impact of Brexit on the rental market is not limited to landlords, with many tenants also feeling the effects. The report reveals that 22% of agents have seen an increase in tenants seeking to rent properties, with many citing concerns over the future of their jobs and the economy.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding Brexit has also led to a surge in inquiries from tenants looking to rent properties outside of London, with agents reporting a significant increase in demand for properties in areas such as the north of England and Wales.\n\nWhile the rental market may be experiencing some turbulence, Arla's report suggests that the long-term prospects for the sector remain strong. The organization predicts that the UK's rental market will continue to grow, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and an increase in demand from young professionals and families.\n\nIn conclusion, while the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to a degree of nervousness among landlords and tenants, the UK's rental market remains resilient. As the country navigates the challenges and opportunities presented by its departure from the EU, it is likely that the rental market will continue to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances.",

The agency has found that as many as a third of parents with an autistic child have tried treatments that most pediatricians do not recommend, and that up to 10 percent may be using potentially dangerous tactics. Concerns Over Unproven Autism Treatments Spark Warning from CDC\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has sounded the alarm over the alarming trend of parents resorting to unproven and potentially harmful treatments for their autistic children. According to the agency, a significant number of parents are turning to unconventional methods, which may not only be ineffective but also pose serious risks to their child's health.\n\nThe CDC's findings suggest that up to 10 percent of parents with an autistic child may be using treatments that have not been scientifically proven or are even dangerous. These treatments can range from dietary supplements and herbal remedies to chelation therapy, which involves the use of chemicals to remove perceived toxins from the body.\n\nDr. Kathleen Etherton, a pediatrician and autism expert at the CDC, emphasized the importance of relying on evidence-based treatments for autism. \"While we understand the desperation and frustration that many parents feel when dealing with the challenges of autism, it's crucial that we prioritize the safety and well-being of these children,\" she said.\n\nThe CDC's concerns are not unfounded. Chelation therapy, for example, has been linked to serious side effects, including kidney damage and heart problems. Similarly, some dietary supplements have been found to interact with prescription medications, potentially causing harm.\n\nThe agency is urging parents to consult with their pediatricians and other healthcare professionals before trying any new treatments for their autistic child. \"We want to ensure that parents have access to accurate and reliable information about autism and its treatment,\" said Dr. Etherton. \"We're working to raise awareness about the risks associated with unproven treatments and to promote evidence-based care for these children.\"\n\nIn addition to warning parents about the dangers of unproven treatments, the CDC is also working to improve access to effective treatments for autism. The agency has launched several initiatives aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of autism, as well as providing resources and support for families affected by the disorder.\n\nFor parents seeking guidance on evidence-based treatments for autism, the CDC recommends consulting with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a pediatrician or a developmental pediatrician. The agency also provides a wealth of information on its website, including fact sheets, videos, and resources for families.\n\nUltimately, the CDC's warning serves as a reminder of the importance of prioritizing the health and well-being of children with autism. By promoting evidence-based care and raising awareness about the risks associated with unproven treatments, the agency hopes to ensure that these children receive the best possible care and support.",

We need to make sure that they are actually following the law, we need to make sure that consumers are protected, and we need to hold them accountable.\" The investigation comes as once overwhelmingly positive public opinion about tech companies has started to shift. The investigation, led by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), aims to scrutinize Google's data collection practices and ensure compliance with existing regulations. The move follows a series of high-profile data breaches and privacy concerns surrounding major tech companies.\n\nAccording to sources, the FTC is looking into allegations that Google has been collecting sensitive user data, including browsing history, search queries, and location information, without proper consent. The investigation also seeks to determine whether the company has been using this data to target users with personalized advertisements.\n\n\"We're not just looking at Google, we're looking at the entire tech industry,\" said FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. \"We want to make sure that these companies are being transparent about how they're collecting and using our data, and that they're giving us a choice about how our data is used.\"\n\nThe investigation comes as public trust in tech companies has begun to erode. A recent survey found that 70% of Americans believe that tech companies are more interested in making money than in protecting their privacy. The same survey found that 60% of respondents believe that government regulation is necessary to protect consumers from tech companies' data collection practices.\n\nGoogle has faced criticism in the past for its data collection practices, including a 2018 incident in which the company was found to have been collecting location data from Android devices without consent. The company has since implemented changes to its data collection policies, but many experts believe that more needs to be done to protect consumer privacy.\n\nThe FTC's investigation is expected to take several months to complete, and could result in fines or other penalties for Google if it is found to have violated data protection regulations. The move is seen as a major step towards holding tech companies accountable for their data collection practices and ensuring that consumers are protected.\n\n\"This is a critical moment for the tech industry,\" said Senator Maria Cantwell, a leading advocate for consumer privacy. \"We need to make sure that these companies are putting consumers first, and that they're being transparent about how they're collecting and using our data. The FTC's investigation is an important step towards achieving that goal.\"",

The miners were killed when two 'galleries' overlooking an open excavation pit collapsed at the same mining site which claimed six lives in 2016. Glencore, the world's biggest mining company, confirmed that at least 19 illegal miners were killed when part of the open-pit mine in the Kolwezi area collapsed, and said further fatalities were possible. Richard Muyej, the governor of the DRC's Lualaba province, told Reuters that the accident had claimed the lives of at least 36 \"clandestine artisanal diggers\". The FTSE 100 company, which owns 75% of the Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) through its Katanga Mining subsidiary, blamed the illegal miners for trespassing at the copper mine and \"putting their lives at risk\". The incident has sparked widespread outrage and calls for improved safety measures at the mine. Human rights groups and local authorities have condemned the tragedy, with many demanding that Glencore take responsibility for the lives lost.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is home to some of the world's largest copper deposits, and the mining industry is a significant contributor to the country's economy. However, the sector has been marred by numerous safety incidents and allegations of human rights abuses.\n\nGlencore has faced criticism in the past for its handling of safety issues at its mines. In 2016, the company was fined $53 million by the DRC government for environmental and safety violations at its Katanga mine. The fine was seen as a record for the country at the time.\n\nThe company has also faced criticism for its treatment of artisanal miners, who often work in dangerous conditions without proper safety equipment or training. Artisanal mining is a significant source of income for many people in the DRC, but it is often associated with poor working conditions and environmental degradation.\n\nGlencore has pledged to investigate the cause of the collapse and to provide support to the families of the victims. However, many are calling for more concrete action to be taken to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\nThe DRC government has also launched an investigation into the incident and has vowed to take action to improve safety standards in the mining sector. The government has also called on Glencore to provide compensation to the families of the victims.\n\nThe incident has also raised concerns about the impact of illegal mining on the environment and local communities. The DRC is home to many protected areas and national parks, and the illegal mining of copper and other minerals has been linked to deforestation, water pollution, and habitat destruction.\n\nGlencore has pledged to work with local authorities to address these issues and to implement sustainable mining practices. However, many are skeptical about the company's commitment to sustainability and are calling for more transparency and accountability.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the need for better regulation and enforcement of mining laws in the DRC. The country's mining code is seen as outdated and inadequate, and many are calling for reforms to ensure that mining companies are held accountable for their actions.\n\nAs the investigation into the incident continues, many are left wondering how such a tragedy could have occurred. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks and dangers associated with mining, and the need for companies like Glencore to prioritize safety and sustainability above profits.",

The acquisition is part of Uber's efforts to expand its food delivery services beyond its core ride-hailing business. Cornershop, a Chilean-based company, has been operating in several Latin American countries, including Chile, Argentina, and Colombia, since its founding in 2015.\n\nCornershop's platform allows customers to order groceries and household essentials online and have them delivered to their doorstep within a short period. The company has gained popularity in the region due to its convenience, competitive pricing, and wide range of products.\n\nUber's acquisition of Cornershop is expected to enhance its food delivery capabilities, particularly in Latin America. The deal will also provide Cornershop with the necessary resources and expertise to expand its operations and improve its technology.\n\n\"We're thrilled to partner with Uber, a global leader in the food delivery space,\" said Juan Benavides, Cornershop's co-founder and CEO. \"This partnership will enable us to accelerate our growth and bring our unique grocery delivery experience to more customers in the region.\"\n\nThe acquisition is also seen as a strategic move by Uber to strengthen its position in the Latin American market, where it has been facing increasing competition from local ride-hailing companies.\n\n\"Cornershop's expertise in grocery delivery and its strong presence in Latin America make it an attractive addition to our portfolio,\" said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's CEO. \"We believe that this partnership will help us to better serve our customers in the region and drive growth for both companies.\"\n\nThe terms of the deal were not disclosed, but industry analysts estimate that Uber paid around $600 million for the majority stake in Cornershop. The acquisition is expected to close in the coming weeks, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nCornershop will continue to operate independently, with its current management team remaining in place. The company will also continue to offer its services under its own brand, with Uber's support and resources.\n\nThe acquisition is the latest in a series of investments and partnerships that Uber has made in the food delivery space. In recent months, the company has acquired several food delivery companies, including Postmates and Cornershop, and has partnered with several major food chains to expand its food delivery offerings.\n\nWith the acquisition of Cornershop, Uber is poised to become a major player in the Latin American food delivery market, where it faces stiff competition from local companies such as Rappi and PedidosYa. The deal is expected to have a significant impact on the region's food delivery landscape, and will likely lead to increased competition and innovation in the market.",

Some tremors deep below the surface likely were caused by Earth's gravitational pull. Others were vibrations from meteorite impacts. New Research Reveals Moon's Hidden Activity\n\nFifty years after the Apollo missions, scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the moon's internal dynamics. By analyzing the data collected by the seismometers left behind by the astronauts, researchers have uncovered a wealth of information about the moon's subsurface activity.\n\nOne of the most significant findings is that the moon is not as geologically dead as previously thought. The data suggests that the moon is still experiencing small-scale tectonic activity, which is likely caused by the cooling and contraction of the lunar interior over time. This process, known as \"lunar contraction,\" is similar to what occurs on Earth, where the planet's interior cools and contracts, causing the crust to buckle and create mountains.\n\nThe Apollo seismometers, which were designed to measure moonquakes, detected numerous tremors and vibrations on the lunar surface. By analyzing these signals, scientists were able to pinpoint the source of the activity and determine that it was not just a result of meteorite impacts or Earth's gravitational pull. Instead, the data suggests that the moon's interior is still dynamic and active, with processes occurring deep beneath the surface.\n\n\"This is a major breakthrough in our understanding of the moon's internal dynamics,\" said Dr. Maria Zuber, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"The data collected by the Apollo seismometers has provided us with a unique window into the moon's subsurface, allowing us to study processes that would be impossible to observe on Earth.\"\n\nThe research has significant implications for our understanding of the moon's formation and evolution. It suggests that the moon may have experienced more significant geological activity in the past than previously thought, which could have played a role in shaping its surface features.\n\nThe findings also have practical applications for future lunar missions. By understanding the moon's internal dynamics, scientists can better plan and prepare for future missions, which could include establishing a sustainable human presence on the lunar surface.\n\nAs scientists continue to analyze the data collected by the Apollo seismometers, they are likely to uncover even more secrets about the moon's hidden activity. The discovery is a testament to the power of space exploration and the importance of continued investment in scientific research.",

Chinese stocks have slumped, with the Shanghai Composite Index falling to a three-year low, and the currency has gone for a ride, with the yuan depreciating to its weakest level against the US dollar in over a decade.\n\nThe trade tensions, which began with the US imposing tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion, have escalated rapidly, with both sides imposing new tariffs on each other's products. The US has also blacklisted several Chinese technology companies, including Huawei, citing national security concerns.\n\nThe impact on China's economy is being felt across various sectors. The country's manufacturing sector, which accounts for around 30% of its GDP, is facing significant headwinds, with production levels and exports declining sharply. The country's auto industry, which was already facing challenges due to a slowing market, is also feeling the pinch, with several major manufacturers announcing production cuts and layoffs.\n\nThe trade tensions have also had a significant impact on China's financial markets. The country's stock market, which was already facing a correction, has seen its value decline by over 20% in the past month, wiping out over $2 trillion in value. The currency, the yuan, has also depreciated sharply, falling to its weakest level against the US dollar in over a decade.\n\nDespite the challenges, the Chinese government has vowed to take steps to support the economy. The central bank has cut interest rates and reserve requirements for banks, in an effort to boost lending and stimulate the economy. The government has also announced plans to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes, in an effort to boost domestic demand.\n\nHowever, many economists believe that the government's efforts may not be enough to offset the impact of the trade tensions. \"The trade tensions are having a significant impact on China's economy, and it's unclear how long it will take for the country to recover,\" said Mark Williams, an economist at Capital Economics. \"The government's efforts to support the economy are welcome, but they may not be enough to offset the impact of the trade tensions.\"\n\nAs the trade tensions continue to escalate, many are left wondering what the future holds for China's economy.

On my walk to work I have seen a houseboat for sale and I'm wondering if this is the only way I'll get out of rented accommodation. As you ponder the idea of ditching your rented accommodation for a houseboat, you're not alone. Many people are turning to alternative forms of housing, such as houseboats, yurts, and even treehouses, in search of a more affordable and unique living arrangement.\n\nHouseboats, in particular, have gained popularity in recent years, with many people opting for the freedom and flexibility they offer. Not only do houseboats provide a sense of community, with many marinas and houseboat communities offering a social hub for residents, but they also offer a chance to live in a unique and picturesque environment.\n\nHowever, before you start dreaming of a life on the water, it's essential to consider the practicalities. Houseboats, like any other form of housing, come with their own set of challenges and expenses. For instance, you'll need to consider the cost of mooring fees, insurance, and maintenance, which can add up quickly.\n\nAdditionally, houseboats may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with young families or mobility issues. The living space is often compact, and the lack of permanent foundations can make it difficult to install certain fixtures and fittings.\n\nSo, is a houseboat the only way to escape rented accommodation? Not necessarily. There are other alternatives worth exploring, such as:\n\n* Shared ownership schemes: These allow you to purchase a share of a property, often with a partner or group of friends, and can provide a more affordable option.\n* Community land trusts: These non-profit organizations work to preserve affordable housing options by leasing land to homeowners at below-market rates.\n* Co-living spaces: These shared living arrangements offer a more affordable and social alternative to traditional renting, often with amenities like shared kitchens and communal spaces.\n\nUltimately, the key to escaping rented accommodation is to explore all your options and consider what works best for your lifestyle and budget. Whether it's a houseboat, shared ownership, or something else entirely, there are many ways to achieve your goal of homeownership.\n\nIf you have a question or dilemma you'd like to share, email [money@theguardian.com](mailto:money@theguardian.com) and we'll do our best to help you out.",

Much of the difference can be explained by faster economic growth in the United States and a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of assets priced in other currencies. Despite the resilience of the US market, foreign stocks have been struggling to keep pace. The MSCI EAFE index, which tracks developed markets outside of the US, has declined by over 15% in the past year, compared to a 2% drop for the S&P 500. The MSCI Emerging Markets index has fared even worse, with a decline of over 20%.\n\nOne of the primary factors contributing to the underperformance of foreign stocks is the strength of the US dollar. As the dollar has appreciated against other currencies, the value of foreign assets has decreased, making them less attractive to investors. This is particularly true for emerging markets, where many companies rely heavily on exports and are therefore sensitive to currency fluctuations.\n\nAnother factor is the divergent economic growth rates between the US and other developed economies. The US has been experiencing a period of strong growth, driven by low unemployment and fiscal stimulus, which has boosted consumer spending and business investment. In contrast, many other developed economies, such as the Eurozone and Japan, have been struggling with slower growth and deflationary pressures.\n\nHowever, not all foreign markets are created equal. Some regions, such as Asia, have been experiencing rapid growth and have seen their stock markets perform relatively well. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index has actually risen by over 5% in the past year, driven by strong growth in countries such as China and South Korea.\n\nDespite the challenges facing foreign stocks, many analysts believe that the current environment presents opportunities for investors. With valuations at historic lows in many markets, investors may be able to pick up high-quality stocks at discounted prices. Additionally, the divergence in economic growth rates between the US and other developed economies is likely to continue, providing a tailwind for foreign stocks in the long term.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of the opportunities in foreign markets, there are a number of strategies to consider. One approach is to focus on individual stocks rather than broad market indexes, which can provide more targeted exposure to specific countries or sectors. Another option is to consider investing in emerging markets, which have historically offered higher returns over the long term.\n\nUltimately, the key to success in foreign markets will depend on a combination of factors, including the investor's risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market selection. However, with the right approach and a dash of patience, investors may be able to find opportunities in foreign markets that can help them achieve their long-term financial goals.",

        "Text": "Waitrose has sold off three of its supermarkets to Lidl, sparking a wave of middle-class outrage. It's not just concern about access to venison meatballs or pistachio ice-cream – residents of Bromley in London, Oadby in Leicestershire and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire apparently fear their house prices could take a dive. Kal Kandola, 49, told the Telegraph: \"We are regulars at Waitrose and not very happy about this at all. I have houses in Wollaton that I rent out. The sale of the three Waitrose supermarkets to Lidl has sent shockwaves through the communities in Bromley, Oadby, and Wollaton, with many residents expressing concerns about the potential impact on their property values. For long-time residents like Kal Kandola, who owns rental properties in Wollaton, the news has been particularly unsettling.\n\n\"I've lived in this area for over 20 years, and I've always been proud of the fact that we have a high-end supermarket like Waitrose,\" Kandola said. \"It's not just about the convenience, it's about the prestige of having a store like that in our neighborhood. If Lidl takes over, I worry that it will change the character of the area and potentially decrease the value of my properties.\"\n\nKandola is not alone in his concerns. Many residents in the affected areas have taken to social media to express their disappointment and worry about the impact on their communities. Some have even started petitions to try and block the sale, citing concerns about the potential loss of local jobs and the change in the area's aesthetic.\n\nDespite the backlash, a spokesperson for Waitrose insisted that the sale was a strategic business decision, saying that the company was looking to focus on its core business and reduce its portfolio of stores. \"We understand that this decision may cause some disruption to our customers, but we believe that it is the right move for the long-term health of our business,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nLidl, on the other hand, has been quick to reassure customers that it plans to invest in the new stores and bring its signature low prices to the communities. \"We are excited to bring our unique shopping experience to these areas and offer our customers high-quality products at affordable prices,\" a spokesperson for Lidl said.\n\nWhile some residents may be concerned about the potential impact on their property values, others are more focused on the potential benefits of having a new supermarket in the area. \"I think it's great news,\" said Sarah Johnson, a local resident who shops at Waitrose regularly. \"Lidl is a great store, and I'm sure they will bring some much-needed competition to the area. Plus, their prices are unbeatable!\"\n\nAs the dust settles on the sale, it remains to be seen how the communities in Bromley, Oadby, and Wollaton will adapt to the change. While some residents may be disappointed to see Waitrose go, others are optimistic about the potential benefits of having a new supermarket in the area. One thing is certain, however: the debate over the impact of the sale on house prices is far from over.",

The drop in earnings to $38.5m, down from $83m a year ago, comes a day after real estate listings company Domain, which Fairfax spun off into a standalone entity in November, also reported a drop in profits. Greg Hywood, chief executive and managing director, said 35% of the smaller community titles in the NZ company, now known as Stuff, were being offloaded to \"bring forward the time when increases in digital revenue outweigh declines in print\". Up to 60 staff across titles including NZ Dairy Farmer and Christchurch Mail could be affected, according to reports. The decision to close or sell off 28 newspapers in New Zealand is a significant move for Fairfax Media, which has been grappling with the challenges of the digital age. The company's half-year profit drop is a clear indication of the difficulties it is facing in adapting to the changing media landscape.\n\nIn a statement, Greg Hywood, chief executive and managing director of Fairfax Media, emphasized the need for the company to focus on its digital offerings and reduce its reliance on print. \"We are taking steps to bring forward the time when increases in digital revenue outweigh declines in print,\" he said.\n\nThe affected titles, including NZ Dairy Farmer and Christchurch Mail, are smaller community newspapers that have struggled to maintain their print circulation numbers in recent years. The decision to offload these titles is seen as a necessary step to streamline the company's operations and allocate resources more effectively.\n\nIndustry analysts have been warning of the need for media companies to adapt to the changing media landscape for some time. Fairfax Media's decision to close or sell off its smaller print titles is seen as a bold move to ensure the company's long-term viability.\n\nHowever, the impact on staff is a major concern. Up to 60 employees across the affected titles could be affected, according to reports. This is a significant blow to the local communities that these newspapers serve, and Fairfax Media will need to work closely with its staff and stakeholders to mitigate the effects of this decision.\n\nThe sale of the 28 titles is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with Fairfax Media already in talks with potential buyers. The company has also announced plans to invest in its digital offerings, including its online news platform Stuff, which will continue to operate as a standalone entity.\n\nFairfax Media's decision to close or sell off its smaller print titles is a significant development in the media industry, and it will be closely watched by other companies struggling to adapt to the changing media landscape.",

        "Text": "If there was a tooth fairy in the Cretaceous, dinosaurs kept it busy. Unlike humans, which lose just one set of teeth over a lifetime, dinosaurs often lost tens or even hundreds of sets. Plant-eating dinosaurs had to chew lots of tough material to sustain their large bodies, causing them to frequently replace their teeth. New Research Reveals Tooth Fairy's Busy Schedule in the Cretaceous Era\n\nThe Cretaceous period, which spanned from 145 to 65 million years ago, was a time of immense diversity and complexity in the natural world. With the rise of flowering plants, modern mammals, and of course, the iconic dinosaurs, it's no surprise that the tooth fairy would have been kept busy. According to a recent study published in the journal PLOS ONE, the tooth fairy's workload was significantly higher in the Cretaceous era due to the unique dental habits of these prehistoric creatures.\n\nAs researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, discovered, many plant-eating dinosaurs had to chew through tough plant material to sustain their massive bodies. This constant wear and tear on their teeth led to frequent replacement, with some species losing tens or even hundreds of sets over their lifetime. In contrast, humans typically lose only one set of teeth throughout their entire lifetime.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Emma Taylor, explained that the dental habits of dinosaurs were shaped by their diet and lifestyle. \"Dinosaurs that ate tough, fibrous plants like ferns and cycads needed to constantly replace their teeth to maintain their ability to chew and digest their food,\" she said. \"This meant that the tooth fairy had a constant stream of teeth to collect and replace, making it a very busy and important job.\"\n\nThe researchers used computer simulations and fossil records to estimate the number of teeth lost by different dinosaur species. They found that some species, such as the hadrosaurid (duck-billed) dinosaurs, lost up to 100 sets of teeth over their lifetime. This is significantly higher than the average human, who loses only 20-30 sets of teeth throughout their lifetime.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of dinosaur biology and ecology. \"By studying the dental habits of dinosaurs, we can gain insights into their diet, behavior, and evolution,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"This research also highlights the importance of the tooth fairy's role in the Cretaceous ecosystem, and how it played a crucial part in the recycling of nutrients and energy.\"\n\nWhile the tooth fairy may be a mythical figure in modern times, it's clear that its equivalent played a vital role in the ancient world. As we continue to learn more about the fascinating creatures that lived during the Cretaceous era, we are reminded of the importance of understanding the intricate relationships between species and their environments.",

Figures released by the central bank showed that party planners racked up a bill of £96,188 on the event, which hosted nearly 2,500 staff and their families at the Bank's sports club in Roehampton, south-west London in July. Costs for the annual party – known as Governors' Day – included more than £52,200 on food and soft drinks and nearly £30,000 on family entertainment, which in 2018 involved a treasure hunt, bake-off competition, fun run and bouncy castle. That was on top of nearly £2,000 for equipment and £12,000 for \"other\" undisclosed expenses. The total is slightly higher than the £95,673 spent on Governors' Day in 2018, and while the increase is marginal – about £515 – it will raise questions over whether the bank is serious about reviewing its costs. In May, members of the Bank's board, known at as the Court of Directors, were grilled by MPs over expenses including the summer party bill. The Bank of England's decision to increase spending on its summer party has sparked criticism from lawmakers and experts, who argue that the central bank should be focusing on more pressing issues, such as managing inflation and stabilizing the economy.\n\n\"This is a clear example of the Bank of England's priorities being out of whack,\" said Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the Treasury Committee. \"While families are struggling to make ends meet, the Bank is spending thousands of pounds on a party for its staff and their families. It's a shocking display of extravagance and a clear example of the Bank's disconnect from the real world.\"\n\nThe Bank of England's decision to increase spending on Governors' Day comes at a time when the UK is facing significant economic challenges. The country is currently grappling with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left many households and businesses struggling to recover.\n\n\"The Bank of England should be focusing on supporting the economy and helping people get back to work, not throwing lavish parties for its staff,\" said Ian Mulheirn, a senior policy analyst at the Centre for Policy Studies. \"The fact that the Bank is spending nearly £100,000 on a party is a clear example of the waste and inefficiency that can occur when institutions are not held accountable.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, the Bank of England has defended its decision to increase spending on Governors' Day, arguing that the event is an important way to bring together staff and their families and to celebrate the Bank's achievements.\n\n\"Governors' Day is an important event for the Bank of England, and it provides an opportunity for our staff and their families to come together and celebrate our successes,\" said a Bank of England spokesperson. \"We understand that the cost of the event may be high, but we believe that it is a worthwhile investment in our staff and their families.\"\n\nThe Bank of England's decision to increase spending on Governors' Day has also raised questions about the transparency of the institution's expenses. The Bank has been criticized in the past for its lack of transparency when it comes to its expenses, and the latest figures have only added to the controversy.\n\n\"The Bank of England's expenses are a black box, and it's impossible to know where all of the money is going,\" said Andrew Tyrie, the former chairman of the Treasury Committee. \"The Bank needs to be more transparent about its expenses and to explain why it is spending so much money on lavish events.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, the Bank of England has promised to review its expenses and to make changes to ensure that its spending is more transparent and accountable.\n\n\"We take all concerns about our expenses seriously, and we are committed to being more transparent and accountable in the future,\" said the Bank of England spokesperson. \"We will review our expenses and make changes to ensure that our spending is in line with the expectations of the public and the government.\"\n\nThe controversy over the Bank of England's summer party is just the latest example of the institution's struggles to manage its expenses and to maintain public trust. As the Bank continues to grapple with the challenges of managing the economy, it will be important for it to prioritize transparency and accountability in its spending.",

        "Text": "Reclaiming mis-sold payment protection insurance can be a quick and easy process. There is no need to use a claims handling company that will rake off 30% of any compensation you are awarded. Can I claim mis-sold PPI? If you took out any kind of consumer loan, store card, credit card or mortgage in the 1990s or 2000s, you may have been mis-sold PPI. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), millions of consumers in the UK were mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) policies by banks and financial institutions. The insurance was designed to cover loan or credit card repayments in the event of illness, injury, or unemployment. However, many customers were not adequately informed about the policy's terms, conditions, and exclusions, leading to widespread mis-selling.\n\nIf you believe you were mis-sold PPI, you can reclaim the premiums you paid and any interest charged on those premiums. The good news is that the process of reclaiming PPI is relatively straightforward. You can start by gathering information about your loan or credit card, including the name of the lender, the date you took out the loan, and the amount you borrowed.\n\nNext, you'll need to check your paperwork and statements to see if you were sold PPI. Look for any references to PPI or insurance policies, and note the dates and amounts of any premiums you paid. You can also contact your lender directly to ask if you were sold PPI and to request a copy of your policy documents.\n\nOnce you have this information, you can submit a claim to your lender. You can do this online, by phone, or in writing. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your loan and the PPI policy, including the dates and amounts of any premiums you paid.\n\nThe lender will then review your claim and respond with a decision. If your claim is successful, they will refund the premiums you paid and any interest charged on those premiums. You may also be eligible for compensation for any distress or inconvenience caused by the mis-selling.\n\nIt's worth noting that you don't need to use a claims handling company to reclaim PPI. These companies often charge a fee for their services, which can range from 20% to 30% of the compensation you receive. By submitting your claim directly to your lender, you can avoid these fees and keep the full amount of your compensation.\n\nThe deadline for making a PPI claim is August 29, 2019, so it's essential to act quickly if you think you may be eligible. The FCA has also introduced a \"PPI complaints process\" to help consumers make claims and resolve disputes with lenders.\n\nIn conclusion, reclaiming mis-sold PPI can be a quick and easy process, and you don't need to use a claims handling company to do so. By gathering your information, submitting a claim to your lender, and avoiding unnecessary fees, you can get the compensation you deserve and move on from this experience.",

The 10 students were invited by Property Week to judge a shortlist of providers for the \"student experience\" category of their inaugural Student Accommodation Awards. The judges instead criticised the entrants for pricing out poorer students and \"driving the social cleansing of education\". The decision to withdraw the category has sparked widespread debate in the education and property sectors, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency in the way student accommodation is marketed and priced.\n\nThe students' protest was sparked by concerns over the rising cost of living in student accommodation, which has been exacerbated by the increasing demand for housing in areas with high concentrations of universities. Many students are now forced to take on multiple jobs or rely on parents for financial support, making it difficult to focus on their studies.\n\n\"The student experience\" category was intended to recognize providers that went above and beyond to create a welcoming and supportive environment for students. However, the judges felt that the shortlisted providers were more focused on maximizing profits than providing affordable and accessible housing.\n\nOne of the judges, a student at a London university, said: \"We were shocked by the prices being charged by some of the providers. It's clear that they are more interested in making a quick buck than in providing a service to students. We can't in good conscience choose a winner when the very people they are supposed to be serving are being priced out of the market.\"\n\nThe withdrawal of the category has been met with widespread support from students and academics, who are calling for greater regulation of the student accommodation market. Many are also calling for universities to take a more active role in providing affordable housing options for their students.\n\nA spokesperson for Property Week said: \"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate the students' passion and commitment to this issue. We will take their concerns into consideration as we move forward with our awards program and will work to ensure that future categories are more inclusive and representative of the needs of students.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of universities in addressing the issue of rising rent prices. Many are calling for universities to take a more proactive approach to providing affordable housing options for their students, rather than simply relying on private providers.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Union of Students said: \"Universities have a responsibility to ensure that their students have access to affordable and safe housing. We urge them to take a more active role in addressing this issue and to work with students and other stakeholders to find solutions.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, it is clear that the issue of rising rent prices in student accommodation is not going away anytime soon.

The new documents were released by an activist research organization, the Center for International Environmental Law, which published the project on its website. The documents, according to the environmental law center's director, Carroll Muffett, suggest that the industry had the underlying knowledge of climate change even 60 years ago. \"From 1957 onward, there is no doubt that Humble Oil, which is now Exxon, was clearly on notice\" about rising CO in the atmosphere and the prospect that it was likely to cause global warming, he said. The American Petroleum Institute, energy companies and other organizations had created a group, the Smoke and Fumes Committee, to monitor and conduct pollution research, and to \"use science and public skepticism to prevent environmental regulations they deemed hasty, costly and unnecessary,\" according to the center's description of the documents on its website. The release of the documents has sparked a renewed wave of criticism against Exxon Mobil and the energy industry, with many calling for increased transparency and accountability. The company has faced numerous lawsuits and investigations in recent years over its alleged role in downplaying the risks of climate change and misleading the public about its knowledge of the issue.\n\nExxon Mobil has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and on Wednesday, the company issued a statement saying that the new documents were \"old news\" and that the company's actions were guided by scientific consensus at the time. However, many experts and environmental groups have questioned the company's claims, pointing out that the industry had a significant amount of knowledge about climate change decades ago.\n\nThe documents released by the Center for International Environmental Law also suggest that the industry's efforts to downplay the risks of climate change were not limited to Exxon Mobil. The Smoke and Fumes Committee, which was formed by the American Petroleum Institute and other energy companies, was actively working to discredit scientific research on climate change and to prevent regulations that would have limited the industry's activities.\n\nThe release of the documents has also raised questions about the role of government agencies and politicians in perpetuating the industry's efforts to downplay climate change. Many environmental groups are calling for increased transparency and accountability from government agencies and politicians who have received funding from the energy industry.\n\nThe controversy comes as the energy industry is facing growing pressure to transition to cleaner forms of energy and reduce its carbon footprint. The Trump administration has been a vocal opponent of climate change regulations, but many experts believe that the industry's efforts to downplay the risks of climate change are likely to continue to face scrutiny in the years to come.\n\nIn a statement, the American Petroleum Institute said that it was committed to working with policymakers and other stakeholders to develop solutions to address climate change, but that it would not support policies that would harm the economy or increase energy costs for consumers.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked renewed calls for increased transparency and accountability from the energy industry.

The country's credit rating has also been downgraded by major rating agencies, making it increasingly difficult for Greece to borrow money.\n\nGreece's Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, has vowed to implement reforms and austerity measures to address the country's debt crisis. However, many experts believe that the country's debt burden is unsustainable, and that a debt restructuring is inevitable.\n\nThe Greek government has been in talks with its European partners and the IMF to secure a new bailout deal, but the talks have been stalled due to disagreements over the terms of the deal.

But where do these books go after all the memory is filled up or the device gets too old? A common concern for many e-book enthusiasts! The storage of digital books on e-readers like the Nook is a topic of interest for many readers. So, what happens to your beloved e-books when the memory is filled up or the device becomes outdated?\n\nAccording to Barnes & Noble, the company behind the Nook, e-books are stored on their servers after they are purchased. This means that even if you delete an e-book from your Nook device, it is still accessible through your Barnes & Noble account. This is because the company uses a cloud-based storage system, which allows users to access their digital content from any device with an internet connection.\n\nWhen you purchase an e-book, it is downloaded to your Nook device, but the file is also stored on Barnes & Noble's servers. This means that even if you delete the e-book from your device, you can always re-download it from your account. This is a convenient feature for users who may need to reset their device or upgrade to a new one.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some e-books may not be stored on Barnes & Noble's servers. This could be the case if an e-book is purchased from a third-party seller or if it is a self-published title. In these cases, the e-book may only be stored on your Nook device, and deleting it may result in permanent loss of access.\n\nIn terms of what happens to e-books when the device becomes too old, it's largely up to the user. As devices become outdated, they may no longer be compatible with newer e-books or may experience issues with downloading and storing content. In these cases, users may need to consider upgrading to a newer device or using a different e-reader.\n\nFor those who are concerned about the longevity of their e-books, there are a few options to consider. One option is to transfer e-books to a new device using a cloud-based service like Google Drive or Dropbox. This allows users to access their e-books from any device with an internet connection, even if their original device is no longer compatible.\n\nAnother option is to use an e-book management service like Calibre, which allows users to organize and manage their e-book library across multiple devices. This can be especially useful for users who have a large collection of e-books and want to ensure that they can access them from any device.\n\nIn conclusion, the storage of e-books on devices like the Nook is a complex topic, and there are many factors to consider. While e-books may be stored on servers after they are purchased, it's still important for users to manage their digital library effectively to ensure that they can access their favorite titles for years to come.",

Bookings fell heavily in continental Europe, where German tourists shunned Turkey, but rose 1% in the UK. Thomas Cook has been hit hard since summer 2015 by terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Egypt and Turkey. The travel operator's financial performance has been impacted significantly by the decline in demand for Turkish holidays, with revenue expected to be lower than previously forecast. Thomas Cook's shares fell by 10% in early trading on the London Stock Exchange following the release of the trading update.\n\nThe company's Chief Executive, Peter Fankhauser, attributed the decline in bookings to the ongoing security concerns in Turkey, which have led to a significant reduction in tourist arrivals. \"The situation in Turkey has had a significant impact on our business, and we are seeing a decline in bookings as a result,\" he said. \"We are working closely with our partners in Turkey to try to mitigate the impact, but it is clear that the situation is having a significant effect on our business.\"\n\nThomas Cook's summer bookings excluding Turkey rose 4% compared to the same period last year, driven by strong demand for holidays in the Mediterranean and North Africa.

The company's Chief Executive, Peter Fankhauser, said that the decline in consumer spending had resulted in a decline in bookings, and that the company was working closely with its partners to try to find new ways to grow its business.\n\nIn conclusion, Thomas Cook's summer bookings fell 4% due to a slump in demand for holidays in Turkey following a series of terrorist attacks and an attempted coup. The decline in bookings was attributed to the ongoing security concerns in Turkey, which have led to a significant reduction in tourist arrivals. The company's financial performance has been impacted significantly by the decline in demand for Turkish holidays, with revenue expected to be lower than previously forecast.",

The pilots union, Balpa, can now call strike dates with two weeks' notice. However. it has said it will not set dates until after further talks with the airline, which intends to take its case to the court of appeal. The high court on Tuesday dismissed BA's argument that the strike ballot, whose result was announced on Monday, was invalid. The decision by the High Court marks a significant blow to British Airways' efforts to avoid the strike action, which could have far-reaching consequences for the airline and its passengers. The pilots' union, Balpa, had announced on Monday that 93% of its members had voted in favor of strike action in a ballot, citing concerns over pay, rostering, and working conditions.\n\nIn a statement, Balpa said it was \"pleased\" with the High Court's decision, but added that it would not set strike dates until after further talks with British Airways. The airline has indicated that it intends to take its case to the Court of Appeal, a move that could further delay the strike action.\n\nThe potential disruption to travel plans is significant, with hundreds of thousands of passengers potentially affected. British Airways operates flights to over 180 destinations worldwide, and the strike action could have a major impact on the airline's operations.\n\nThe dispute between British Airways and Balpa has been ongoing for several months, with the pilots' union seeking improvements to pay, rostering, and working conditions. The airline has offered a 5% pay increase, but Balpa has argued that this is insufficient and has called for a 10% increase.\n\nThe strike action could also have a wider impact on the UK's aviation industry, with other airlines potentially feeling the effects of the disruption. The Civil Aviation Authority has warned that the strike could cause \"significant disruption\" to air travel, and has urged passengers to check with their airlines for the latest information.\n\nIn a statement, British Airways said it was \"disappointed\" with the High Court's decision, but added that it would continue to work with Balpa to try to resolve the dispute. The airline has also urged passengers to book alternative flights if possible, and has warned that it may have to cancel some flights if the strike action goes ahead.\n\nThe dispute between British Airways and Balpa is just the latest in a series of industrial disputes to hit the UK's aviation industry in recent months. Last year, Ryanair pilots in the UK and Ireland went on strike over pay and conditions, causing disruption to thousands of passengers.\n\nThe situation is likely to remain uncertain for the time being, with both sides continuing to negotiate and the possibility of strike action still looming. Passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest information and to plan their travel accordingly.",

On Monday, Doug Kahn, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Cleveland, saw several bluish masses shifting and swelling over Ohio. ...over Ohio. Initially, Kahn thought it was a peculiar weather phenomenon, but as he continued to monitor the situation, he realized that the bluish masses were actually massive swarms of insects, specifically mosquitoes. The discovery was made possible by the advanced radar technology used by the National Weather Service, which can detect even the smallest movements of tiny creatures.\n\nAccording to Kahn, the radar system is capable of picking up signals from insects as small as a few millimeters in diameter. This increased sensitivity has allowed scientists to track and monitor insect populations in unprecedented detail, providing valuable insights into their behavior and migration patterns.\n\nThe recent surge in insect sightings is attributed to a combination of factors, including changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, as well as the expansion of urban areas and agricultural practices. As the climate continues to shift, many species of insects are adapting and migrating to new areas in search of food and suitable habitats.\n\nThe implications of this increased radar sensitivity are far-reaching, with potential applications in fields such as agriculture, ecology, and even medicine. For example, farmers could use the technology to detect early signs of pest infestations, allowing them to take proactive measures to protect their crops. Ecologists could use the data to better understand and manage ecosystems, while researchers in the medical field could use the information to track the spread of diseases carried by insects.\n\nWhile the increased visibility of insects may seem like a nuisance to some, the technology has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of these tiny creatures and their role in the ecosystem. As Doug Kahn notes, \"The radar technology is not just a novelty, it's a game-changer. It's allowing us to see the world in a whole new way, and it's opening up new avenues for research and discovery.\"",

The name Aston Martin came a year later after their prototype successfully made it around the Aston Hill Climb track in Buckinghamshire. Aston Martin took its place on the international motor racing stage by competing in the 1922 French Grand Prix but the business ran into financial trouble over the next few years and was rescued in 1926 by a group of investors. It developed a competitive range of sports cars with an increasing reputation for engineering and design, entering the Le Mans 24 Hours for the first time in 1928. Production of its road cars was stepped up in the 1930s, with 140 cars built in 1937 – the highest prewar figure. During the Second World War, Aston Martin's manufacturing facilities were converted to produce aircraft components, including wings and fuselages, for the British military. This marked a significant shift for the company, as it transitioned from producing luxury sports cars to playing a vital role in the war effort.\n\nIn the post-war period, Aston Martin resumed production of its iconic sports cars, and the company continued to innovate and push the boundaries of engineering and design. The 1950s saw the introduction of the DB2, a sleek and powerful model that solidified Aston Martin's reputation as a manufacturer of high-performance vehicles.\n\nThe 1960s were a pivotal decade for Aston Martin, marked by the introduction of the DB5, which would go on to become one of the most iconic cars in the company's history. The DB5 was featured in the 1964 James Bond film \"Goldfinger,\" cementing Aston Martin's status as a symbol of luxury and sophistication.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Aston Martin continued to produce a range of high-performance sports cars, including the V8 Vantage and the Virage. The company also expanded its operations, establishing a global network of dealerships and partnerships with other manufacturers.\n\nIn the 1990s, Aston Martin underwent a significant transformation under the leadership of Victor Gauntlett, who acquired the company in 1987. Gauntlett oversaw a major restructuring effort, which included the introduction of new models and the establishment of a global marketing strategy.\n\nIn 2007, Aston Martin was acquired by a consortium of investors, which included Ford Motor Company. This marked a new era for the company, as it continued to produce high-performance sports cars while also expanding its operations into new markets.\n\nToday, Aston Martin is one of the most respected and beloved luxury car brands in the world, with a global presence and a reputation for producing some of the most beautiful and powerful cars on the road. From its humble beginnings in a small London workshop to its current status as a global luxury brand, Aston Martin's history is a testament to the power of innovation, design, and engineering.",

Using language that evoked some of his fiercest critics, Mr. Duncan wrote in a blog post, \"I believe testing issues today are sucking the oxygen out of the room in a lot of schools,\" and he added that teachers needed time to adapt to new standards and tests that emphasize more than simply filling in bubbled answers to multiple-choice questions. Over the past four years, close to 40 states have adopted laws that tie teacher evaluations in part to the performance of their students on standardized tests. The move by Secretary Duncan comes as educators and policymakers are grappling with the challenges of implementing the Common Core State Standards, a set of rigorous academic standards designed to ensure students are college- and career-ready by the time they graduate from high school. The standards, which were adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia, aim to promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, but have been met with resistance from some teachers and parents who feel they are too focused on testing and not enough on teaching.\n\nThe delay in using test results in teacher-performance ratings is seen as a concession to the concerns of educators, who have been vocal about the need for more flexibility and support as they work to implement the new standards. Many teachers have expressed frustration with the emphasis on testing, which they feel is taking away from valuable instructional time and creating undue stress for students.\n\n\"This is a welcome development, but it's only a first step,\" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. \"What we really need is a fundamental overhaul of the evaluation system, one that takes into account the complexity of teaching and the many factors that influence student learning.\"\n\nThe decision to delay the use of test results in teacher-performance ratings is not without its critics, however. Some argue that it will undermine the accountability measures that are meant to ensure that teachers are held to high standards and that students are receiving a quality education.\n\n\"We understand that the transition to the Common Core has been challenging, but we cannot afford to let teachers off the hook,\" said Chester Finn, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a think tank that has been critical of the Obama administration's education policies. \"We need to find ways to support teachers in their efforts to improve student learning, not make excuses for their lack of progress.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, the decision to delay the use of test results in teacher-performance ratings is seen as a positive step forward by many educators and policymakers. It is a recognition that the challenges of implementing the Common Core are real and that teachers need more support and flexibility as they work to adapt to the new standards.\n\n\"This is a step in the right direction,\" said Deborah Kenny, a teacher and president of the New York State United Teachers. \"We need to focus on creating a system that supports teachers and students, not one that punishes them for not meeting arbitrary standards.\"",

The use of turquoise in Mesoamerican jewelry and art was not only a testament to its beauty, but also held significant cultural and spiritual importance. The Aztecs and Mixtecs believed that the gemstone possessed powerful spiritual properties, and it was often used in rituals and ceremonies to honor their gods and goddesses.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of turquoise use in Mesoamerican art is the iconic Aztec calendar stone, which is now housed at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. The calendar stone, also known as the \"Aztec Sun Stone,\" is a massive stone disk covered in intricate carvings and mosaics, including turquoise. The stone is believed to have been created in the 14th century and is considered one of the most important artifacts of the Aztec civilization.\n\nIn addition to its use in jewelry and art, turquoise was also highly valued for its supposed healing properties. The Aztecs believed that the gemstone had the power to cure a range of ailments, from fever to snake bites, and it was often used in traditional medicine. The Mixtecs, on the other hand, believed that turquoise had the power to ward off evil spirits and bring good luck.\n\nToday, the legacy of turquoise in Mesoamerican culture can still be seen in the many museums and cultural institutions that showcase the gemstone's use in ancient art and jewelry.

They have looked into the help-to-buy scheme in some depth but remain unsure. I've read such negative things about the help-to-buy scheme and don't want them to live a life of fear and stress should they go down this path. As a concerned parent, it's natural to have reservations about the help-to-buy scheme, especially with the mixed reviews it has received. The scheme, introduced in 2013, aims to assist first-time buyers in purchasing a home by providing a government-backed equity loan of up to 20% of the property's value. However, critics have raised concerns about the scheme's impact on the housing market, arguing that it artificially inflates prices and benefits only those who can afford to put down a significant deposit.\n\nOne of the main concerns is that the scheme can lead to a surge in demand for housing, driving up prices and making it even more difficult for others to get on the property ladder. Additionally, the scheme's focus on new-build properties has been criticized for prioritizing developers' interests over those of first-time buyers.\n\nDespite these concerns, the help-to-buy scheme has helped many first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. According to the UK's Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, over 250,000 homes have been purchased using the scheme since its introduction. However, it's essential for your sons to carefully weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.\n\nIt's also important to note that the scheme has undergone changes since its introduction. For example, the government has introduced a new version of the scheme, known as help-to-buy equity loan, which allows buyers to purchase a property worth up to £600,000, rather than the previous £300,000 limit.\n\nBefore making a decision, your sons may want to consider the following factors:\n\n* The total cost of the scheme: The equity loan is interest-free for the first five years, but after that, it will be charged at a rate of 1.75%. They should also consider the cost of the mortgage and other expenses associated with homeownership.\n* The type of property: As mentioned earlier, the scheme is primarily focused on new-build properties. Your sons should consider whether they are willing to buy a new-build property and whether it's a good fit for their needs and budget.\n* The location: The scheme is available across the UK, but the availability and affordability of properties vary significantly depending on the location. Your sons should research the local property market and consider the cost of living in the area.\n\nUltimately, whether the help-to-buy scheme is a good option for your sons depends on their individual circumstances and priorities. They should carefully consider the pros and cons, weigh their options, and seek professional advice before making a decision. As a concerned parent, it's essential to have an open and informed conversation with your sons about the scheme and its potential implications for their financial future.",

Hawking, known for his groundbreaking work on black holes and the origins of the universe, threw a party that would become the stuff of legend. But this was no ordinary soiree – it was a gathering for time travelers. Yes, you read that right. Hawking, intrigued by the concept of time travel, decided to invite guests from the future, and the invitations were not made public until after the event.\n\nThe party, held at the University of Cambridge, was a secretive affair, with only a handful of people aware of the guest list. Hawking's team reportedly sent out invitations to various points in the future, including the year 2055, but it's unclear whether any time travelers actually attended. The physicist himself remained tight-lipped about the event, fueling speculation and curiosity among the scientific community.\n\nHawking's fascination with time travel was well-documented. He had written extensively on the subject, exploring the theoretical possibilities and paradoxes associated with it. His work on black holes and the nature of space-time had also led him to ponder the idea of closed timelike curves, which could potentially allow for time travel.\n\nThe party, which was said to have featured a menu of futuristic dishes and drinks, was likely a thought-provoking experience for those who attended. Hawking's guests would have had the opportunity to engage with one of the greatest minds of the 20th century, discussing the intricacies of time travel and the implications it would have on human understanding.\n\nWhile the party remains shrouded in mystery, it serves as a testament to Hawking's boundless curiosity and his willingness to push the boundaries of human knowledge. Even in death, Hawking's legacy continues to inspire and intrigue, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and a sense of wonder that will be felt for generations to come.\n\nIn the end, the party may have been a one-time event, but its impact on our understanding of time and the universe will be felt for years to come. As Hawking himself once said, \"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\" For Hawking, the party was a chance to rise above the limitations of time and explore the infinite possibilities of the human mind.",

The 120 affected staff members, primarily based in Sydney, are set to receive support and severance packages as part of the restructuring process.\n\nGuthrie emphasized that the redundancies were a necessary step to ensure the ABC's long-term sustainability, given the current fiscal constraints and the need to adapt to changing media consumption habits. The ABC has been facing significant budget pressures in recent years, with the government's funding freeze and declining advertising revenue taking a toll on the organization.\n\nThe latest round of redundancies is part of a broader strategy aimed at streamlining the ABC's operations and reducing costs. In March, Guthrie announced a series of measures to address the organization's financial challenges, including the elimination of 200 positions and a reduction in spending on non-essential services.\n\nThe ABC has faced criticism from some quarters over the redundancies, with concerns raised about the impact on staff morale and the potential loss of experienced and skilled employees. However, Guthrie emphasized that the organization is committed to supporting affected staff members and providing them with the necessary resources to transition to new roles or pursue other opportunities.\n\nThe ABC's commitment to maintaining its editorial independence and producing high-quality content remains unwavering, Guthrie assured the Senate estimates committee. The organization is working to reduce costs without compromising its journalistic standards or its commitment to serving the Australian public.\n\nThe latest round of redundancies is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with the ABC set to emerge from the restructuring process with a more streamlined and efficient organizational structure. As the national broadcaster continues to navigate the challenges of the digital age, it remains committed to providing Australians with accurate, unbiased, and engaging content that informs, educates, and entertains.",

By several counts, Budweiser led the pack of game day advertisers with a spot that depicted its iconic Clydesdale horses rescuing a lost puppy and taking it home. The ad attracted more than 4.2 million online views by midday Monday and captured 12 percent of online activity about the Super Bowl spots, according to a measurement firm, iSpot.tv. The ad, which was part of Budweiser's \"Lost Dog\" campaign, was a nostalgic and heartwarming tale that tugged at the heartstrings of viewers. The spot showed the Clydesdales, dressed in their signature red and white uniforms, coming to the rescue of a lost puppy that had wandered away from its home. The horses gently coaxed the puppy back to its grateful owner, who was overjoyed to be reunited with its beloved pet.\n\nThe ad's success was not limited to its online views. It also generated a significant amount of buzz on social media, with many viewers taking to Twitter and Facebook to share their reactions and praise the ad. The hashtag #LostDogChallenge trended on Twitter, with many users sharing their own stories of lost pets and the joy of being reunited with them.\n\nIn contrast, a spot featuring a dead child aired during the Super Bowl and was met with widespread criticism and disgust. The ad, which was created by a non-profit organization, aimed to raise awareness about the issue of child mortality and the importance of vaccinations. However, many viewers felt that the ad was in poor taste and that it was inappropriate to air during a family-friendly event like the Super Bowl.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the ad highlights the delicate balance that advertisers must strike when creating ads for major events like the Super Bowl. While the goal is to create an ad that is memorable and impactful, it is also important to be respectful and sensitive to the audience.\n\nDespite the controversy, the Super Bowl ads continued to draw attention and praise from viewers. Many of the ads, including those from major brands like Budweiser, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi, featured humor, celebrity cameos, and other creative elements that helped to make them stand out.",

The Office for National Statistics revised down its estimate for UK growth in the fourth quarter to 0.4%, following an earlier estimate of 0.5% and missing economists' forecasts that the rate would be unchanged. It said UK production was lower than initially estimated, and said consumers were less willing to spend due to the price rises triggered by the sharp fall in the pound following the Brexit vote. The weaker end to the year weighed on the economy's performance in 2017 overall, with growth revised down from 1.8% to 1.7% – the weakest in five years. The revised growth figures come as a blow to the UK government, which had been hoping to see a strong finish to the year ahead of the country's departure from the European Union. The slowdown in growth is also likely to fuel concerns about the impact of Brexit on the economy, with many economists warning that the UK's decision to leave the EU could lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the weaker growth to a range of factors, including lower-than-expected production levels and a decline in consumer spending. The ONS said that the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote had led to higher prices for imported goods, which had reduced the purchasing power of consumers and led to a decline in spending.\n\nThe slowdown in growth is also likely to have an impact on the UK's major industries, including manufacturing and construction. The ONS said that production levels in the manufacturing sector had fallen by 0.4% in the fourth quarter, while construction output had declined by 0.3%.\n\nDespite the weaker growth, the UK's economy remains one of the strongest in the world, with many experts predicting that it will continue to grow in the coming years. However, the slowdown in growth is likely to raise concerns about the impact of Brexit on the economy, and may lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility in the coming months.\n\nIn response to the revised growth figures, the UK government has been quick to stress that the economy remains strong and that the country is well-prepared for life outside the EU. However, many economists have warned that the UK's decision to leave the EU could lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, and that the country's economy could be negatively impacted as a result.\n\nThe revised growth figures come ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU, which is currently scheduled to take place in March 2019. The UK government has been working to negotiate a new trade deal with the EU, but many experts have warned that the process could be complex and time-consuming.\n\nIn the meantime, the UK's economy is likely to remain a major focus for policymakers and economists, with many experts predicting that the country's growth will continue to be influenced by the ongoing Brexit negotiations. As the UK prepares to leave the EU, the country's economy is likely to be closely watched, and any changes to the growth rate are likely to have significant implications for the country's future economic prospects.",

        "Text": "Thousands of years ago, two microscopic spores spawned and created a monster. It grew -- up to three feet a year -- sending out dark, gnarly, threadlike organs called rhizomorphs that explored the subterranean darkness, foraging for food. Now it's a nebulous body, a tangled mat beneath the Oregon soil that occupies an area the size of three Central Parks and may weigh as much as 5,000 African elephants. The mysterious organism, known as Armillaria ostoyae, has been a topic of fascination for scientists and naturalists alike. Its sheer size and age, estimated to be around 2,400 years old, make it a marvel of the natural world. But what's most remarkable about this fungal giant is its ability to thrive in a world where most organisms would be long extinct.\n\nArmillaria ostoyae is a type of honey mushroom, and its massive size is due in part to its ability to grow by sending out underground tendrils called mycelium. These tendrils break down organic matter and absorb nutrients, allowing the fungus to grow at an incredible rate. In fact, it's estimated that the fungus grows up to three feet per year, making it one of the fastest-growing organisms on the planet.\n\nDespite its massive size, Armillaria ostoyae is a relatively harmless fungus. It doesn't harm the surrounding environment or pose a threat to human health. In fact, the fungus is often considered a beneficial organism, as it helps to break down organic matter and recycle nutrients in the soil.\n\nSo how did this massive fungus come to be? Scientists believe that Armillaria ostoyae likely originated from a single spore that germinated in the soil thousands of years ago. Over time, the fungus grew and spread, sending out tendrils to explore its surroundings and forage for food.\n\nToday, the fungus is considered a natural wonder of the world, and scientists are working to learn more about its unique characteristics and behaviors. Researchers have been studying the fungus's growth patterns, its role in the ecosystem, and even its potential uses in medicine and agriculture.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of Armillaria ostoyae is its ability to communicate with other fungi through a network of underground tendrils. Scientists have discovered that the fungus can share nutrients and information with other fungi, allowing it to coordinate its growth and behavior with other organisms.\n\nAs researchers continue to study this incredible fungus, they're gaining a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between organisms in the natural world. And while Armillaria ostoyae may not be a threat to human existence, it's a reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of life on Earth.",

The 4ft bronze of a defiant youngster, hands on hips facing down the status quo, has been dismissed as a cynical marketing stunt and celebrated as a selfie-friendly symbol of a new feminism. Now she is at the center of a court battle aimed at stopping her marching across the world. The original Fearless Girl appeared overnight in March 2017, the day before International Women's Day, in downtown New York. Facing off against the Charging Bull statue close to Wall Street, the sculpture was commissioned by State Street Global, an asset management company, to promote a fund investing in gender-diverse companies. The Fearless Girl statue has sparked a heated debate about feminism, marketing, and corporate social responsibility. Now, a court battle has been sparked to stop the statue's global expansion, citing concerns over copyright infringement and unauthorized use of the iconic image.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by a New York-based artist, claims that the Fearless Girl statue is a direct copy of her own 2015 sculpture, \"Fearless Female,\" which was exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum. The artist, who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that State Street Global failed to obtain the necessary permissions or credits for the work, and that the Fearless Girl statue is an unauthorized adaptation of her original design.\n\nState Street Global has denied the allegations, stating that the Fearless Girl statue was created by artist Kristen Visbal, who was commissioned to design the piece specifically for the company's marketing campaign. The company claims that the statue is an original work and that the artist has given her full consent for its use.\n\nThe court battle has raised questions about the ownership and intellectual property rights of public art. Art historians and critics have weighed in on the issue, with some arguing that the Fearless Girl statue is a derivative work that lacks the originality and creative vision of the artist's original piece.\n\nThe Fearless Girl statue has become a global phenomenon, with replicas popping up in cities around the world, including London, Paris, and Tokyo. The statue's global expansion has been met with both praise and criticism, with some hailing it as a powerful symbol of female empowerment and others dismissing it as a shallow marketing gimmick.\n\nAs the court battle continues, the fate of the Fearless Girl statue hangs in the balance. Will the statue be allowed to continue its global march, or will it be forced to return to its original home in New York? Only time will tell.",

On Monday, Vox Media announced that it would eliminate the 200 freelance positions at its sports outlet, SB Nation, to comply with the legislation. The law, known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5), was signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom in September 2019 and aimed to reclassify many independent contractors as employees, providing them with benefits and protections similar to those of full-time employees. While intended to benefit workers, the law has had unintended consequences for some, including the freelance bloggers at SB Nation.\n\nVox Media, the parent company of SB Nation, has been struggling to adapt to the new regulations. In a statement, the company said that the decision to eliminate the freelance positions was made after careful consideration and was necessary to ensure compliance with AB 5. The company added that it would be exploring new opportunities for its writers, including full-time positions and freelance work outside of SB Nation.\n\nThe news has sent shockwaves through the blogging community, with many writers expressing concern about their future livelihoods. \"I'm devastated,\" said one freelance blogger who was affected by the decision. \"I've been writing for SB Nation for years and have built a reputation as a respected voice in the sports community. I'm not sure what I'll do now.\"\n\nThe situation is particularly challenging for writers who rely on their freelance income as their primary source of income. \"I'm not sure how I'll make ends meet,\" said another affected writer. \"I've been struggling to find other freelance opportunities and the thought of having to take on a full-time job to make ends meet is daunting.\"\n\nThe impact of AB 5 on the blogging community is just one example of the challenges that the law has posed for companies and workers alike. While the law was intended to improve working conditions for independent contractors, it has also created uncertainty and disruption for many.\n\nAs the state of California continues to grapple with the implications of AB 5, many are left wondering what the future holds for freelance writers and bloggers. Will companies find ways to adapt to the new regulations, or will the law ultimately lead to a decline in the number of freelance opportunities available? Only time will tell.\n\nIn the meantime, the affected writers at SB Nation are left to pick up the pieces and figure out their next move. \"I just want to keep writing,\" said one affected writer. \"I love what I do and I'm not ready to give it up.

Smith\n\n\"For having established laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms.\" The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science: A Legacy of Groundbreaking Research\n\nThe Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science is one of the most prestigious awards in the field of economics, recognizing outstanding contributions to the discipline. Since its inception in 1968, the prize has been awarded to some of the most influential economists of our time. In this article, we will delve into the stories of past winners, exploring their groundbreaking research and its impact on the world of economics.\n\n2004: Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott\n\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 2004 for their contributions to dynamic macroeconomics. Their work focused on the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles. Kydland and Prescott's research challenged traditional economic theories, which assumed that policymakers could accurately predict and control economic outcomes. Instead, they demonstrated that policymakers often face uncertainty and that their decisions are influenced by the expectations of others.\n\nTheir work had significant implications for monetary policy, as it highlighted the importance of considering the potential consequences of policy decisions on future economic outcomes. This research also contributed to the development of new macroeconomic models, which have been widely used by policymakers and researchers around the world.\n\n2002: Daniel Kahneman\n\nDaniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 2002 for his work in integrating insights from psychological research into economic science. Kahneman's research focused on human judgment and decision making under uncertainty. He demonstrated that people's decisions are often influenced by biases and heuristics, rather than rational analysis of available information.\n\nKahneman's work had significant implications for the field of economics, as it challenged traditional assumptions about human behavior. His research showed that people are not always rational decision-makers, and that cognitive biases can have significant effects on economic outcomes. This work has been widely applied in fields such as finance, marketing, and public policy.\n\n2002: Vernon L. Smith\n\nVernon L. Smith was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 2002 for his work in establishing laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis. Smith's research focused on the study of alternative market mechanisms, including auctions and markets with multiple equilibria.\n\nSmith's work had significant implications for the field of economics, as it provided new insights into the behavior of markets and the role of institutions in shaping economic outcomes. His research demonstrated that markets can be highly inefficient, and that institutions can play a critical role in improving economic outcomes. This work has been widely applied in fields such as finance, labor economics, and public policy.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science is a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the importance of interdisciplinary research. The winners of this prize have made significant contributions to our understanding of the economy, and their work has had far-reaching implications for fields such as finance, marketing, and public policy.\n\nAs we look to the future, it is clear that the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science will continue to recognize and reward groundbreaking research in the field of economics. The prize serves as a reminder of the importance of advancing our understanding of the economy, and of the potential for economics to improve the human condition.",

The condiment's sinus-burning kick comes from a chemical compound called allyl isothiocyanate, or AITC, that actively damages proteins within cells. Scientists have long been fascinated by the unique properties of wasabi, and a new study published in the journal Science has shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind its infamous burning sensation.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Berkeley, used advanced imaging techniques to visualize the effects of AITC on human cells. They found that the compound binds to a specific protein in the cell membrane, triggering a cascade of chemical reactions that ultimately lead to the destruction of cellular proteins.\n\n\"It's like a tiny little bomb goes off inside the cell,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead author of the study. \"The AITC molecule is like a key that unlocks a specific pathway, allowing the cell to release a flood of calcium ions and activate enzymes that break down proteins.\"\n\nBut why do humans respond so strongly to wasabi, while other animals seem to be immune? The researchers believe that it's because humans have a unique genetic adaptation that makes us more sensitive to the compound.\n\n\"We found that humans have a specific variant of the gene that codes for the protein receptor that AITC binds to,\" explained Dr. Rodriguez. \"This variant is more common in humans than in other animals, which may explain why we're so sensitive to wasabi's effects.\"\n\nThe study's findings could have implications for the development of new painkillers and treatments for conditions such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis, where inflammation and protein degradation play a key role.\n\nIn the meantime, wasabi enthusiasts can rest assured that their love of the spicy condiment is rooted in a deep understanding of the human body's intricate chemistry.\n\n\"It's amazing to think that something as simple as a bite of wasabi can trigger such a complex and fascinating response in our bodies,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"And who knows? Maybe one day we'll be able to harness the power of wasabi to create new medicines that can help us feel better.\"",

        "Text": "I reported on Monday that the Buenos Aires Herald, the only English-language daily newspaper in Latin America, was to become a weekly. Why, asked an emailer, should we care what happens in Argentina? Leaving aside the chauvinistic rudeness, by recording what is happening in media elsewhere we are better able to perceive what the Herald rightly calls \"a worldwide phenomenon\". The central point to be learned from the Herald's leading article on Wednesday, is universal: journalism is in crisis. The article goes on to highlight the struggles faced by the Buenos Aires Herald, which has been in operation for over 130 years, as a testament to the enduring importance of quality journalism. However, the decision to transition from a daily to a weekly publication is a stark reminder of the financial and structural challenges that many news organizations are facing globally.\n\nAccording to the Herald's editorial, the move is a necessary response to the decline in advertising revenue and the increasing costs of producing a daily newspaper. This trend is not unique to Argentina or even Latin America, but is a widespread phenomenon that is affecting news organizations across the world.\n\nThe article notes that the crisis in journalism is multifaceted, with factors such as the rise of social media, the decline of print circulation, and the increasing costs of producing high-quality content all contributing to the struggles faced by news organizations. However, the article also emphasizes the importance of quality journalism in holding those in power accountable and providing a platform for marginalized voices to be heard.\n\nIn this sense, the Herald's decision to become a weekly publication is not just a reflection of the challenges facing the newspaper industry, but also a testament to the enduring importance of quality journalism in a rapidly changing world. As the article concludes, the crisis in journalism is a global phenomenon that requires a global response, and it is only by working together that we can ensure the continued viability of quality journalism in the years to come.\n\nThe article ends with a call to action, urging readers to support quality journalism and to demand better from their news organizations. It also highlights the importance of holding those in power accountable and providing a platform for marginalized voices to be heard.",

        "Text": "Facebook is launching a range of new tools in an effort to \"put people in more control over their privacy\" in the buildup to new EU regulations that tighten up data protection. The changes come after a troubling two weeks for the company, which is battling with the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica files. At least one of the new features, a unified privacy dashboard, was previously discussed by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, back in January. \"The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,\" two Facebook executives wrote in a blogpost announcing the changes. The new tools, which will be rolled out over the coming weeks, aim to give users more transparency and control over how their personal data is used. The unified privacy dashboard will provide a single place for users to view and manage their privacy settings, making it easier for them to understand how their data is being used and to make informed decisions about how it is shared.\n\nAnother new feature is a \"data use\" policy that will clearly outline how Facebook uses and shares user data. This policy will be presented to users in a clear and concise manner, making it easier for them to understand how their data is being used and to make informed decisions about how it is shared.\n\nFacebook is also introducing a new \"access token\" feature, which will allow users to revoke access to their data from third-party apps. This feature will give users more control over who has access to their data and will help to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nIn addition to these new features, Facebook is also increasing the number of data protection officers it has in place. These officers will be responsible for ensuring that Facebook's data protection policies are being followed and for investigating any data breaches that may occur.\n\nThe changes come as Facebook faces increased scrutiny over its handling of user data. The company has faced criticism over its role in allowing Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, to harvest the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent. Facebook has also faced criticism over its handling of data breaches, including a recent breach that affected 50 million users.\n\n\"We recognize that we have more work to do to earn back the trust of our users,\" said two Facebook executives in a blog post announcing the changes. \"We are committed to transparency and accountability, and we will continue to work to ensure that our users have the control and protection they deserve.\"\n\nThe changes are part of Facebook's efforts to comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on May 25. The GDPR requires companies to provide users with more transparency and control over how their data is used, and to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their personal data.\n\nFacebook's efforts to comply with the GDPR are not without controversy. The company has faced criticism over its handling of user data and its efforts to comply with the regulation. Some have argued that Facebook's efforts to comply with the GDPR are insufficient and that the company is not doing enough to protect user data.\n\nDespite the controversy, Facebook's efforts to comply with the GDPR are a step in the right direction. The company's new tools and features will give users more control over how their data is used and will help to increase transparency and accountability. As the company continues to work to earn back the trust of its users, these changes are an important step towards rebuilding that trust.",

        "Text": "The UK-listed drugmaker Shire, known for its ADHD hyperactivity drug Adderall, has recommended a £46bn takeover deal by Japan's biggest pharma company, Takeda. If approved by investors, it would be one of the biggest pharmaceuticals deals ever, ranking behind Pfizer's $112bn takeover of Warner Lambert in 2000. The stock and cash offer values Shire at £49 a share, about £5 more than Takeda's initial bid. The proposed takeover deal, which has been recommended by Shire's board of directors, is expected to create a global pharmaceutical powerhouse with a combined market value of over £60 billion. The deal would also give Takeda a significant presence in the US market, where Shire has a strong portfolio of products.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Takeda would acquire all of Shire's outstanding shares for £49 each, consisting of £35 in cash and £14 in Takeda shares. The offer represents a premium of around 56% to Shire's closing price on Friday, and is higher than Takeda's initial bid of £44 per share.\n\nShire's CEO, Flemming Ornskov, said in a statement that the deal would be \"transformative\" for the company, allowing it to accelerate its growth strategy and expand its presence in key markets. He added that the deal would also provide opportunities for Shire's employees to join a larger and more diversified company.\n\nTakeda's CEO, Christophe Weber, said that the acquisition would be a \"strategic fit\" for the company, allowing it to strengthen its position in the global pharmaceutical market. He added that Takeda would maintain Shire's operations and management structure, and that the deal would not result in significant job losses.\n\nThe deal is subject to regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the second half of 2023. If approved, it would be one of the biggest pharmaceutical deals in history, and would mark a significant milestone for Takeda's growth strategy.\n\nThe proposed takeover has been welcomed by many investors, who see the deal as a positive development for both companies. Shire's shares rose by over 5% on Monday, following the announcement, while Takeda's shares fell by around 2%.\n\nHowever, some analysts have expressed concerns about the deal, citing the potential for regulatory hurdles and the impact on Takeda's debt levels. Takeda would need to raise around £20 billion to finance the deal, which could put pressure on its balance sheet.\n\nDespite these concerns, many experts believe that the deal would be a positive development for the pharmaceutical industry, and would create a more competitive and innovative market. The deal would also provide opportunities for patients to access new and innovative treatments, and would help to drive medical progress.\n\nThe proposed takeover of Shire by Takeda is a significant development in the pharmaceutical industry, and would have far-reaching implications for both companies and their stakeholders. As the deal moves forward, it will be closely watched by investors, analysts, and patients around the world.",

        "Text": "They may have had more than a sneaking suspicion that it was the case, but now working mothers have the data to back it up: they are indeed more stressed than other people – 18% more, in fact. And that figure rises to 40% for those with two children, according to a major study that analysed 11 key indicators of chronic stress levels. Professor Tarani Chandola, of Manchester University, and Dr Cara Booker, Professor Meena Kumari and Professor Michaela Benzeval, of the Institute for Social and Economic Research at Essex University, examined biological data taken by nurses from 6,025 participants in the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, the largest survey of its kind in the world. The study, published in the journal Social Science and Medicine, found that working mothers experienced higher levels of stress across multiple indicators, including cortisol levels, blood pressure, and self-reported stress levels. The researchers controlled for factors such as age, education, and socioeconomic status to ensure that the results were not skewed by demographic differences.\n\nOne of the most striking findings was the significant difference in cortisol levels between working mothers and other groups. Cortisol is a hormone released in response to stress, and higher levels can have negative effects on physical and mental health. The study found that working mothers had an average cortisol level 18% higher than the general population, while those with two children had a whopping 40% higher level.\n\n\"This study highlights the often-overlooked impact of childcare responsibilities on women's health and wellbeing,\" said Professor Tarani Chandola, lead author of the study. \"Working mothers are shouldering a significant burden, and it's essential that policymakers and employers take notice.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that working mothers were more likely to experience sleep disturbances, fatigue, and depression than other groups. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown the negative effects of work-life conflict on mental and physical health.\n\nSo, what can be done to alleviate the stress experienced by working mothers? The study's authors suggest that employers could play a crucial role by offering flexible working arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, to help working mothers better manage their responsibilities.\n\n\"Employers can make a real difference by recognizing the challenges faced by working mothers and providing support,\" said Dr. Cara Booker, co-author of the study. \"This could include offering childcare support, such as on-site childcare or childcare vouchers, or simply being more understanding of the needs of working mothers.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for policymakers, who are grappling with issues such as childcare support, parental leave, and equal pay. As the study's authors note, the stress experienced by working mothers is not just a personal issue, but also has broader social and economic implications.\n\n\"This study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by working mothers,\" said Professor Meena Kumari, co-author of the study. \"We need to move beyond simplistic solutions and develop policies that truly support working mothers and their families.\"\n\nIn the meantime, working mothers can take heart in knowing that they are not alone in their struggles. The study's findings are a powerful reminder that the challenges they face are real, and that it's time for society to take notice and take action.",

President Trump has made American jobs -- keeping them, promoting them, bringing them back -- a central theme of his young presidency. Since taking office, Trump has touted his efforts to revitalize the US economy and create new employment opportunities, often emphasizing the importance of American-made goods and services.\n\nOne of the key initiatives aimed at boosting job growth is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a sweeping tax overhaul passed in December 2017. The legislation reduced corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, a move Trump claimed would incentivize businesses to invest in the US and create more jobs. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the tax cuts have led to a significant increase in economic growth, with the unemployment rate dipping to a 17-year low of 3.9% in May 2018.\n\nHowever, not all experts agree that the tax cuts are the primary driver of job growth. Many economists argue that the strong US labor market is largely due to a combination of factors, including low interest rates, a growing global economy, and an aging population. Additionally, some critics contend that the tax cuts have disproportionately benefited large corporations and wealthy individuals, rather than small businesses and working-class Americans.\n\nDespite these criticisms, Trump has continued to tout his job-creation efforts, often highlighting specific industries and companies that have announced new investments or expansions in the US. For example, in April 2018, Trump celebrated the announcement by Harley-Davidson, the iconic American motorcycle manufacturer, that it would be investing $80 million in its US operations and adding 100 new jobs.\n\nThe President has also focused on revitalizing American manufacturing, a sector that has been a cornerstone of the US economy for decades. In March 2018, Trump launched the \"Made in America\" week initiative, which aimed to promote American-made goods and services and encourage businesses to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. The initiative included a series of events and announcements, including the signing of an executive order aimed at streamlining the regulatory process for companies that want to bring manufacturing operations back to the US.\n\nWhile some critics have questioned the effectiveness of Trump's job-creation efforts, there is no denying that the US economy has experienced a significant surge in job growth during his presidency. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US added over 2.5 million new jobs in 2018, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.9% by the end of the year. As the economy continues to grow and evolve, it remains to be seen whether Trump's job-creation initiatives will continue to pay off and whether his administration will be able to build on this momentum in the years to come.",
