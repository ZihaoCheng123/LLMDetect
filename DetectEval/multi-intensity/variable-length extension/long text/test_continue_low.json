        "Text": "California's escalating housing costs have yielded epic commutes and a rising tide of homelessness. Now they are close to producing a political milestone: a vast expansion of tenant-protection laws that would cap rents statewide. On Tuesday, the State Senate voted to advance a bill to limit rent increases to 5 percent a year plus a cost-of-living adjustment. The State Assembly, the Legislature's lower house, could give final approval as early as Wednesday, though passage is uncertain. The legislation is the latest in a series of measures that have swept through state and local governments this year to regulate rents and strengthen tenant rights. For decades, such provisions have been mostly limited to a relative handful of apartments in the nation's big cities. \"Passing tenant legislation in Sacramento is incredibly difficult,\" said Assemblyman David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat who is the bill's author. \"But we're in the midst of the worst housing crisis in our state's history, and I think my colleagues and policymakers understand we have to do something differently.\" All this has opened the door for rent control, historically a lost cause in Sacramento but a legislative priority of Gov. Gavin Newsom in his first year in office. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, was previously mayor of San Francisco, where the housing pinch has been particularly acute. The bill is technically an anti-gouging measure that borrows language from the typically short-term price caps imposed after disasters like fires and floods. It would extend price protections to an estimated eight million tenants, though only a small fraction now face annual rent increases in excess of the bill's limit. [Read more: How older tenants on fixed incomes could remain vulnerable, even with rent caps.] The bill's passage would mark a significant shift in California's approach to addressing the state's housing crisis, which has been exacerbated by a severe shortage of affordable housing and a surge in gentrification. If signed into law, the bill would make California the first state in the country to implement a statewide rent cap, a move that has been hailed by tenant advocates and criticized by real estate industry groups.\n\nThe bill's author, Assemblyman David Chiu, has argued that the legislation is necessary to protect tenants from rapid rent increases that have left many struggling to make ends meet. \"This bill is about fairness and affordability,\" Chiu said in a statement. \"Tenants should not have to choose between paying their rent and paying for basic necessities like food and healthcare.\"\n\nThe bill's language is modeled after anti-gouging measures that have been implemented after natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. These measures typically impose temporary price caps on essential goods and services to prevent price gouging and ensure that affected communities have access to basic necessities.\n\nIn the case of the rent cap bill, the 5 percent annual increase would be tied to the cost of living adjustment, which would ensure that rent increases are tied to inflation and other economic factors. The bill would also exempt certain types of properties, such as single-family homes and new construction, from the rent cap.\n\nWhile the bill has been praised by tenant advocates, it has also faced opposition from real estate industry groups, which argue that it would stifle investment in new housing development and drive up construction costs. \"This bill is a solution in search of a problem,\" said Dan Schnur, a professor at the University of Southern California and a former Republican strategist. \"It's going to make it harder for people to build new housing, which is exactly what we need to do to address the housing crisis.\"\n\nThe bill's fate remains uncertain, as it still needs to pass the State Assembly and be signed into law by Governor Newsom. However, if passed, it could have significant implications for the state's housing market and the millions of tenants who are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIn the meantime, tenant advocates are urging the State Assembly to pass the bill and send it to the Governor's desk. \"This bill is a critical step towards addressing the housing crisis in California,\" said Dean Preston, the executive director of Tenants Together, a statewide tenant advocacy group. \"We urge the State Assembly to pass this bill and give tenants the protections they need to stay in their homes.\"",

        "Text": "The British parliament now has two Tory parties and two Labour parties. But the Conservatives will find it far easier to heal the breach than Labour. That's because the Tory split is mainly about personalities and partially about strategy. By contrast, the Labour split is structural and ideological. Back in December, I wrote that Labour was in the process of falling apart and that its famous \"broad church\" could not possibly hold together for much longer. Now it is coming to pass. Given that the overwhelming majority of MPs did not support Jeremy Corbyn it was inevitable that, at some stage, they would engineer a coup. The Brexit vote provided them with an opportunity. Replacing a leader is, however, entirely to miss the point. The chasm in the Labour party cannot be bridged by some kind of political fix at Westminster. MPs who believe Corbyn to be the main problem, and his replacement to be the beginning of a cure for the party's ills, are fooling themselves. Their newspaper voice, the Daily Mirror, is also wasting newsprint with its call for Corbyn to \"go now\". They misunderstand the profound problem across the country among people who are regarded as \"traditional\" Labour voters (and traditional Mirror readers). It is an understatement to say there is a disconnect between the bulk of the party's members in parliament, whether in the Commons or the Lords, and the electorate. Gradually, older Labour voters are peeling away from the party they used to support as a matter of course. That was clear from the numbers willing to switch to Ukip at the last general election. This disconnect is not just about Corbyn, but about the party's shift to the left and its perceived abandonment of traditional Labour values. The party's attempts to rebrand itself as a champion of social justice and equality, while admirable in intent, have alienated many of its core supporters who feel that the party has lost touch with its working-class roots.\n\nThe Labour party's leadership has been slow to recognize the scale of the problem, and its response has been piecemeal and ineffective. The party's reliance on Momentum, a left-wing activist group, has further exacerbated the issue, as many traditional Labour voters feel that the party is no longer representing their interests.\n\nThe situation is made worse by the fact that many Labour MPs are out of touch with their constituents. A recent survey found that only 15% of Labour MPs live in the same constituency as they did before the 2010 general election, while 60% of Conservative MPs do. This lack of connection to the local community means that Labour MPs are often unable to understand the concerns and values of their constituents, let alone represent them effectively.\n\nIn contrast, the Conservative party's split is largely a matter of personalities and strategy. While there are certainly ideological differences between the two factions, they are not as profound as those within the Labour party. The Conservative party's leadership has been able to paper over its internal divisions by focusing on the bigger picture â€“ namely, the need to deliver Brexit and win the next general election.\n\nThe Labour party's failure to address its structural and ideological problems will only continue to exacerbate its decline. Unless the party can find a way to reconnect with its traditional voters and reconnect with its roots, it will continue to hemorrhage support and struggle to win elections. The question is, can the party's leadership find a way to bridge the chasm between the party's MPs and its voters, or will it continue to drift further and further away from the very people it is supposed to represent? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "The Sun is face a trial over phone hacking for the first time after a high court judge ruled there was enough evidence for claims against the newspaper to be heard in a civil court. Four claimants, including entertainer Les Dennis, allege that 40 articles printed in the tabloid were obtained through phone hacking, including some while the paper was edited by Rebekah Brooks. Brooks, who was cleared of all phone-hacking charges in a trial which ended in 2014, returned in September as chief executive of News UK, publisher of the Sun as well as the Times and Sunday Times. The phone-hacking revelations led to the closure of the News of the World, ultimately owned by Rupert Murdoch. News UK has insisted the practice did not take place at the Sun. Mr Justice Mann said on Thursday that a trial to hear the claims should go ahead after considering evidence including allegations that senior executives and journalists who could have known about phone hacking at the News of the World moved to the Sun. The decision by Mr. Justice Mann marks a significant turning point in the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, which has plagued the media industry for over a decade. The claimants, who are seeking damages for the alleged breaches of their privacy, will now have the opportunity to present their cases in court and seek justice.\n\nThe allegations against the Sun are particularly noteworthy given the paper's close ties to News UK's parent company, News Corp. Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul and News Corp's chairman, has faced intense scrutiny over his company's handling of the phone-hacking scandal, which has led to the closure of several publications and the resignation of several high-profile executives.\n\nRebekah Brooks, who was cleared of phone-hacking charges in 2014, has returned to News UK as chief executive, sparking concerns about the company's commitment to transparency and accountability. The allegations against the Sun, which are said to have taken place during Brooks' previous tenure as editor, have raised questions about whether the company has truly learned from its past mistakes.\n\nThe trial is expected to be a lengthy and complex process, with both sides likely to present a significant amount of evidence and testimony. The claimants will need to prove that the Sun engaged in phone-hacking and that the newspaper's actions caused them harm, while the Sun will need to demonstrate that it did not engage in such practices and that any alleged breaches were isolated incidents.\n\nThe outcome of the trial will have significant implications for the media industry, as it will set a precedent for how newspapers and other media outlets are held accountable for their actions. The case will also shed light on the extent to which phone-hacking was tolerated or encouraged within the industry, and whether there were any systemic failures that allowed the practice to continue for so long.\n\nIn a statement, News UK said that it was \"disappointed\" by the decision to proceed with the trial and maintained that the allegations were \"without merit.\" The company also reiterated its commitment to transparency and accountability, saying that it would \"cooperate fully\" with the legal process and \"do everything in its power\" to ensure that the truth is revealed.\n\nThe trial is expected to begin in the coming months, and will be closely watched by the media and the public. As the case unfolds, it will be important to remember the human impact of phone-hacking, and the devastating consequences that it has had for the individuals affected.",

I was the sort of child who would spend time rolling up balls of all different kinds of fluff and that would be my little family. My friends were amazed that I became a TV presenter. I was not a big talker at school â€“ I never liked people seeing my braces, so I walked around with my sleeves pulled over my hands and my hands over my mouth in case anybody saw me smiling. In a group of people I knew you couldn't shut me up, but it took quite a long time until I was comfortable enough to speak openly. I've been really crap at my job. In the beginning I was terrible, although I enjoyed doing it, which was kind of more upsetting. I spoke in a posh telephone voice, and I was so unnatural: I fixated on remembering lines rather than just speaking. It took me two years working away from the camera in a TV studio until I went back to presenting. Being a mum can be utterly overwhelming. As a TV presenter, I have had my fair share of challenges and struggles, but becoming a mother has brought a whole new level of complexity to my life. Despite my initial reservations, I have found that being a mom has actually helped me to grow and develop as a person, and has even influenced my approach to my work.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises for me has been the sense of calm and confidence that comes with being a mom. As a TV presenter, I was always trying to be perfect, to get everything just right, and to make sure that I didn't make any mistakes on camera. But as a mom, I've learned to let go of that need for perfection and to focus on just being present and enjoying the moment.\n\nOf course, being a mom is not without its challenges. There are days when I feel like I'm just trying to keep my head above water, and when I'm exhausted and overwhelmed. But despite the difficulties, I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. Being a mom has taught me so much about myself and about the world, and has given me a sense of purpose and fulfillment that I never knew was possible.\n\nAs I look back on my journey, I am grateful for the twists and turns that have brought me to where I am today. From being a shy and introverted child to becoming a confident and outgoing TV presenter, and from there to becoming a mom, I have learned to embrace change and to find the beauty in the unexpected. And as I continue on this journey, I am excited to see what the future holds, and to find new ways to grow and learn as a person and as a mom.",

Justin Madders, Labour MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston, said the carmaker's comments were a direct reaction to the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, \"stuffing his cabinet with people who are committed to a no-deal Brexit\". Madders said: \"The challenge is for the new government to explain what they're going to do to avoid catastrophic-level job losses in my part of the world. If it shut, I think that would shatter a lot of confidence and morale in the area.\" PSA, the French carmaker that owns Vauxhall, on Sunday made explicit its pledge to pull all production from the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire and switch to a site in mainland Europe if Brexit renders the factory unprofitable. Its chief executive, Carlos Tavares, said the business had lined up an alternative location in southern Europe to build Vauxhall Astra and Opel Astra cars if the UK did not achieve a satisfactory outcome when leaving the EU. The threat of job losses has sent shockwaves through the local community, with many residents and workers at the Ellesmere Port factory expressing their concerns and fears about the potential consequences. The factory, which has been in operation for over 60 years, employs around 2,000 people and is a significant contributor to the local economy.\n\nLocal residents have taken to social media to express their dismay and frustration at the news, with many calling on the government to take immediate action to prevent the factory from shutting down. \"This is a disaster waiting to happen,\" said one resident. \"We can't let our government let this happen. We need to take a stand and fight for our jobs.\"\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns about the impact on the local community, with many residents relying on the factory for employment and economic stability. \"If the factory closes, it will have a devastating impact on our community,\" said another resident. \"We need to find a way to keep it open and ensure that our community remains thriving.\"\n\nThe news has also sparked a debate about the potential consequences of a no-deal Brexit, with many experts warning of the potential economic and social impacts of such an outcome. \"A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK economy,\" said one expert. \"It would lead to job losses, economic instability, and a decline in living standards. We need to avoid this outcome at all costs.\"\n\nIn response to the news, the UK government has said that it is working to ensure that the country's car industry remains competitive and that the necessary steps are being taken to mitigate the potential impacts of Brexit. \"We understand the concerns of the car industry and are working to ensure that the UK remains a competitive and attractive place for businesses to invest,\" said a government spokesperson. \"We will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that the UK's car industry remains strong and competitive.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, residents and workers at the Ellesmere Port factory remain hopeful that a solution can be found to prevent the factory from shutting down. \"We are doing everything we can to keep the factory open,\" said one worker. \"We are working closely with the government and the company to find a solution that works for everyone. We are confident that we can find a way forward and keep the factory open.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the local community is coming together to support the workers and residents affected by the news. \"We are a tight-knit community and we will do everything we can to support each other,\" said one resident. \"We will work together to find a solution and keep our community thriving.\"",

The chancellor pledged in last year's election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank â€“ just under 10% of the company â€“ to the public this spring. However, he decided to delay the sale following the sharp sell-off in stock markets in recent weeks. The sale will not happen until after Easter, it is understood. Osborne said: \"I want to create a share-owning democracy. The decision to delay the sale comes as a surprise to many, as the UK's financial markets have been experiencing a period of relative stability in recent months.

John Lewis Finance revamped its website in early October, asking cardholders to re-register. I did so. Then, two weeks ago, I realised that my card expired this month and a replacement had not arrived. It was apparent from the online posts about failed payments and direct debit problems that all was not hunky-dory. John Lewis said there was a \"high volume of calls\" and warned of a wait of up to 45 minutes. After 70 minutes I gave up and instead tried secure messaging, which then collapsed, so I sent a letter of complaint and asked that my card be mailed within a week. So far this has not arrived, although my account has said for several weeks that a card is on its way. Repayment day resulted in my \"faster\" payment being returned. The Frustrations of a Revamped Credit Card System: A John Lewis Partnership Cardholder's Plight\n\nAs I struggled to get in touch with John Lewis Finance's customer service, I couldn't help but wonder how many others were facing similar issues. The revamped website, intended to streamline the process, seemed to have created a perfect storm of confusion and frustration.\n\nAccording to a John Lewis spokesperson, the company experienced an unprecedented volume of calls and online inquiries following the website update. This surge in demand led to long wait times, with some customers waiting up to 45 minutes to speak with a representative. For those who managed to get through, the experience was often marred by technical issues, such as secure messaging failures.\n\nMy own experience was a prime example of these problems. After waiting 70 minutes to speak with a representative, I was left with no choice but to send a letter of complaint and request a replacement card. Despite this, my account continued to show that a new card was on its way, only for it to remain elusive.\n\nThe consequences of these issues were felt acutely on repayment day, when my \"faster\" payment was returned due to the lack of a functioning card. This was a stark reminder of the importance of reliable payment processing and the need for companies to prioritize customer service during times of change.\n\nIn response to the outcry, John Lewis Finance has apologized for the inconvenience and promised to work on resolving the issues as quickly as possible. The company has also implemented measures to improve its customer service, including additional staff and enhanced technical support.\n\nWhile these efforts are welcome, they do little to alleviate the frustration and anxiety caused by the recent problems. As a customer, it is essential to feel confident in the ability of a company to deliver a seamless and efficient service. The recent issues with the John Lewis Partnership credit card have fallen short of this standard, leaving many customers feeling let down and frustrated.\n\nIn the coming weeks, it will be crucial for John Lewis Finance to demonstrate its commitment to resolving these issues and restoring customer trust. Until then, customers will continue to suffer the consequences of a revamped system that seems to have lost its way.",

As the Ryanair cancellation crisis has gone from bad to worse, despite the chief executive's insistence that it wouldn't, almost nobody is asking whether he is still the right person for the job. The question would be asked at most listed companies in Ryanair's position. The second round of cancellations will affect 18,000 flights on 34 routes between November 2017 and March 2018, which suggests the original rostering plans weren't merely wrong, but miles off target. The company has also provoked the fury of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has said Ryanair misled passengers about their legal rights. The regulator set a deadline for compliance of 5pm on Friday. And Ryanair has made a major strategic U-turn by walking away from its pursuit of the bankrupt Italian airline Alitalia. The lack of scrutiny on O'Leary's leadership is all the more surprising given the severity of the crisis. Ryanair's cancellation debacle has left thousands of passengers stranded, with many more facing uncertainty about their travel plans. The airline's failure to adequately plan and communicate its rostering has led to a perfect storm of chaos, with flights being cancelled at the last minute and passengers being left in the dark.\n\nBut O'Leary's unscathed reputation is not the only anomaly in this crisis. The company's decision to abandon its pursuit of Alitalia, a move that would have given it a significant foothold in the European market, has raised eyebrows. Analysts are questioning whether Ryanair's leadership is capable of making sound strategic decisions, particularly in the face of adversity.\n\nThe airline's botched handling of the cancellation crisis has also sparked concerns about its ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Ryanair's rigid approach to rostering, which relies heavily on manual calculations rather than technology, has been criticized for being inflexible and prone to errors. The company's refusal to invest in modern technology has left it struggling to keep pace with the demands of a rapidly changing industry.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) intervention has added to the pressure on Ryanair, with the regulator warning the airline that it must comply with its rules and regulations by the end of the week. The CAA's actions are a stark reminder that Ryanair is not above the law, and that its actions have consequences.\n\nAs the dust settles on the latest round of cancellations, it is clear that Ryanair faces a daunting task in rebuilding its reputation and restoring confidence in its ability to operate effectively. The airline's leadership must take responsibility for the crisis and outline a clear plan for how it intends to prevent similar disasters in the future. Anything less would be unacceptable.\n\nIn the meantime, passengers are left to pick up the pieces and wonder what went wrong. The cancellation crisis has exposed the cracks in Ryanair's operation, and it is up to the airline's leadership to fix them before it's too late. The question remains: is Michael O'Leary still the right person for the job? Only time will tell.",

Guardian Australia can reveal Adani was granted a reissued water licence to take up to 12.5bn litres a year from the Suttor River by the Queensland government on 29 May. The deadline for the $18.5m outstanding payment has now been pushed back until mid-2021. The company had previously been given a year's extension beyond the initial July 2018 payment deadline. Adani's own water modelling shows it requires 3.35bn litres of water during the first year of construction. Adani says the reason for the delay is because the company is working through the implications of \"legal challenges by activist groups\" to its water scheme, and will pay when those matters are finalised. The company has also recently sought and been granted approval by the federal government for a two-year extension to the deadline to legally acquire properties to be used as environmental offsets for the western portion of its rail corridor. Adani will have to negotiate with landholders and pay compensation to secure the offset areas. Since announcing it had secured finance from within the Adani group to build a scaled-down version of the Carmichael mine in November 2018, Adani's Australian operation aggressively sought to pressure governments to sign off on outstanding environmental approvals. The move has raised concerns among environmental groups and local communities, who have long been critical of the mine's potential impacts on the Great Barrier Reef and the Suttor River. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the delay in payment was a \"clear indication\" that Adani's claims of having secured finance from its Indian parent were \"unsubstantiated\".\n\n\"This is a clear case of Adani trying to delay and dodge its financial obligations to the Queensland government,\" said the foundation's chief executive, Keith Munro. \"It's unacceptable that Adani is trying to wriggle out of its commitments while at the same time seeking to lock in environmental approvals for its destructive project.\"\n\nThe Queensland government has come under fire for its handling of the Carmichael mine, with many critics arguing that it has given Adani too much leeway and failed to adequately protect the environment. The state's environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, has defended the government's decision to grant Adani the reissued water licence, saying it was done in accordance with the company's water management plan.\n\nHowever, environmental groups are skeptical of the plan, citing concerns about the mine's potential impacts on the Suttor River and the surrounding ecosystem. The river is a vital habitat for many endangered species, including the critically endangered mahogany glider.\n\nAdani has faced numerous challenges and delays in its efforts to develop the Carmichael mine, including opposition from local communities and environmental groups. The company has also been criticized for its handling of indigenous relations, with many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities expressing concerns about the mine's potential impacts on their lands and cultures.\n\nThe Australian government has also faced criticism for its support of the Carmichael mine, with many arguing that it has prioritized the interests of big business over the environment and local communities. The government has defended its decision to support the mine, saying it will create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the region.\n\nAs the debate over the Carmichael mine continues, environmental groups are calling on the Queensland government to re-examine its decision to grant Adani the reissued water licence and to take a closer look at the company's financial arrangements. They are also urging the Australian government to rethink its support for the mine and to prioritize the protection of the environment and local communities.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Carmichael mine is just the latest in a long line of disputes between Adani and environmental groups, and it is likely to continue to be a major point of contention in the coming months and years. As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the fate of the Carmichael mine will have significant implications for the environment, local communities, and the future of the Great Barrier Reef.",

And because they're mostly paved, they do little to capture one of the city's most prized resources: water. Following the examples set by Chicago, Seattle and other cities, Los Angeles is working to transform these narrow spaces into networks of green alleys. The main purpose, beginning with a green alley network in the South Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles, is to capture some of the storm water that is otherwise lost. \"In my mind, the green alley project has a much greater value in Los Angeles than it does in other places that don't have a water shortage,\" said Heather Repenning, a commissioner of the city's Board of Public Works. As California enters the fifth year of its drought, city officials hope that these alleys save as many drops as possible, as part of a larger project to increase the storm water captured, to 50 billion gallons by 2035 from 8.8 billion gallons now. The green alley project is a collaborative effort between the city's Public Works Department, the Bureau of Engineering, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The initial phase, which began in 2020, focuses on the South Park neighborhood, where crews are transforming 10 blocks of alleys into lush green spaces.\n\nThe transformation involves installing rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavers that allow rainwater to soak into the ground, reducing the amount of stormwater that flows into the city's storm drains and ultimately into the ocean. The alleys will also feature native plants, trees, and public art installations, making them more aesthetically pleasing and community-friendly.\n\nThe city plans to expand the green alley network to other neighborhoods, with a goal of covering 20% of the city's alleyways by 2025. This will not only help to capture more stormwater but also improve air quality, reduce urban heat island effects, and provide habitat for local wildlife.\n\nRepenning emphasized the importance of the green alley project in addressing the city's water shortage. \"Los Angeles is a city that's built on a desert, and we're constantly struggling to find ways to conserve water,\" she said. \"By capturing more stormwater, we're reducing the amount of water that's wasted and increasing our water supply.\"\n\nThe project has also received support from local residents, who see the benefits of having more green spaces in their neighborhoods. \"It's not just about capturing stormwater; it's about creating a more livable city,\" said Maria Rodriguez, a South Park resident who has been involved in the planning process. \"We're excited to see our alleys transformed into beautiful green spaces that we can enjoy with our families.\"\n\nThe city's efforts to transform its alleys into green spaces are part of a larger initiative to increase its resilience to climate change. By capturing more stormwater, reducing urban runoff, and creating more green spaces, Los Angeles hopes to reduce its vulnerability to droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.\n\nAs California continues to face the challenges of drought and climate change, the green alley project serves as a model for other cities to follow. By working together to transform urban spaces into sustainable and resilient green areas, cities can reduce their environmental impact, improve public health, and create more livable communities for their residents.",

        "Text": "VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- A Falcon 9 rocket roared into the sky on Saturday carrying 10 communications satellites -- a return by SpaceX and its billionaire leader, Elon Musk, to the business of launching satellites to orbit. But financial details disclosed this past week about the company overshadowed the successful liftoff, raising questions about the viability of Mr. Musk's long-range plans for SpaceX and his vision of sending people to Mars. SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, Calif., has been set back since September, when a different Falcon 9 caught fire and exploded on a launchpad in Florida, destroying the rocket and its payload, a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to lease to expand global internet services. The company's rockets had been grounded since then. An internal investigation concluded that a failure of a helium vessel in the second stage liquid oxygen tank had led to the conflagration. The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial space launches, accepted SpaceX's report on the explosion's causes on Jan. 6 and issued a launch license, clearing the way for Saturday's liftoff here, on the other side of the country. To prevent a recurrence, SpaceX adjusted its fueling procedures to avoid overcooling of the helium. Saturday's countdown proceeded smoothly, with the liftoff occurring within a one-second window that would send the rocket on a trajectory to line up with the orbit of a group of current Iridium Communications satellites. The new satellites are more powerful than the original ones, which have been in orbit nearly two decades and have outlived their designed lifetimes. SpaceX also repeated its feat of recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, landing it on a floating platform named \"Just Read the Instructions\" in the Pacific. The successful launch and recovery of the Falcon 9 rocket has given SpaceX a much-needed boost, but the company's financial struggles have left many wondering about its long-term viability. According to reports, SpaceX has been facing significant financial challenges, including a reported $2 billion loss in 2022. The company's expenses, including the development of its Starship program, have been growing rapidly, while its revenue has been stagnant.\n\nDespite the successful launch, SpaceX's financial struggles have raised concerns about the company's ability to fund its ambitious plans, including its goal of sending humans to Mars. The Starship program, which is designed to take humans to the Red Planet, is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to develop and launch.\n\nSpaceX's financial struggles have also raised questions about the company's ability to compete with other players in the satellite launch market. Companies like Arianespace and United Launch Alliance have been launching satellites for years and have a established a strong reputation for reliability and efficiency.\n\nDespite these challenges, SpaceX remains committed to its vision of sending humans to Mars and establishing a permanent human settlement on the Red Planet. The company has already made significant progress in developing its Starship program, including the construction of a large prototype of the spacecraft.\n\nIn a statement, Elon Musk said that the successful launch of the Falcon 9 rocket was a major step forward for the company and that it demonstrated its ability to overcome challenges and achieve its goals. \"This launch is a major milestone for SpaceX and a testament to our team's hard work and dedication,\" Musk said. \"We are committed to continuing to push the boundaries of space technology and to making our vision of a human settlement on Mars a reality.\"\n\nThe successful launch and recovery of the Falcon 9 rocket has given SpaceX a much-needed boost, but the company's financial struggles remain a major concern. As the company continues to develop its Starship program and work towards its goal of sending humans to Mars, it will be important to closely monitor its financial situation and ensure that it has the resources it needs to achieve its ambitious goals.",

        "Text": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) from June 2006 to May 2009\nThe big news this month was the mea culpa from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that they had got it all wrong for years. They admitted the 16 forecasts they had done since they were set up had under-estimated the impact of austerity on output. In each of the disastrous 16 they predicted that productivity would rise like a rocket when in fact it has remained as flat as a pancake. Despite the fact that growth never happened they continued to forecast each successive time that output per man would follow exactly the same path; so there was no learning. The OBR's admission has sent shockwaves through the economic community, with many experts questioning the accuracy of their forecasts and the impact on economic policy-making. Professor David Blanchflower, a renowned economist and former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, has been vocal in his criticism of the OBR's mistakes.\n\n\"I'm not surprised by the OBR's admission,\" Professor Blanchflower said in an interview. \"Their forecasts have been consistently wrong, and it's clear that they failed to take into account the real-world impact of austerity on the economy. The consequences of their errors are severe, and it's crucial that we learn from these mistakes to avoid repeating them in the future.\"\n\nThe OBR's underestimation of the impact of austerity on output has significant implications for the UK's economic policy. The government's austerity measures, introduced in 2010, were designed to reduce the budget deficit and stimulate economic growth. However, the OBR's forecasts suggested that the measures would have a positive impact on the economy, which has not materialized.\n\nInstead, the UK economy has experienced a prolonged period of slow growth, with productivity growth remaining flat. The OBR's admission has raised questions about the effectiveness of austerity as a tool for stimulating economic growth and has sparked debate about alternative policies.\n\nProfessor Blanchflower believes that the OBR's mistakes highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to economic policy-making. \"We need to move away from simplistic, one-size-fits-all solutions and adopt a more flexible approach that takes into account the complexities of the real economy,\" he said.\n\nThe OBR's admission has also raised concerns about the role of independent forecasters in economic policy-making. The OBR was established in 2010 to provide independent forecasts of the economy, but its mistakes have raised questions about the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nIn response to the OBR's admission, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced a review of the OBR's forecasting methods, with a view to improving the accuracy of its forecasts. The review is expected to report in the coming months and will likely have significant implications for the UK's economic policy.\n\nFor now, the OBR's mistakes serve as a reminder of the importance of accurate forecasting in economic policy-making. As Professor Blanchflower noted, \"Economic policy-making is not a game of chance; it requires careful consideration and a deep understanding of the real economy. We need to learn from our mistakes and adopt a more informed approach to economic policy-making.\"",

        "Text": "Cancer experts said Tuesday that the actress and filmmaker  Pitt was wise to have had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed last week because she carries a genetic mutation, BRCA1, that significantly increases the risk of ovarian cancer, a disease so difficult to detect that it is often found only at an advanced, untreatable stage. They also said Ms. Jolie Pitt's decision to discuss her own choices so frankly will encourage women in similar situations to consider their own options. BRCA mutations cause about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers and 10 to 15 percent of ovarian cancers among white women in the United States. It is unclear how common the mutations are in other racial and ethnic groups. \"Prophylactic removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes is strongly recommended in women before age 40 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers,\" said Dr. Susan Domchek, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania's Basser Research Center, which specializes in BRCA mutations. \"There is no effective screening for ovarian cancer and too many women with advanced stage ovarian cancer die of their disease.\" Writing for The New York Times's Op-Ed page, Ms. Jolie Pitt, 39, said she had expected to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, a procedure called a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but that a cancer scare made her decide to undergo the procedure sooner. Her mother, aunt and grandmother died of cancer. \"To my relief, I still had the option of removing my ovaries and fallopian tubes and I chose to do it,\" she wrote. The decision by Angelina Jolie Pitt to share her personal experience with the BRCA1 genetic mutation has sparked a renewed conversation about the importance of genetic testing and preventive measures for women with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Swisher, a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Washington, emphasized that while genetic testing is not a guarantee of developing cancer, it can provide valuable information for women who have a family history of the disease. \"BRCA mutations are a significant risk factor for developing ovarian cancer, and removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes can significantly reduce that risk,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have a 40 to 60 percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 10 to 30 percent lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. While these statistics can be daunting, experts stress that early detection and prevention are key to reducing the risk of developing the disease.\n\nThe removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes is a common procedure for women with a BRCA mutation, and it can significantly reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that women who underwent the procedure had a 96 percent reduction in the risk of developing ovarian cancer.\n\nWhile the decision to undergo the procedure is a personal one, experts say that it is often the best course of action for women with a BRCA mutation. \"Removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes is a proactive step that can significantly reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer,\" said Dr. Swisher. \"It's a decision that requires careful consideration, but it can be a lifesaving one.\"\n\nIn addition to the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, experts recommend that women with a BRCA mutation also undergo regular breast cancer screenings and consider taking medications that can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nFor Angelina Jolie Pitt, the decision to undergo the procedure was a difficult one, but one that she believes was necessary to protect her health. \"I want to encourage women to be proactive about their health and to seek out genetic testing if they have a family history of breast and ovarian cancer,\" she wrote in her op-ed piece. \"I hope that my story will inspire other women to take control of their health and to seek out the information and resources they need to make informed decisions about their care.\"",

This changed on Monday when the parish council received a letter making an offer: if they would rename the village as Vegan Wool, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) would send 2,000 \"cruelty-free\" fake wool blankets to residents. Inadvertently, the village had been sucked into the incredibly effective PR outrage machine which Peta has run for many years. The story made headlines in Britain in print, online and on television including ITV's Good Morning Britain. Peta had been ridiculed and mocked, the stories said. And yet, somehow, the charity was delighted. The unexpected turn of events has left the villagers of Wool in a state of bewilderment, with many residents weighing in on the proposal. While some have expressed support for the idea, citing the charity's efforts to raise awareness about animal welfare, others have voiced concerns about the potential impact on the village's identity and heritage.\n\n\"I think it's a bit of a joke, to be honest,\" said local resident, Jane Smith. \"We're proud of our history and our connection to Thomas Hardy's work. Renaming the village just to get some free blankets seems a bit silly to me.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is opposed to the idea. \"I think it's a great opportunity for our village to be a part of something bigger than itself,\" said Councillor John Johnson. \"Peta is a well-known and respected charity, and if renaming our village can help bring attention to their cause, then I'm all for it.\"\n\nThe village council has announced that it will hold a public meeting to discuss the proposal and gather feedback from residents. In the meantime, Peta has released a statement expressing its enthusiasm for the idea, citing the village's \"rich literary history\" as a fitting backdrop for its campaign.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked a lively debate on social media, with many people weighing in on the pros and cons of renaming the village. Some have joked about the potential for confusion, with one Twitter user quipping, \"I'm not sure what's more confusing, the idea of vegan wool or the fact that Peta thinks renaming a village is a good idea.\"\n\nDespite the backlash, Peta remains committed to its campaign, with a spokesperson stating, \"We believe that by renaming Wool as Vegan Wool, we can help raise awareness about the cruel treatment of animals in the wool industry. We're thrilled that the village is considering our proposal and we look forward to working with them to make it a reality.\"\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, one thing is certain: the quiet village of Wool will never be the same again. Whether or not the villagers ultimately decide to rename their village, the world will be watching with interest to see how this unusual story plays out.",

And, like most people in the audience, she had Harvey Weinstein and the sexual misconduct bonfire that is raging in the entertainment industry on her mind. \"I've been reeling like everybody else,\" Ms. Robinson said. As the lights dimmed and the audience settled in for a panel discussion on the current state of the film industry, the weight of the Harvey Weinstein scandal hung heavy in the air. The gathering, organized by the non-profit organization Women in Film, aimed to spark a conversation about the pervasive culture of sexual harassment and assault that has come to light in recent weeks.\n\nMs. Robinson, who was joined by fellow industry professionals including actresses, writers, and directors, expressed her frustration and disappointment at the lack of accountability and change within the industry. \"It's not just about Harvey Weinstein,\" she emphasized. \"It's about the systemic issues that have been ignored for far too long. We need to address the power imbalances, the lack of transparency, and the complicity of those who knew or should have known about the behavior.\"\n\nThe panelists shared their own personal experiences and stories of survival, highlighting the ways in which the industry's toxic culture has affected their careers and well-being. Actress and writer, Regina King, spoke about the countless times she had been subjected to inappropriate comments and advances from male colleagues, while director, Dee Rees, discussed the ways in which she had been marginalized and excluded from projects due to her gender and race.\n\nThe discussion was punctuated by moments of anger, sadness, and even tears, but it was also marked by a sense of determination and solidarity. The women in the room, and those watching from afar, were clear about their demand for change: they wanted a safer, more inclusive, and more equitable industry.\n\nAs the evening drew to a close, the audience was left with a sense of urgency and a renewed commitment to creating a better future for women in film. The conversation may have been difficult, but it was a necessary one, and one that will continue to unfold in the days and weeks to come.",

Daulerio, a former editor in chief of Gawker, listening to testimony on Wednesday during a trial over a sex tape involving Hulk Hogan. ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A palpable sense of shock rippled through a courtroom here Wednesday morning when the former editor in chief of Gawker.com was shown in a videotaped deposition suggesting that almost anything goes when it comes to the newsworthiness of celebrities' sex videos. The former editor, Albert J. Daulerio, a defendant in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit brought by the retired wrestler Hulk Hogan, was asked by the plaintiff's lawyer where he drew the line when it came to posting videos of people having sex. As the courtroom fell silent, Daulerio's response sent a wave of unease through the packed room. \"I don't think there is a line,\" he said, his tone matter-of-fact. \"If it's newsworthy, we'll post it.\"\n\nThe deposition, taken in 2012, was part of a larger cache of evidence presented in the trial, which began earlier this week. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, is suing Gawker Media, the company founded by Nick Denton, for invasion of privacy and emotional distress. The lawsuit stems from a 2012 article published on Gawker's website, which included a clip from a sex tape featuring Hogan and his then-wife, Heather Clem.\n\nDaulerio's comments sparked heated debate among the jurors, with some appearing visibly disturbed by his words. The former editor's defense of posting explicit content without consent has been a central theme throughout the trial, with many arguing that the article was a legitimate piece of journalism.\n\nHowever, Hogan's legal team has argued that the publication of the sex tape was a clear violation of the wrestler's privacy, and that the article was motivated by a desire to sensationalize and attract clicks rather than provide meaningful reporting.\n\nAs the trial continues, the question of what constitutes \"newsworthiness\" in the age of online journalism is likely to remain a central theme. The case has already sparked widespread debate about the boundaries of media freedom and the rights of public figures to privacy.\n\nIn a statement, Gawker Media said that the company stands by its reporting and that the article in question was a legitimate piece of journalism. \"We believe that the First Amendment protects our right to publish newsworthy information, even if it is controversial or uncomfortable,\" the statement read.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue for several more days, with both sides presenting their cases and calling witnesses to testify. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for the future of online journalism and the rights of public figures to privacy.",

There, in a little blue box, A.I. tells him how he's doing. Talking too fast? The program flashes an icon of a speedometer, indicating that he should slow down. Sound sleepy? The software displays an \"energy cue,\" with a picture of a coffee cup. Not empathetic enough? A heart icon pops up. Mr. Sprouls and the other call center workers at his office in Warwick, R.I., still have plenty of human supervisors. But the software on their screens -- made by Cogito, an A.I. company in Boston -- has become a kind of adjunct manager, always watching them. At the end of every call, Mr. Sprouls's Cogito notifications are tallied and added to a statistics dashboard that his supervisor can view. If he hides the Cogito window by minimizing it, the program notifies his supervisor. Cogito is one of several A.I. programs used in call centers and other workplaces. The use of artificial intelligence in the workplace is becoming increasingly prevalent, and MetLife's call center is just one example of how A.I. is being integrated into daily operations. While the idea of a machine becoming one's boss may seem daunting, the reality is that A.I. is being used to augment human performance, rather than replace it.\n\nCogito's software, which is designed to analyze and provide feedback on customer service interactions, is just one example of how A.I. can be used to improve workplace efficiency. By providing real-time feedback and analytics, Cogito helps customer service representatives like Conor Sprouls to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions.\n\nBut Cogito's impact goes beyond just individual performance. The software also helps supervisors to identify trends and patterns in customer interactions, allowing them to make informed decisions about training and resource allocation. For example, if Cogito's analytics show that a particular group of customers is consistently experiencing long wait times, supervisors can use that data to adjust staffing levels and improve overall customer satisfaction.\n\nThe use of A.I. in call centers is just the tip of the iceberg. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see A.I. being used in a wide range of industries and applications. From healthcare to finance, A.I. is being used to improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and enhance customer experiences.\n\nBut while the benefits of A.I. are clear, there are also concerns about the impact it will have on the workforce. As machines become more capable of performing tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans, there is a risk that jobs will be lost or displaced.\n\nHowever, proponents of A.I. argue that the technology is not intended to replace humans, but rather to augment their capabilities. By freeing humans from mundane and repetitive tasks, A.I. can allow them to focus on more complex and creative work.\n\nIn the case of MetLife's call center, Cogito's software is being used to help customer service representatives like Conor Sprouls to provide better service to customers. Rather than replacing human supervisors, Cogito is being used to provide them with valuable insights and data that can help them to make informed decisions.\n\nAs the use of A.I. continues to grow and evolve, it will be important for workers and employers alike to understand the benefits and challenges of this technology. By embracing A.I. and using it to augment human capabilities, we can create a more efficient, effective, and customer-centric workforce.",

Some are trapped in a paradox: hoping that their work is not too popular, not too well read, so it does not create too many problems. Such is life as a journalist in the growing number of countries condemned for shutting down, stifling or squeezing the financial life out of independent media. The big concern now is that the problem is no longer limited to the two dozen or so totalitarian regimes that have dismantled free media. The erosion of independent media has become a widespread phenomenon, with even democracies and emerging economies joining the ranks of those that have compromised press freedom. According to a recent report by the Committee to Protect Journalists, more than 50 countries have taken steps to restrict media freedom in the past year alone.\n\nIn some cases, governments have used the pretext of national security or public order to silence critical voices. In others, they have exploited loopholes in laws or exploited the lack of effective regulatory frameworks to stifle dissenting opinions. The consequences are devastating, as journalists and media outlets are forced to operate in a climate of fear and uncertainty.\n\nThe impact is not limited to the journalists themselves. The public also suffers, as they are deprived of access to diverse and independent sources of information. This can lead to a lack of accountability among those in power, as well as a decline in the quality of governance.\n\nOne of the most concerning trends is the rise of \"fake news\" laws, which have been enacted in several countries to criminalize the dissemination of information deemed \"false\" or \"misleading\" by the authorities. These laws have been used to target not only independent media outlets but also social media platforms and online news sites.\n\nAnother worrying development is the increasing use of surveillance technology to monitor and control the media. Governments are using advanced tools to track journalists' online activities, intercept their communications, and even hack into their devices. This has created a culture of self-censorship, as journalists are reluctant to report on sensitive topics for fear of being monitored and punished.\n\nThe international community has been slow to respond to these developments, despite the growing consensus that press freedom is essential for a healthy democracy. The United Nations has issued several statements condemning the suppression of independent media, but concrete action has been lacking.\n\nIn the meantime, journalists and media outlets are finding creative ways to resist the pressure. Some are using encryption and other digital security tools to protect their sources and communications. Others are establishing independent newsrooms and crowdfunding campaigns to support their work.\n\nAs the situation continues to deteriorate, it is essential that governments, civil society, and the international community come together to defend press freedom and promote a culture of transparency and accountability. The fate of independent media hangs in the balance, and the consequences of inaction will be far-reaching and devastating.",

Markets rallied after the release Wednesday morning of the minutes from the March meeting. They were released five hours earlier than originally planned because a Fed official mistakenly e-mailed them Tuesday afternoon to a host of legislative staff members and bank representatives. The disclosure raised eyebrows both in Washington and on Wall Street, and legal and compliance departments at the banks were poring over e-mail records to determine exactly what transpired because of the early release. Several banks declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said the employee who received the e-mail did not share its contents with anyone or act upon it in any way. The e-mail went to lobbyists and government relations officials at the banks, rather than to trading desks or senior executives, but the wide distribution underscored the magnitude of the Fed's mistake. Fed officials discovered the error about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday and immediately briefed , the Fed chairman. An official for the Fed insisted the error was discovered internally, not because of trading anomalies or because a recipient had alerted regulators. The minutes are closely watched by traders and investors for any clue about Fed policy, making them among the most market-sensitive documents the government releases. Participants in the multitrillion-dollar bond market follow the zigs and zags of the Fed intently, since even a small move in rates can move bond prices sharply. The Federal Reserve's mistake has sparked widespread interest and scrutiny, with many wondering how such a sensitive document could be released prematurely. The minutes from the March meeting, which typically are released 14 days after the meeting, contain crucial information about the Fed's thinking on interest rates and monetary policy.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, the e-mail containing the minutes was sent to over 100 recipients, including lobbyists, government relations officials, and bank representatives. While the Fed insists that the employee who received the e-mail did not share its contents with anyone or act upon it in any way, the wide distribution of the document has raised concerns about potential market manipulation.\n\nThe early release of the minutes has already had a significant impact on financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged over 100 points on Wednesday morning, with many analysts attributing the rally to the unexpected release of the minutes. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note also fell sharply, as investors became more optimistic about the Fed's future policy decisions.\n\nThe incident has also sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability from the Federal Reserve. Some lawmakers have questioned whether the Fed's internal controls are sufficient to prevent such mistakes from happening in the future.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked to the market,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts. \"This mistake is unacceptable and raises serious concerns about the Fed's ability to protect the integrity of our financial markets.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve has promised to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident and to take steps to prevent similar mistakes from happening in the future. The agency has also pledged to maintain its commitment to transparency and to continue releasing minutes from its meetings in a timely and accurate manner.\n\nIn the meantime, investors and traders are left to wonder what the early release of the minutes might mean for the future of monetary policy. The minutes themselves contain few surprises, but the timing of their release has sparked a significant shift in market sentiment.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve continues to navigate the complexities of monetary policy, this incident serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in the financial markets.",

        "Text": "XI'AN, China -- For years, many of China's best and brightest left for the United States, where high-tech industry was more cutting-edge. But Mark R. Pinto is moving in the opposite direction. Mr. Pinto is the first chief technology officer of a major American tech company to move to China. The company, Applied Materials, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent firms. It supplied equipment used to perfect the first computer chips. Today, it is the world's biggest supplier of the equipment used to make semiconductors, solar panels and flat-panel displays. As the first chief technology officer of a major American tech company to relocate to China, Mark R. Pinto is part of a growing trend of companies shifting their focus to the Asian nation. Applied Materials, a Silicon Valley-based firm, has established a significant presence in China, with Pinto at the helm to oversee its operations.\n\nPinto's move is seen as a strategic move by Applied Materials to tap into China's rapidly growing technology sector.

        "Text": "The founders of Stem -- Jovin Cronin-Wilesmith, left, Milana Rabkin and Tim Luckow -- after a conference in Los Angeles last week. Stem distributes digital music and videos for artists and then helps split and send the earnings back to each creator who was involved. When Frank Ocean's album \"Blonde\" came out in August, it went straight to No. 1 and became the talk of the music business because it was released completely outside the usual channels of the recording industry. The mystery was how Mr. Ocean and his team did it. One answer was revealed on Sunday in an online ad promoting \"Blonde\" as one of the most acclaimed releases of 2016 and noting that it was \"powered by Stem.\" That service, which began only a year ago, has quickly become a player in a fast-growing corner of the music industry: online platforms that cater to independent artists by distributing their music to streaming services and organizing the many strands of royalties that accumulate from fans' clicks. Stem, founded by three 20-somethings in Los Angeles, has attracted a clientele of young artists who operate independently yet tend to collaborate frequently with other acts, some of them stars. The company's success is attributed to its user-friendly platform, which allows artists to easily upload and manage their music, as well as its ability to track and distribute royalties in a transparent and timely manner. According to Stem's co-founder, Jovin Cronin-Wilesmith, the company's goal is to empower independent artists to take control of their music and careers, rather than relying on traditional record labels.\n\n\"We're not a label, we're a partner,\" Cronin-Wilesmith said in an interview. \"We help artists get their music out to the world, and then we help them get paid for it. We're not interested in owning their music or controlling their creative direction. We just want to help them succeed.\"\n\nStem's platform has been particularly popular among young artists who are looking for a more flexible and autonomous way to release their music. The company's clients include a diverse range of acts, from electronic music producers to hip-hop artists, and even some established stars who are looking to branch out and try new things.\n\nOne of Stem's biggest advantages is its ability to handle the complex and often confusing process of royalty distribution. With so many different streaming services and platforms, it can be difficult for artists to keep track of where their music is being played and how much they're earning from it. Stem's platform takes care of all of this behind the scenes, ensuring that artists receive a fair and accurate share of their royalties.\n\nThe company's success has also attracted the attention of industry giants, including major record labels and music publishing companies. While Stem is not a traditional label, it has formed partnerships with several major companies to help distribute its artists' music and promote their work to a wider audience.\n\nDespite its rapid growth and success, Stem is still a relatively small company, with a team of just a few dozen employees. However, the company's founders are ambitious and are planning to continue expanding their platform and services in the coming years.\n\n\"We're just getting started,\" said Cronin-Wilesmith. \"We're excited to see where this journey takes us and how we can continue to help independent artists succeed in the music industry.\"",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook is working on a new tool that could help drive subscriptions to news organizations that publish articles directly on the online service, an effort to improve the fraught relationship between the social giant and media companies. The tool would be added to Facebook's Instant Articles product, which allows publishers to post news articles that can be read within Facebook rather than on the publisher's website. The discussions about the tool are still in the early stages, according to two people familiar with the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were not public. But it is possible that Facebook could produce a metered pay wall product similar to those used by some publishers. After reading 10 New York Times articles on Facebook, for instance, a user could be sent to The Times's subscription sign-up page. Facebook plans to start a pilot with a small group of publishers using the tool in October and to expand the initiative in 2018 if early results are promising. It was not clear which publishers might participate in the test. The proposed tool is part of Facebook's efforts to strengthen its relationship with media companies, which have long been critical of the social network's impact on the news industry. In recent years, many publishers have complained that Facebook's algorithm changes have led to a decline in traffic to their websites, while also making it harder for them to monetize their content.\n\nFacebook's Instant Articles product, which launched in 2015, was designed to help publishers increase engagement and revenue by allowing users to read articles directly within the Facebook app. However, some publishers have expressed concerns that the product has actually reduced their ability to collect data on their readers and to sell targeted advertising.\n\nThe new tool, if implemented, could help address some of these concerns by allowing publishers to offer users a seamless subscription experience. For example, a user who reads a certain number of articles on Facebook could be prompted to sign up for a subscription to the publication's website, where they could access additional content and features.\n\nIndustry observers say that the tool could be a game-changer for publishers, particularly those that have struggled to transition to digital subscriptions. \"This could be a huge win for publishers who have been trying to figure out how to get readers to pay for their content,\" said Ken Doctor, a media analyst at Newsonomics. \"If Facebook can help them do that, it could be a major step forward for the industry.\"\n\nHowever, the success of the tool will depend on a number of factors, including the user experience and the incentives that Facebook provides to publishers. Some publishers have expressed concerns that Facebook may not do enough to promote the subscriptions, or that the company may take a significant cut of the revenue generated.\n\nFacebook has not commented publicly on the details of the tool, but company officials have said that they are committed to working with publishers to find new ways to support the news industry. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, \"We're always looking for ways to help publishers succeed on our platform, and we're exploring new tools and features to help them do so.\"\n\nThe pilot program, which is set to launch in October, will involve a small group of publishers and will be closely monitored by Facebook and the participating publishers. If the results are promising, the company plans to expand the initiative to more publishers in 2018.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant development in the ongoing efforts to reform the relationship between Facebook and the news industry. In recent years, the company has faced criticism for its role in disseminating misinformation and its impact on the news industry's business model.\n\nBy providing a tool that helps publishers to monetize their content, Facebook is taking a step towards addressing some of these concerns. However, the success of the tool will depend on a number of factors, and it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to repair the fraught relationship between Facebook and the news industry.",

        "Text": "A landmark 2015 report that cast doubt on the results of dozens of published psychology studies has exposed deep divisions in the field, serving as a reality check for many working researchers but as an affront to others who continue to insist the original research was sound. On Thursday, a group of four researchers publicly challenged the report, arguing that it was statistically flawed and, as a result, wrong. The 2015 report, called the Reproducibility Project, found that less than 40 studies in a sample of 100 psychology papers in leading journals held up when retested by an independent team. The new critique by the four researchers countered that when that team's statistical methodology was adjusted, the rate was closer to 100 percent. Neither the original analysis nor the critique found evidence of fraud or manipulation of data. The critique was published in Science, the journal that published the original report. On Thursday, Science also published a strong rebuttal from the authors of the original replication project. \"That study got so much press, and the wrong conclusions were drawn from it,\" said Timothy D. Wilson, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia and an author of the new critique. \"It's a mistake to make generalizations from something that was done poorly, and this we think was done poorly.\" Brian A. Nosek, a colleague of Dr. Wilson's at Virginia who coordinated the original replication project, which took several years, countered that the critique was highly biased: \"They are making assumptions based on selectively interpreting data and ignoring data that's antagonistic to their point of view.\" The debate surrounding the Reproducibility Project has sparked a heated discussion within the psychology community, with some researchers defending the original findings and others questioning the methodology used. The critique published in Science has reignited the debate, with both sides presenting strong arguments.\n\nThe Reproducibility Project, led by Brian A. Nosek, aimed to replicate the results of 100 psychology papers published in leading journals. The study found that less than 40 studies held up when retested, leading to concerns about the reliability and validity of the original research. The project's findings were widely publicized, with many concluding that the results were a sign of a broader crisis in the field.\n\nHowever, the new critique argues that the original analysis was flawed, and that the results were not as dire as initially reported. The critique's authors, including Timothy D. Wilson, claim that the statistical methodology used by the original project was incorrect, leading to an overestimation of the number of failed replications.\n\nThe critique has been met with skepticism by many in the psychology community, who argue that the original project's findings were robust and that the critique is an attempt to discredit the work. In response to the critique, the authors of the original project published a rebuttal in Science, accusing the critique's authors of being biased and selectively interpreting the data.\n\nThe debate highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and transparency in scientific research. It also underscores the need for continued scrutiny and replication of research findings to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.\n\nDespite the controversy, the Reproducibility Project's findings have had a significant impact on the field of psychology. Many researchers have taken steps to increase the transparency and replicability of their work, including publishing more detailed methods and data, and making their data and materials publicly available.\n\nIn the end, the debate surrounding the Reproducibility Project serves as a reminder of the importance of skepticism and critical thinking in scientific research. It also highlights the need for continued dialogue and collaboration within the scientific community to ensure that research is conducted with the highest standards of quality and integrity.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- For decades, Intel was one of the most predictable players in the technology industry. On Thursday, the semiconductor maker blindsided Silicon Valley with the abrupt resignation of its chief executive over a relationship with a subordinate. The chip company said it was recently informed that Brian Krzanich had a \"past consensual relationship\" with an Intel employee. An investigation by internal and external counsel then found that Mr. Krzanich, 58, had violated a non-fraternization policy that applies to managers, the company said. So Intel's board accepted his resignation. The disclosure about Mr. Krzanich, a soft-spoken chip manufacturing specialist who joined Intel in 1982 and has run it for five years, left many questions unanswered. The company declined to identify the employee involved, when the relationship took place or any additional details. The sudden departure of Brian Krzanich, Intel's CEO since 2013, has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, leaving many wondering what this means for the company's future and its commitment to ethics and accountability.\n\nKrzanich's resignation comes at a critical time for Intel, which is facing intense competition from rival chipmakers such as AMD and NVIDIA. The company is also struggling to recover from a series of high-profile setbacks, including a major security breach and delays in the production of its 10-nanometer processor.\n\nIntel's board of directors has appointed Bob Swan, the company's chief financial officer, as its interim CEO. Swan has been with Intel for over 30 years and has a deep understanding of the company's operations and strategy.\n\nIn a statement, Intel's board said it took the allegations against Krzanich seriously and conducted a thorough investigation before accepting his resignation. The company also emphasized its commitment to maintaining a safe and respectful workplace, and said it would continue to work with external counsel to ensure that its policies and procedures are robust and effective.\n\nThe news of Krzanich's resignation has sparked a range of reactions within the tech industry, with some calling for greater transparency and accountability from companies in the sector. Others have expressed concern about the impact on Intel's employees and customers, and the potential for further disruption to the company's operations.\n\nAs Intel navigates this challenging period, it will be important for the company to maintain open lines of communication with its stakeholders and to provide regular updates on its progress. The tech industry is built on trust and credibility, and Intel's ability to restore confidence in its leadership and operations will be crucial to its long-term success.\n\nIn the meantime, the search for a permanent CEO is likely to be a lengthy and complex process. Intel's board will need to carefully consider a range of candidates with the necessary skills and experience to lead the company forward. The successful candidate will need to be able to build on the company's strengths while also addressing its weaknesses and challenges.\n\nUltimately, the departure of Brian Krzanich presents a significant opportunity for Intel to rethink its strategy and approach, and to emerge stronger and more resilient in the years ahead.",

        "Text": "Australian companies need to start developing sophisticated scenario-based analyses of climate risks, and incorporating them into their business outlooks so shareholders know how climate change will affect profitability, a thinktank has said. However, the Centre for Policy Development (CPD) said companies needed to do so in a standardised way, so investors and regulators were able to easily understand economy-wide risks to whole industries. The progressive thinktank urged Australia's biggest businesses to use the Paris climate agreement as the centrepiece for their scenario planning, saying it provided a credible, long-term anchor for policies that limit global warming to well below 2C. The group has released a discussion paper, called \"Climate horizons: next steps for scenario analysis in Australia\", explaining the best way to do so. Australia's financial regulator warned in February that climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. The Centre for Policy Development's discussion paper outlines a step-by-step approach for companies to develop robust scenario-based analyses of climate risks. The thinktank recommends that companies identify the most critical climate-related risks to their business, such as changes in demand, supply chain disruptions, and physical damage to assets. They should then develop scenarios that reflect different levels of climate change, from moderate to severe, and assess the potential impacts on their operations and profitability.\n\nThe paper also emphasizes the importance of transparency and consistency in scenario planning. Companies should report their climate risk assessments in a standardized format, allowing investors and regulators to easily compare and analyze the risks across different industries and companies. This would enable a more informed discussion about the economic implications of climate change and help to identify areas where companies need to take action to mitigate the risks.\n\nThe CPD's recommendations are timely, given the growing recognition of climate change as a material risk to businesses and the financial system as a whole. In February, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) warned that climate change posed a significant risk to the stability of the financial system, and urged companies to start adapting to the changing climate.\n\nAPRA's warning was echoed by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has also highlighted the need for companies to take action to mitigate the risks of climate change. The bank has urged companies to develop strategies to manage the risks and opportunities presented by climate change, and to report their progress to investors and regulators.\n\nThe CPD's discussion paper provides a valuable framework for companies to develop robust scenario-based analyses of climate risks. By following the thinktank's recommendations, companies can better understand the potential impacts of climate change on their business and develop strategies to mitigate the risks. This will help to ensure that Australia's biggest businesses are better equipped to adapt to the changing climate and to continue to thrive in a low-carbon economy.",

        "Text": "Britain outside the European Union will enjoy much cheaper imports. That's one of the threads running through arguments for Brexit. Outside the high walls of the EU's economic fortress, we can scour the Earth for the cheapest stuff on offer, buy it and and bring it home to consume, saving ourselves billions of pounds. This policy fits well with a country that is coming to terms with low productivity growth and with it, only stumbling increases in average wages. Low productivity and low wage rises are with us until at least 2023, according to the Treasury's economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in a report accompanying the budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, in its role as chief budget watchdog, warned that the OBR analysis showed that average wages would still be well below their 2008 level in the middle of the next decade, when adjusted for inflation. What better solution is there, when earnings are flat, than to ditch the EU's punitive tariffs and make the monthly salary go further? Trade secretary Liam Fox has talked about the benefits of tariff-free meat from South Africa, wine from New Zealand and chicken from the US. However, experts warn that the benefits of cheaper imports may be short-lived, as the UK's own agricultural industry struggles to compete with the influx of foreign goods. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has expressed concerns that the relaxation of tariffs will lead to a surge in imports, potentially displacing British farmers and threatening the livelihoods of thousands of rural workers.\n\n\"This is a short-term fix at best,\" said NFU President Minette Batters. \"While cheaper imports may be a welcome relief for consumers in the short term, we must not forget the long-term consequences for our farming industry. The UK's agricultural sector is already struggling to compete with larger, more efficient farms in Europe. The introduction of cheaper imports will only exacerbate this problem.\"\n\nFurthermore, the environmental impact of increased imports has also raised concerns. The UK's own food production is subject to strict environmental regulations, which ensure that farming practices are sustainable and environmentally friendly. However, many of the countries from which the UK will be importing goods have much laxer regulations, which could lead to an increase in carbon emissions and environmental degradation.\n\n\"This is not just an issue of trade, but also of the environment,\" said Green Party MP Caroline Lucas. \"We must ensure that our food imports are not only cheap, but also sustainable and environmentally friendly. The UK has a responsibility to lead by example and promote environmentally responsible farming practices around the world.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the government remains committed to its plan to leave the EU and reduce tariffs. Trade Secretary Liam Fox has argued that the benefits of cheaper imports will outweigh the costs, and that the UK's agricultural industry will adapt to the new market conditions.\n\n\"We understand the concerns of the farming industry, but we believe that the benefits of a post-Brexit trade policy will far outweigh the costs,\" said Fox. \"We will work closely with the farming industry to ensure a smooth transition and to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices around the world.\"\n\nAs the UK navigates the complex and contentious issue of trade policy, one thing is clear: the country's future relationship with the EU and the rest of the world will have far-reaching consequences for its economy, environment, and society.",

We didn't have a huge amount of money when I was growing up and I couldn't afford flying lessons, but I found ways to overcome that. My grandmother bought me a flying session for my 14th birthday and straight after that I wrote to aviation organisations to find out about scholarships. I also began offering private tutoring in maths and music, which earned me Â£15 an hour and enabled me to pay for flying lessons. Later, when I was old enough, I won a scholarship to fund getting my private pilot's licence. Keeping the licence once qualified proved hard because powered flights cost about Â£200 an hour so I kept these to a minimum at university and joined a gliding club to keep flying. Despite the challenges, [Name]'s determination to fly only grew stronger. As a glider pilot, she was able to fly regularly without the hefty cost of powered flights. The experience not only honed her skills but also allowed her to appreciate the beauty of flying from a different perspective.\n\nAfter completing her university education, [Name] decided to take her passion for flying to the next level by pursuing a career in aviation. She landed a job as a flight instructor at a local flying school, where she could share her knowledge and experience with others. The opportunity to inspire and mentor aspiring pilots was a fulfilling one for [Name], and she found joy in watching her students achieve their own flying dreams.\n\nHowever, [Name]'s career in aviation wasn't without its setbacks. In 2018, she was involved in a serious gliding accident that left her with a broken leg and a shattered ankle. The incident forced her to take a break from flying and re-evaluate her priorities. Despite the setback, [Name] refused to give up on her dream. She used the time to focus on her rehabilitation and began working on a new project â€“ designing a more accessible and affordable glider for people with disabilities.\n\nThe project, which [Name] worked on with a team of engineers and designers, was a groundbreaking success. The new glider, named the \"Freedom Flyer,\" was specifically designed to be easy to operate and accessible to people with physical disabilities. The aircraft's innovative design features included a joystick-controlled system and a specially designed harness to ensure safe and comfortable flying.\n\nThe Freedom Flyer made its maiden flight in 2020 and has since been used by people with disabilities from all over the world. [Name]'s dedication to her project has not only changed the lives of many people but has also earned her international recognition and accolades. Her story serves as a testament to the power of perseverance and the impact that one person can have on the world.",

        "Text": "The government should consider imposing an embargo on goods made in factories where workers have been underpaid, the workers' rights tsar has told MPs. Sir David Metcalf, director of labour market enforcement, who reports to both the home and business secretaries, said he was looking at new measures to improve adherence to employment legislation. Speaking to a parliamentary inquiry into the recommendations of the Matthew Taylor review into gig economy workers on Wednesday, Metcalf said as many as 5% of the lowest paid may not be receiving the national minimum wage while holiday pay rules were \"simply not enforced\". Metcalf said that health and safety inspectors, who oversee holiday pay, did not have the resources to investigate companies, and enforcement should be handed to HM Revenue and Customs, which already oversees payment of the national minimum wage. \"We are a very law abiding nation and mainly compliant but there is a tail, and possibly a long tail, using a business model that turns on non-compliance,\" Metcalf told MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee. Metcalf said non-compliance with employment law in the Leicester clothing manufacturing trade, for example, was \"rife\". Metcalf's comments come as the government faces growing pressure to address the issue of low pay and poor working conditions in the UK's manufacturing sector. The Leicester clothing manufacturing trade has been particularly affected, with many factories found to be breaching employment laws and exploiting workers.\n\nThe government has already taken steps to address the issue, including launching an investigation into the working conditions of garment workers in Leicester following a series of fires at factories in the city. However, Metcalf's comments suggest that more needs to be done to ensure that employers are held accountable for their actions.\n\nMetcalf also highlighted the need for better enforcement of employment laws, particularly in relation to holiday pay. He said that health and safety inspectors, who are responsible for overseeing holiday pay, do not have the resources to investigate companies and that enforcement should be handed to HM Revenue and Customs, which already oversees payment of the national minimum wage.\n\nThe government has announced plans to increase funding for the labour market enforcement agency, which is responsible for investigating and prosecuting employers who breach employment laws. However, Metcalf said that more needs to be done to ensure that employers are held accountable for their actions.\n\nThe issue of low pay and poor working conditions in the UK's manufacturing sector has been highlighted by a number of recent reports and investigations. In July, a report by the Trades Union Congress found that one in five workers in the UK's manufacturing sector were paid less than the living wage, while a separate investigation by the Guardian found that many garment workers in Leicester were being paid as little as Â£3 an hour.\n\nThe government has faced criticism for its response to the issue, with many calling for stronger action to be taken to protect workers' rights. Labour MP and chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, Rachel Reeves, said that the government's plans to increase funding for the labour market enforcement agency were a \"welcome step\" but that more needed to be done to address the issue of low pay and poor working conditions in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\"We need to see a more robust approach to enforcement and a greater commitment to protecting workers' rights,\" Reeves said. \"The government must do more to ensure that employers are held accountable for their actions and that workers are paid a fair wage for their work.\"\n\nThe issue of low pay and poor working conditions in the UK's manufacturing sector is likely to remain a major concern for the government in the coming months, with many calling for stronger action to be taken to protect workers' rights.",

A study by scientists in the US has found that wide smiles with a high angle and showing a lot of teeth are not the best at creating a positive impression. \"A lot of people don't understand how important their smiles are and how important this aspect of communication we do with each other every day is,\" said Stephen Guy, a co-author of the research from the University of Minnesota. The authors say the findings could prove valuable for clinicians working to restore facial movement and expression to those who have experienced facial paralysis. \"When you have different surgical options, how do you choose which one is better?\" The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, analyzed the facial expressions of over 1,000 individuals and found that smiles with a more moderate angle and less teeth exposure were perceived as more pleasant and trustworthy. The researchers used a combination of computer software and human evaluators to assess the facial expressions, taking into account factors such as the width of the smile, the angle of the lips, and the amount of teeth visible.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Rachel Kim, explained that the findings suggest that a more subtle smile may be more effective at conveying positive emotions and building rapport with others. \"Our results show that a more restrained smile may be a better indicator of friendliness and approachability than a wide, toothy grin,\" she said.\n\nThe research has implications not only for clinicians working with patients who have experienced facial paralysis, but also for individuals looking to improve their social interactions and communication skills. \"Understanding the importance of facial expressions and how to use them effectively can be a valuable tool in both personal and professional settings,\" said Dr. Guy.\n\nThe study's findings also highlight the complexity of human communication, which often involves subtle cues and nuances that can be difficult to decipher. \"Facial expressions are a fundamental aspect of human communication, and yet we often overlook the importance of getting them right,\" said Dr. Kim.\n\nThe researchers plan to continue their research, exploring the role of facial expressions in different cultural and social contexts. They hope that their findings will ultimately contribute to a better understanding of the complex dynamics of human communication and help individuals to improve their relationships and interactions with others.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to make a good impression, it may be worth considering a more subtle smile. As Dr. Guy put it, \"A smile that is too wide or too toothy can come across as insincere or even aggressive. A more restrained smile, on the other hand, can convey warmth and approachability.\" So the next time you're interacting with someone, try to strike a balance between a genuine smile and a more subtle expression. Your smile may just be the key to building a stronger connection with others.",

        "Text": "British Airways' safety training for cabin crew has been called into question at the inquest into the death of a teenager with food allergies who collapsed on one of the airline's flights. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, from Fulham, south-west London, was on flight BA342 from London to Nice on 17 July 2016 when she fell ill after eating a baguette she had bought from a branch of Pret A Manger at Heathrow airport's Terminal 5. She died later that day in hospital. The inquest, at west London coroner's court, has heard that BA staff did not fetch an onboard defibrillator nor tell a doctor treating Natasha that there was one. Addressing the airline's learning and development manager, Clare Durrant, on Thursday, Sean Cummings, the assistant senior coroner for west London, said: \"I am struggling a little bit with why the full range of kit wasn't made aware to Dr [Thomas] Pearson-Jones.\" Durrant replied: \"That [the defibrillator] wouldn't have helped at that stage.\" But Cummings questioned the ability of BA staff to make that judgment rather than a doctor. The inquest has also highlighted concerns about the airline's safety training for cabin crew, with some staff members reportedly unaware of the exact location of the onboard defibrillator. Natasha's parents, Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, have been critical of the airline's response to their daughter's death, saying that they were not informed of the defibrillator's presence on the plane until after her death.\n\nThe inquest has heard that Natasha's food allergy was not declared before she boarded the flight, and that she had eaten the baguette without checking the ingredients. However, her parents have argued that the airline should have taken more steps to ensure her safety, particularly given the severity of her allergy.\n\nThe coroner, Sean Cummings, has criticized British Airways for not doing enough to educate its staff about food allergies and the importance of carrying emergency equipment on board. He has also expressed concern that the airline's safety procedures were not followed correctly during the flight, and that this may have contributed to Natasha's death.\n\nThe inquest is ongoing, and it is expected to continue for several more days. The Ednan-Laperouse family is seeking answers about what happened to their daughter and how the airline could have done more to prevent her death. They are also calling for greater awareness and education about food allergies, particularly among airline staff and passengers.\n\nIn a statement, British Airways said that it was \"deeply sorry\" for Natasha's death and that it was cooperating fully with the inquest. The airline has also announced that it is reviewing its safety procedures and training for cabin crew, and that it is working to improve its response to medical emergencies on board.\n\nThe inquest has sparked widespread concern about food allergies and the importance of carrying emergency equipment on commercial flights. It has also raised questions about the level of training and education provided to airline staff, and whether more could be done to prevent similar tragedies in the future.",

        "Text": "TAMANA, Japan  Two pedals, inches apart, one for gas and the other for brakes. For years, a Japanese inventor has argued that this most basic of car designs is dangerously flawed. The side-by-side pedal arrangement, the inventor says, can cause drivers mistakenly to floor the accelerator instead of the brakes, especially under stress. The solution? ...a radical rethinking of the pedal layout. Meet inventor Kenji Tsuda, a 55-year-old engineer who has spent over a decade perfecting a new design that he claims will revolutionize the way we drive.\n\nTsuda's innovative solution is a pedal arrangement that places the brake pedal on the left and the accelerator on the right, a departure from the traditional side-by-side setup. The inventor believes that this change will significantly reduce the risk of accidents caused by pedal confusion.\n\nAccording to Tsuda, the traditional pedal arrangement can be particularly problematic in high-stress situations, such as when a driver is trying to avoid an obstacle or merge onto a busy highway. In these situations, the natural instinct is to press the brake pedal, but the side-by-side design can cause drivers to inadvertently floor the accelerator instead.\n\nTsuda's design, on the other hand, is designed to take advantage of the way our brains process visual information. By placing the brake pedal on the left, drivers are able to use their peripheral vision to quickly identify the pedal and avoid mistakes.\n\nThe inventor has already tested his design with a group of volunteer drivers, and the results are promising. In a series of simulated driving scenarios, drivers using Tsuda's pedal arrangement were able to correctly apply the brakes in over 95% of cases, compared to just 70% with the traditional design.\n\nWhile some critics have raised concerns about the potential for drivers to become accustomed to the new pedal arrangement and then experience confusion when switching back to a traditional vehicle, Tsuda is confident that his design will ultimately prove to be a game-changer.\n\n\"We're not just talking about a minor tweak to the pedal layout,\" Tsuda said in an interview. \"We're talking about a fundamental shift in the way we design vehicles to prioritize safety. I believe that my design will save lives and reduce the number of accidents on our roads.\"\n\nAs for when we might see Tsuda's innovative pedal arrangement on the road, the inventor is currently in talks with several major automakers and is hopeful that his design will be implemented in production vehicles within the next few years.\n\nIn the meantime, Tsuda's design is being tested by a growing number of enthusiasts and safety advocates who are eager to experience the benefits of his innovative pedal arrangement for themselves. Whether or not his design will ultimately become the new standard for vehicle design remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Kenji Tsuda's radical rethinking of the pedal layout is an important step towards making our roads safer and more efficient.",

The \"She Can STEM\" campaign was put together by the Advertising Council in collaboration with General Electric, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Verizon. The companies advised the Ad Council and the New York office of McCann Worldgroup, which did creative work pro bono, on the campaign's development. Each also identified a female employee in a STEM field to be featured in the campaign, alongside women who work at Boeing and the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The centerpiece of the campaign are videos in which the seven women discuss with girls (actresses with an interest in STEM subjects) what they do professionally and what the opportunities are. The professionals are also featured on the campaign's website, SheCanStem.com, and in individual profiles on Instagram and in more traditional media. \"When girls don't feel encouraged and empowered in STEM, we see serious consequences not only for girls and women, but also for the future of innovation in our country,\" said Lisa Sherman, president and chief executive of the Ad Council. \"If we want women at the forefront of the next generation of STEM leaders, we must show young girls that it is possible.\" The \"She Can STEM\" campaign aims to inspire and empower young girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math, a field that has traditionally been dominated by men. The campaign's message is clear: women can and should be leaders in STEM fields.\n\nAccording to the Ad Council, only 28% of STEM jobs are held by women, and this disparity can have serious consequences for innovation and economic growth. The campaign hopes to address this issue by providing role models and mentors for young girls who may be interested in pursuing STEM careers.\n\nThe campaign's videos feature the seven women in STEM fields, including Bonnie Ross, Maya Gupta, and Lisa Seacat DeLuca, discussing their work and the opportunities available in their fields. The videos also feature actresses who are interested in STEM subjects, allowing girls to see themselves in the professionals they are looking up to.\n\nIn addition to the videos, the campaign's website, SheCanStem.com, provides individual profiles of the women featured in the campaign, as well as resources and information for girls interested in pursuing STEM careers. The campaign is also being promoted through social media, with profiles on Instagram and other platforms.\n\nThe Ad Council and its partners hope that the \"She Can STEM\" campaign will inspire a new generation of women to pursue careers in STEM fields. By providing role models and mentors, the campaign aims to empower young girls to pursue their interests and passions, and to show them that they too can be leaders in STEM fields.\n\n\"We believe that every girl has the potential to be a STEM leader, and we want to show them that it's possible,\" said Lisa Sherman, president and chief executive of the Ad Council. \"By providing role models and mentors, we hope to inspire and empower girls to pursue their interests and passions, and to show them that they too can be leaders in STEM fields.\"\n\nThe \"She Can STEM\" campaign is just one example of the many efforts underway to encourage girls and women to pursue careers in STEM fields. By providing role models and mentors, and by promoting STEM education and career opportunities, we can work towards a future where women are fully represented in STEM fields and are able to pursue their passions and interests.",

But Mr. Favreau could also have been describing the way Walt Disney Studios used marketing sleight of hand to fill seats on opening weekend. \"The Jungle Book\" took in an astounding $103.6 million in North America, according to Disney. Studios hate to discuss their marketing for fear of coming across as corporate versions of Kaa, the slippery \"Jungle Book\" python who hypnotizes prey. Despite the impressive opening weekend haul, Disney's marketing strategy for \"The Jungle Book\" has been shrouded in mystery. The studio has been tight-lipped about its advertising budget, leaving industry insiders to speculate about the tactics used to lure in audiences.\n\nOne marketing expert, who wished to remain anonymous, described Disney's approach as \"a masterclass in misdirection.\" The expert claimed that the studio's campaign focused on creating a sense of nostalgia and wonder, rather than relying on traditional trailers and TV spots.\n\n\"This was a campaign that was all about building anticipation and excitement,\" the expert said. \"Disney created a sense of mystery around the film, using social media and influencer partnerships to generate buzz and create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) among potential viewers.\"\n\nDisney's marketing efforts included a series of cryptic teasers and trailers that dropped in the weeks leading up to the film's release. These trailers were designed to be more atmospheric and evocative than traditional promotional materials, featuring haunting music and snippets of footage that hinted at the film's themes and action sequences.\n\nThe studio also partnered with popular social media influencers and YouTube personalities to promote the film. These influencers were given early access to the film and encouraged to share their reactions and thoughts with their followers, helping to generate a sense of grassroots enthusiasm and word-of-mouth buzz.\n\nDisney's efforts appear to have paid off, as \"The Jungle Book\" has received widespread critical acclaim and is on track to become one of the highest-grossing films of the year. The studio's marketing strategy has been praised by industry insiders and analysts, who say that it has helped to reinvigorate the traditional Hollywood marketing model.\n\n\"Disney's campaign for 'The Jungle Book' is a perfect example of how studios can use innovative marketing tactics to generate excitement and buzz around a film,\" said one analyst. \"By creating a sense of mystery and anticipation, Disney was able to tap into the collective imagination of audiences and create a sense of shared experience around the film.\"\n\nAs the film continues to play in theaters and rack up box office dollars, it's clear that Disney's marketing strategy has been a key factor in its success. Whether or not the studio will reveal the full extent of its marketing budget remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: \"The Jungle Book\" is a reminder that, in the world of Hollywood marketing, sometimes the best tricks are the ones that are hardest to see.",

Sue Sharp*, who also buys her home and car insurance from Direct Line, contacted Guardian Money this week to ask if other readers had complained about \"ridiculous\" price rises. The company, which has gained a reputation for being among insurers that push through big premium increases in second and third years, quoted her Â£139 to renew her recovery plus breakdown cover. According to Sue Sharp, she had been paying Â£63 for the same policy for the past two years, and was shocked to see the sudden and significant increase in her premium. She contacted Direct Line's customer service department to inquire about the reason behind the hike, but was told that there was no explanation for the increase.\n\n\"I was expecting a small increase, maybe 10-15%, but Â£76 is ridiculous,\" Sharp said. \"I've been with Direct Line for years and have always been happy with their service, but this is unacceptable.\"\n\nSharp's experience is not an isolated incident. Many insurance customers have reported similar price hikes from Direct Line, with some seeing increases of up to 50% or more in their premiums.\n\nGuardian Money has received numerous complaints from readers who have been hit with unexpected price increases from Direct Line. Some have reported being quoted higher premiums despite having no claims or accidents, while others have seen their premiums increase despite having improved their credit scores or driving records.\n\nIndustry experts suggest that the increase in premiums may be due to a combination of factors, including rising claims costs, increasing road congestion, and the impact of Brexit on the insurance industry.\n\n\"It's not uncommon for insurance companies to increase premiums in the second and third years of a policy, especially if there have been changes in the underlying costs of claims,\" said Mark Shepherd, an insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket. \"However, it's still important for customers to shop around and compare prices to ensure they are getting the best deal.\"\n\nSharp is considering switching to a different insurance provider to avoid the hefty premium increase. \"I'm not sure if I'll be staying with Direct Line anymore,\" she said. \"I'll definitely be shopping around to see if I can get a better deal.\"\n\nIn response to the complaints, Direct Line has issued a statement saying that it regularly reviews its pricing to ensure that it remains competitive and that customers are protected against potential risks. The company also offers a price promise, which guarantees that customers will not be charged more than 10% above their previous year's premium.\n\nHowever, some customers are skeptical about the company's claims. \"I've been with Direct Line for years, and every year they increase my premium without explanation,\" said Sarah Johnson, another customer who has been affected by the price hike. \"It's like they're taking advantage of loyal customers.\"\n\nAs the insurance industry continues to evolve, customers are being advised to remain vigilant and to shop around for the best deals. With the rise of online insurance comparison platforms, it's easier than ever for customers to compare prices and find the best value for their money.\n\nIn the meantime, Direct Line customers who are facing unexpected price increases are being advised to contact the company's customer service department to negotiate a better deal. With the right approach, it may be possible to reduce the premium and avoid the need to switch to a different insurer.",

Somewhere down that tremendous list is one he probably didn't predict: breaking the grip of Fox News over conservative media and scattering talking heads, bloggers and politicians across various tribes of pro- and anti-Trump thinking. Trump's feud with Fox over the anchor Megyn Kelly, whose incisive questions have aggravated the billionaire for months, reached a new low on Wednesday when he announced he would skip the network's Thursday night debate. While Fox News kingpin Roger Ailes could once use his network to influence conservative voters and, arguably, shape the Republican party, Trump has baffled him and divided his audience. The fallout from Trump's decision to boycott the debate has been swift and far-reaching. Fox News, once the go-to destination for conservative news and commentary, is now facing a crisis of credibility among its core audience. Many of the network's top anchors and pundits, including Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and Bret Baier, have been vocal in their support for Trump, but their efforts to rally behind their favorite candidate have been met with skepticism and even ridicule from many viewers.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's decision to skip the debate has given his rivals a rare opportunity to gain traction and momentum. Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who have been struggling to gain ground in the polls, have both seized the moment to attack Trump and question his commitment to the Republican party. The debate, which was supposed to be a key moment in the campaign, has instead become a footnote in the larger narrative of Trump's feud with Fox News.\n\nBut Trump's move may also have unintended consequences. By skipping the debate, he has given up a valuable opportunity to connect with a large audience and showcase his policy proposals. His rivals, on the other hand, have been able to use the debate to highlight their own strengths and weaknesses, and to appeal directly to voters.\n\nThe impact of Trump's decision on the Republican party as a whole is also uncertain. While some conservatives may view Trump's boycott as a bold move, others may see it as a sign of weakness and instability. The party's leadership, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, has been careful to maintain a neutral stance on the debate, but the controversy has highlighted the deep divisions within the party.\n\nAs the debate season continues, it remains to be seen how Trump's feud with Fox News will play out. Will he continue to boycott future debates, or will he find a way to reconcile with the network and its audience? One thing is certain, however: the drama and intrigue surrounding Trump's candidacy have already reshaped the political landscape, and will likely continue to dominate the headlines for weeks to come.",

For it was 50 years ago on Wednesday 29 June 1966 that Barclays launched Britain's first credit card. Barclaycard kickstarted a revolution in the way we manage and spend our money, and played a key role in creating Britain's Â£1.5tn personal debt mountain. The card was \"born\" in a derelict shoe and boot factory in Northampton that had been converted into Barclaycard's HQ. The launch of Barclaycard marked a significant shift in the way people managed their finances, and its impact can still be felt today. Initially, the card was only available to a select group of customers, including Barclays' most loyal and affluent clients. However, as the years went by, the card became more widely available, and its popularity grew rapidly.\n\nBy the 1970s, Barclaycard had become a staple of British life, with millions of people using the card to make purchases and pay bills. The card's success can be attributed to its innovative features, such as the ability to make purchases without the need for cash, and the convenience of being able to pay bills and manage accounts online.\n\nHowever, the rise of Barclaycard also marked the beginning of a new era of consumer debt. As people became more comfortable using credit cards to make purchases, they also began to accumulate debt at an alarming rate. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, the amount of personal debt in the UK has grown from Â£1.5 trillion in 1966 to over Â£2 trillion today.\n\nDespite this, Barclaycard has continued to evolve and adapt to changing consumer habits. In recent years, the company has introduced new features such as contactless payments and mobile banking apps, making it easier for customers to manage their finances on-the-go.\n\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of Barclaycard, the company is hosting a series of events and exhibitions across the UK. The events will feature interactive displays and exhibits that showcase the history of the card, as well as its impact on British society and culture.\n\nBarclaycard's CEO, Mark King, said: \"We're proud to have played a key role in shaping the way people manage their finances over the past 50 years. From its humble beginnings in a Northampton shoe factory to its current status as a leading provider of credit cards, Barclaycard has always been at the forefront of innovation and customer service.\"\n\nAs the UK continues to navigate the challenges of the modern economy, the legacy of Barclaycard serves as a reminder of the importance of financial literacy and responsible spending habits. While the card has undoubtedly played a significant role in shaping the way people manage their finances, it also highlights the need for consumers to be aware of the risks and consequences of accumulating debt.\n\nIn conclusion, the 50th anniversary of Barclaycard is a significant milestone in the history of British finance. As the company looks to the future, it is clear that its impact will continue to be felt for many years to come.",

The problems described in your report are exacerbated in large parts of rural Wales, where the language and culture are under enormous pressure from a seemingly endless tide of second homers and elderly English retirees, whose main impact is to price local youngsters out of the housing market. The housing crisis in Wales is acute and has its origins in the sale of council houses at knockdown prices as an electoral bribe by the Thatcher government. The irony in Wales is that while many understandably took up this offer, few here ever voted for Thatcher. The consequences of this policy are still being felt today, with many young people struggling to find affordable housing in rural areas. According to a recent report by the Welsh Government, the average house price in Wales has increased by over 50% in the past decade, making it increasingly difficult for locals to purchase a home.\n\nThe influx of second homers and elderly English retirees has also had a profound impact on the local culture and language. Many rural communities in Wales are predominantly Welsh-speaking, and the influx of non-Welsh speakers has led to concerns about the long-term viability of the language. A recent survey by the Welsh Language Commissioner found that over 50% of Welsh speakers under the age of 25 are concerned about the future of the language, and many are choosing to leave rural areas to pursue opportunities in cities where Welsh is more widely spoken.\n\nThe Welsh Government has attempted to address the housing crisis through initiatives such as the \"Help to Buy\" scheme, which provides financial assistance to first-time buyers. However, many argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the crisis, including the lack of affordable housing and the influx of second homers and retirees.\n\nOne solution being proposed is the introduction of a \"community land trust\" model, where local communities would have the power to purchase and manage land, allowing them to build affordable housing and preserve the character of their community. This model has been successful in other parts of the UK, and could provide a solution to the housing crisis in rural Wales.\n\nIn addition to addressing the housing crisis, the Welsh Government is also working to preserve the Welsh language and culture. Initiatives such as the \"Welsh Language Plan\" aim to promote the use of Welsh in public services, education, and the workplace, and to provide support for Welsh-speaking communities.\n\nWhile there are many challenges facing rural Wales, there are also many opportunities for growth and development. The region is rich in natural beauty, with many areas of outstanding natural beauty, and is home to a thriving tourism industry. The Welsh Government is working to promote sustainable tourism, and to support local businesses and communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the difficulties faced by rural Wales are complex and multifaceted, but there are many solutions being proposed and implemented to address these challenges. By working together, local communities, the Welsh Government, and other stakeholders can build a brighter future for rural Wales, where the language and culture are preserved, and where young people have access to affordable housing and opportunities for growth and development.",

Many of us parents are explaining to our children how the election went and how you'll stay in power. Young people these days are very interested, as I'm sure you'll now know. Inevitably, this has required us to describe who the DUP are and what they believe in.

        "Text": "Outside the conference hall of the Moon Palace, a luxury Cancun resort, warm waves lapped white sands, bathed in a pink Mexican sunset. Inside, close to two hundred delegates to the United Nations' 2016 biodiversity conference huddled around a doorway, desperate to get into a windowless room for the final evening's negotiating session. In the end, most of the crowd made it into room, to witness twenty or so country delegates hammer out compromise text late into the night. This wasn't what they had expected from a UN summit. But the issue under discussion â€“ synthetic biology â€“ is an unusual topic. Synthetic biology is often described as the application of engineering principles to biology. Some see it a fundamentally new approach to biology; others as the next stage of biotechnology; and others as simply an exercise in rebranding. As social scientists researching this field, we've seen the confusion of synthetic biologists as to why a treaty about biodiversity is attempting to govern their research. The reason lies in the broad mandate of the UN's convention on biological diversity (CBD). One of the largest international environmental agreements, the CBD's three objectives include conservation of biodiversity; sustainable use of biodiversity; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources of biodiversity. The CBD's broad mandate has led to a contentious debate among synthetic biologists, who argue that their work is not inherently harmful to biodiversity. They claim that the development of new biological products and processes can actually contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, by providing alternative solutions to traditional methods that may be more environmentally friendly.\n\nHowever, environmental groups and some governments have expressed concerns that synthetic biology could have unintended consequences on ecosystems. They point to the potential for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to escape and thrive in the wild, potentially outcompeting native species and disrupting delicate ecological balances.\n\nDespite these concerns, the CBD's governing body, the Conference of the Parties (COP), has decided to move forward with developing a framework for governing synthetic biology. The COP has established a working group, comprising representatives from governments, industry, and civil society, to develop guidelines for the safe and responsible use of synthetic biology.\n\nThe working group's mandate is to ensure that synthetic biology is developed and used in a way that is consistent with the CBD's three objectives. This includes developing standards for the identification, characterization, and monitoring of genetically modified organisms, as well as guidelines for the sharing of benefits from genetic resources.\n\nThe negotiations have been challenging, with different stakeholders holding strong positions. Industry representatives have pushed for a light-touch approach, arguing that excessive regulation would stifle innovation. Environmental groups, on the other hand, have demanded stricter controls, citing the need to protect biodiversity.\n\nAs the sun rises over the Moon Palace, the delegates are expected to reconvene for another day of negotiations. The outcome is far from certain, but one thing is clear: the future of synthetic biology will be shaped by the decisions made in this Cancun conference hall.",

A peak of almost 15 million viewers, more than half of the public who were watching TV, tuned in to see Candice Brown win the Bake Off crown in the final of the baking show phenomenon on Wednesday night. Channel 4 will be buoyed by the rise in viewing, but must now begin the tricky task of selling the revamped format to sponsors and advertisers, shorn of presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins and judge Mary Berry. ITV's director of television, Kevin Lygo, said recently that Channel 4 had paid for \"baking powder and a tent\" by failing to secure the full current star line-up in its deal to take the show off the BBC. Despite the impressive viewing figures, Channel 4 faces a daunting challenge in convincing sponsors and advertisers to support the revamped format without its beloved presenters and judge. The show's success has been largely attributed to the chemistry and camaraderie between Mel Giedroyc, Sue Perkins, and Mary Berry, who have become household names.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that Channel 4 may need to offer substantial incentives to attract big-name brands and advertisers, potentially including increased exposure and bespoke marketing packages. However, the network's willingness to invest in the show's future could be tempered by the financial constraints of the current television landscape.\n\n\"It's not just about the numbers, it's about the quality of the audience and the engagement they have with the show,\" said a television executive, who wished to remain anonymous. \"While 15 million viewers is impressive, it's unclear whether the show can maintain that level of interest without its original cast. Channel 4 will need to work hard to convince sponsors that the revamped format is still worth investing in.\"\n\nThe loss of Mary Berry, in particular, could prove a significant blow to the show's appeal. The judge's warm and witty commentary has been a key part of the show's charm, and her absence may leave a void that cannot be easily filled. Channel 4 has announced that Paul Hollywood, the show's resident judge, will be joined by new judges Prue Leith and Noel Fielding, but it remains to be seen whether they can replicate the chemistry and banter that Berry and Hollywood shared.\n\nDespite these challenges, Channel 4 remains committed to making The Great British Bake Off a success. The network has announced plans to air a special Christmas episode later this year, featuring a selection of past contestants and judges. This could be an opportunity for the show to recapture some of its magic and build momentum for the new series.\n\nUltimately, the success of The Great British Bake Off on Channel 4 will depend on its ability to adapt to the changing television landscape and appeal to a new generation of viewers. While the show's original cast may be gone, its enduring popularity and the passion of its fans will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping its future.",

The building is of course named after former prime minister William Gladstone, who used parliament to defend his father's treatment of slaves, to secure some of the biggest pay-outs in slavery reparations, and to sanction forced labour post-abolition. We didn't think he deserved to be honoured above our door. That's why my friends and I launched a petition: to give students an opportunity to change the building's name and to start a conversation about slavery's legacy in Britain. The halls are being refurbished, so it seemed a good opportunity for change. In a world where contemporary slavery continues to affect some 3 million people and where racism continues to blight society, we believe celebrating those who aided it is wrong. We've been met with predictable criticism. Most often, Gladstone's defenders will cite his political successes and the ubiquity of racism in the 19th century. But this is whataboutery, not a direct answer to our questioning of his actions. As the petition gained traction, it sparked a heated debate among students, staff, and alumni of the university. Some argued that renaming the halls would erase an important part of history, while others felt that honoring Gladstone would perpetuate a legacy of racism and oppression.\n\nAlisha and I faced criticism from some quarters, with some suggesting that we were being overly sensitive and that Gladstone's achievements in politics and social reform outweighed his flaws. However, we remained steadfast in our conviction that it was important to acknowledge the complexities of history and to recognize that even those who achieved great things could also perpetuate harmful systems and ideologies.\n\nWe also faced pushback from some who claimed that renaming the halls would be a costly and unnecessary exercise. However, we pointed out that the university was already undertaking a major refurbishment of the building, and that the cost of changing the name would be minimal compared to the broader benefits of promoting a more inclusive and equitable campus culture.\n\nAs the debate continued, we were heartened to see that many students and staff were coming forward to express their support for our petition. We received messages from people who had never previously thought about the issue, but who were now convinced that renaming the halls was the right thing to do.\n\nOne student, who had grown up in a community affected by slavery, wrote to us to say that she had never felt represented or heard on campus until she saw our petition. \"I never thought I'd see the day where students would be brave enough to challenge the status quo and demand change,\" she wrote. \"Thank you for giving me a voice and for making me feel seen.\"\n\nAs the petition reached its deadline, we were thrilled to see that it had gathered over 1,000 signatures, representing a significant proportion of the student body. While we knew that the ultimate decision to rename the halls would be up to the university, we felt proud of the fact that we had sparked a conversation that would not be easily silenced.\n\nIn the end, the university decided to rename the halls, and we were overjoyed to see that the new name would be \"The Roscoe Building\", honoring the life and legacy of John Roscoe, a former student and anti-slavery activist who had played a key role in the fight against slavery in Liverpool.\n\nThe experience had been a powerful reminder that even small actions can have a big impact, and that by standing up for what we believe in, we can create positive change and challenge the status quo. As Alisha and I looked out at the newly renamed building, we knew that we had made a difference, and that we would continue to be a voice for those who had been silenced by the past.",

In a sign of the rapid shift in the modern jobs market as many as one in 10 working-age adults now work on gig economy platforms, up from one in 20 as recently as 2016, finds the study from the TUC and academics at the University of Hertfordshire. Revealing how a boom in digital platforms, such as Uber and Deliveroo, has sparked a revolution in the world of work, the report warns that workers' rights have failed to keep pace with the dismantling of the traditional nine-to-five working week for growing numbers of people. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the explosion of the gig economy showed that working people ran the risk of battling to make ends meet. \"The world of work is changing fast and working people don't have the protection they need. The report, titled \"Gigged: The Gig Economy and the Future of Work\", highlights the significant growth of the gig economy in the UK, with the number of workers relying on platforms such as Uber, Deliveroo, and TaskRabbit increasing by 135% since 2016. This rapid expansion has led to concerns about the erosion of traditional employment rights and the increasing precariousness of work.\n\nAccording to the study, the gig economy now accounts for 4.7 million workers, with one in 10 working-age adults relying on these platforms for their income. This represents a significant shift from the traditional nine-to-five working week, where employees were guaranteed a minimum number of hours and benefits such as sick pay and holiday entitlement.\n\nThe report's authors argue that the growth of the gig economy has been driven by the rise of digital platforms, which have disrupted traditional industries such as transportation, food delivery, and logistics. However, they warn that workers' rights have failed to keep pace with this change, leaving many gig economy workers without access to basic protections such as minimum wage, paid holidays, or sick pay.\n\nFrances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, expressed concerns about the impact of the gig economy on workers' lives. \"The explosion of the gig economy shows that working people are at risk of battling to make ends meet,\" she said. \"We need to ensure that workers have the protection they need to thrive in this new world of work.\"\n\nThe report's findings have been welcomed by trade unions, who have long argued that the gig economy is eroding workers' rights. \"This report highlights the urgent need for action to protect workers in the gig economy,\" said Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC. \"We need to see stronger regulations and better protections for workers, including the right to a minimum wage, paid holidays, and sick pay.\"\n\nThe government has been criticized for its failure to address the issue, with many arguing that it has been too slow to introduce regulations to protect gig economy workers. However, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has announced plans to introduce new measures to improve workers' rights, including a new code of practice for gig economy employers.\n\nThe report's authors are calling for further action to protect workers in the gig economy, including the introduction of a minimum wage for gig economy workers and greater transparency around working conditions. They also argue that the government must do more to support workers who are struggling to make ends meet, including increasing the minimum wage and introducing policies to reduce poverty.\n\nAs the gig economy continues to grow, the report's findings highlight the need for urgent action to protect workers' rights and ensure that they are able to thrive in this new world of work.",

The claim comes as part of an internal investigation into allegations that the company helped Russian spies discover and steal the NSA files, by locating and flagging the contractor. Kaspersky Lab does not dispute that it discovered hacking tools on the computer of a user of one of its consumer antivirus products. According to sources familiar with the matter, the NSA contractor, who has not been named, was using Kaspersky Lab's antivirus software on his personal computer to scan for malware and viruses. Unbeknownst to the contractor, the software had flagged the presence of the confidential hacking tools, which were stored on an external hard drive connected to the computer.\n\nKaspersky Lab claims that the company's algorithms identified the tools as potential threats and automatically quarantined them, preventing them from being executed or accessed. However, the company's internal investigation suggests that the contractor may have inadvertently downloaded the tools onto his personal computer while working on a project, without realizing the sensitive nature of the files.\n\nThe allegations have sparked widespread concern among cybersecurity experts and government officials, who fear that the leak could have compromised national security and potentially given Russian spies access to highly classified information.\n\nThe NSA has declined to comment on the matter, citing ongoing investigations and national security concerns. However, a senior government official told Reuters that the agency is taking the allegations \"very seriously\" and is working closely with Kaspersky Lab to determine the extent of the breach.\n\nKaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied any involvement in the alleged theft of the NSA files, and has offered to cooperate fully with the investigation. The company has also launched an internal probe into the matter, and has suspended the employee responsible for the antivirus software that flagged the hacking tools.\n\nThe incident has raised fresh concerns about the security of Kaspersky Lab's products, which are widely used by consumers and governments around the world. The company has faced scrutiny in the past over allegations that it has ties to the Russian government, and has been banned from government use in several countries, including the United States.\n\nThe NSA leak is the latest in a series of high-profile cybersecurity breaches, which have highlighted the vulnerabilities of even the most advanced security systems. As the world becomes increasingly dependent on digital technology, the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks continues to grow, and experts warn that the consequences of such incidents can be devastating.\n\nIn the wake of the alleged breach, cybersecurity experts are calling for greater vigilance and better security measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. \"This incident highlights the importance of robust security protocols and the need for greater transparency in the cybersecurity industry,\" said John Smith, a leading cybersecurity expert. \"We must work together to prevent such breaches and protect our sensitive information.\"",

They found the first carcasses in late December, on the frozen steppes of Mongolia's western Khovd province. By the end of January, officials in the region had recorded the deaths of 2,500 endangered saiga antelopes -- about a quarter of the country's saiga population -- and scientists had identified a culprit: a virus called peste des petits ruminants, or P.P.R., also known as goat plague. It was the first time the disease, usually seen in goats, sheep and other small livestock, had been found in free-ranging antelopes. For the saiga, an ancient animal that once roamed the grasslands of the world with the woolly mammoth and the saber-toothed tiger, the outbreak was potentially catastrophic. The antelope's numbers, once in the millions, have been severely depleted by illegal hunting, habitat loss and competition for food. The discovery of the virus has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, as it highlights the vulnerability of the saiga antelope population to diseases that were previously thought to be confined to domesticated animals. \"This is a wake-up call for conservation efforts,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a wildlife expert at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. \"We knew that the saiga population was struggling, but we didn't realize that they were so susceptible to diseases that are commonly found in livestock.\"\n\nThe outbreak has also raised concerns about the potential for the virus to spread to other wildlife species in the region. \"The saiga is a keystone species, and its decline could have far-reaching consequences for the entire ecosystem,\" said Dr. John Taylor, a biologist at the University of Cambridge. \"We need to act quickly to contain this outbreak and prevent it from spreading to other animals.\"\n\nConservation efforts are already underway to try to contain the outbreak. Wildlife officials in Mongolia have launched a vaccination program for the remaining saiga antelopes, and are working with international partners to develop a more effective treatment for the virus. \"We're doing everything we can to save these amazing animals,\" said Tsendjavyn Lkhagvasuren, the director of the Mongolian Ministry of Environment and Tourism. \"We're working with the best scientists and conservationists in the world to find a solution to this crisis.\"\n\nThe saiga antelope is an ancient species that has been roaming the grasslands of Central Asia for millions of years. It is known for its distinctive horned head and its ability to survive in some of the harshest environments on Earth. Despite its impressive adaptations, the saiga population has been declining rapidly in recent years due to a combination of habitat loss, hunting, and climate change.\n\nThe discovery of the virus has highlighted the need for greater conservation efforts to protect the saiga antelope and its habitat. \"This is a critical moment for the saiga,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"We need to work together to save this incredible species before it's too late.\"",

Research, conducted by the trust, found that the views of Russell Group admissions tutors on what makes a good personal statement differed from what teachers believed would impress them. The trust places the blame for this on universities, warning they must provide more information about what they are looking for from students. Dr Steven Jones, author of the research, says: \"The advice and guidance that some young people receive at school when composing their personal statement may not reflect the content and style expected by admissions tutors at the UK's most selective universities. Applicants need to be given a structured programme of advice that emphasises academic suitability.\" The study, which analyzed the opinions of 150 Russell Group university admissions tutors and 150 teachers, revealed significant disparities in the types of information and tone considered essential for a strong personal statement. While teachers emphasized the importance of highlighting extracurricular activities, community service, and personal achievements, admissions tutors prioritized academic rigor, intellectual curiosity, and specific examples of coursework.\n\nThe findings suggest that students who receive guidance from teachers may be more likely to focus on their non-academic pursuits, which may not be as highly valued by university admissions panels. This could result in students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not have access to the same level of guidance and resources, being at a disadvantage when applying to top universities.\n\nDr. Jones warned that the current lack of clarity on what universities are looking for in a personal statement is perpetuating inequality in the higher education system. \"Universities need to provide more transparent guidance on what they are looking for in a personal statement, so that all students have an equal opportunity to showcase their academic potential,\" he said.\n\nThe Sutton Trust is calling on universities to provide clearer guidance on what constitutes a strong personal statement, including specific examples of the types of information and tone that are valued. The organization is also urging teachers to receive training on how to provide effective guidance to students on writing a personal statement that showcases their academic abilities.\n\nThe research highlights the need for a more structured approach to teaching students how to write a personal statement. Many students may be relying on generic advice or guidance from teachers who may not have a deep understanding of the university admissions process.\n\nThe Sutton Trust's findings are timely, as the deadline for university applications is fast approaching. With thousands of students set to submit their personal statements in the coming weeks, the organization is urging students and teachers to take a closer look at the guidance being provided and to prioritize academic suitability above all else.\n\nIn conclusion, the research underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to teaching students how to write a personal statement.

But one team of researchers spent 15 years scouring guano-filled caves, cliffside nests and museum archives for bedbug specimens that might clarify the murky natural history of this globally loathed parasite. The team's findings, published Thursday in Current Biology, confirmed that bedbugs originated at least 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed Earth. The discovery upends the established timeline of bedbug evolution, and could help to anticipate the pest's next moves in an era of climate change and expansive human activity. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The research team also found that the main varieties of bedbugs linked to humans evolved some 47 million years ago. Because they are tens of millions of years older than humans, their origins must not be linked to the emergence of Homo sapiens, as past studies have suggested. To reconstruct the complex evolutionary story of bedbugs -- a family of insects known as Cimicidae -- the team analyzed the DNA of 34 species, sourced from 62 locations. The researchers, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, used a combination of traditional taxonomic methods and cutting-edge genetic analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of bedbugs. By studying the DNA of the 34 species, they were able to identify key genetic markers that indicated the relationships between different bedbug species.\n\nThe team's findings revealed that the earliest known bedbug species dates back to the Cretaceous period, a time when dinosaurs dominated the Earth. This discovery challenges the previous understanding of bedbug evolution, which suggested that the pests emerged much more recently, around 20-30 million years ago.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that bedbugs were already present on Earth during the time of the dinosaurs,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"It's clear that these insects have been adapting to their environments and evolving over millions of years, long before humans ever set foot on the planet.\"\n\nThe study also found that the main varieties of bedbugs linked to humans, known as Cimex lectularius, evolved around 47 million years ago. This means that these bedbugs have been associated with humans for tens of millions of years, long before the emergence of Homo sapiens.\n\nThe researchers believe that understanding the evolutionary history of bedbugs can provide valuable insights into how they adapt to changing environments and how they may respond to future climate change and human activity.\n\n\"Bedbugs are often seen as a nuisance, but they are also a fascinating example of evolutionary success,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"By studying their history, we can gain a better understanding of how they have survived and thrived for millions of years, and how they may continue to adapt to changing conditions in the future.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health and pest management. By understanding the evolutionary history of bedbugs, researchers can develop more effective strategies for controlling their populations and preventing infestations.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the University of California, Berkeley.

France has been working with other countries on a European Union-wide digital tax on companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, but some members of the bloc have balked at the proposal. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said last week that France would move ahead on its own if the union did not approve such a tax by March. On Monday, he moved up that date. \"The tax will be introduced no matter what on Jan. 1, and it will be for the whole of 2019,\" Mr. Le Maire said. A week ago, he urged the public to \"fight with me\" on the issue in an interview on French radio, during which he said, \"It's time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe.\" The French government's decision to impose a digital tax on American technology giants has sent shockwaves through the business community, with many analysts predicting a trade war between the two nations. The tax, which is expected to generate around â‚¬500 million in revenue for the French government, is seen as a major blow to the companies, which have long enjoyed a low-tax environment in Europe.\n\nThe French government's move is also seen as a response to the growing public anger over income inequality and the perceived lack of taxation on large corporations. The Yellow Vest movement, which has been protesting in the streets of Paris and other cities for months, has been demanding greater taxation on the wealthy and corporations to address the country's growing budget shortfall.\n\nThe digital tax is expected to be a 3% levy on the revenue generated by digital companies in France, and will apply to companies with more than â‚¬750 million in global revenue. The tax will be retroactive, applying to revenue generated in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe French government's decision to move ahead with the tax has been met with resistance from the American government, with the White House issuing a statement saying that the tax is \"unfair\" and \"discriminatory\". The statement also warned that the tax could lead to \"retaliatory measures\" against French companies operating in the United States.\n\nThe European Union, which has been working on its own digital tax proposal, has also weighed in on the issue. The EU's economic affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, said that the French government's decision was \"unilateral\" and \"unacceptable\", and urged the country to reconsider its decision.\n\nDespite the backlash, the French government remains committed to its plan to impose the digital tax. Mr. Le Maire, the finance minister, has said that the tax is necessary to address the country's budget shortfall and to ensure that large corporations contribute their fair share to the tax system.\n\nThe tax is also seen as a major victory for the French government's efforts to assert its authority in the face of growing criticism over its handling of the Yellow Vest protests. The government has been accused of using the protests as an excuse to crack down on dissent and to silence critics, and the digital tax is seen as a way to demonstrate its commitment to addressing the country's economic and social issues.\n\nAs the debate over the digital tax continues, many experts are predicting a long and difficult battle ahead. The tax is expected to be challenged in court, and the French government is likely to face pressure from the American government and other countries to reconsider its decision. However, for now, the French government remains committed to its plan, and the digital tax is set to come into effect on January 1st.",

Now the announcement will come \"in due course.\" Only 100 jobs or so will be affected directly, but do not doubt that the location of Unilever's HQ matters to politicians. Look at what has happened since April, which was when the Dove-to-Lipton group launched the review of its dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister â€“ a former employee of Unilever, note â€“ has risked a political storm by planning to overhaul local tax rules on dividends so as not to penalise international investors in Dutch companies. He will look a fool if Unilever refuses his red carpet. In the UK, there is a proposal to change the takeover code to the advantage of defending companies. Polman, it so happened, had been complaining about unlevel playing fields, despite Unilever's great escape from Kraft Heinz's financial engineers. The tweak may not satisfy his worries, but it's something and was supposed to be symbolic of May's preference for Unilever-style long-term capitalism. The delay in Unilever's decision to choose between London and Rotterdam as its sole headquarters has sent a ripple of uncertainty through the business community, particularly in the wake of the ongoing Brexit negotiations. While the company's CEO, Paul Polman, has assured that the decision will be made \"in due course,\" the delay has sparked speculation about the motivations behind the delay.\n\nSome analysts believe that Unilever's decision is closely tied to the ongoing Brexit talks, with the company seeking to avoid taking sides in the complex negotiations between the UK and the EU. By delaying its decision, Unilever may be attempting to avoid drawing attention to itself and avoid being seen as taking a stance that could potentially alienate either the UK or the EU.\n\nOthers have suggested that the delay may be a result of internal considerations within the company, with some reports indicating that Unilever is still weighing the pros and cons of each location. The company's decision to delay its announcement has sparked concerns about the potential impact on its employees and operations, particularly in the event that the company chooses to relocate its headquarters to Rotterdam.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Unilever's decision, the company's CEO, Paul Polman, has remained tight-lipped about the company's plans. In a statement, Polman said that the company would continue to monitor the Brexit negotiations and would make a decision when the time is right. \"We are committed to our dual-headed Anglo-Dutch structure and will continue to work with our stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition,\" Polman said.\n\nThe delay in Unilever's decision has also sparked concerns about the potential impact on the wider business community. The company's decision to choose between London and Rotterdam as its sole headquarters has significant implications for the economies of both countries, with the UK government eager to retain the company's headquarters in London.\n\nIn the meantime, Unilever's employees are left wondering what the future holds for the company. While the delay in the company's decision may be seen as a temporary setback, it is clear that the company's choice will have significant implications for its employees and operations in the long run.\n\nAs the Brexit negotiations continue to unfold, it remains to be seen what the future holds for Unilever and its employees. One thing is certain, however: the company's decision will have significant implications for the business community and will be closely watched by investors and analysts alike.",

        "Text": "The commodities trader Glencore has bowed to pressure from shareholders to limit coal production for environmental reasons â€“ days after reporting that it produced nearly 130m tonnes of the fossil fuel last year. The Switzerland-based firm, whose oil-trading operation is based in London, laid out plans to improve its environmental record, including a review of its membership of trade bodies it fears may be undermining the international Paris climate agreement. Glencore, which is Australia's biggest miner of coal, said it was responding to concern within the investment community. The Church of England, which is understood to have a stake worth just under Â£10m in the group, welcomed the announcement. Carlota Garcia-Manas of the Church Commissioners, the C of E's Â£8.3bn endowment fund, said: \"The simple truth is that in the absence of commercially viable carbon capture and storage, coal has no long-term future in the energy mix. \"Glencore's commitments on capital investment and expenditure start to provide assurance to investors increasingly focused on climate-related risks and opportunities.\" Glencore's decision to limit coal production comes as the company faces growing pressure from investors and environmental groups to address its role in the global climate crisis. The move is seen as a significant shift for the company, which has long been a major player in the coal industry.\n\nAccording to a statement released by Glencore, the company will review its membership in trade bodies that may be undermining the Paris climate agreement. This includes the World Coal Association, which has been criticized for its efforts to delay and undermine climate action.\n\nGlencore's announcement has been welcomed by environmental groups and investors who have been pushing the company to take action on climate change. The Church of England, which has a significant stake in Glencore, praised the company's decision, saying it was a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever, some experts have expressed skepticism about the company's commitment to reducing its coal production. \"Glencore's announcement is a step in the right direction, but it's not enough,\" said Dr. Emma Wilson, a climate scientist at the University of Cambridge. \"The company needs to go further and faster to reduce its coal production and transition to cleaner forms of energy.\"\n\nGlencore's decision to limit coal production is part of a broader trend in the commodities industry. Many companies are facing increasing pressure from investors and regulators to address their environmental and social impacts.\n\nIn recent years, several major companies have announced plans to reduce their coal production or transition to cleaner forms of energy. These include companies such as Anglo American, which has announced plans to reduce its coal production by 50% by 2025, and BHP, which has announced plans to reduce its coal production by 40% by 2025.\n\nGlencore's announcement is seen as a significant development in the ongoing debate about the role of coal in the global energy mix. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges of climate change, companies like Glencore will be under increasing pressure to transition to cleaner forms of energy.\n\nIn the coming months, Glencore will be working to develop a detailed plan to reduce its coal production and improve its environmental record. The company has said it will engage with stakeholders, including investors, customers, and environmental groups, to develop a plan that meets its commitments.\n\nAs the company works to develop its plan, it will be closely watched by investors and environmental groups. The success of Glencore's efforts will depend on the company's ability to deliver on its commitments and make meaningful progress towards reducing its coal production.\n\nIn the meantime, the company's announcement is seen as a significant step forward in the ongoing effort to address the challenges of climate change. As the world continues to grapple with the impacts of climate change, companies like Glencore will play a critical role in shaping the future of the energy industry.",

        "Text": "Madison Avenue exists to persuade. (Check out how stylish this car looks! Doesn't everyone seem to be having a great time while drinking this beer?) In a perilous political climate, however, some advertising agencies have decided to use their marketing acumen in service of advancing cultural and political causes, rather than selling products. It is not unusual for agencies to work with nonprofit groups or create public service announcements, pro bono, but this new activism entails a deeper level of involvement. These agencies are taking a more proactive role in shaping public discourse and promoting social change. They are using their expertise in messaging and branding to amplify the voices of marginalized communities, raise awareness about pressing issues, and advocate for policy changes.\n\nOne notable example is the advertising agency, Wieden+Kennedy, which has been working closely with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to promote its campaign against government surveillance. The agency created a series of ads featuring everyday Americans, highlighting the importance of privacy and the need for strong protections against government overreach.\n\nAnother agency, 72andSunny, has partnered with the National Domestic Workers Alliance to raise awareness about the struggles faced by domestic workers, many of whom are undocumented immigrants. The agency created a powerful campaign featuring real-life stories of domestic workers, highlighting the importance of fair wages, benefits, and protections.\n\nThese partnerships are not limited to traditional nonprofit organizations. Some agencies are also working with social justice movements and advocacy groups to promote change. For example, the agency, R/GA, has partnered with the Black Lives Matter movement to create a series of ads highlighting the systemic racism and police brutality faced by African Americans.\n\nThis new wave of activism in the advertising industry is not without its challenges. Some agencies are facing backlash from clients who are uncomfortable with the political nature of the work. Others are struggling to balance their commercial goals with their newfound commitment to social causes.\n\nDespite these challenges, many in the industry believe that this new activism is a necessary step towards creating a more just and equitable society. As the advertising executive, Rory Sutherland, recently stated, \"Advertising has always been about changing people's behavior, but now we're using our skills to change the world.\"\n\nAs the political climate continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how this new wave of activism in the advertising industry develops. Will more agencies follow suit, and what kind of impact will this have on the industry as a whole? One thing is certain, however: the power of persuasion is being used for good, and that is a message worth spreading.",

In 2010, archaeologists exploring a fifth-century fortress on a Swedish island found a pair of skeleton feet peeking out from a doorway. The team thought it odd that the ancient people had left a body unburied to rot within their village's stone walls, which housed some 200 people. When they later dug up the rest of the skeleton, the team discovered signs that the person had been murdered. Beside him they found the brutalized remains of another. And in houses nearby and on the streets they uncovered more human bones that had been butchered with swords, axes and clubs. The gruesome discovery sparked a massive excavation effort, with archaeologists working tirelessly to uncover the truth behind the brutal massacre. As they dug deeper, they found evidence of a fierce battle that had ravaged the village, with bodies strewn about and buildings destroyed.\n\nThe team, led by Dr. Maria Svensson, a renowned archaeologist from the University of Gothenburg, was shocked by the sheer scale of the violence. \"It's as if the villagers were caught off guard, with no chance to defend themselves,\" Dr. Svensson said in an interview. \"The bodies were found in a state of disarray, with some still lying in their beds, while others were scattered throughout the village.\"\n\nAs the excavation progressed, archaeologists uncovered more bodies, bringing the total number of victims to over 30. The remains were found in various states of decomposition, with some showing signs of torture and mutilation. The team also discovered evidence of a fire that had engulfed the village, leaving behind a layer of ash and charred wood.\n\nForensic experts were called in to analyze the remains, and their findings revealed a chilling tale of brutality and savagery. The victims, mostly women and children, had been killed with a combination of bladed weapons and blunt force trauma. The team also found evidence of sexual violence, with some of the victims showing signs of rape and sexual assault.\n\nThe discovery has sent shockwaves through the archaeological community, with many experts hailing it as one of the most significant finds in recent history. \"This is a game-changer,\" said Dr. John Smith, a leading expert on ancient warfare. \"The scale and brutality of this massacre are unprecedented, and it's a sobering reminder of the violence that has plagued human history.\"\n\nThe team is now working to reconstruct the events leading up to the massacre, using a combination of archaeological evidence and historical records. While the exact circumstances of the event remain unclear, it is believed to have occurred during a period of turmoil and conflict in the region, with rival tribes vying for control of the island.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the people of Sweden are left to grapple with the brutal reality of their ancient past. The discovery is a powerful reminder of the fragility of human life and the devastating consequences of conflict.",

Mr. Scalia was chosen by President Trump in July, days after Mr. Trump's first labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, announced that he would resign. He is a son of the Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. The nomination was approved on a 53-to-44 vote along party lines. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the committee that presided over Mr. Scalia's confirmation, summed up the Republican viewpoint. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the committee that presided over Mr. Scalia's confirmation, summed up the Republican viewpoint, stating that Mr. Scalia's extensive experience in labor law and his commitment to promoting job growth and economic development made him an ideal candidate for the position.\n\n\"Mr. Scalia's impressive credentials and dedication to his work will serve the American people well in this critical role,\" Senator Alexander said. \"As a seasoned lawyer, he has a deep understanding of the complexities of labor law and will work tirelessly to ensure that workers have access to good-paying jobs and that employers have the flexibility they need to thrive.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns about Mr. Scalia's record as a corporate lawyer, arguing that his appointment would further erode the rights of workers and undermine the Department of Labor's ability to protect them.\n\n\"Mr. Scalia's confirmation is a devastating blow to workers across the country,\" said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \"As a corporate lawyer, he has consistently represented the interests of big business, not workers. We cannot afford to have someone in this critical role who is more concerned with padding the pockets of corporate executives than with protecting the rights of working Americans.\"\n\nDespite the partisan divisions, Mr. Scalia's confirmation marks a significant milestone in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the Department of Labor. As labor secretary, he will play a key role in shaping labor policies, including the administration's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and to weaken labor unions.\n\nMr. Scalia's appointment has also sparked concerns about the potential impact on the country's labor laws, particularly the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets minimum wage and overtime standards for workers. Labor advocates have warned that Mr. Scalia's confirmation could lead to further erosion of these protections, leaving workers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\n\nAs Mr. Scalia prepares to take office, labor leaders and advocates are vowing to continue fighting for workers' rights, despite the challenges ahead. \"We will not go quietly into the night,\" said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. \"We will continue to stand up for workers and fight for their rights, even in the face of adversity.\"\n\nIn the end, Mr. Scalia's confirmation is a reflection of the deep divisions within the country over the role of government in protecting workers' rights. While some see his appointment as a victory for corporate interests, others view it as a threat to the very fabric of American society. As the country looks to the future, one thing is clear: the battle for workers' rights will continue, and the outcome will have far-reaching consequences for generations to come.",

Output of vehicles for the UK market plunged by 47% in June, compared with a 6% rise in exports, amid a \"perfect storm\" of factors, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. The SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, played down the significance of the monthly slump but said the figures were a \"reminder of the exports-led nature\" of the UK car industry. Hawes said this showed the importance of striking a deal with the EU, the destination for 53% of UK car exports, and warned that a lack of clarity on Brexit had left the industry struggling to prepare for the departure date in March 2019. \"No one would profess to being Brexit-ready because there are too many variables in there,\" he said. \"We need a deal. If we have no deal, there is no transition, there is no implementation period, that would kick in less than eight months away. You can operate on WTO [World Trade Organization] trade rules but it would be at a significant extra cost and burden than we currently enjoy.\" The SMMT chief executive's warning comes as the UK's automotive sector faces a period of unprecedented uncertainty, with the industry's future prospects hanging in the balance. The industry's reliance on exports, particularly to the EU, makes it vulnerable to any disruptions caused by Brexit.\n\nHawes pointed out that the industry's supply chain is highly integrated, with many components sourced from EU countries. \"We're not just talking about cars, we're talking about components, we're talking about engineering, we're talking about design,\" he said. \"The UK is a significant player in the global automotive industry, and we need to make sure we can continue to be so.\"\n\nThe SMMT has been urging the government to provide greater clarity on Brexit, particularly on the issue of customs arrangements and trade tariffs. Hawes said that the industry is seeking a \"bespoke\" agreement with the EU, which would allow for tariff-free trade and minimize the impact of any customs checks.\n\nHowever, with less than eight months to go before the UK's departure from the EU, the industry is growing increasingly concerned about the lack of progress on these issues. The SMMT has warned that a \"no-deal\" Brexit could lead to a significant decline in UK car production, with some manufacturers already considering relocating production to other EU countries.\n\nThe industry's concerns are not limited to the UK's exports. The SMMT has also warned that a \"no-deal\" Brexit could lead to a shortage of skilled workers, as EU nationals are no longer able to work in the UK without a visa. This could have a significant impact on the industry's ability to recruit and retain talent.\n\nIn response to the SMMT's warning, the government has said that it is working to secure a \"good deal\" with the EU, and that it is committed to supporting the automotive industry. However, with the clock ticking down to Brexit, the industry is growing increasingly anxious about the lack of progress.\n\nAs the UK's automotive sector faces this uncertain future, many are left wondering what the implications will be for jobs, investment, and the industry's long-term prospects. One thing is certain, however: the industry's future is inextricably linked to the outcome of Brexit, and the SMMT's warning serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved.",

The company's botched takeover of Homebase, which was meant to be a strategic move to dominate the British market, has left many wondering if the Australian retailer has what it takes to succeed in the UK.\n\nBunnings' aggressive management style, which has been criticized by employees and customers alike, has led to a series of high-profile mistakes. From poorly trained staff to inadequate stock levels, the company's failure to adapt to the UK market has resulted in a significant loss of customer trust.\n\nThe writing was on the wall when Bunnings announced a massive write-down of A$1 billion, a staggering sum that has left many questioning the company's ability to turn things around. The move has also sparked concerns about the future of Homebase's 250 stores, which are now at risk of closure.\n\nHowever, not everyone is giving up on Bunnings just yet.

Confounding critics who said the club of oil-producing nations was too riven with political infighting to agree a deal, Opec announced it was trimming output by 1.2m barrels per day (bpd) from 1 January. The deal is contingent on securing the agreement of non-Opec producers to lower production by 600,000m barrels per day. The announcement sent shockwaves through the global energy market, with oil prices jumping to their highest level in nearly three years. The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, surged to over $65 per barrel, while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose to above $59 per barrel.\n\nThe decision by Opec to cut production was seen as a significant shift in strategy, as the cartel had previously resisted calls to reduce output despite a global glut of oil. The move is aimed at rebalancing the market and supporting prices, which have been under pressure due to rising US shale production and concerns over global demand.\n\nThe agreement was reached after months of intense negotiations between Opec's 14 member countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela. The deal was seen as a major victory for Saudi Arabia, which had pushed for a production cut to support prices and maintain its market share.\n\nThe decision is also expected to have significant implications for the global economy, particularly for countries that are heavily reliant on oil imports. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the production cut could lead to a reduction in global oil inventories, which could help to support prices and boost economic growth.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the production cut will have the desired effect. Some analysts have warned that the deal may not be enough to rebalance the market, and that prices could continue to be volatile in the coming months. Others have raised concerns over the impact of the production cut on oil prices, particularly for countries that are major oil producers.\n\nThe agreement is also contingent on securing the agreement of non-Opec producers to lower production by 600,000 barrels per day. This is seen as a key hurdle, as some non-Opec producers, such as Russia, have been resistant to reducing output. The IEA has estimated that non-Opec producers account for around 60% of global oil production, and that their cooperation will be crucial in achieving the desired rebalancing of the market.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, the production cut is seen as a significant step forward in efforts to stabilize the global oil market. The deal has been welcomed by many oil producers and consumers, who are hoping that it will help to support prices and boost economic growth.

Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to stick to what has become a well-used script when he appears before European lawmakers in Brussels on Tuesday evening. The chief executive intends to say that Facebook did not do enough to prevent the social network from being used for harm, according to an excerpt from his prepared remarks viewed by The New York Times. \"Whether it's fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing people's information, we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibilities,\" Mr. Zuckerberg plans to say, according to the prepared remarks. \"That was a mistake, and I'm sorry.\" The language closely mirrors what Mr. Zuckerberg told members of Congress last month when he went to Washington for a two-day grilling over how Facebook handled the data of tens of millions of its users. The Times and others had revealed in March that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly used the information of Facebook members to build psychographic profiles of American voters, setting off a data privacy storm. Since then, Mr. Zuckerberg has posted a public apology for the scandal, accepting personal responsibility for the data leak and vowing to \"step up.\" The Silicon Valley company has also announced new privacy and security settings and begun an advertising campaign in which it has promised to clean up the social network.

Even after the controversies that the ride-hailing app has faced worldwide and the concerted opposition of unions, employment-rights lawyers and black-cab drivers, few expected TfL's verdict that Uber is not a \"fit and proper\" firm to run taxis in the capital. While Uber's battle to survive in London will take place first in the courts, political heat will be piled on the capital's mayor, Sadiq Khan, during an appeal process that could take a year or more to play out. For Uber to highlight the livelihoods of 40,000 drivers may seem a bit rich from a firm that has long insisted it does not employ them and is fighting rulings on workplace rights for its \"partners\". Its trump card could be consumer sentiment, with about 3.5 million Londoners using the app, many finding Uber more convenient and cheaper than traditional black cabs. As with Ryanair, passengers have flocked to a cheaper transport alternative without worrying unduly about the employment practices: a petition (started by Uber) calling on Khan to reverse the decision quickly reached 200,000 signatures on Friday. However, rivals claim the US cab-hailing app's fares are artificially low, that its \"surge pricing\" â€“ increasing fares in line with demand â€“ shows a more accurate picture of what an Uber monopoly could look like. As the battle between Uber and Transport for London (TfL) heats up, the ride-hailing giant is likely to face intense scrutiny over its business practices and treatment of its drivers. The decision not to renew Uber's licence has sparked widespread debate, with some arguing that the company's model is unsustainable and exploitative, while others see it as a necessary evil in a city desperate for affordable transportation options.\n\nOne of the key concerns is the treatment of Uber's drivers, who are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. This means they are not entitled to the same benefits and protections as traditional employees, including minimum wage, sick pay, and holiday pay. Uber has consistently argued that this classification is necessary to maintain the flexibility and autonomy of its drivers, but critics argue that it is simply a way to avoid paying taxes and providing decent working conditions.\n\nThe decision by TfL not to renew Uber's licence has been welcomed by some, who see it as a step towards creating a more level playing field for traditional black cab drivers. \"This is a victory for the taxi industry and a recognition that Uber's business model is unsustainable,\" said a spokesperson for the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association. \"We have always argued that Uber's cheap fares are artificially low and that its business model is based on exploiting its drivers and undercutting traditional taxi firms.\"\n\nHowever, others argue that the decision will have far-reaching consequences for Londoners, who will be left with fewer transportation options and higher fares. \"This decision is a disaster for Londoners, who will now have to rely on expensive and unreliable public transportation,\" said a spokesperson for the London Chamber of Commerce. \"Uber's licence was due to expire in September, but TfL has decided to bring forward the decision, which will cause chaos and disruption to the city's transportation network.\"\n\nAs the appeal process gets underway, it is likely that both sides will continue to dig in their heels and fight for their respective positions. For Uber, the stakes are high, as its very survival in London hangs in the balance. For TfL, the decision is seen as a crucial step towards creating a more sustainable and equitable transportation system in the capital.\n\nIn the meantime, Londoners will have to wait and see how the battle between Uber and TfL plays out. One thing is certain, however: the decision will have far-reaching consequences for the city's transportation network and the thousands of people who rely on it every day.",

        "Text": "Musk oxen, massive mammals that live on Arctic tundra, are seeing their numbers dwindle as warmer, rainier winters limit access to food, researchers report. In the Arctic, More Rain May Mean Fewer Musk Oxen\n\nIt's hard to miss a musk ox: It looks like a buffalo decked out in a hairy fur coat. And yet this easy-to-spot giant, which lives on tundras from Siberia to Greenland, is still surprisingly mysterious. \"Here is the largest land mammal of the polar zones, but we hardly know anything about musk oxen,\" said Joel Berger, a wildlife biologist at Colorado State University and a senior scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society. Dr. Berger has studied musk oxen in Alaska for nearly a decade, and on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, he and his colleagues reported a disturbing finding: Musk oxen are unexpectedly vulnerable to rapid climate change in the Arctic. In a warming landscape, pregnant female musk oxen may struggle to find enough food for their unborn calves, the researchers found. Their undersized offspring may die young or fail to produce many calves of their own. In places, musk oxen may disappear altogether. The study is the first to suggest a strong link between increasing winter rainfall and the declining health of Arctic mammals, said R. Terry Bowyer, a senior research scientist at the Institute of Arctic Biology in Fairbanks, Alaska, who was not involved in the research. Other grazing species, like caribou or Dall sheep, also may be harmed by increasing rain in the Arctic, Dr. Bowyer said: \"It bodes poorly for big mammals.\" The findings of Dr. Berger and his team are a stark reminder of the far-reaching consequences of climate change on Arctic ecosystems. Musk oxen, once a symbol of resilience in the harsh Arctic environment, are now facing a significant threat to their survival.\n\nAccording to the study, the warming trend in the Arctic has led to an increase in winter rainfall, which has devastating effects on the musk oxen's ability to find food. Pregnant females, in particular, struggle to locate nutritious vegetation for their unborn calves, leading to undersized and malnourished offspring. This, in turn, can lead to a decline in the overall population of musk oxen.\n\nThe study's findings are concerning not only for the musk oxen themselves but also for the entire Arctic ecosystem. Musk oxen play a crucial role in shaping the tundra landscape through their grazing activities, which in turn support a wide range of other species. If the population of musk oxen continues to decline, it could have a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem, leading to a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.\n\nDr. Bowyer, who was not involved in the research, emphasized the importance of the study's findings, stating, \"This is a wake-up call for conservation efforts in the Arctic. We need to take immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect these iconic species.\"\n\nThe study's authors are now calling for further research to better understand the impacts of climate change on musk oxen and other Arctic species. They are also advocating for conservation efforts, such as habitat preservation and restoration, to support the recovery of declining populations.\n\nAs the Arctic continues to warm at a rate twice as fast as the global average, the fate of the musk oxen and other Arctic species hangs in the balance. The study's findings serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for action to protect these vulnerable species and the ecosystems they inhabit.",

        "Text": "The swirling story around President Trump's dealings with Russia is being compared in journalism circles to past blockbusters like Watergate and the Monica Lewinsky scandal -- with a 21st-century twist. News organizations like The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN are jousting for scoops, but instead of sending clerks to grab the early editions from newsstands, editors watch the news unfold on Twitter in real time. Anonymous sources are driving bombshell stories, but leaks are springing from encrypted iPhone messaging apps rather than from meetings in underground parking garages. The news cycle begins at sunrise, as groggy reporters hear the ping of a presidential tweet, and ends sometime in the overnight hours, as newspaper editors tear up front pages scrambled by the latest revelation from Washington. In consequence and velocity, the political developments of the past four weeks -- has it been only four weeks? -- are jogging memories of momentous journalistic times. \"There is this sense of urgency and energy that I feel now that reminds me of being 29 and in a very different situation: in the middle of a revolutionary situation in Russia,\" said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, who was a correspondent for The Washington Post in Moscow during the collapse of the Soviet Union. \"I'm not saying it's a revolution now. But there is this uncertainty about what is happening minute to minute, day to day.\" As the news cycle continues to unfold, journalists are working around the clock to keep pace with the breaking developments. Gone are the days of relying on traditional sources and methods, as the digital age has brought about a new era of instant communication and information dissemination.\n\nIn this fast-paced environment, social media platforms have become a crucial tool for journalists, allowing them to gather and share information in real-time. Twitter, in particular, has become a go-to source for scoops and breaking news, with many reporters and editors using the platform to stay informed and share their findings.\n\nHowever, the increased reliance on social media has also brought about new challenges for journalists. With the rise of fake news and misinformation, it's become more important than ever for reporters to verify the accuracy of the information they're sharing.\n\nDespite these challenges, many journalists are embracing the new era of journalism, recognizing the potential benefits of the digital age. \"Social media has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for journalists,\" said Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. \"It's allowed us to connect with sources and readers in ways that were previously impossible, and to share our work with a global audience.\"\n\nAs the news cycle continues to evolve, it's clear that the role of the journalist will continue to change. While traditional reporting skills will still be essential, the ability to navigate the complexities of social media and digital communication will become increasingly important.\n\nIn the meantime, journalists are working hard to keep pace with the breaking developments, using their skills and expertise to provide accurate and informative reporting to the public. As the story continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the role of the journalist has never been more important.\n\nIn the midst of this chaotic news cycle, it's worth noting that the public is hungry for reliable information. According to a recent survey, 70% of Americans say they trust news organizations to provide accurate and unbiased reporting, and 60% say they rely on news organizations to help them understand the news.\n\nDespite the challenges, many journalists are committed to providing high-quality reporting, even in the face of adversity. As David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, noted, \"Journalism is not just about breaking news, it's about telling the story of our time. And that's what we're trying to do, even in the midst of this chaos.\"",

        "Text": "The classics can take you back in time -- and are probably easier to recapture than you think. Video games hit their 60th birthday in October, if you start counting (as many do) with Tennis for Two, a rudimentary Pong ancestor cobbled together by the physicist William A. Higinbotham at Long Island's Brookhaven National Laboratory. Games have evolved a lot since then, of course, becoming far more complicated and visual, as well as multiplayer. Yet sometimes you just want to play an old favorite. Why seek out an ancient game with rudimentary graphics and only basic actions? For some, it's pure nostalgia, like reading a beloved picture book again. For others, old games are a way to share a link to their childhood with a child of their own. Video game companies have caught on to the urge. Nintendo sells throwback consoles preloaded with its vintage games, as do Atari, Sony and others. The resurgence of classic games has also led to a thriving community of retro gamers, who not only play the old games but also create new content around them. Modders, or modification enthusiasts, have been busy reworking classic titles to add new features, levels, and even graphics. This has breathed new life into old favorites, making them more appealing to a new generation of gamers.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of this is the Doom modding community. Released in 1993, Doom was a groundbreaking first-person shooter that revolutionized the genre. Today, modders continue to create new levels, enemies, and even entire campaigns for the game, keeping it fresh and exciting for players.\n\nThe nostalgia factor is also driving the popularity of retro gaming events and conventions. These events bring together gamers of all ages to play classic games, attend panels and workshops, and even compete in tournaments. The retro gaming community is a tight-knit one, and these events provide a unique opportunity for fans to connect with each other and share their passion for classic games.\n\nIn addition to the nostalgia and community aspects, there are also practical benefits to playing classic games. For one, many retro games are simply more accessible than their modern counterparts. With fewer system requirements and no need for constant updates, classic games can be played on a wide range of devices, from old consoles to modern PCs.\n\nFurthermore, playing classic games can also be a great way to learn about the history of video games. By experiencing the evolution of the industry firsthand, players can gain a deeper appreciation for the innovations and challenges that game developers faced in the past. This can be especially valuable for aspiring game developers, who can learn from the successes and failures of their predecessors.\n\nAs the video game industry continues to evolve, it's clear that classic games will remain an important part of its heritage. Whether it's through nostalgia, community, or education, retro gaming has become a vital part of the gaming landscape. So, dust off that old console or fire up the emulator â€“ there's a whole world of classic games waiting to be rediscovered.",

And although preliminary, the authors think octopuses present a promising model for studying MDMA's effects on the human brain, treating PTSD and better understanding how the brain evolved to conjure social behaviors. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The discovery, published in the journal Nature, sheds new light on the complex social behaviors of octopuses, which have long fascinated scientists with their intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and ability to recognize and interact with individual members of their species.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of behavioral experiments and brain imaging techniques to study the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior in both humans and octopuses.

Mr. Trump easily won the Republican primary in Michigan this month. The state, home base for the American auto industry, also delivered an upset victory to Bernie Sanders, the Democratic anti-Nafta standard-bearer. The sentiment among auto industry workers in Michigan was a stark contrast to the concerns expressed by many in the industry, who worry that a renegotiation or withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could have devastating consequences for their businesses and jobs.\n\n\"We understand that some people are frustrated with the current state of trade, but breaking NAFTA is not the solution,\" said Mike Bonesto, a union representative at the Ford Motor Company's assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan. \"It's a complex agreement that has created jobs and opportunities for American workers, and we don't want to see that undone.\"\n\nThe auto industry is a significant contributor to Michigan's economy, with the state being home to major manufacturing facilities for companies like General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). According to data from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, the state's auto industry employed over 150,000 people in 2015, with an average annual salary of over $60,000.\n\nWhile some auto industry workers may have cheered Trump's promise to \"break\" NAFTA, many others are worried about the potential consequences of a renegotiation or withdrawal. \"We're already seeing some uncertainty in the market, and if NAFTA is renegotiated or withdrawn, it could lead to a decline in production and jobs,\" said Tom McCarthy, a spokesperson for the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.\n\nThe UAW, which represents over 400,000 auto workers in the United States, has been vocal in its opposition to a renegotiation or withdrawal from NAFTA. In a statement released earlier this year, the union said that any changes to the agreement must prioritize the interests of American workers and protect the jobs and livelihoods of those in the auto industry.\n\nDespite the concerns, some experts believe that a renegotiation of NAFTA could actually benefit the auto industry in the long run. \"NAFTA has created a level playing field for American automakers, but it's also led to a surge in imports from Mexico and Canada,\" said Mark Perry, a senior fellow at the Center for Automotive Research. \"A renegotiation could lead to more favorable terms for American automakers and help to rebalance the trade deficit.\"\n\nAs the presidential campaign season heats up, the debate over NAFTA is likely to continue. While some auto industry workers may have cheered Trump's promise to \"break\" the agreement, many others are worried about the potential consequences of a renegotiation or withdrawal.

I was working weekend shifts in a supermarket to make ends meet. The Reality of Student Life: A Story of Financial Struggle and Resilience\n\nAs I walked onto campus, I couldn't help but feel a sense of irony. Everyone around me seemed to be living the stereotypical student life: all-nighters fueled by energy drinks, late-night pizza parties, and endless Netflix binges. Meanwhile, I was stuck in a supermarket, stacking shelves and trying to make ends meet.\n\nLast semester, I found myself working weekend shifts at a local supermarket to cover my living expenses. It wasn't a choice I took lightly, but it was a necessity. The cost of tuition, rent, and living expenses had become overwhelming, and I was forced to take on a part-time job to stay afloat.\n\nI'm not alone in this struggle. According to a recent survey, over 40% of students are working part-time jobs to support themselves while in school. The reality is that many students are not living the carefree, party-filled lifestyle that is often portrayed in media and popular culture.\n\nWorking weekends was tough, to say the least. I would wake up at 6 am, grab a quick breakfast, and head to the supermarket. I would spend the next eight hours on my feet, restocking shelves, and dealing with demanding customers. By the time I got back to my dorm, I was exhausted, both physically and mentally.\n\nBut despite the challenges, I refused to give up. I knew that I wasn't alone in this struggle, and that there were others out there who were facing similar financial struggles. I also knew that I had to stay focused on my studies, no matter how tough it got.\n\nSo, I made a plan. I created a schedule that allowed me to balance my work and school commitments. I prioritized my studies, making sure to get my homework done before my shift started. And I made time for self-care, whether it was a quick workout in the dorm gym or a relaxing bath after a long day.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I was able to stay on top of my schoolwork, and I even managed to squeeze in some extracurricular activities. I joined a student club, which helped me meet new people and build connections outside of my work and school life.\n\nAs the semester drew to a close, I realized that I had learned something valuable. I had learned that even in the toughest of times, there is always a way to stay positive and focused. I had learned that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.\n\nAnd as I walked onto campus this semester, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I knew that I was not alone in my struggles, and that there were others out there who were facing similar challenges. But I also knew that I had the strength and resilience to overcome them, and to achieve my goals.\n\nSo, the next time you see a student walking down the street, don't assume that they're just partying and having the time of their life. Take a closer look, and you might just see someone who is working hard to make ends meet, just like me.",

Speaking as he launched a new product that the firm claims is less harmful than traditional smoking, chief executive AndrÃ© Calantzopoulos predicted a \"phase-out period\" for cigarettes. He said the company's new iQos product, which heats tobacco but does not burn it, releases fewer toxins and is capable of replacing cigarettes in the long term. \"I believe that there will come a moment in time where we have sufficient adoption of this alternative product and sufficient awareness to start envisaging â€“ together with governments â€“ a phase-out period for cigarettes,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday. \"I hope this time will come soon.\" Philip Morris, the largest tobacco firm outside China, has invested $3bn (Â£2.4bn) in the iQos, which differs from vaporisers or e-cigarettes that heat a liquid containing nicotine. The firm's prediction of a future without cigarettes came as the UK court of appeal ruled that plans to remove distinctive branding from packs will go ahead. But campaigners and industry analysts cast doubt on the chances of cigarettes being banished, either by e-cigarettes or other replacement products such as the iQos. Critics have pointed out that Philip Morris' claims are overly optimistic and that the company's true intentions are to maintain its market share and profits rather than genuinely promoting a healthier alternative to traditional smoking.\n\n\"Philip Morris is trying to create a false narrative that their product is a game-changer, but the reality is that it's just a new way to deliver nicotine and other harmful chemicals to the user,\" said Dr. Ellen Kane, a leading researcher on tobacco control at the University of California. \"We need to be cautious of companies that are trying to spin their products as a solution to the smoking epidemic when in reality they are just trying to find new ways to make money off of people's addiction.\"\n\nAdditionally, some experts argue that the iQos is not a suitable replacement for traditional cigarettes, as it still contains nicotine and can lead to addiction. \"The idea that a product that heats tobacco is somehow less harmful than a product that burns it is a myth,\" said Dr. Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California. \"Nicotine is nicotine, regardless of how it's delivered, and it's still a highly addictive substance that can cause serious health problems.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, Philip Morris remains committed to its vision of a cigarette-free future. The company has announced plans to invest an additional $1bn in the development and marketing of the iQos over the next five years, and has partnered with several major retailers to make the product more widely available.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether the iQos will be able to make a significant dent in the global tobacco market. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco use is responsible for more than seven million deaths worldwide each year, and it is estimated that the global tobacco market will continue to grow in the coming years.\n\nIn the UK, the government has announced plans to introduce a new tax on e-cigarettes and other vaping products in an effort to reduce the number of people who start smoking. The move is seen as a key part of the government's strategy to reduce smoking rates and improve public health.\n\nAs the debate over the future of cigarettes continues to rage, one thing is clear: the tobacco industry is undergoing a significant transformation, and it remains to be seen what the future will hold for traditional cigarettes and the companies that produce them.",

A link between the two companies to form the world's third-biggest carmaker after Volkswagen and Toyota has always made a lot of sense. If the deal is scuppered, it won't be due to a lack of business logic; it will be because politics gets in the way. There are two big arguments in favour of the deal. The first is there is a global glut of automotive capacity that is already forcing companies to cut production, close plants and lay off workers. The second is the age of the internal combustion engine is drawing to a close. Technological change has meant progress being made towards autonomous, self-driving cars, while the need to combat the climate emergency has forced car companies to think about a new generation of electric-powered vehicles. These changes â€“ the biggest in the industry for 125 years â€“ leave companies in a bind: they either have to come up with the massive investment required to deliver the cars of the future against new rivals such as Google's Waymo, or become museum pieces. The tie-up between the Italian-American Fiat Chrysler and the French-Japanese alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi is primarily about generating economies of scale in order to save â‚¬5bn a year that would be available for R&D and product development. The proposed merger would also allow the combined entity to better compete with the likes of Waymo, Google's self-driving car subsidiary, and other new entrants in the industry. By pooling their resources and expertise, Fiat Chrysler and Renault would be able to invest in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, rather than struggling to do so on their own.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the merger would be the creation of a global supply chain and manufacturing network that would be difficult for competitors to match. The combined entity would have a significant presence in Europe, North America, and Asia, giving it the scale and reach to compete effectively in all major markets.\n\nThe deal would also provide significant cost savings, estimated to be around â‚¬5 billion per year, which would be redirected towards research and development, product development, and marketing. This would enable the combined entity to invest in the development of new technologies and products, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, and to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nIn addition, the merger would provide a platform for the combined entity to expand its presence in emerging markets, such as China and India, where demand for cars is growing rapidly. The deal would also provide opportunities for the combined entity to increase its presence in the commercial vehicle market, where Fiat Chrysler and Renault already have a significant presence.\n\nHowever, the deal is not without its challenges. The merger would require significant integration efforts, including the merging of two separate corporate cultures and the rationalization of overlapping operations. There would also be concerns about job losses, particularly in areas where the combined entity would have excess capacity.\n\nDespite these challenges, the economic case for the merger is strong. The deal would create a global carmaking giant with the scale and resources to compete effectively in a rapidly changing industry. It would also provide a platform for the combined entity to invest in the development of new technologies and products, and to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed merger between Fiat Chrysler and Renault makes sense from a business perspective. It would create a global carmaking giant with the scale and resources to compete effectively in a rapidly changing industry, and would provide a platform for the combined entity to invest in the development of new technologies and products. While there are challenges to overcome, the economic case for the merger is strong, and it is likely to be a key player in the future of the global automotive industry.",

The results of the stress tests, which are scheduled to be released on Friday, could pose a headache for the 27 European Union finance ministers who met here to discuss ways to ease the region's financial turmoil. Olli Rehn, the European Union's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said that once vulnerable banks were identified they \"must recapitalize themselves, or be recapitalized or restructured.\" In a statement, the finance ministers said that backstop mechanisms would aid struggling banks. \"These measures privilege private sector solutions but also include a solid framework for the provision of government support in case of need, in line with state aid rules,\" the statement said. Officials insist that the exercise is more stringent than tests done last year, which failed to reveal a looming banking crisis in Ireland. The new tests will include a review of how lenders would handle a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the euro zone in 2011, a 15 percent drop in European stock markets and potential trading losses on sovereign debt. The officials insist that Europe's banks and governments are better prepared this time around. Jacek Rostowski, the finance minister of Poland, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency, argued that Europe now had \"a banking system that is in much better shape than it was last year.\" Despite the assurances, the uncertainty surrounding the stress tests and the potential need for additional financial support for Greece continues to weigh on the markets. The Greek government has been struggling to implement austerity measures and reform its economy, and many fear that the country's debt crisis could spread to other eurozone countries.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has already taken steps to stabilize the financial system, cutting interest rates and providing emergency loans to struggling banks. However, the ECB's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, warned that the bank's ability to provide further support is limited, and that governments must take responsibility for addressing their own debt crises.\n\nThe stress tests are expected to identify which banks are most vulnerable to the economic downturn and require additional capital to withstand potential losses. The results will be closely watched by investors and policymakers, who are eager to see whether the banks are adequately prepared for the challenges ahead.\n\nIn the meantime, the European Union is working to finalize a second bailout package for Greece, which is expected to total around â‚¬130 billion. The package will include a combination of loans and debt relief, and will be conditional on Greece implementing further austerity measures and economic reforms.\n\nThe Greek government has already taken steps to address its debt crisis, including raising taxes and cutting government spending. However, many economists believe that more needs to be done to restore confidence in the country's economy and prevent a default.\n\nThe European Union's finance ministers will meet again in a few weeks to discuss the results of the stress tests and the progress being made on the bailout package for Greece. In the meantime, investors will be closely watching the markets for any signs of instability, and policymakers will be working to address the root causes of the debt crisis and prevent it from spreading to other countries.",

The innovative expansion port, dubbed \"Hi-Fi,\" is a major differentiator for the Essential phone, which is expected to be released on June 1st. The company claims that the Hi-Fi port will enable a new wave of accessories and experiences, allowing users to seamlessly integrate their phone with other devices and services.\n\nIn an interview with The Verge, Rubin explained that the idea behind the Hi-Fi port was to create a more flexible and open ecosystem, one that would allow users to customize their phone experience without being limited by traditional connectors and ports. \"We wanted to create a phone that would allow people to do more, to be more creative, and to have more fun,\" Rubin said.\n\nThe 360-degree camera, which is the first accessory to take advantage of the Hi-Fi port, is a prime example of this vision in action. The camera, which is designed to work seamlessly with the Essential phone's camera app, allows users to capture stunning 360-degree videos and photos that can be shared on social media or used to create immersive experiences.\n\nBut the Hi-Fi port is not just limited to the 360-degree camera. Essential has also announced plans to release a range of other accessories, including a wireless charging pad, a pair of headphones, and a portable power bank. All of these accessories will be designed to work seamlessly with the Hi-Fi port, allowing users to easily switch between devices and experiences.\n\nThe Essential phone is set to go head-to-head with Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy series, two of the most popular and successful smartphone brands in the world. But with its innovative Hi-Fi port and focus on customization and creativity, Essential is hoping to carve out a niche for itself in the competitive smartphone market.\n\nThe phone's specs are impressive, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 3040mAh battery. The phone will also run Android 7.1.1 out of the box, with a promise of timely software updates.\n\nPricing for the Essential phone will start at $699 for the 128GB model, with a 128GB version available for $749. The 360-degree camera accessory will be available for $199.\n\nThe Essential phone is set to be released on June 1st, and will be available for pre-order starting May 25th. With its innovative Hi-Fi port and focus on customization and creativity, the Essential phone is shaping up to be a major player in the competitive smartphone market.",

        "Text": "UK banks are strong enough to survive a disorderly Brexit that could leave the country worse off than the 2008 financial crisis, according to the Bank of England. For a second straight year, none of the high street lenders have been told to raise billions of pounds in capital to strengthen their finances, under the Bank's latest financial sector health check. Seven lenders â€“ RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, the UK arm of Santander and Nationwide building society â€“ were tested against a crisis scenario involving a 4.7% fall in UK GDP, a rise in unemployment to 9.5%, a 33% drop in house prices, a hike in interest rates to 4% and a 27% drop in the value of the pound. Lenders faced the same crisis scenario during last year's stress test, but the Bank of England said the economic shocks and market turmoil modelled in the tests broadly matched its assessment of the effects of a no deal, no transition Brexit, which was detailed in a separate paper released by the central bank on Wednesday. The test encompassed conditions more severe than the 2008 global financial crisis. The Bank of England's stress test results have been met with a mix of relief and skepticism from industry experts. While the news that UK banks are prepared to withstand a disorderly Brexit is reassuring, some have questioned the validity of the tests and the Bank's assessment of the potential economic impact of a no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"The Bank of England's stress tests are a useful tool, but they are only as good as the assumptions that underpin them,\" said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. \"The Bank's scenario is a worst-case scenario, but it's still a scenario. We need to be cautious about extrapolating from it to real-world outcomes.\"\n\nStewart also highlighted the potential risks to the UK's economy that are not captured by the stress tests. \"The tests don't account for the potential impact on global trade and supply chains, or the potential for a global economic downturn,\" he said. \"These are all significant risks that could have a much greater impact on the UK economy than the Bank's scenario.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the Bank of England's stress tests have been praised by some for providing a more realistic assessment of the potential risks to the UK's financial system. \"The Bank's tests are a significant improvement on previous years, in that they are more transparent and more granular,\" said Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. \"They provide a much better understanding of the potential risks to the financial system, and that's important for policymakers and regulators.\"\n\nThe results of the stress tests are also likely to have implications for the Bank of England's monetary policy decisions. The Bank has already hinted that it may need to cut interest rates to support the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and the stress tests may have provided further evidence to support this view.\n\n\"The Bank's tests suggest that the economy is more vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit than previously thought,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \"This could lead to a more dovish monetary policy stance, with the Bank cutting interest rates to support the economy.\"\n\nOverall, while the results of the Bank of England's stress tests are reassuring, they should be taken in the context of the significant risks and uncertainties surrounding the UK's exit from the EU. As the deadline for Brexit draws closer, policymakers and regulators will need to continue to monitor the situation closely and be prepared to respond to any changes in the economic outlook.",

        "Text": "Teaching assistants in County Durham are to be balloted on strike action after they rejected a final pay offer by the local council that unions claim could result in a 20% pay cut. The Unison and GMB unions held consultative ballots with their members over Durham county council's plans to fire 2,700 classroom assistants and re-employ them on term-time only contracts. The unions say the move could lose the teaching assistants up to Â£6,000 per year. While 53.5% of GMB members approved the deal, it was backed by only 22% of Unison members who voted. The ballot result marks a significant escalation in the dispute between the unions and the council, which has been ongoing for several months. The teaching assistants, who are responsible for supporting teachers and pupils in classrooms, are concerned that the proposed changes to their contracts would have a significant impact on their livelihoods.\n\n\"This is a devastating blow to our members who are already struggling to make ends meet,\" said a spokesperson for Unison. \"The council's proposal is not only a pay cut, but it would also mean that our members would have to give up their holidays and other benefits. We will not stand idly by while our members are treated so unfairly.\"\n\nThe GMB union, which represents many of the teaching assistants, has also expressed its disappointment with the result. \"While we understand that the council is facing financial challenges, we believe that the proposed changes are unfair and unjust,\" said a spokesperson. \"We will continue to work with our members to find a solution that benefits everyone involved.\"\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing since the council announced its plans to cut costs by reducing the number of teaching assistants. The unions argue that the move would not only affect the teaching assistants but also the quality of education provided to pupils.\n\n\"The teaching assistants are not just numbers, they are vital members of the education team,\" said a local parent. \"They provide vital support to teachers and pupils, and their loss would be deeply felt. I urge the council to reconsider its plans and find a solution that benefits everyone.\"\n\nThe council has yet to comment on the ballot result, but it is expected to respond in the coming days. In the meantime, the unions are preparing for a potential strike, which could have significant implications for the education system in County Durham.\n\n\"This is not a decision we have taken lightly,\" said the Unison spokesperson. \"But we believe that it is necessary to stand up for our members and fight for their rights. We will do everything in our power to support our members and ensure that they receive the fair treatment they deserve.\"",

        "Text": "Ratcheting up an investigation that has been criticized by news organizations and press-freedom groups, the San Francisco Police Department said a freelance journalist who had obtained a leaked police report was a suspected \"co-conspirator\" in the purported \"theft\" of the document. The allegation, contained in a statement issued by the Police Department late Tuesday, was the first instance of law enforcement authorities describing the journalist, Bryan Carmody, as a subject of their investigation, according to Mr. Carmody's lawyer, Tom Burke. Mr. Carmody has covered news events in the Bay Area -- crime scenes, fires, car crashes -- for nearly 30 years as a self-employed journalist. In February, he obtained a police report from an unidentified person, or persons, related to the death of San Francisco's longtime public defender, Jeff Adachi. Mr. Carmody said the document was among the supporting materials he sold to three local news programs that aired reports based on his work the day after Mr. Adachi's death. Mr. Carmody's reporting indicated that Mr. Adachi, who was 59 when he died in February, collapsed at the apartment of a woman who was not his wife. (In addition to the police report, Mr. Carmody obtained photographs of the apartment showing alcohol bottles and marijuana gummies.) The Police Department said Tuesday that it viewed the manner in which Mr. Carmody obtained the report with suspicion. \"As the investigation developed,\" it said in its statement, \"Mr. Carmody was and continues to be viewed by investigators as a possible co-conspirator in this theft, rather than a passive recipient of the stolen document.\" William Scott, San Francisco's police chief, told reporters that investigators believed that Mr. Carmody's contact with whoever had provided him with the police report \"went past just doing your job as a journalist.\" The Police Department's statement sparked widespread outrage and criticism from the journalism community, with many calling the allegations against Carmody a blatant attempt to intimidate and silence a journalist who had uncovered potentially sensitive information.\n\n\"This is a clear and blatant attempt to discredit and silence a journalist who was simply doing his job,\" said Tom Burke, Carmody's lawyer. \"The police department is trying to use their power and influence to intimidate a journalist and to prevent him from doing his job. This is a serious attack on press freedom and a threat to the very fabric of our democracy.\"\n\nCarmody's reporting on Adachi's death had sparked a firestorm of controversy, with some critics accusing him of sensationalism and others defending his right to publish the information. However, the Police Department's decision to label him a \"co-conspirator\" in the theft of the police report has raised concerns about the department's motives and the potential consequences for Carmody's career.\n\n\"This is a classic case of police overreach,\" said Joe Rosato, a journalist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"The police department is trying to use their power to silence a journalist who has uncovered information that they don't want the public to know. This is a threat to press freedom and a threat to the public's right to know.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the Police Department's handling of the investigation into Adachi's death. Adachi was a prominent figure in San Francisco's legal community, and his death was met with widespread shock and sadness. However, the police department's initial investigation was criticized for being slow and incomplete, with some critics accusing the department of trying to cover up the circumstances of Adachi's death.\n\nCarmody's reporting had shed new light on the investigation, including the discovery of a police report that suggested Adachi may have been at the apartment of a woman who was not his wife at the time of his death. The report also suggested that Adachi may have been involved in a romantic relationship with the woman, which had not been previously disclosed.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of the police department in investigating the death of a public official. Adachi's death was a significant event in San Francisco, and the police department's handling of the investigation has been criticized for being slow and incomplete.\n\n\"This is a classic case of police overreach,\" said Rosato. \"The police department is trying to use their power to silence a journalist who has uncovered information that they don't want the public to know. This is a threat to press freedom and a threat to the public's right to know.\"\n\nThe controversy is likely to continue to unfold in the coming days and weeks, with many calling for an investigation into the police department's handling of the investigation and the allegations against Carmody.",

It's a false choice and Faustian bargain.\" The primary human right threatened by the two companies is the right to privacy, of course, but Westby also argues that the eradication of privacy has \"knock-on effects\" that threaten other rights, including freedom of expression, freedom of thought and freedom from discrimination. Accusing Facebook and Google of \"enabling human rights harm at a population scale\" represents something of an inflection point for Amnesty International. The report, titled \"Undermining Human Rights: The Impact of Facebook and Google's Business Model on Human Rights,\" details how the two companies' business practices are fundamentally at odds with human rights principles. According to the report, Facebook and Google's reliance on targeted advertising and data collection has created a culture of surveillance, where individuals are constantly being monitored and tracked, often without their knowledge or consent.\n\nThe report highlights several examples of how this has led to human rights abuses, including the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies, the spread of misinformation and propaganda, and the amplification of hate speech. It also notes that the companies' dominance over the global public square has given them significant influence over the flow of information, allowing them to silence marginalized voices and suppress dissenting opinions.\n\nAmnesty International is calling on governments around the world to take action to hold Facebook and Google accountable for their human rights abuses. This includes implementing stricter regulations on data collection and use, as well as providing greater transparency and accountability for the companies' business practices.\n\nThe report's author, Joe Westby, emphasized that the issue is not just about Facebook and Google, but about the broader impact of the digital economy on human rights. \"We're not just talking about two companies, we're talking about an entire industry that is built on the exploitation of people's personal data,\" he said. \"We need to fundamentally rethink the way we approach privacy and data protection, and we need to hold companies accountable for their actions.\"\n\nThe report's release has sparked widespread debate and criticism, with many experts and activists calling for greater regulation of the tech industry. In response, Facebook and Google have issued statements denying any wrongdoing and emphasizing their commitment to protecting user privacy and promoting human rights.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the companies' words are not enough, and that concrete action is needed to address the human rights abuses detailed in the report. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the era of unchecked corporate power and surveillance is coming to an end, and it's time for governments and companies to take responsibility for the impact of their actions on human rights.",

Restaurant chain Wahaca asked users if they could \"taco bout your data and your emails\". Despite the creative efforts, many experts warn that such tactics may not be enough to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and could potentially backfire. \"While humor can be an effective way to engage with customers, it's not a substitute for transparency and clear communication about how their data is being used,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a data privacy expert at the University of Oxford.\n\nIn fact, many businesses are still struggling to come to terms with the new regulations, which aim to give individuals more control over their personal data. According to a recent survey, nearly 40% of businesses have not yet implemented the necessary changes to comply with the GDPR.\n\nThe lack of preparedness has led to a surge in phishing emails and other scams, as cybercriminals seek to take advantage of the confusion. \"The GDPR deadline has created a perfect storm for fraudsters,\" said Mark Thompson, a cybersecurity expert at Kaspersky Lab. \"With so many businesses scrambling to comply, it's only a matter of time before someone falls victim to a scam.\"\n\nIn addition to the risks posed by phishing emails, businesses also face the risk of fines and reputational damage if they fail to comply with the GDPR. The regulation allows for fines of up to 4% of a company's global turnover for serious breaches, making it a potentially costly mistake for businesses to ignore.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, experts are urging businesses to focus on building trust with their customers through transparency and clear communication. \"The GDPR is not just about compliance, it's about building a relationship with your customers based on trust and respect,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"By being open and honest about how their data is being used, businesses can build a stronger connection with their customers and avoid the risks associated with non-compliance.\"\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are being advised to be vigilant when it comes to their emails and to be wary of any requests for personal data that seem suspicious or unclear.

        "Text": "When two participants in a Duke of Edinburgh expedition felt ill this week, they did what they had been told to do, and contacted help. Despite some early dramatic stories hinting at a disaster, and some appalling weather conditions locally, all 26 were found safe and well after a retrieval mission mounted by emergency services, including mountain rescue and the coastguard. Why do hikers and climbers die? Although hiking and climbing in the UK are a relatively safe sports, there are fatalities: Mountain Rescue England & Wales report over a thousand incidents most years, with annual injuries at about 650 people, and deaths averaging about 34 per year (using 2009-2013 figures). Scottish Mountain Rescue attend slightly fewer incidents per year, but assist about the same number of people and record similar numbers of deaths (see their reports here). While the majority of these injuries are caused by accidents or existing health conditions, exhaustion and exposure are still a significant reported minority of incidents in the UK countryside. Deaths are more poignant when young people are involved. According to experts, a combination of factors can contribute to the risk of death or serious injury while hiking or climbing. Weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, strong winds, and heavy rain, can quickly turn a trip into a life-threatening situation. In the case of the Duke of Edinburgh expedition, the participants were caught in a sudden and severe storm, which made it difficult for them to navigate and find shelter.\n\nAnother significant factor is physical conditioning. Many hikers and climbers underestimate the demands of their chosen activity and fail to prepare themselves physically for the challenges they will face. This can lead to exhaustion, dehydration, and hypothermia, which can be fatal if left untreated.\n\nIn addition, many hikers and climbers also underestimate the risks involved in their activities. They may not take the necessary safety precautions, such as bringing adequate supplies of food, water, and clothing, or informing someone of their itinerary and expected return time. This can leave them vulnerable to accidents, such as falls, avalanches, or getting lost.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh expedition, which is a prestigious award-winning program, emphasizes the importance of teamwork, leadership, and self-reliance. Participants are trained to work together, make decisions, and take responsibility for their actions. However, even with proper training and preparation, accidents can still happen.\n\nThe incident highlights the importance of emergency services and rescue teams in the UK. The mountain rescue teams, coastguard, and other emergency responders worked together to locate and retrieve the participants, ensuring their safe return. The rescue operation was a testament to the bravery and professionalism of the emergency services, who risk their own lives to save others.\n\nThe incident also serves as a reminder to hikers and climbers to always prioritize their safety and take necessary precautions. This includes being prepared for the weather, bringing adequate supplies, and informing someone of their plans. It is also essential to stay alert and aware of one's surroundings, and to seek help if needed.\n\nIn conclusion, while hiking and climbing can be a safe and enjoyable activity, there are risks involved. It is crucial to be prepared, take necessary precautions, and stay alert. The Duke of Edinburgh expedition and other outdoor activities can be a great way to challenge oneself and develop new skills, but it is essential to prioritize safety above all else.",

        "Text": "In several experiments, researchers found that people who came from a higher social class were more likely to have an inflated sense of their skills -- even when tests proved that they were average. In season four of NBC's \"Parks and Recreation,\" Paul Rudd plays a wealthy businessman named Bobby Newport who runs for city council because he's looking for something \"easy\" to do. He is asked during a debate how he'd fix the town. His answer: \"I have no idea.\" Still, the audience goes wild, much to the frustration of his rival, Leslie Knope. It's funny because it's relatable. Sooner or later, we all may encounter a Bobby Newport. What is it about an elite upbringing that seems to make people feel qualified for tasks where they have little experience? This is one of the questions that inspired a study published Monday in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. The researchers suggest that part of the answer involves what they call \"overconfidence.\" In several experiments, they found that people who came from a higher social class were more likely to have an inflated sense of their skills -- even when tests proved that they were average. This unmerited overconfidence, they found, was interpreted by strangers as competence. The findings highlight yet another way that family wealth and parents' education -- two of a number of factors used to assess social class in the study -- affect a person's experience as they move through the world. \"With this research, we now have reason to think that coming from a higher social class confers yet another advantage,\" said Jessica A. Kennedy, a professor of management at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study. Studying social class is tricky. First there's the matter of definitions. Defining social class can be a complex task, as it encompasses a wide range of factors, including income, education, occupation, and family background. In this study, the researchers used a combination of these factors to assess social class, with higher social classes defined as those with higher incomes, more education, and more prestigious occupations.\n\nThe researchers then conducted a series of experiments to test the relationship between social class and overconfidence. In one experiment, participants were asked to complete a series of tasks, including a math test and a writing prompt. After completing the tasks, participants were asked to rate their own performance and confidence in their abilities.\n\nThe results showed that participants from higher social classes were more likely to overestimate their abilities and rate themselves as more confident than they actually were. This was true even when their performance was average or below average.\n\nIn another experiment, participants were asked to watch a video of someone completing a task, such as a puzzle or a game. After watching the video, participants were asked to rate the person's ability and confidence. Again, the results showed that participants from higher social classes were more likely to rate the person's ability and confidence as higher than they actually were.\n\nThe researchers also found that this overconfidence was not limited to self-assessment, but was also perceived by others. When participants from higher social classes were asked to rate the ability and confidence of others, they were more likely to rate them as higher than they actually were.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for our understanding of social class and its effects on our behavior and interactions. They suggest that coming from a higher social class can confer an advantage in terms of perceived competence and confidence, even when that confidence is not justified.\n\n\"This research highlights the importance of considering social class in our understanding of human behavior,\" said Dr. Kennedy. \"It's not just about individual differences, but about the social context in which we live and work.\"\n\nThe study's findings also have implications for education and employment. They suggest that people from lower social classes may face additional barriers to success, as they may be perceived as less competent or confident than their peers.\n\nThe researchers hope that their study will contribute to a greater understanding of the complex ways in which social class affects our lives, and will inform efforts to promote greater equality and fairness in education and employment.\n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings highlight the importance of considering social class in our understanding of human behavior, and suggest that coming from a higher social class can confer an advantage in terms of perceived competence and confidence.",

Founded in Britain in 1998, the company was the country's first product design firm to set up permanent offices in China. After setting up an office in Hong Kong in 2004 and working there for about a year, Andy James Lee, Tecatech's founder and design director, realized he was going to mainland China almost daily to meet with manufacturers and other business contacts. So he decided to see whether he could hire qualified engineers and move his operations to Shenzhen. But things did not go quite as he had expected. Not speaking Chinese, and not knowing where to start, he visited a government job center and asked whether it would be possible to recruit three or four employees who were proficient in Pro Engineer, a software program that requires significant training. The people behind the counter told him he would need to fill out paperwork and have his business registered. \"I walked off,\" recalled Mr. Lee. \"Then all the guys came out from behind the counter, chased after me and said, 'I can use Pro Engineer, give me a job!' I was astounded.\" The unexpected encounter with the enthusiastic engineers was a turning point for Tecatech. Mr. Lee was impressed by their skills and eagerness to work, and he decided to take a chance on them. He spent the next few days training the engineers and setting up his new office in Shenzhen.\n\nFast forward to today, Tecatech has grown to employ over 50 engineers and designers, making it one of the largest product design firms in Shenzhen. The company has worked with clients from all over the world, designing products for major brands such as Apple and Samsung.\n\nTecatech's success is a testament to the growing importance of Shenzhen as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. The city's proximity to Hong Kong and its well-developed infrastructure make it an attractive location for companies looking to tap into the Chinese market.\n\nHowever, Tecatech's journey was not without its challenges. Mr. Lee faced numerous obstacles, including language barriers and cultural differences. He had to navigate the complex bureaucracy and find reliable suppliers and manufacturers. But he persevered, and his efforts paid off.\n\nToday, Tecatech is a leading player in the product design industry, and its success has inspired other companies to follow in its footsteps. The company's story is a reminder that with determination and hard work, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Lee reflected on his experience, \"I was surprised by the talent and enthusiasm of the engineers in Shenzhen. I was also surprised by the challenges we faced, but we were able to overcome them through perseverance and adaptability. Shenzhen has become an important hub for our company, and we're proud to be a part of its thriving innovation ecosystem.\"\n\nAs Tecatech continues to grow and thrive, it serves as a model for other companies looking to establish a presence in Shenzhen. The city's unique blend of innovation, entrepreneurship, and talent makes it an attractive location for companies looking to tap into the Chinese market. With its success, Tecatech is paving the way for other companies to follow in its footsteps and achieve their own success in Shenzhen.",

        "Text": "Streamline, accelerate, graduate. Educators have been scurrying to figure out how to cut short just about every field of professional study, be it law, medicine or business. Graduate business programs were first truncated in Europe in the late 1950s, half a century after the two-year degree was introduced by Dartmouth. But one-year M.B.A.s are only starting to catch on in the United States with cost- and time-conscious students. Donato Wilkins started a graduate program in May 2013 at Emory's Goizueta Business School and is already headed toward a new job in mergers and acquisitions at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"I did the math, and the return on investment for the one-year program was much higher than for the two-year program,\" said Mr. Wilkins, who had worked three years in corporate finance at Xerox and Newell Rubbermaid but wanted to get into a more exciting slice of finance. He considered both savings on tuition and the additional income from starting a job with an M.B.A. salary one year earlier. He believes this: \"You get the exact same benefit as the two-year program -- the same professors, the community, the G.B.S. network, all the on-campus resources and Goizueta brand -- in less time and for less money.\" As the demand for one-year M.B.A. programs continues to grow, many business schools are taking notice. According to a recent survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council, the number of one-year M.B.A. programs in the United States has increased by 25% over the past five years, with many schools offering similar programs.\n\nOne of the main drivers of this trend is the changing needs of students. With the rising cost of tuition and the increasing burden of student debt, many students are looking for ways to minimize their time and financial commitment to graduate school. \"We're seeing a lot of students who are looking for a more efficient way to get their M.B.A.,\" said Linda Abraham, president of Accepted, a graduate school admissions consulting firm. \"They're looking for a program that will give them the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the business world, but without the long-term commitment of a two-year program.\"\n\nAnother factor driving the growth of one-year M.B.A. programs is the increasing recognition of their value in the job market. Many employers are now willing to pay a premium for employees with an M.B.A. degree, recognizing the added value it brings to the workforce. \"Having an M.B.A. degree can be a major differentiator in the job market,\" said David F. Hawkins, a senior vice president at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"It shows that an individual has the skills and knowledge to succeed in a fast-paced and competitive business environment.\"\n\nDespite the growing popularity of one-year M.B.A. programs, there are still some concerns about their quality and rigor. Some critics argue that the condensed format of these programs can make it difficult for students to fully absorb the material and develop the skills they need to succeed. \"One-year M.B.A. programs can be a bit of a challenge for students who are used to a more traditional two-year program,\" said Dr. Maryanne Harris, a professor at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. \"They need to be able to keep up with the pace and intensity of the program, which can be demanding.\"\n\nHowever, many students and employers argue that the benefits of one-year M.B.A. programs far outweigh any potential drawbacks. For students, the condensed format can be a major advantage, allowing them to get back to work sooner and start earning a higher salary. For employers, the value of an M.B.A. degree is clear, providing a competitive edge in the job market and a higher level of skill and knowledge in their employees.\n\nAs the demand for one-year M.B.A. programs continues to grow, it's likely that we'll see even more schools offering similar programs in the future. For students looking to advance their careers and employers seeking to attract top talent, the benefits of a one-year M.B.A. program are clear.",

NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory-California Institute of Technology, via Southwest Research Institute, via Malin Space Science Systems, via Alex Mai\n\n\n\nHours before a close flyby of Jupiter on Wednesday, NASA's Juno spacecraft experienced a malfunction that scrambled plans for peering deep into the planet. At 1:47 a.m. Eastern, the spacecraft put itself into \"safe mode\" and restarted its computer. Juno's instruments shut down, scuttling observations that were to take place as it passed 3,000 miles above Jupiter's clouds. NASA officials said that Juno appeared healthy, however, and engineers were working to pinpoint what went wrong. The computer problem followed a glitch that led mission managers last week to put off one last firing of Juno's main engine in order to refine its orbit. Occurring at closest approach, that engine burn would have shortened Juno's orbit, bringing it close to Jupiter every 14 days instead of every 53. With each close pass, instruments on Juno are to peer beneath Jupiter's dense clouds. With enough passes, scientists should be able to piece together a picture of the planet's composition. Despite the setback, NASA officials remained optimistic about Juno's chances of recovering from the malfunction and continuing its mission to explore Jupiter. \"We're working diligently to identify the cause of the safe mode event and get Juno back to normal operations as soon as possible,\" said Scott Bolton, the Juno mission's principal investigator.\n\nThe spacecraft's instruments were shut down to prevent any further anomalies, but NASA engineers were working to restore them and ensure that Juno's systems were functioning properly. \"We're taking a cautious approach to ensure the spacecraft's safety and the integrity of our data,\" said Bolton.\n\nThe malfunction occurred just hours before Juno was set to make its closest approach to Jupiter, an event that would have allowed the spacecraft to gather valuable data about the planet's atmosphere and magnetic field. While the engine burn that was planned for this close approach would have shortened Juno's orbit, it was also a crucial step in refining the spacecraft's trajectory and preparing it for its next set of observations.\n\nDespite the setback, NASA officials remained confident that Juno would be able to recover and continue its mission. \"We're not giving up on Juno,\" said Bolton. \"We're committed to getting it back to normal operations and continuing our exploration of Jupiter.\"\n\nIn the meantime, NASA engineers were working to troubleshoot the issue and identify the cause of the safe mode event. The spacecraft's instruments were expected to remain shut down until the problem was resolved, but NASA officials remained hopeful that Juno would be able to continue its mission in the near future.\n\nAs the spacecraft continues to orbit Jupiter, scientists are eager to learn more about the planet's composition and magnetic field. With each close pass, Juno's instruments are designed to peer beneath Jupiter's dense clouds and gather valuable data about the planet's internal structure. By studying Jupiter's composition and magnetic field, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of the planet's formation and evolution, as well as the role it plays in the solar system.\n\nDespite the setback, NASA's Juno mission remains an important and exciting part of the agency's exploration of our solar system. With its unique orbit and advanced instruments, Juno is well-positioned to continue making groundbreaking discoveries about Jupiter and the surrounding environment.",

        "Text": "One day when L. J. Krumenacker was a teenager, he left his home to hunt for fossils. He drove about an hour and a half to Paris Canyon in Bear Lake County in southeastern Idaho and stopped at a foothill covered in sagebrush. Mr. Krumenacker got out of his car, picked up the first large rock he saw and smashed it with a hammer, uncovering seven or eight fossilized shark teeth. \"I did a double take. I thought, 'No, this is impossible.' As he stood there, stunned by his discovery, Krumenacker couldn't help but wonder how shark teeth ended up in a landlocked region like southeastern Idaho. He had always been fascinated by fossils, and this find was a significant departure from the usual dinosaur bones and trilobites he had encountered in his hunting expeditions.\n\nDespite his initial shock, Krumenacker's curiosity got the better of him, and he began to excavate the site further. Over the next few hours, he uncovered dozens more fossilized shark teeth, ranging in size from small to large, and even a few fragments of fossilized bone. The find was so remarkable that Krumenacker knew he had to share it with the scientific community.\n\nHe contacted the University of Idaho's Department of Geosciences, and a team of paleontologists was dispatched to the site to investigate. Led by Dr. Emily Taylor, a renowned expert in the field of vertebrate paleontology, the team spent several days excavating the site and collecting the fossils.\n\nThe team's preliminary analysis revealed that the fossils were indeed from sharks, and dated back to the Eocene epoch, around 50 million years ago. This was a significant discovery, as it pushed the known range of shark fossils back in time and provided new insights into the evolution of these ancient creatures.\n\nThe discovery also sparked a flurry of interest among the scientific community, with researchers from around the world reaching out to learn more about the find. Krumenacker, who had initially stumbled upon the fossils by chance, was hailed as a lucky discoverer, and his find was hailed as one of the most significant fossil discoveries in recent years.\n\nThe fossils are now housed at the University of Idaho's Museum of Natural History, where they are available for public viewing. The discovery has also sparked a renewed interest in the region's geological history, and researchers are now working to uncover more secrets about the region's ancient past. For Krumenacker, the discovery was a reminder that even the most unexpected finds can lead to significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the natural world.",

The lawyer, Andrew M. Smith, would recuse himself from any potential investigations or enforcement involving dozens of companies he has worked for over the past two years while at Covington & Burling in Washington, including many banks, lenders, credit-reporting agencies and technology companies, according to two people familiar with his proposed appointment but were not authorized to speak publicly. Those recusals would force Mr. Smith to step aside from his bureau's most prominent investigations: the investigations into incidents at Facebook and Equifax that leaked the personal data of tens of millions of people. He also would not be involved in enforcing a F.T.C. ...a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) order requiring Facebook to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine for its role in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.\n\nThe proposed appointment of Andrew M. Smith, a partner at Covington & Burling, has raised concerns among consumer advocates and lawmakers who fear that his industry ties could undermine the FTC's ability to effectively police the companies he has represented.\n\n\"Recusal is not enough,\" said Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee. \"The FTC needs a leader who is committed to protecting consumers, not just protecting the interests of big corporations.\"\n\nThe FTC's consumer protection bureau, which is responsible for investigating and enforcing consumer protection laws, has been criticized in recent years for being too soft on large corporations. The agency has faced allegations of being captured by the industries it is supposed to regulate, leading to a lack of effective enforcement and inadequate penalties for companies that violate the law.\n\nSmith's appointment would be a significant departure from the FTC's traditional approach to consumer protection. In his current role at Covington & Burling, Smith has represented some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, including Facebook, Uber, and Equifax. His work has focused on defending these companies against regulatory and legal challenges, rather than advocating for consumer interests.\n\nThe FTC's decision to appoint Smith to lead the consumer protection bureau has also raised concerns about the agency's priorities and commitment to consumer protection. The agency has faced criticism for its handling of high-profile cases, including the Facebook and Equifax data breaches, and its lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\"The FTC's decision to appoint Andrew Smith to lead the consumer protection bureau is a clear indication that the agency is more interested in protecting corporate interests than consumer interests,\" said John Simpson, consumer advocate and former FTC Commissioner. \"This is a major setback for consumer protection and a blow to the agency's credibility.\"\n\nThe FTC has not commented on the proposed appointment, but the agency is expected to make a formal announcement in the coming weeks. If Smith is appointed, he would take over the consumer protection bureau from Acting Director, Marcy Goldstein, who has been leading the bureau on an interim basis since the previous director, Maureen Ohlhausen, left the agency in 2018.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Smith's appointment comes at a time when the FTC is facing increased scrutiny over its handling of consumer protection issues. The agency is under pressure to take a more aggressive approach to enforcing consumer protection laws, particularly in the wake of high-profile data breaches and other consumer harm incidents.\n\nAs the FTC continues to grapple with the implications of Smith's proposed appointment, consumer advocates and lawmakers are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the agency. They are urging the FTC to prioritize consumer protection and to ensure that its leadership is committed to protecting the interests of American consumers, rather than just big corporations.",

        "Text": "Each year an index of press freedom raises fresh concern about the horrors faced by journalists in countries such as Turkey and North Korea; this year Britain and other bastions of press freedom are also causing concern. Journalists working in the UK and US may not fear death in the same way their colleagues do in more dangerous parts of the world; but the attacks on them could be just as damaging to journalism itself. On the face of it, there is little new from the World Press Freedom Index, produced by Reporters without Borders: Nordic countries still afford the greatest freedom, North Korea, Eritrea and Turkmenistan the least. Yet there is something new and worrying happening, underlined by the fact that the UK has fallen two places to 40th out of 180 countries, down 12 places in the past five years. Other leading democracies have also fallen, most notably the US â€“ down to 43 â€“ in a year in which a new president called the press an \"enemy of the American people\". What's going on? The not-for-profit organisation also known as Reporters Sans FrontiÃ¨res explained its decision to downgrade the UK by pointing to several attacks on press freedom, typically made in the name of national security. The worst of these was the Investigatory Powers Act, which it called the \"most extreme surveillance legislation in UK history\" as it allows for surveillance without adequate protection for journalists or their sources, particularly whistleblowers. There are two other threats. The other threats to press freedom in the UK, as identified by Reporters without Borders, are the increasing use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence journalists and the growing trend of lawsuits against the media. The organisation notes that NDAs have become a tool for powerful individuals and corporations to gag journalists and prevent them from reporting on important stories. This has led to a culture of fear and self-censorship, where journalists are reluctant to tackle sensitive topics for fear of being sued or facing financial ruin.\n\nThe rise of lawsuits against the media is another worrying trend. Reporters without Borders highlights the case of a British journalist who was sued by a wealthy businessman for Â£100,000 after publishing an article that was critical of him. The journalist was forced to pay the damages and was left with significant legal bills. This type of intimidation has a chilling effect on investigative journalism, as journalists are increasingly reluctant to take on powerful interests for fear of being sued.\n\nThe decline in press freedom in the UK is not limited to these specific threats. The organisation also notes that the country's data protection laws are being used to restrict access to information, and that the government is increasingly using anti-terrorism laws to crack down on investigative journalism. The cumulative effect of these threats is to create a climate of fear and self-censorship, where journalists are reluctant to tackle important stories or challenge powerful interests.\n\nThe decline in press freedom in the UK is not unique to Britain. Other leading democracies, such as the US, are also facing similar challenges. The World Press Freedom Index notes that the US has fallen to 43rd place, down from 32nd place just five years ago. The index attributes this decline to a range of factors, including the increasing use of non-disclosure agreements, the rise of lawsuits against the media, and the growing trend of anti-press rhetoric from politicians.\n\nThe decline in press freedom is a worrying trend that has significant implications for democracy. A free and independent press is essential for holding those in power accountable, and for ensuring that citizens have access to accurate and unbiased information. Without a free press, citizens are left in the dark, and are unable to make informed decisions about their lives.\n\nThe decline in press freedom is not inevitable, however. There are steps that governments and individuals can take to protect and promote press freedom. Governments can pass laws that protect the rights of journalists and whistleblowers, and can ensure that national security laws are used in a way that is consistent with democratic values. Individuals can support independent media outlets, and can use their voices to speak out against attacks on press freedom.\n\nUltimately, the decline in press freedom is a wake-up call for all of us. It is a reminder that our rights and freedoms are not guaranteed, and that we must be vigilant in defending them. By working together, we can promote a culture of press freedom, and ensure that journalists are able to do their job without fear of intimidation or reprisal.",

The Â£520m compensation claim brought by 9,000 retail investors and a handful of major institutions alleges that Goodwin, three former directors and the bank misled them into buying shares during a Â£12bn cash call in April 2008. Granting an adjournment of the case to 7 June, the judge also set a deadline of 1 June for him to be informed of any agreement over the Â£200m settlement being offered by RBS. \"We must have certainty one way or another,\" Mr Justice Hildyard told the court. The case had been due to start in central London on Monday and the judge has already granted two 24-hour adjournments to allow shareholders to thrash out a deal with RBS, which made a last-minute settlement offer just before the case was due to begin. Asked by Hildyard what the impediments to a deal were, Jonathan Nash QC for the claimants said the shareholder group was not able to contact all its members. The judge's comments highlighted the urgency of the situation, as the court battle is expected to be a complex and lengthy process. The Â£520m compensation claim, brought by a group of 9,000 retail investors and a handful of major institutions, alleges that Goodwin and three former directors misled investors into buying shares during a Â£12bn cash call in April 2008.\n\nThe settlement offer made by RBS, worth Â£200m, is seen as a significant step towards resolving the dispute, but the claimants' lawyers have indicated that they are still working to finalize the agreement. According to Jonathan Nash QC, the shareholder group is struggling to contact all its members, which is one of the main impediments to reaching a deal.\n\nThe judge's deadline of 1 June for Goodwin to be informed of any agreement is seen as a critical milestone in the process. If an agreement is reached, it could potentially avoid a lengthy and costly court battle, which could have far-reaching implications for all parties involved.\n\nThe case has been adjourned until 7 June, giving the parties involved another opportunity to negotiate and reach a settlement. However, if no agreement is reached, the case is expected to proceed to trial, which could take several months or even years to conclude.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Goodwin's tenure as CEO of RBS has been well-documented, with many critics accusing him of making reckless decisions that contributed to the bank's near-collapse during the financial crisis. The Â£12bn cash call in April 2008 was seen as a desperate attempt to raise capital, but it was widely criticized as a failed attempt to prop up the bank's struggling balance sheet.\n\nThe outcome of the case is likely to have significant implications for Goodwin, who has faced intense scrutiny over his role in the bank's demise. If the claimants are successful, Goodwin could be forced to pay a significant portion of the Â£520m compensation claim, which would be a major blow to his personal finances.\n\nIn a statement, RBS said it was \"committed to resolving the matter as quickly and fairly as possible\" and was working closely with the claimants to finalize the settlement agreement. The bank has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has argued that the claims are without merit.\n\nThe case is being closely watched by the financial community, with many observers expecting a significant outcome that could have far-reaching implications for the banking industry. As the parties involved continue to negotiate and prepare for the court battle, one thing is clear: the fate of Fred Goodwin and the legacy of RBS will be decided in the coming weeks.",

TV cameras crews, tipped off in advance, were in position outside to watch dozens of investigators in dark business suits pour into the building. But it is likely to take more than symbolic action to assure foreign investors that the company will address a scandal that has caused the company's stock market value to drop by half since early October. Olympus is said to be looking to raise capital from a domestic investor, a move that would dilute the influence of overseas shareholders, while making fundamental changes less likely. In fact, some foreign shareholders say the reaction to the scandal is shaping up to confirm overseas investors' worst fears about Japan Inc.: that entrenched executives will thwart any attempts at reform, with their business-as-usual attitudes given the tacit endorsement of friendly bankers and staid Japanese institutional investors. The raid on Olympus's headquarters is a significant step in the investigation, but it is just the beginning. The company's former president, Michael Woodford, blew the whistle on the accounting fraud in October, revealing that the company had hidden losses of around $1.1 billion. Since then, Olympus has been under intense scrutiny, with many calling for the company to take drastic measures to address the scandal.\n\nHowever, Olympus's plans to raise capital from a domestic investor have raised concerns among foreign shareholders. The move would dilute their influence and make it less likely that the company will implement fundamental changes. Some foreign investors have already begun to sell their shares, citing a lack of transparency and accountability from the company's leadership.\n\nThe reaction to the scandal is also raising concerns about Japan Inc.'s ability to reform. Many foreign investors have long been skeptical of the country's corporate governance practices, and the Olympus scandal has done little to alleviate those concerns. The company's entrenched executives and cozy relationships with bankers and institutional investors have led some to question whether Japan is willing to make the necessary changes to attract foreign investment and improve its business environment.\n\nThe Japanese government has also been under pressure to take action. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has promised to take steps to improve corporate governance and increase transparency, but many are skeptical of the government's ability to implement meaningful reforms. The Olympus scandal has also raised concerns about the country's accounting practices and the lack of oversight by regulators.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Olympus's future remains uncertain. The company's stock price has plummeted, and many are wondering whether it will be able to recover from the scandal. The Japanese government and Olympus's leadership will need to take swift and decisive action to restore investor confidence and address the concerns of foreign shareholders. Anything less may have far-reaching consequences for the company and the country's business environment.",

These may sound like itinerary ideas for a particularly upscale European jaunt, but each is actually an advertisement for a high-end liquor company. In an attempt to attract customers, especially much-desired millennials, premium spirit brands are often eschewing traditional marketing in favor of more imaginative promotions. Millennials are \"not about acquiring products, but about acquiring experiences,\" said Mauricio Vergara, the chief marketing officer in North America for Bacardi. As the spirits industry continues to evolve, luxury brands are recognizing the importance of creating memorable experiences for their customers. Gone are the days of straightforward product placements and print ads; instead, high-end liquor companies are investing in innovative marketing strategies that cater to the preferences of millennials.\n\nFor Bacardi, this means transforming a French bakery into a beach club, complete with sand, beach balls, and a DJ spinning tunes. The pop-up event, which took place in Paris, was designed to showcase the brand's new rum-based cocktail, the Bacardi Razz. The event was a huge success, with attendees enjoying the unique experience and sharing photos and videos on social media.\n\nAnother example of Bacardi's creative marketing efforts is its upcoming film, which will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 2115. Yes, you read that correctly - 2115. The film, titled \"The Future of Rum,\" is a futuristic sci-fi epic that explores the world of rum in the year 2154. The movie is part of Bacardi's \"Future of Rum\" campaign, which aims to reposition the brand as a leader in the spirits industry.\n\nBut Bacardi isn't the only luxury liquor company getting creative with its marketing efforts. Hennessy, the cognac brand, recently partnered with the iconic French fashion house, Louis Vuitton, to create a limited-edition cognac bottle. The bottle, designed by Louis Vuitton's artistic director, Nicolas GhesquiÃ¨re, features a unique blend of Hennessy's finest cognacs and is packaged in a bespoke wooden box.\n\nSimilarly, Diageo, the parent company of Johnnie Walker, has been investing in experiential marketing campaigns to connect with millennials. The company recently launched a pop-up bar in New York City's Meatpacking District, featuring a bespoke cocktail menu and interactive experiences designed to showcase the brand's commitment to quality and craftsmanship.\n\nAs the spirits industry continues to evolve, it's clear that luxury brands are willing to think outside the box to stand out in a crowded market. By creating memorable experiences and investing in innovative marketing strategies, these brands are not only attracting new customers but also building brand loyalty and driving sales.\n\n\"We're not just selling a product, we're selling an experience,\" said Vergara. \"And that's what millennials are looking for - something that will make them feel special, something that will make them remember our brand.\"\n\nWith their creative marketing efforts, luxury liquor companies are poised to make a lasting impression on the spirits industry and beyond. As the saying goes, \"the proof is in the pudding,\" and for these brands, the pudding is a memorable experience that will leave a lasting impression on their customers.",

        "Text": "The Very First Animal Appeared Amid an Explosion of DNA\n\nThe animal kingdom is one of life's great success stories -- a collection of millions of species that swim, burrow, run and fly across the planet. All that diversity, from ladybugs to killer whales, evolved from a common ancestor that likely lived over 650 million years ago. No one has found a fossil of the ur-animal, so we can't say for sure what it looked like. But two scientists in Britain have done the next best thing. They've reconstructed its genome. ...reconstructed its genome. The achievement, published in the journal Science, marks a major milestone in the field of evolutionary biology and provides a fascinating glimpse into the origins of life on Earth.\n\nThe two scientists, Dr. Emma Smith and Dr. James Wilson, used a combination of computational modeling and laboratory experiments to piece together the genome of the ur-animal. They began by analyzing the DNA of modern animals, from humans to fruit flies, to identify patterns and commonalities that could be used to infer the characteristics of their ancient ancestor.\n\nNext, they used computer simulations to test different scenarios for how the ur-animal's genome might have evolved over time. By comparing the results to the DNA of modern animals, they were able to narrow down the possibilities and reconstruct a plausible genome for the ur-animal.\n\nThe reconstructed genome is a remarkable 1.2 billion base pairs long, making it one of the most complex and detailed genetic blueprints ever created. It includes genes for basic biological functions, such as metabolism and reproduction, as well as genes that are specific to animals, such as those involved in muscle development and sensory perception.\n\nThe implications of the discovery are far-reaching. By studying the genome of the ur-animal, scientists can gain insights into the evolutionary processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth. They can also use the reconstructed genome as a template to study the evolution of specific traits, such as the development of limbs or the emergence of complex behaviors.\n\nThe discovery also raises new questions about the origins of life on Earth. How did the ur-animal arise from the primordial soup of chemicals that existed on the planet 650 million years ago? What was its environment like, and how did it adapt to its surroundings?\n\nWhile the answers to these questions remain unknown, the reconstruction of the ur-animal's genome is a major step forward in our understanding of the history of life on Earth. It is a testament to the power of scientific inquiry and the importance of continued research into the mysteries of evolution and the natural world.",

In Twitter posts, Facebook messages and a live British television news program, people pointed to Abu Izzadeen, a radical British cleric who was imprisoned last year for running afoul of British terrorism rules. His photos were shared on the internet. His Wikipedia page was updated with the information. Not only was Mr. Izzadeen not the assailant in Wednesday's attack, but he was also in a British prison, according to his lawyer, Tanveer Qureshi. \"He was not responsible for these terrible and unjustified attacks,\" Mr. Qureshi said by email. The real assailant was identified on Thursday as Khalid Masood, 52, a British-born man who had been previously investigated for potential ties to violent extremism and had a lengthy criminal record. The public naming of Mr. Izzadeen was a troubling reminder that fact and fiction can be hard to separate in a breaking news event. In this rapid-fire world, confusion and hearsay can spread quickly on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. The swift spread of misinformation on social media has raised concerns about the impact of online rumors on the public's perception of events, particularly in the wake of a traumatic incident like the London terrorist attack. The case of Abu Izzadeen serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of spreading unverified information without fact-checking.\n\nIn the hours following the attack, social media platforms were flooded with speculation and misinformation about the identity of the assailant. While some users were quick to condemn the attack and offer support to the victims, others were more focused on sharing unverified information and spreading rumors. The ease with which misinformation can spread on social media has been a concern for experts, who warn that it can lead to a breakdown in trust and a distortion of the truth.\n\n\"This is a classic example of how misinformation can spread quickly online,\" said Dr. Emma Bond, a digital media expert at the University of London. \"In the heat of the moment, people are more likely to share information without verifying its accuracy. This can have serious consequences, particularly in the context of a traumatic event like a terrorist attack.\"\n\nThe speed at which misinformation spreads on social media is largely due to the platforms' design, which prioritizes engagement and virality over accuracy. Social media algorithms are designed to reward content that generates a lot of likes, shares, and comments, often without considering the accuracy of the information being shared.\n\n\"This can create a feedback loop where misinformation is amplified and spread quickly, even if it's not accurate,\" said Dr. Bond. \"It's a challenge for social media companies to balance the need for engagement with the need for accuracy, but it's essential that they take steps to prevent the spread of misinformation.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the London attack, social media companies have faced criticism for their handling of misinformation. Twitter, for example, was criticized for allowing false information to spread on its platform, while Facebook faced accusations of failing to take action to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, social media companies have announced plans to take steps to combat misinformation. Twitter has introduced new measures to flag and remove false information, while Facebook has launched a fact-checking program to help identify and remove false content.\n\nWhile these measures are a step in the right direction, experts warn that more needs to be done to prevent the spread of misinformation on social media. \"It's not just a matter of social media companies taking action,\" said Dr. Bond. \"It's also important for individuals to take responsibility for verifying the accuracy of the information they share online.\"\n\nIn the end, the case of Abu Izzadeen serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of fact-checking and verifying information before sharing it online. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on social media for news and information, it's essential that we take steps to prevent the spread of misinformation and promote a culture of accuracy and truth.",

But in the days since, it has seemed increasingly clear that Andreas Lubitz, 27, the plane's co-pilot, was something far more sinister: the perpetrator of one of the worst mass murder-suicides in history. If what researchers have learned about such crimes is any indication, this notoriety may have been just what Mr. Lubitz wanted. As the investigation into the Germanwings crash continues, experts are shedding light on the motivations and behaviors of individuals who commit mass murder-suicides, and the disturbing similarities between Lubitz's actions and those of others who have committed similar crimes.\n\nResearchers have long studied the characteristics of individuals who engage in mass murder-suicides, often referred to as \"suicide by proxy\" or \"homicide-suicide.\" These individuals typically exhibit a range of warning signs, including a history of mental health issues, social isolation, and a desire for notoriety.\n\nAccording to Dr. Mary Ellen O'Toole, a leading expert on violent behavior, \"Individuals who commit mass murder-suicides often feel powerless and marginalized, and they see their actions as a way to gain control and attention.\"\n\nLubitz's behavior in the days leading up to the crash has been described as erratic and suspicious. He had been struggling with depression and anxiety, and had recently cancelled a training session due to illness. His girlfriend had also reported that he had become increasingly withdrawn and isolated in the weeks before the crash.\n\nWhile it is impossible to know for certain what motivated Lubitz to commit such a heinous act, experts say that the desire for notoriety is a common theme among individuals who engage in mass murder-suicides.\n\n\"Individuals who commit these types of crimes often want to leave a lasting impact and be remembered,\" said Dr. O'Toole. \"They may feel that their own lives are insignificant, and that by committing such a horrific act, they can gain the attention and recognition they crave.\"\n\nThe Germanwings crash has sent shockwaves around the world, and has raised important questions about airline safety and mental health screening. As the investigation continues, experts say that it is crucial to understand the motivations and behaviors of individuals like Lubitz, in order to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, the families of the victims are left to pick up the pieces and try to make sense of the senseless. As they struggle to come to terms with their loss, they are left wondering how someone like Lubitz could have been able to carry out such a devastating act, and what could have been done to prevent it.",

        "Text": "How Did a Virus From the Atlantic Infect Mammals in the Pacific? * None  \n\nSea otters and seals in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Alaska, are infected with a virus that once was seen only in animals in the Atlantic. A new study suggests that melting ice in the Arctic may be to blame -- and that climate change may help spread the disease to new areas and new animals. Tracey Goldstein, a biologist at the University of California, Davis, got curious when sea otters in the Pacific tested positive for phocine distemper virus -- a cousin of canine distemper virus -- in 2004, two years after a major outbreak among European harbor seals. Researchers from the University of California, Davis, led by Dr. Goldstein, embarked on a comprehensive investigation to understand the origins of the virus in the Pacific. They analyzed tissue samples from infected sea otters and seals, as well as environmental samples from the affected areas. The team's findings revealed that the virus was not only present in the Pacific but had also mutated to adapt to its new host species.\n\nThe researchers discovered that the virus had likely spread to the Pacific through a combination of factors, including changes in ocean currents and the melting of sea ice in the Arctic. As the ice melts, it allows for the movement of marine animals and pathogens across previously isolated regions.\n\n\"This is a classic example of how climate change can facilitate the spread of disease,\" said Dr. Goldstein. \"As the Arctic warms, we're seeing changes in the distribution of marine species and the movement of pathogens between ecosystems. It's a wake-up call for conservationists and policymakers to take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change on animal populations.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for conservation efforts in the Pacific. The phocine distemper virus is highly contagious and can have devastating effects on marine mammal populations. If left unchecked, it could lead to significant declines in sea otter and seal populations, which play crucial roles in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.\n\nThe research team is now working with conservation organizations and government agencies to develop strategies for monitoring and controlling the spread of the virus. They are also conducting further studies to understand the long-term impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and the potential for disease outbreaks.\n\n\"This is a critical moment for us to come together as a global community to address the challenges posed by climate change,\" said Dr. Goldstein. \"By working together, we can protect not only the health of marine animals but also the health of our planet.\"\n\nThe study's findings were published in the journal Science and have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community. As researchers continue to unravel the mysteries of the phocine distemper virus, they are also highlighting the urgent need for climate action to mitigate the impacts of global warming on our planet's ecosystems.",

University staff can be forgiven for feeling naÃ¯ve alongside these tech-savvy \"digital natives\" - but is this perception of students' skills based on reality? At Jisc, the UK's higher education digital technology agency, we have been researching how we can best support universities. ...support universities in developing the digital skills of their students. Our research has revealed some surprising findings that challenge common assumptions about the digital abilities of today's students.\n\nOne of the key areas we investigated was students' understanding of digital literacy, which encompasses skills such as online safety, critical thinking, and media literacy. While it's often assumed that students are naturally adept at navigating the digital world, our research suggests that many are lacking in these fundamental skills.\n\nIn fact, our study found that only 40% of students possess a good understanding of digital literacy, with many struggling to identify and evaluate online sources, recognize phishing scams, and manage their online presence. These findings are concerning, as digital literacy is essential for students to succeed in higher education and beyond.\n\nAnother area we looked at was students' ability to use technology to enhance their learning. While many students are familiar with digital tools such as email, social media, and online collaboration platforms, our research suggests that few are using these tools in a way that is truly transformative.\n\nFor example, our study found that only 25% of students use digital tools to access course materials, and even fewer (15%) use them to collaborate with peers or engage in online discussions. This lack of adoption is particularly concerning, as digital tools have the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and interact with each other.\n\nSo, what does this mean for universities? Our research suggests that they need to take a more proactive approach to developing the digital skills of their students. This could involve providing training and support in digital literacy, as well as encouraging the use of digital tools to enhance learning and collaboration.\n\nAt Jisc, we are working with universities to develop a range of initiatives that aim to address these issues. These include providing digital literacy training for students, as well as offering support and resources for universities to help them integrate digital technologies into their teaching and learning practices.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to ensure that students leave university with the digital skills they need to succeed in an increasingly online world. By working together, we can help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in the digital age.",

But Google \"lavender\" and results hint at perhaps the real fuel for our obsession: \"tranquillity,\" \"calm,\" \"relaxation,\" \"soothing,\" and \"serenity.\" Lavender has purported healing powers for reducing stress and anxiety. But are these effects more than just folk medicine? Yes, said Hideki Kashiwadani, a physiologist and neuroscientist at Kagoshima University in Japan -- at least in mice. \"Many people take the effects of 'odor' with a grain of salt,\" he said in an email. \"But among the stories, some are true based on science.\" Kashiwadani's team conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effects of lavender on stress and anxiety in mice. They found that when the rodents were exposed to the scent of lavender, their brain activity changed in ways that suggested reduced stress and anxiety. Specifically, the mice exhibited lower levels of corticosterone, a hormone associated with stress, and increased activity in areas of the brain responsible for relaxation and calmness.\n\nThe researchers also observed that the mice's behavior changed in response to the lavender scent. They became more calm and less aggressive, and were more likely to engage in activities that are typically associated with relaxation, such as grooming and exploring their environment.\n\nWhile these findings are promising, it's important to note that the study was conducted in mice, not humans. However, Kashiwadani's team is planning to conduct further research to see if similar effects can be observed in humans.\n\nIf the results hold up, it could have significant implications for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Currently, there are limited options available for people who suffer from anxiety, and many of these options come with significant side effects. A natural, non-invasive treatment like lavender essential oil could be a game-changer.\n\nIn addition to its potential therapeutic benefits, lavender is also being studied for its potential to improve sleep quality. Many people use lavender essential oil in their bedrooms to help them relax and fall asleep more easily. While more research is needed to fully understand the effects of lavender on sleep, the existing evidence suggests that it may be a useful tool for people who struggle with insomnia and other sleep disorders.\n\nOverall, the research on lavender is promising, and it's clear that this herb has more to offer than just its pleasant aroma. Whether you're looking to reduce stress and anxiety, improve your sleep, or simply enjoy the calming effects of a relaxing bath, lavender is definitely worth considering.",

Mr. Scorsese's partly finished documentary about Mr. Clinton -- which once seemed likely to be released as Hillary Rodham Clinton was navigating a presidential run -- has stalled over disagreements about control, people briefed on the project said. Though parts of the film were shot over the last two years as Mr. Clinton made a philanthropic visit to Africa and elsewhere, the project is now indefinitely shelved, partly because Mr. Clinton insisted on more control over the interview questions and final version than Mr. Scorsese was willing to give, those people said. How Mr. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, who briefly worked as a special correspondent at NBC News, might figure in the film or on the production team was also an open question. Asked about assertions that the project, which is backed by HBO, was stalled over differences about content and control and was now put aside, Matt McKenna, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, in an email described them as \"inaccurate,\" without elaborating. A spokesman for Mr. Scorsese declined to comment on the project, as did a spokesman for Steve Bing, a Clinton friend and donor who was to be a producer of the film. A spokesman for HBO said, \"It's not happening soon but that doesn't mean it's not going to happen.\" The people who described the project's disintegration (barring a sudden thaw between the two camps) spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures. Despite the setbacks, insiders close to the project believe that the issues surrounding control and content can be resolved, and that the documentary could still be revived in the future. However, it would likely require a significant amount of negotiation and compromise from both parties involved.\n\nThe disagreement over control is not surprising, given the strong personalities and egos of both Scorsese and Clinton. Scorsese, known for his meticulous attention to detail and creative vision, has a reputation for being a demanding director. Clinton, on the other hand, has a long history of being a strong-willed and assertive individual, particularly when it comes to his public image and legacy.\n\nThe issue of Chelsea Clinton's involvement in the project also remains unclear. As a special correspondent at NBC News, she has experience working in the media industry and could potentially bring a unique perspective to the documentary. However, it is unclear whether she would be involved in the production team or simply appear on camera as a participant.\n\nThe project's indefinite shelving is a blow to HBO, which had high hopes for the documentary. The network has a history of producing high-quality, critically acclaimed documentaries, and the Scorsese-Clinton collaboration was seen as a major coup. However, the network's statement that the project is \"not happening soon\" but could still happen in the future suggests that they are not entirely giving up on the idea.\n\nIn the meantime, fans of Scorsese and Clinton will have to wait and see if the two parties can resolve their differences and bring the documentary to life. If they do, it could be a fascinating look at the life and legacy of one of the most iconic figures in American politics.",

Despite a well-publicized commitment to involve parents in the city's public education system, some of them are not happy with how Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his school team are following through. And some say they are still not familiar with the new Office of Community and Family Engagement. \"I've heard of the new department, but I quite honestly have no idea what they do,\" said Jonathan Goldman, a parent and Local School Council member at Drummond Montessori School, a sought-after magnet program. The district has long been accused of excluding parents from its decision-making process. As a result, many parents are left feeling frustrated and disconnected from the district's decision-making process. According to a recent survey conducted by the Chicago Parent Alliance, a group that advocates for parental involvement in education, only 22% of parents reported feeling informed about district policies and decisions.\n\n\"It's like they're trying to push us out of the way,\" said Maria Rodriguez, a parent at a South Side elementary school. \"We're the ones who are supposed to be the most invested in our children's education, but it seems like they don't care what we have to say.\"\n\nThe district's commitment to involving parents in the education system was a major campaign promise made by Mayor Emanuel during his re-election bid in 2015. At the time, he vowed to create a more transparent and inclusive decision-making process that would involve parents, teachers, and community members in shaping the district's policies and programs.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the district's actions have not matched its rhetoric.

However, many parents say these efforts are tokenistic and do not go far enough to address the systemic issues that have led to a lack of trust and engagement between the district and parents.\n\n\"We need to see real changes, not just window dressing,\" said Jonathan Goldman, the parent and Local School Council member. \"We need to see parents being included in the decision-making process, and we need to see real accountability from the district.\"\n\nAs the district continues to navigate its first year under new leadership, parents are holding their breath, hoping that the promises of increased transparency and parental involvement will become a reality.

The business secretary has declared â€“ about eight weeks after he could have acted â€“ that it would be a fine thing if we knew more about how Melrose would manage GKN if its Â£8bn bid succeeds. The result is five legally binding commitments from Melrose and one voluntary offer â€“ a pledge to keep GKN's aerospace division, the most sensitive asset from the point of view of the UK's long-term industrial ambitions, at least until 2023 unless the government agrees otherwise. Clark's announcement comes as a relief to many who had been calling for greater transparency from Melrose, a private equity firm known for its aggressive cost-cutting measures. The company's bid for GKN, a leading manufacturer of aircraft parts and automotive components, has raised concerns about the potential impact on the UK's industrial base.\n\nUnder the terms of the commitments, Melrose has agreed to maintain GKN's aerospace division as a separate entity for at least five years, subject to certain conditions. The company has also pledged to invest Â£100 million in the division over the next three years, with a focus on research and development and the development of new products.\n\nAdditionally, Melrose has committed to maintaining GKN's existing relationships with major customers, including Airbus and Boeing, and to continuing to supply the aerospace industry with critical components. The company has also agreed to maintain GKN's current workforce and to provide support for the company's pension schemes.\n\nThe voluntary offer from Melrose is seen as a significant concession, as it will allow the government to have a greater say in the management of GKN's aerospace division if the bid is successful. The offer has been welcomed by business secretary Greg Clark, who has praised Melrose for its willingness to work with the government to ensure the long-term success of the company.\n\nThe news has been met with relief by many in the industry, who had been concerned about the potential impact of a private equity firm taking control of GKN. The company's aerospace division is seen as a critical component of the UK's industrial base, and its maintenance is seen as essential for the country's long-term economic prosperity.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the commitments go far enough. Some have expressed concerns that Melrose's aggressive cost-cutting measures could still have a negative impact on GKN's operations, and that the company's commitment to maintaining the aerospace division is conditional on certain factors.\n\nDespite these concerns, the news is seen as a significant step forward in the bid process. The government is now expected to carefully review the commitments and the voluntary offer, and to make a decision on whether to approve the bid in the coming weeks.\n\nFor GKN employees, the news is a welcome relief.

Witnesses to the review have been doing their best to convince the commissioners about the virtue of expanding the remit of the freedom of information act (FoIa) as a way of countering attempts to water it down. Consider first the comments by Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, who said: \"It's a matter of trying to get the default switch into a different place.\" Instead of releasing information only when you've got to \"the assumption should be [to] release it unless there is a very good reason for not doing so.\" Quite so. The notion that the default switch should be set to release information unless there is a strong reason not to, is a crucial one in the ongoing debate about the freedom of information act. Satchwell's comments come as the commission is reviewing the act, which has been in place since 2000, and considering proposals to expand its remit.\n\nOther witnesses have echoed Satchwell's sentiments, highlighting the importance of transparency and accountability in government and public institutions. For instance, Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading expert on freedom of information, emphasized the need for a \"culture of openness\" in public bodies. \"The FoIA is not just about providing information to the public, but also about promoting a culture of transparency and accountability within government,\" she said.\n\nTaylor pointed out that many public bodies are still not taking the FoIA seriously, and that this lack of engagement is leading to a culture of secrecy. \"We need to change the mindset of public officials, so that they see the FoIA as a tool for improving transparency and accountability, rather than just a burden to be complied with,\" she said.\n\nThe commission has also heard from representatives of the public, who have shared their own experiences of struggling to access information under the FoIA. Many have reported being met with delays, refusals, and even outright hostility from public bodies, which has led to frustration and disillusionment.\n\nDespite these challenges, there is growing momentum behind the push to expand the remit of the FoIA. The commission is expected to make a final decision on the proposals in the coming months, and many are hoping that it will take a bold step towards greater transparency and accountability.\n\nAs the review continues, it remains to be seen whether the commission will take the evidence it is hearing to heart, and make the necessary changes to ensure that the FoIA is a effective tool for promoting transparency and accountability. One thing is certain, however: the public is watching, and the outcome of this review will have far-reaching implications for the future of freedom of information in the UK.",

        "Text": "A year ago the government announced there would be an overhaul of sex and relationship education. It was a welcome move, given that the current curriculum is older than the iPod. Last week, after much delay, ministers finally unveiled the new plans, with the subject rebranded as \"relationship (and sex) education and health education\". So sex is now reduced to a bracket. You have to wonder: are they having a laugh? The reason for the change in name is pure politics. When the former education secretary Justine Greening said she would make sex education compulsory for all schools, tabloid headlines shrieked that four-year-olds would be learning about nookie. Of course, this isn't true. The new curriculum, while an improvement, has been watered down to appease the critics. Gone are the days of comprehensive sex education, replaced by a more sanitized approach that focuses on \"healthy relationships\" and \"emotional well-being\". While these topics are important, they are not a substitute for the real thing.\n\nThe new curriculum will still cover topics such as puberty, consent, and sexual health, but it will do so in a way that is more vague and less explicit. This is a missed opportunity to have a more open and honest conversation with children about their bodies and sexuality.\n\nThe government's decision to rebrand sex education as \"relationship and sex education and health education\" is a clear attempt to downplay the importance of the subject. By putting it in a bracket, they are implying that it is not as significant as other subjects, such as math and science. This is a disservice to the children who will be affected by this decision.\n\nThe new curriculum is also being criticized for being too focused on abstinence and not enough on comprehensive sex education. This is a concern, as it may not provide children with the information they need to make informed decisions about their own bodies and sexual health.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the new curriculum is a step in the right direction. It is a recognition that sex education is an important part of a child's education and that it should be taught in a way that is age-appropriate and comprehensive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the new curriculum is an improvement over the current one, it is still a missed opportunity to have a more open and honest conversation with children about their bodies and sexuality. The government's decision to rebrand sex education as \"relationship and sex education and health education\" is a clear attempt to downplay the importance of the subject.",

Trump on Monday to urge him not to dismantle the Iran deal, calling it a strong bulwark against any Iranian bid to make nuclear arms. \"We urge you to preserve this critical U.S. strategic asset,\" the letter read. The 37 signatories included Nobel laureates, veteran makers of nuclear arms, former White House science advisers and the chief executive of the world's largest general society of scientists. During the campaign, Mr. Trump called the Iran accord \"the worst deal ever negotiated.\" In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, he declared that his \"No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal\" and argued that Tehran had outmaneuvered Washington in winning concessions and could still develop nuclear arms when the pact's restrictions expire in 15 years. The letter, which was made public on Monday, emphasized that the Iran deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), has been successful in preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and has also helped to reduce tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nThe scientists argued that the deal has been rigorously monitored and verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and that Iran has been in compliance with its obligations. They also pointed out that the deal has helped to reduce the risk of conflict in the Middle East and has provided a framework for future negotiations with Iran.\n\nThe signatories included Dr. Eric Chivian, a Nobel laureate and professor at Harvard University, Dr. Frank von Hippel, a veteran nuclear arms expert and professor at Princeton University, and Dr. Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and professor at Harvard University.\n\nThe letter was also signed by Dr. Neal Lane, a former science adviser to President Bill Clinton, and Dr. John Holdren, a former science adviser to President Barack Obama. The chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Dr. Rush Holt, was also among the signatories.\n\nIn a statement, Dr. Holt said that the Iran deal has been a major success and that it has helped to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. He also expressed concern that dismantling the deal could lead to a destabilization of the region and a increased risk of conflict.\n\nThe letter is the latest in a series of efforts by scientists and experts to urge President-elect Trump to preserve the Iran deal. Last week, a group of 100 retired generals and admirals wrote to Trump urging him to maintain the deal, and a group of 1,000 scientists and experts signed a petition calling for the deal to be preserved.\n\nThe Iran deal has been a contentious issue in the United States, with many Republicans and some Democrats criticizing it as a weak agreement that has not done enough to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. However, many experts and scientists have argued that the deal has been a major success and that it has helped to reduce tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nThe fate of the Iran deal remains uncertain, with President-elect Trump set to take office on January 20th. It is unclear whether he will attempt to dismantle the deal or work to maintain it. However, the letter from the scientists is a clear indication that many experts and experts are opposed to dismantling the deal and are urging Trump to preserve it.",

That accolade goes to the Great Dying at the end of the Permian Period, about 250 million years ago, when up to 96% of species became extinct. But since the dinosaurs weren't around for that mass extinction, it hasn't entered the popular consciousness in quite the same way. Despite being less severe in terms of the percentage of species that went extinct, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event has had a profound impact on the Earth's ecosystem and the course of evolution. The sudden and catastrophic loss of life, which included the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and many other species, marked the end of the Cretaceous Period and the beginning of the Paleogene Period.\n\nThe event is believed to have been triggered by a massive asteroid impact in what is now the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula in Mexico, which caused a global cooling effect, wildfires, and a prolonged period of darkness. This, in turn, led to the collapse of food chains and the extinction of many species that were unable to adapt to the new environment.\n\nThe aftermath of the extinction event saw the rise of new species, including the early mammals and birds. These early mammals were small, insectivorous creatures that were able to thrive in the post-extinction environment. Over time, they evolved into a diverse range of species, many of which are still alive today.\n\nThe Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event has also had a significant impact on the fossil record. The sudden and global nature of the extinction event meant that many species went extinct without leaving behind a fossil record. This has made it difficult for scientists to study the event and understand the full extent of the extinctions that occurred.\n\nDespite these challenges, scientists have been able to piece together a detailed picture of the event using a variety of methods, including the study of fossilized rocks and the analysis of the chemical composition of sedimentary rocks. These studies have provided valuable insights into the causes and consequences of the extinction event, and have helped to shed light on the evolution of life on Earth.\n\nIn recent years, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event has also been the subject of much popular interest and media attention. The discovery of the Chicxulub asteroid impact crater in the 1970s, and the subsequent confirmation of the link between the impact and the extinction event, has sparked a renewed interest in the event and its significance for our understanding of the Earth's history.\n\nOverall, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event is a fascinating and complex topic that continues to capture the imagination of scientists and the general public alike. Its significance extends far beyond the extinction of the dinosaurs, and provides a unique window into the evolution of life on Earth.",

I sent off an old mobile phone to a gadget recycling company without checking its credentials or terms of business â€“ and it nearly cost me dear. RapidRecycle.co.uk, part of Goodbye Gadgets, quoted me Â£26.75 for my old Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini. It was in full working order with only one or two scratches and chips. But when I received the payment, it was a paltry Â£5.50, a whopping 79% less than what I was promised. I was left feeling frustrated and duped, wondering how a company could be so brazen in their deception.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the matter, I discovered that RapidRecycle.co.uk is not a registered company with the UK's Companies House, and Goodbye Gadgets, the parent company, has a string of negative reviews online. Many customers have reported similar experiences, with some even claiming to have been sent empty envelopes or received significantly lower payments than quoted.\n\nI decided to take action and contacted the company's customer service team, but my efforts were met with radio silence. No response, no apology, and no explanation for the discrepancy. It was as if they had vanished into thin air.\n\nFeeling helpless and annoyed, I turned to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and filed a complaint. The ASA launched an investigation, and after reviewing the evidence, they concluded that RapidRecycle.co.uk had breached advertising standards by making false and misleading claims.\n\nThe ASA ruling stated that the company's ads were \"likely to mislead\" consumers, and that they had failed to provide adequate information about their payment terms and conditions. The regulator also warned Goodbye Gadgets to ensure that their marketing practices were compliant with the UK's advertising codes.\n\nIn the aftermath of this ordeal, I've learned a valuable lesson: always read the small print and do your due diligence when dealing with unfamiliar companies. It's a clichÃ©, but it's true â€“ if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nMy experience serves as a warning to others who may be tempted by flashy marketing and low-ball offers.

In the post-crisis era, battalions of compliance officers have been recruited and trained. The costs are enormous and still increasing, say the banks, but financial regulators have got what they demanded. All banks must know their clients, including where and how they got their money, and the supporting documentation has to be pristine, especially if chunky sums are moving across borders. That's the theory, but then there's the practice. Despite the significant investments in compliance and anti-money laundering (AML) measures, financial crime continues to plague the industry. A recent report by a leading financial think tank revealed that a staggering 80% of financial institutions have been victims of financial crime in the past year alone. The report also highlighted the alarming lack of effective collaboration between banks, regulators, and law enforcement agencies in identifying and prosecuting financial criminals.\n\nOne of the main challenges in combating financial crime is the sheer complexity of the financial system. With billions of transactions taking place every day, it is virtually impossible for even the most sophisticated AML systems to detect every suspicious activity. Moreover, the rise of digital currencies and online payment platforms has created new avenues for criminals to launder money and evade detection.\n\nThe lack of international cooperation is another significant obstacle in the fight against financial crime. Different countries have varying levels of AML regulations, making it difficult for banks to navigate the complex web of laws and regulations. This has led to a situation where some banks may be stricter than others in their AML measures, creating an uneven playing field.\n\nThe consequences of failing to combat financial crime can be severe. Not only do financial institutions risk losing their reputation and facing significant fines, but they also put their customers at risk of being defrauded or losing their savings. In addition, financial crime can have far-reaching social and economic impacts, perpetuating inequality and undermining trust in the financial system.\n\nIn light of these challenges, experts are calling for a more proactive and collaborative approach to combating financial crime. This includes the development of more advanced AML technologies, increased international cooperation, and greater transparency and accountability from financial institutions. It also requires a shift in the mindset of regulators and law enforcement agencies, who must be willing to work together to share intelligence and best practices.\n\nAs the battle against financial crime continues, it is clear that the frontline troops â€“ the compliance officers and AML specialists â€“ will play a critical role in detecting and preventing financial crime. However, it is equally important that regulators, law enforcement agencies, and financial institutions work together to create a more effective and coordinated response to this global problem. Only then can we hope to make significant progress in eradicating financial crime and restoring trust in the financial system.",

Researchers say these \"Machiavellian\" types appear to throw themselves into group work while actually behaving as lone wolves. Amy Armstrong, from Ashridge Executive Education, who led the study, said the research was part of an effort to explore how to boost engagement at work. \"Engagement levels in this country remain anaemic. They have been stubbornly flat for many years, and we have some of the highest levels of active disengagement in western Europe,\" she said, adding that disengaged employees were vocal, took more time off than engaged staff and took up most of managers' time. The study, published in the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, analyzed data from over 1,000 employees across various industries to identify the characteristics of these \"Machiavellian\" individuals. The researchers found that these individuals often present themselves as team players, volunteering for group projects and participating in team-building activities. However, despite their outward appearance of collaboration, they actually work alone, often taking credit for others' ideas and contributions.\n\nArmstrong and her team also discovered that Machiavellian employees tend to be highly skilled at manipulating others, using tactics such as flattery, guilt-tripping, and intimidation to get what they want. They are also more likely to gossip and spread rumors, creating a toxic work environment that can lead to low morale and high turnover rates.\n\nThe researchers believe that the presence of Machiavellian employees can have a significant impact on team dynamics and overall productivity. \"When you have a team member who is not genuinely committed to the team's success, it can create a sense of distrust and undermine the team's ability to work together effectively,\" said Armstrong.\n\nSo, how can organizations identify and deal with these \"Machiavellian\" employees? Armstrong recommends that managers pay close attention to an individual's behavior and actions, rather than just their words. \"Look for behaviors such as taking credit for others' work, not following through on commitments, and being overly critical of others,\" she said.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for organizations looking to boost engagement and improve team performance. By recognizing the characteristics of Machiavellian employees and taking steps to address their behavior, organizations can create a more positive and productive work environment.\n\nIn addition to identifying and addressing Machiavellian employees, Armstrong suggests that organizations focus on building a culture of trust, respect, and open communication. This can be achieved through regular team-building activities, regular feedback and recognition, and providing opportunities for employees to take ownership of their work and contribute to the organization's success.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the importance of understanding the complex dynamics of team behavior and the need for organizations to take a proactive approach to building a positive and productive work environment.

Discovery broadcasts more than 100 TV channels across Europe from its headquarters in west London, making the pay-TV giant the biggest broadcaster to use the UK as a hub for the continent. The Guardian has learned that Discovery is to shut the European playout hub for broadcasting its channels, affecting up to 100 jobs, as it moves to a US-based transmission system. However, it will continue to employ 1,300 people in the UK, where it makes programmes and broadcasts 16 channels to British viewers. The company said that while it will move the playout of non-live channels â€“ it airs shows from Gold Rush to Running Wild with Bear Grylls â€“ it will look to develop the playout centre as a hub for sport and live broadcasting. The move is seen as a strategic shift for Discovery, which has been operating in Europe for over two decades. Despite its long history in the continent, the company has been facing increasing competition from other global players and changing viewer habits.\n\nIndustry insiders suggest that the decision to shut the European playout hub is partly driven by the company's desire to streamline its operations and reduce costs. With the rise of digital streaming and online platforms, traditional broadcasting methods are becoming less relevant, and companies are looking for ways to adapt to the changing landscape.\n\nHowever, the move is not without controversy. The UK's broadcasting industry has been vocal about the potential impact of the decision on the country's broadcasting sector. The loss of up to 100 jobs will be a significant blow to the local community, and the industry is concerned about the long-term implications for the UK's broadcasting infrastructure.\n\nDespite these concerns, Discovery remains committed to its UK operations. The company has announced plans to invest in its UK-based production facilities, which will continue to produce popular shows such as \"Gold Rush\" and \"Running Wild with Bear Grylls\". The company has also pledged to maintain its 16 channels for British viewers, ensuring that local audiences will continue to have access to their favorite programming.\n\nThe move is also seen as a strategic play by Discovery to position itself for future growth in the European market. By shifting its focus to live broadcasting and sport, the company is looking to capitalize on the growing demand for live content and the increasing popularity of sports programming.\n\nIndustry analysts are watching the situation closely, as it is seen as a significant development in the European broadcasting landscape. The move by Discovery could have far-reaching implications for the industry, and it will be interesting to see how other players respond to the changing landscape.\n\nIn a statement, a Discovery spokesperson said: \"We are committed to our UK operations and will continue to invest in our production facilities and channels for British viewers.

The paper, published Wednesday in Nature, examined data on the effects, over five decades, of extreme temperatures, floods and droughts on national crop harvests. \"People already knew that these extreme weather events had impacts on crop production,\" said Navin Ramankutty, a geographer from the University of British Columbia and an author of the report. \"But we didn't know by how much, and we didn't have a basis for how that might change in the future.\" Dr. Ramankutty and his team combined data from a disaster database with food production information from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. They looked at about 2,800 weather disasters, such as the 1983-1984 drought in Ethiopia and the 2003 European heat wave, along with data on 16 different cereals, including oats, barley, rye and maize, grown in 177 countries. The study found that droughts were the most common type of extreme weather event affecting crop production, accounting for 55% of the total impact. Heat waves were the second most common, responsible for 26% of the losses, while floods made up the remaining 19%.\n\nThe researchers discovered that the impact of extreme weather events on crop production varied significantly depending on the type of crop and the region. For example, droughts had a devastating effect on maize and wheat production in Africa, while heat waves had a greater impact on rice production in Asia.\n\nThe study also found that the effects of extreme weather events on crop production were not limited to the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The researchers discovered that crop yields continued to decline in the years following a disaster, a phenomenon known as \"residual damage.\"\n\n\"This residual damage is a major concern because it can have long-term impacts on food security and the livelihoods of farmers,\" said Dr. Ramankutty. \"It's not just about the immediate loss of crops, but also about the long-term effects on agricultural productivity and food availability.\"\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for policymakers and farmers. The researchers suggest that developing strategies to mitigate the effects of extreme weather events, such as drought-resistant crops and irrigation systems, could help to reduce the impact of disasters on crop production.\n\nThe study also highlights the need for better data collection and monitoring of extreme weather events and their impact on crop production. \"We need to improve our ability to track and predict extreme weather events, as well as their effects on crop production,\" said Dr. Ramankutty. \"This will help us to better prepare for and respond to disasters, and to develop more effective strategies for mitigating their impacts.\"\n\nThe study's authors hope that their research will contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationships between extreme weather events, crop production, and food security. \"Our goal is to provide policymakers and farmers with the information they need to make informed decisions about how to adapt to a changing climate,\" said Dr. Ramankutty. \"We hope that our study will help to inform the development of more effective strategies for reducing the impacts of extreme weather events on crop production and food security.\"",

Nearly a quarter of all spending on fashion purchases is now made on the internet. The company's financial struggles have been ongoing for some time, with Debenhams reporting a decline in sales and profits in recent years. The chain has been attempting to revamp its business model, investing in e-commerce and improving its online shopping experience, but it appears that these efforts have not been enough to stem the decline.\n\nThe planned store closures are expected to take place over the next two years, with the company aiming to reduce its store count by around 30%.

Debbie Hewitt, chair of the Restaurant Group, thanked the majority \"for the support they have shown\" in backing the Â£559m purchase of Wagamama. She will also know that the two-fifths of dissenters, assuming they hang around, will want her out if the super-sized serving of noodles causes medium-term indigestion. As it was, the Restaurant Group's shares fell another 15% as the board declared victory. The stock has fallen by a third since Wagamama came on to the menu last month. The buyer will hope that, once the hefty 13-for-nine Â£315m rights issue has cleared, the market will warm to the pitch that Wagamama will reinvigorate a tired-looking portfolio currently led by Frankie & Benny's and Garfunkel's. Maybe, but it remains hard to ignore the key statistics of this purchase. The price represents 13 times top-line earnings, which is a very high ratio for an established restaurant format. On a per-leasehold basis, broker Langton Capital reckons Â£4m a pop is the most ever paid for a chain of any size in the UK. The high price tag has raised eyebrows among industry experts, who are questioning the wisdom of the deal. \"The valuation is extremely aggressive, and it's hard to see how the Restaurant Group justifies it,\" said one analyst. \"Wagamama is a great brand, but it's not worth 13 times earnings. The company is taking on a lot of debt to finance this deal, and it's a risk that could come back to haunt them.\"\n\nAnother concern is the impact on the Restaurant Group's existing portfolio. Frankie & Benny's and Garfunkel's are both struggling to attract customers, and the addition of Wagamama's higher-end menu may not be enough to turn things around. \"The Restaurant Group needs to focus on revitalizing its core brands before taking on a new challenge like Wagamama,\" said a retail expert. \"This deal may be a distraction from the real issues facing the company.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the Restaurant Group remains optimistic about the deal. In a statement, Debbie Hewitt said, \"We believe Wagamama will be a great addition to our portfolio, and we're excited to work with the team to drive growth and expansion.\" The company plans to integrate Wagamama's operations with its own, and to leverage the brand's popularity to attract new customers to its other restaurants.\n\nHowever, some investors are already sounding the alarm. The Restaurant Group's shares have fallen by a third since the deal was announced, and many are wondering if the company has overpaid for Wagamama. \"The market is sending a clear message that this deal is not as good as the Restaurant Group thinks it is,\" said one investor. \"We'll be watching closely to see how this plays out, and whether the company can deliver on its promises.\"\n\nAs the dust settles on the deal, one thing is clear: the Restaurant Group has taken a big risk.

One of the biggest fears of an ambitious project to lease the first autonomous vehicles to everyday motorists is that other road users might slam on their brakes or drive erratically in order to force the driverless cars into submission, he said. This is why the first 100 self-driving 4x4 vehicles to be leased to motorists as part of a pilot scheme on busy main roads into London will look no different than other Volvos of the same model, said Erik Coelingh, senior technical leader at Volvo Cars. The scheme will start in 2018. \"From the outside you won't see that it's a self-driving car. From a purely scientific perspective it would be interesting to have some cars that are marked as self-driving cars and some that are not and see whether other road users react in a different way,\" Coelingh told the Observer. Coelingh's comments come as Volvo Cars prepares to launch a pilot scheme in 2018, which will see 100 self-driving 4x4 vehicles leased to ordinary motorists in the UK. The aim of the project is to test the feasibility of autonomous vehicles on public roads and to gather data on how they interact with other drivers.\n\nThe pilot scheme, which will take place on busy main roads into London, is a significant step forward for the development of self-driving cars. Volvo Cars has been at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology for several years, and has already conducted extensive testing of its self-driving systems on closed courses and in controlled environments.\n\nHowever, the company recognizes that the real-world testing of autonomous vehicles will require a different approach. \"We need to test our technology in a real-world environment, with all the complexities and uncertainties that come with it,\" said Coelingh. \"This pilot scheme will allow us to do just that, and to gather valuable data on how our self-driving cars perform in a variety of different scenarios.\"\n\nThe decision to deliberately leave the self-driving cars unmarked is designed to minimize the risk of other drivers reacting aggressively to the presence of an autonomous vehicle. \"We don't want to create a situation where other drivers feel the need to 'take on' our self-driving cars,\" said Coelingh. \"By making them look like ordinary cars, we can ensure that they are treated like any other vehicle on the road.\"\n\nThe pilot scheme is expected to last for several months, during which time Volvo Cars will gather data on the performance of its self-driving cars and the reactions of other road users. The data will be used to refine the company's autonomous vehicle technology and to inform the development of future self-driving systems.\n\nThe launch of the pilot scheme has been welcomed by road safety experts, who see it as an important step forward in the development of autonomous vehicle technology. \"Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce the number of road accidents, and we welcome any initiative that can help to bring this technology to market more quickly,\" said a spokesperson for the UK's Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.\n\nThe success of the pilot scheme will depend on a number of factors, including the performance of the self-driving cars and the reactions of other road users. However, Volvo Cars is confident that its technology is ready for the challenge. \"We have spent many years developing our autonomous vehicle technology, and we are confident that it will perform well in a real-world environment,\" said Coelingh. \"We look forward to gathering valuable data from this pilot scheme and to using it to inform the development of future self-driving systems.\"",

        "Text": "The embattled TSB chief executive is to face intense questioning from MPs as the bank stumbled into its second week of chaos following its catastrophic IT failure. Paul Pester, along with the bank's chair Richard Meddings and a representative from Spanish parent group Sabadell, will be hauled in front of the Treasury committee on Wednesday to explain how TSB's IT systems collapsed more than a week ago, and how they will compensate affected customers. Committee chair and Conservative MP Nicky Morgan said: \"We will take evidence from TSB and Sabadell representatives to find out how they got into this mess, who is responsible, and how they are putting it right.\" The botched IT transfer from TSB's former owner Lloyds to Banco de Sabadell was designed to reap cost savings of Â£100m a year but Pester admitted last week that the bank was \"on our knees\". TSB said on Monday its online banking services were \"available again but some customers may still have difficulties accessing and using these services\". A week after problems first emerged, TSB's online services continued running significantly below capacity, with some customers reporting they were still blocked from their accounts. As the committee prepares to grill Pester and his team, the bank's customers are growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in resolving the issue. Many have been unable to access their accounts, pay bills, or conduct transactions, causing financial hardship and stress.\n\nThe IT failure has also raised concerns about the bank's ability to protect customer data. With thousands of customers affected, there are fears that sensitive information may have been compromised during the transfer process. TSB has assured customers that their data is safe, but many are skeptical and are calling for greater transparency about what happened.\n\nThe Treasury committee's investigation is expected to be a tough one, with MPs demanding to know how the bank's IT systems could have failed so spectacularly. Pester and his team will be under intense scrutiny, and any attempts to shift the blame or downplay the severity of the issue are likely to be met with skepticism.\n\nIn the meantime, TSB's customers are being advised to continue using alternative methods to access their accounts, such as visiting a branch or using a mobile banking app. However, many are finding this difficult, particularly those who rely on online banking to manage their finances.\n\nThe IT failure has also had a significant impact on small businesses and entrepreneurs who rely on TSB for their banking needs. Many have reported difficulties in accessing their accounts, making it difficult to pay employees, suppliers, or invoices on time.\n\nAs the investigation gets underway, it remains to be seen how TSB will respond to the crisis. The bank has already apologized for the inconvenience caused and has promised to compensate affected customers, but many are calling for more concrete action to restore confidence in the bank's systems.\n\nThe Treasury committee's inquiry is expected to be a lengthy one, with MPs likely to scrutinize every aspect of the IT transfer and the bank's response to the crisis. For TSB, the stakes are high, and the outcome could have significant implications for the bank's reputation and future viability.",

        "Text": "Has Sharon White at Ofcom flunked it by declining to order an immediate breakup of BT? No. The argument for liberating Openreach â€“ as advocated by Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk â€“ was always too full of wishful thinking. There are many reasons to bemoan BT's performance in broadband but abolishing one monopoly supplier to create another monopoly supplier would have achieved little in itself. An independent Openreach, loaded with a chunk of pension liabilities, might have chosen to sweat its old copper assets just as intensely as critics say BT does. Competition would not have been advanced one jot. Even more heavier-handed regulation might have been required to improve the UK's broadband infrastructure. White is sensibly retaining the breakup option and thus waving a weapon at BT chief executive Gavin Patterson to discourage foot-dragging. But, for now, the focus is on encouraging rivals to invest in competing fibre cables while injecting accountability into Openreach. It is a good, pragmatic choice. First, BT will have to allow rivals to build their own fibre networks by opening up Openreach's underground cable ducts and telegraph poles. Second, there will be heavier fines if Openreach misses service standards. Third, Openreach will have an independent board. The opening up of the infrastructure is the most important innovation. BT reacted by shrugging its shoulders and saying rivals have had that right since 2009 and few have bothered to use it. However, it appears that BT's rivals have been slow to take advantage of this existing right, and the regulator is now pushing for greater action. The company's reluctance to open up its infrastructure is a major sticking point, with many arguing that it is hindering the development of a more competitive and robust broadband market.\n\nUnder the new plans, BT will be required to provide more detailed information about its infrastructure, including the location and condition of its underground cable ducts and telegraph poles. This will enable rivals to better plan their own fibre network builds and reduce the risk of costly delays and disputes.\n\nIn addition, Ofcom is also introducing measures to increase transparency and accountability within Openreach. The company will be required to publish regular updates on its performance, including metrics on the quality and reliability of its services. This will enable consumers to make more informed choices about their broadband providers and hold companies accountable for any failures to meet expected standards.\n\nThe new measures are likely to be welcomed by many in the industry, who have long argued that BT's dominance of the UK's broadband market has stifled innovation and competition. However, some have expressed concerns that the regulator's approach may not go far enough, and that more radical measures may be needed to truly address the issues facing the UK's broadband infrastructure.\n\nFor its part, BT has expressed disappointment at the decision not to force a full breakup of the company, but has welcomed the regulator's commitment to increasing competition and improving the quality of its services. The company has also pledged to work closely with Ofcom to implement the new measures and ensure a smooth transition to the new regime.\n\nOverall, the decision by Ofcom to retain the breakup option while still pushing for greater competition and accountability within Openreach is a pragmatic one that balances the need to address the UK's broadband challenges with the need to avoid disrupting the market. While some may argue that more could have been done to address the issues facing the industry, the regulator's approach is likely to be seen as a step in the right direction by many.",

        "Text": "The Online Ad World Is Murky. A Group of Companies Wants to Fix That. A group of 16 companies -- including leading ad tech firms, ad agencies and publishers -- is trying to help clean up the murky world of digital advertising. On Wednesday, the companies called for more visibility into where each dollar is spent in the online advertising supply chain. They committed to standards and practices for sharing data on fees and authenticating content, and urged others to move in the same direction. The move, industry executives and analysts say, is an effort to bolster digital advertising outside the domains of Google and Facebook, whose ad businesses are being scrutinized by federal and state investigators for anticompetitive behavior. The group, which includes Oracle and News Corporation, also hopes to apply pressure on the digital ad powers to pry open their \"black box\" marketplaces, by disclosing fees and other information. Publishers routinely complain that the opaque nature of the digital ad pipeline is inefficient and expensive, with middlemen taking an outsize share of ad spending. The companies, which also include The New York Times, The Washington Post, and ad tech firms like AppNexus and PubMatic, have formed an alliance to promote transparency and accountability in the digital advertising industry. The move comes as regulators and lawmakers increasingly scrutinize the digital ad market, which is dominated by Google and Facebook.\n\nAccording to the alliance, the lack of transparency in the digital ad supply chain has led to inefficiencies and high costs for publishers and advertisers. The group claims that middlemen, such as ad exchanges and demand-side platforms, take a significant share of ad spending, leaving publishers with reduced revenue and advertisers with limited visibility into where their ads are being displayed.\n\n\"We believe that transparency is essential to building trust in the digital ad market,\" said a spokesperson for the alliance. \"By sharing data on fees and authenticating content, we can help ensure that advertisers get the value they expect from their ad spend, and that publishers receive fair compensation for their content.\"\n\nThe alliance has outlined a set of principles for transparency and accountability, which include:\n\n* Disclosing fees and other charges associated with ad transactions\n* Authenticating content to prevent ad fraud\n* Providing clear and concise information about ad placement and targeting\n* Ensuring that data is shared securely and in compliance with industry standards\n\nThe group is urging other companies in the digital ad industry to adopt these principles and commit to transparency and accountability. The move is seen as a significant step towards creating a more level playing field in the digital ad market, where smaller players can compete more effectively with the dominant players.\n\nIndustry analysts say that the alliance's efforts could have a significant impact on the digital ad market. \"This is a major development in the digital ad industry,\" said an analyst at eMarketer. \"The lack of transparency has been a major issue for years, and this alliance is a step towards addressing that problem. If other companies follow suit, it could lead to a more efficient and effective digital ad market.\"\n\nThe alliance's efforts are also seen as a response to the growing scrutiny of Google and Facebook's ad businesses. Both companies have faced antitrust investigations and lawsuits over their dominance of the digital ad market. The alliance's push for transparency and accountability is seen as an effort to apply pressure on these companies to open up their \"black box\" marketplaces and provide more information about their ad practices.\n\nIn a statement, Google said that it \"welcomes the efforts of the alliance to promote transparency and accountability in the digital ad industry.\" Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe alliance's efforts are expected to continue in the coming months, with the group planning to release a report on its progress and outlining a roadmap for future action. The move is seen as a significant step towards creating a more transparent and accountable digital ad market, and could have significant implications for the industry as a whole.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The White House is expected to name , the deputy director of the National Economic Council, as the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to comment on the record. Mr. Furman is one of the last holdovers from the original Obama administration economic team that managed the financial crisis and deep recession. His nomination, which the Senate must confirm, might signal a more powerful role for a body that has in the last few years proven less central than the National Economic Council and the Treasury Department. Mr. Furman, who has a doctorate in economics from Harvard, has a long history in Washington. He served as an economist in the Clinton administration, spent time at the World Bank and has advised several Democrats, including current Secretary of State John Kerry during his presidential campaign. If confirmed, Furman's appointment would mark a significant shift in the White House's economic policy apparatus. The Council of Economic Advisers, which was established in 1946, is tasked with providing independent economic analysis to the President and advising on economic policy. While the Council has historically played a key role in shaping economic policy, its influence has waned in recent years as the National Economic Council and the Treasury Department have taken on more prominent roles.\n\nFurman's background and experience make him well-suited to lead the Council. As a former member of the Obama administration's economic team, he played a key role in managing the financial crisis and implementing policies to stimulate economic growth. His experience working with international organizations, including the World Bank, would also be valuable in navigating the complex global economic landscape.\n\nFurman's nomination has been welcomed by many in the economic policy community, who see him as a strong advocate for evidence-based policy-making. \"Jason Furman is an exceptional economist and a dedicated public servant,\" said former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. \"He would bring a high level of expertise and integrity to the role of Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.\"\n\nThe Senate confirmation process is likely to be smooth, given Furman's broad support among Democrats and Republicans. His nomination is expected to be sent to the Senate in the coming weeks, with a vote likely to take place in the spring.\n\nFurman's appointment comes at a critical time for the US economy, which is facing a range of challenges, including rising inflation, a slowing job market, and ongoing trade tensions. As Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Furman will be tasked with providing independent analysis and advice to the President on these and other economic issues.\n\nIn a statement, the White House praised Furman's qualifications and experience, saying that he would be a \"strong and effective\" leader for the Council. \"Jason Furman is a highly respected economist with a deep understanding of the economy and a strong commitment to public service,\" said a White House spokesperson. \"We look forward to his confirmation and to working with him to advance the President's economic agenda.\"",

The swirl of bad news around the company comes after its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was criticised for meeting the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, having refused to appear before an influential parliamentary committee in Westminster. The meeting came amid speculation that the government may soon publish a white paper potentially paving the way for an independent social media regulator. But the Observer has been told that a row is brewing over how the regulator should be funded. The controversy surrounding Facebook's handling of user data has reached a fever pitch, with concerns mounting over the company's alleged receipt of highly personal information from third-party apps. The development comes as the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, faces scrutiny for meeting with UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright, despite previously declining to appear before a parliamentary committee in Westminster.\n\nThe meeting has sparked widespread criticism, with many questioning the timing and purpose of the encounter. The UK government has been considering the introduction of an independent social media regulator, and some have speculated that the meeting may have been a precursor to discussing the funding of such a regulator.\n\nAccording to sources, a row is brewing over how the regulator should be funded. The UK government has been under pressure to take a tougher stance on social media companies, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency. The proposed regulator would be responsible for ensuring that social media platforms adhere to a set of strict guidelines, including those related to data privacy and online safety.\n\nHowever, the question of how the regulator would be funded has become a major point of contention. The UK government has been considering a range of options, including imposing a levy on social media companies or introducing a new tax on online advertising revenue.\n\nFacebook has faced intense scrutiny in recent months over its handling of user data, following revelations that the company had allowed third-party developers to access sensitive information without users' consent. The company has since implemented a number of changes to its data policies, including the introduction of new controls on third-party app access.\n\nDespite these efforts, concerns over Facebook's handling of user data remain. The company's decision to meet with the UK Culture Secretary has only added to the controversy, with many questioning the company's commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nAs the debate over the funding of the social media regulator continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the UK government will ultimately decide to proceed. One thing is certain, however: the controversy surrounding Facebook's handling of user data is unlikely to subside anytime soon, and the company will need to take significant steps to regain the trust of its users and regulators alike.",

        "Text": "Now that the holiday spending party is over and credit card statements are landing in mailboxes, consumers would be wise to start whittling their balances, financial advisers and analysts say. Consumers have been spending freely on plastic as the economy motors along. Revolving credit -- mostly credit card debt -- reached a record $1.023 trillion in November, the Federal Reserve reported this week. (Data for December will be reported in early February.) Serious card account delinquencies remain relatively low, but have been ticking upward. Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit that oversees a network of agencies offering low-cost or free advice for consumers struggling with debt, said its member offices were seeing more people carrying larger balances from month to month. \"It certainly has our attention,\" he said. Interest rates are expected to keep rising in 2018, meaning that borrowers who carry balances should reduce their card debt to avoid higher costs, said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst with CreditCards.com, a card comparison website. How to avoid trouble? For starters, stop adding to your card balance except for emergencies, and seek better terms. \"There's nothing wrong with calling your card issuer to see if you can get a lower rate,\" said Bill Hardekopf, chief executive of the card website LowCards.com. He suggests borrowers check their credit report before calling, so they know what kind of a rate they might reasonably expect. As interest rates continue to rise, consumers are facing a double whammy: higher borrowing costs and potentially lower credit scores. According to Schulz, the average credit card interest rate has already risen to 16.5% in 2017, up from 15.4% in 2016. This means that cardholders who carry balances will be paying more in interest charges over time.\n\nTo avoid falling into this trap, experts recommend paying more than the minimum payment each month. \"Even paying an extra $10 or $20 per month can make a big difference in the long run,\" said Hardekopf. \"It's also important to prioritize your debt, focusing on the card with the highest interest rate first.\"\n\nConsumers can also take advantage of balance transfer offers, which allow them to move their existing debt to a new card with a lower or 0% interest rate. However, it's essential to read the fine print and be aware of any balance transfer fees or promotional period expiration dates.\n\nAnother strategy is to consider a debt consolidation loan, which can simplify payments and potentially lower interest rates. \"Debt consolidation loans can be a good option for people who have multiple credit cards with high balances and are struggling to make payments,\" said McClary. \"However, it's crucial to carefully review the terms and conditions before committing to a loan.\"\n\nIn addition to these strategies, consumers should also monitor their credit reports and credit scores regularly. A single missed payment or credit inquiry can significantly impact credit scores, making it more difficult to qualify for loans or credit in the future.\n\nBy taking proactive steps to manage their credit card debt, consumers can avoid financial trouble and maintain a healthy credit profile. As the economy continues to grow, it's essential to prioritize debt management and make smart financial decisions to ensure long-term financial stability.",

The demonstrations, which were largely peaceful, started in the morning at the headquarters of the European Central Bank and moved to the central shopping area at midday. Demonstrations were also held in Frankfurt at the headquarters of Deutsche Bank, the biggest German bank and one of the largest in Europe. By midafternoon the protests had moved to the airport. The police estimated that between 500 and 1,000 people were in scattered groups at multiple sites around the city. Organizers had expected more protesters, and the police had planned for thousands. A group called Blockupy organized the demonstrations. As the sun began to set on Frankfurt, the protesters showed no signs of dispersing. Despite the police presence, the atmosphere remained calm and peaceful, with chants and songs filling the air. The diverse group of demonstrators, ranging from students to union members, held signs and banners bearing messages such as \"End Austerity Now\" and \"Global Solidarity with Workers.\"\n\nThe protests were a response to the economic policies implemented by the European Central Bank and other financial institutions, which many see as perpetuating inequality and exacerbating poverty. \"We're here to say that the current system is not working for the majority of people,\" said Maria, a 25-year-old student who traveled from Berlin to participate in the demonstrations. \"We need a more just and equitable society, and that means challenging the power of the banks and corporations.\"\n\nThe Blockupy movement, which organized the protests, has been vocal in its criticism of the European Central Bank's policies, which it sees as favoring the interests of big business and financial institutions over those of ordinary people.

In a statement, Boeing said the board had \"decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders\". The Chicago-based company said its chairman, David Calhoun, would take over as chief executive on 13 January. Muilenburg's departure comes after months of intense scrutiny and criticism surrounding the 737 Max's certification process and the company's handling of the crisis. The crashes of the 737 Max in Ethiopia and Indonesia in March and October 2018, respectively, led to the grounding of the entire fleet and a significant loss of revenue for Boeing.\n\nThe decision to fire Muilenburg was seen as a move to distance the company from the controversy and to signal a new direction under Calhoun's leadership. Calhoun, who has been a member of Boeing's board since 2009, has a background in aerospace and defense, having previously served as the CEO of Nielsen Holdings and the CEO of AFL-CIO.\n\nIn a statement, Calhoun said, \"I am honored to lead this iconic American company and its dedicated employees, and I am committed to making things right with our customers, our regulators, and the public.\" He added that Boeing's top priority would be to ensure the safety and reliability of its products and to restore the trust of its stakeholders.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant step towards Boeing's recovery, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to fully restore the company's reputation. The 737 Max is expected to return to service in the coming months, but Boeing still faces numerous lawsuits and regulatory investigations related to the crashes.\n\nIndustry analysts say that Calhoun's appointment is a positive step, but that Boeing still needs to address the underlying issues that led to the crashes. \"This is a necessary step, but it's not sufficient on its own,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group. \"Boeing needs to fundamentally change its culture and its approach to safety and regulatory compliance.\"\n\nBoeing's stock price rose slightly following the announcement, but it remains to be seen whether the company can regain its footing in the long term. The company's struggles have had a ripple effect throughout the aviation industry, with airlines and suppliers facing significant financial losses as a result of the grounding.\n\nAs Boeing looks to the future, it will be crucial for the company to demonstrate its commitment to safety and transparency. Calhoun has promised to work closely with regulators and customers to ensure that the company's products meet the highest standards, and to provide regular updates on the status of the 737 Max's return to service.\n\nIn the meantime, the company is facing numerous challenges, including a massive backlog of orders and a need to rebuild trust with its customers and the public. As the aviation industry continues to evolve, Boeing will need to adapt and innovate to remain competitive. With Calhoun at the helm, the company will be closely watched to see if it can regain its footing and return to its position as a leader in the industry.",

        "Text": "In the capital of Zimbabwe, a building called Eastgate Centre holds nearly 350,000 square-feet of office space and shops. It uses 90 percent less energy than a similar sized building next door. In the 1990s, Mick Pearce, the building's architect, took his inspiration from mounds built by fungus-farming termites he saw on a nature show. The insects created their own air conditioning systems that circulated hot and cool air between the mound and the outside. As architects and builders seek new and improved ways to cool buildings without using more energy in a warming world, a study of another type of termite mound suggests that Mr. Pearce won't be the last human to take design tips from these cockroach cousins. The study, published in the journal Nature, analyzed the intricate tunnel systems of the African termite species Macrotermes natalensis. Researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of Pretoria found that the termites' underground structures were able to maintain a consistent temperature of around 25Â°C (77Â°F) throughout the year, despite the scorching heat of the African savannah.\n\nThe secret to the termites' success lies in their unique ventilation system. The insects create complex networks of tunnels and chambers that allow hot air to rise and escape, while simultaneously drawing in cooler air from the surrounding soil. This process is facilitated by the termites' ability to modify the soil's moisture levels, creating a stable microclimate that is ideal for their survival.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Adrian Bejjani, were amazed by the efficiency of the termites' system. \"The termites are able to maintain a consistent temperature without using any energy at all,\" Dr. Bejjani said. \"They're able to do this by using the natural convection of air and the thermal mass of the soil. It's a truly remarkable example of biomimicry.\"\n\nThe findings of the study have significant implications for the design of buildings in hot and humid climates. As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, architects and engineers are increasingly turning to nature for inspiration. By studying the unique adaptations of insects like termites, researchers hope to develop new and innovative solutions for cooling buildings without relying on energy-intensive air conditioning systems.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the Eastgate Centre has already proven that biomimicry can be a game-changer. Since its opening in 1996, the building has saved millions of dollars in energy costs, while also reducing its carbon footprint. The study's findings suggest that similar designs could be replicated in other parts of the world, providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution for the built environment.\n\nAs Dr. Bejjani noted, \"The termites are showing us that there's a better way to build. By embracing biomimicry, we can create buildings that are not only more efficient, but also more sustainable and more resilient. It's a new frontier in architecture, and one that has the potential to transform the way we design and build our cities.\"",

        "Text": "After weeks of backing a European rescue for the financially troubled Greece, Germany shifted course on Thursday, signaling that help should come from the International Monetary Fund rather than Greece's neighbors. Turning to the I.M.F. would represent a new and potentially humiliating twist in Greece's financial drama, which was set off by doubts about Athens's ability to borrow 53 billion euros this year to finance a yawning budget deficit and refinance waves of debt coming due. Worries that investors would shun Greek bonds and force a default shook markets worldwide last month but eased recently after Germany and other members of the European Union signaled they would come to Greece's aid if necessary. The Greek government, in turn, unveiled a long-awaited package of budget cuts. But prospects for both European aid and domestic spending cuts seemed to fade Thursday with Berlin's about-face, as well as a warning from Greece's prime minister that the promised budget cuts might not be enacted unless the country could borrow at lower interest rates. \"We will make it, provided that our country can borrow on reasonable terms,\" Prime Minister George A. Papandreou said in a cabinet meeting that was broadcast in Greece. \"Based on those conditions, our country is not seeking and will not seek financial aid, either from our European partners or from the I.M.F., which would be our last resort.\" Despite Mr. Papandreou's brave talk, it is likely that some form of aid will be needed to help Greece raise the 53 billion euros, which includes 20 billion euros that is needed in April and May alone. And for Greece, as well as the European Union, the maneuvers Thursday amount to fiscal brinksmanship. The sudden shift in Germany's stance has sent shockwaves through the global financial markets, with investors scrambling to reassess the prospects of Greece's financial recovery. The Greek government, meanwhile, is facing mounting pressure to deliver on its promises of fiscal reform, with many questioning whether the country has the capacity to implement the necessary austerity measures.\n\nThe European Union, too, is facing a crisis of confidence, as the bloc's ability to respond to the Greek crisis is being called into question. The EU's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), has been criticized for its limited resources and lack of credibility, with many arguing that it is not equipped to handle the scale of Greece's debt crisis.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is emerging as a key player in the drama. The IMF has already provided Greece with a series of loans, but many believe that a full-scale bailout program is needed to stabilize the country's economy. However, the IMF's involvement would come with strict conditions and austerity measures, which could further exacerbate the crisis.\n\nThe Greek government, meanwhile, is facing a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, it needs to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal reform and reduce its budget deficit in order to regain the trust of international investors. On the other hand, it must also ensure that the austerity measures do not spark widespread social unrest and undermine the country's fragile economic recovery.\n\nIn a bid to address these concerns, the Greek government has announced a series of measures aimed at reducing the country's budget deficit. These include a 10% cut in public sector salaries, a 15% reduction in government spending, and a series of tax increases. However, many believe that these measures are insufficient and that more drastic action is needed to address Greece's debt crisis.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, the world is watching with bated breath to see how Greece and the European Union will respond to the crisis. Will the IMF step in to provide a bailout, or will Greece be forced to default on its debt? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the future of the eurozone hangs in the balance.",

        "Text": "Professional footballer Zeli Ismail had never heard of a\"rentcharge\" when he bought his freehold home in Wolverhampton in May 2015. But the overlooked clause in his property's deeds has led to the Bury midfielder facing large legal bills and threatened with eviction. Ismail's story is rare â€“ but terrifying. He bought his home outright, and settled down to family life with his partner and young daughter. The first time the 24-year-old saw the word \"rentcharge\" was when he received a solicitor's letter in December 2017 incorrectly describing him as \"a tenant\". After a call, an amended letter arrived in January this year entitled \"Outstanding rentcharges and fees\" and included an invoice for backdated charges of Â£112.51, Â£3.61 interest, Â£240 for two letters, and solicitor's fees of Â£480. The letter stated that if the total bill of Â£836.12 wasn't settled within 21 days, the client \"intends to either re-enter the property or grant a lease in respect of the property\". Ismail was shocked and confused by the sudden demand for payment, which he believed was a mistake. He had always understood that he owned his home outright, and the thought of being a tenant was foreign to him. He immediately contacted his solicitor, who had handled the purchase of the property, to seek clarification.\n\nThe solicitor's response only added to Ismail's frustration. They explained that the \"rentcharge\" was an ancient clause in the property's deeds, which allowed the freeholder to charge an annual fee for the right to occupy the land. Ismail was told that this was a common practice in England and Wales, and that he was not alone in being unaware of its existence.\n\nBut Ismail was not convinced. He believed that the clause was unfair and that he had been misled by his solicitor. He decided to seek independent advice and contacted the National House Building Council, a charity that provides advice and support to homeowners.\n\nThe NHBC confirmed Ismail's worst fears. They explained that the \"rentcharge\" was a common feature of many freehold properties, but that it was often not disclosed to buyers. The charity also warned that the clause could be used to evict homeowners who failed to pay the annual fee, and that Ismail's situation was not unique.\n\nIsmail's case has highlighted the need for greater transparency in the property market. Many homeowners are unaware of the existence of \"rentcharges\" and are being caught out by unexpected demands for payment. The NHBC is calling for greater regulation of the industry and for solicitors to be more proactive in disclosing these clauses to buyers.\n\nIn the meantime, Ismail is facing a difficult and uncertain future. He is still waiting to hear back from the freeholder and is unsure what will happen next. He is determined to fight for his rights and is seeking support from other homeowners who have been affected by similar issues.\n\nIsmail's story is a wake-up call for all homeowners. It highlights the importance of carefully reading the small print and seeking independent advice before making a purchase. It also raises questions about the fairness and transparency of the property market, and whether more needs to be done to protect homeowners from unexpected and unfair demands.",

The New Day made its eye-catching debut with a free issue that is more magazine than newspaper, a feel-good, colourful, sub-editorial confection that lives up to its promise to be a novel addition to the newsstand. It screamed new and alternative, beginning with the masthead - turquoise or duck egg blue? - and on through a succession of digest-style news pages, big pictures and short features. Two spreads were devoted to sport, but without any news or match reports. Now that is different. There were two pages in which the weekend results were concealed in digested paragraphs. Then, several pages on, there was another spread, tagged \"sportopinioneers\", in which Robbie Fowler lamented Liverpool losing the Capital One cup and Ugo Monye praised England's rugby victory. Aware of the public's disenchantment with newsprint, The New Day's bouncy \"mission statement\" said: \"We know this can't just be another newspaper. The New Day's bold approach to journalism has sparked a mixed reaction from readers and industry experts alike. While some have praised the innovative design and engaging features, others have criticized the lack of traditional news content and the perceived watering down of journalism.\n\nOne of the most notable departures from traditional newspaper format is the absence of in-depth reporting on current events. The free issue's focus on feel-good stories, features, and opinion pieces has led some to question the publication's commitment to hard-hitting journalism.\n\n\"I'm not sure what kind of news The New Day is trying to provide,\" said John Smith, a long-time newspaper reader. \"It's all fluff and no substance. Where's the real news?\"\n\nHowever, others have welcomed the fresh approach, citing the need for a change in the way news is presented.\n\n\"I love the way The New Day is shaking things up,\" said Sarah Johnson, a young professional. \"I'm tired of the same old format and style. This is exciting and engaging.\"\n\nThe New Day's editor, Tom Watson, defended the publication's approach, stating that the goal is to appeal to a wider audience and provide a more enjoyable reading experience.\n\n\"We're not trying to replace traditional newspapers, but rather offer an alternative,\" Watson said. \"We know that many people are looking for a change in the way they consume news, and we're trying to meet that demand.\"\n\nThe success of The New Day remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - it has certainly generated a lot of buzz and attention in the media industry. As the publication continues to evolve and refine its approach, it will be interesting to see how it adapts to reader feedback and criticism.\n\nIn the meantime, readers are left to ponder the future of journalism and whether The New Day's bold experiment will pay off. Will this new approach revolutionize the way we consume news, or will it ultimately fail to resonate with readers? Only time will tell.",

RGL Management, formed to gather claims against RBS over the conduct of its now defunct Global Restructuring Group, is understood to have processed 50 claimants less than a month after its launch. The group has also secured legal representation from Humphries Kerstetter, which has previously acted for Tesco and WH Smith in a suit against credit card companies. Claims within RGL Management are expected to exceed Â£1bn as the group prepares for a marketing push to sign up more firms. \"We believe this has the potential to be a huge claim,\" said James Hayward, its chief executive. \"Single businesses within our group have losses of tens of millions of pounds and thousands of businesses suffered as a result of GRG's actions. The claims against Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) are expected to be filed in the coming weeks, with RGL Management preparing for a marketing push to attract more small businesses to join the group. The claims are centered around the bank's treatment of small businesses that were placed in its Global Restructuring Group (GRG), which was designed to help struggling companies recover.\n\nHowever, an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that GRG had engaged in aggressive and misleading practices, leading to many businesses being driven into insolvency or forced to sell their assets at a fraction of their value. The FCA's report, published in 2014, found that GRG had prioritized its own profits over the interests of its customers.\n\nRGL Management's claims will focus on the alleged mis-selling of financial products and services by GRG, as well as the bank's failure to properly advise small businesses on the risks involved. The group is also expected to claim that RBS deliberately targeted small businesses, often with limited financial resources, in order to maximize its own profits.\n\nThe news has sent shockwaves through the small business community, with many entrepreneurs and business owners expressing outrage and frustration at the bank's alleged actions. \"I was devastated when I discovered what had happened,\" said Sarah Johnson, owner of a small retail business that was placed in GRG. \"I had no idea what was going on, and before I knew it, I was facing financial ruin. I'm just glad that I'm not alone in this fight.\"\n\nThe claims against RBS are likely to be complex and time-consuming, with both sides expected to present extensive evidence and expert testimony. However, if successful, the claims could result in significant compensation for the affected businesses, as well as a major reputational blow to RBS.\n\nIn a statement, RBS said that it would \"vigorously defend\" itself against the claims, and that it had already taken steps to address the issues raised by the FCA's report. However, many small businesses remain skeptical, and are demanding greater accountability from the bank.\n\nThe news has also sparked calls for greater regulation of the banking industry, with many arguing that the FCA's investigation and subsequent report were inadequate. \"This is a clear example of the need for stronger regulation and oversight of the banking industry,\" said Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs. \"We need to ensure that banks are held accountable for their actions, and that small businesses are protected from predatory practices.\"\n\nAs the claims against RBS continue to unfold, many small businesses are holding their breath, hoping that justice will finally be served. For those affected, the prospect of compensation is a welcome relief, but the real test will be whether the bank is held accountable for its actions, and whether meaningful reforms are implemented to prevent similar abuses in the future.",

Caring, the multi-millionaire owner of London restaurants including The Ivy and Le Caprice and clubs including Annabel's and Harry's Bar, had been invited to give evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS on Wednesday. Caring wrote to the business, innovation and skills committee saying he thought its inquiry into the demise of BHS, in which he was a 22% shareholder until 2006, taking Â£93m in dividends, was \"clearly important\". However, he said he was not on the board of the company, had no involvement in corporate governance or dividend policy and had no dealings with the pension scheme, which was left Â£571m in deficit when the company collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Caring was due to appear in parliament alongside Brett Palos, the stepson of the former BHS owner Sir Philip Green, who bought a store from the business just before it went bust. Caring's decision to decline the invitation to testify before the parliamentary committee has raised questions about his potential role in the demise of BHS. Critics have accused him of profiting from the company's downfall, while doing little to support its employees or pensioners.\n\nDespite his claims of limited involvement in the company's governance, Caring's significant shareholding and dividend payments have sparked concerns about his responsibility in the company's collapse. The parliamentary inquiry is seeking to understand the circumstances surrounding BHS's demise, including the role of its former owners and shareholders.\n\nBrett Palos, who is expected to appear before the committee, has already faced criticism for his involvement in the company's collapse. Palos, the stepson of Sir Philip Green, purchased a BHS store just before the company went into administration, sparking allegations of asset stripping.\n\nThe parliamentary inquiry is also seeking to understand the role of the pension scheme's trustees, who have been accused of failing to protect the scheme's assets. The scheme's deficit has left thousands of former employees facing uncertain futures, with many struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe inquiry's chairman, Iain Wright, has vowed to get to the bottom of the matter, saying, \"We will be scrutinizing the evidence presented to us and holding those responsible for the collapse of BHS accountable.\"\n\nThe committee's investigation is expected to take several months, with a report detailing its findings and recommendations set to be published later this year. In the meantime, the families of BHS employees and pensioners continue to wait for answers and compensation for the devastating impact of the company's collapse.",

The controversy surrounding Jesse Watters' comment on \"The Five\" has sparked widespread debate and criticism, with many calling for the Fox News host to apologize for his remarks. The incident has also raised questions about the network's commitment to promoting respectful and inclusive dialogue.\n\nWhile Watters maintains that his comment was simply a lighthearted observation about Ivanka Trump's voice, many have interpreted his words as a thinly veiled attempt to make a lewd joke about the first daughter.

Implants of stem cells that make fresh neurons in the brain were found to put the brakes on ageing in older mice, keeping them more physically and mentally fit for months, and extending their lives by 10-15% compared to untreated animals. The work, described as a tour de force and a breakthrough by one leading expert, suggests that ageing across the body is controlled by stem cells that are found in the hypothalamus region of the brain in youth, but which steadily die off until they are almost completely absent in middle age. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York hope to launch clinical trials of the procedure soon, but must first produce supplies of human neural stem cells in the lab which can be implanted into volunteers. The study, published in the journal Nature, marks a significant milestone in the quest to understand and reverse the aging process. The researchers, led by Dr. Evans, used a novel approach to implant the stem cells into the brains of the mice, which were already showing signs of aging.\n\nThe stem cells, which are capable of differentiating into various cell types, were found to integrate seamlessly into the brain tissue, producing new neurons and improving cognitive function. The treated mice were observed to have improved memory and learning abilities, as well as enhanced motor function and coordination.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the development of new treatments for age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. These diseases are characterized by the loss of neurons and the degeneration of brain tissue, which can lead to cognitive decline and motor dysfunction.\n\nDr. Evans and his team believe that their approach could potentially be used to treat a range of age-related conditions, including those that affect the brain, heart, and other organs. \"Our study suggests that the aging process is not just a natural part of life, but rather a complex biological process that can be influenced by external factors,\" said Dr. Evans.\n\nThe researchers are now working to scale up their production of human neural stem cells in the lab, with the aim of launching clinical trials in the near future. If successful, the treatment could potentially be used to extend human lifespan and improve quality of life for millions of people worldwide.\n\nThe study has generated significant excitement in the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a major breakthrough. \"This is a game-changer,\" said Dr. Smith, a leading expert in the field of aging research. \"The potential applications of this technology are vast and could have a profound impact on our understanding and treatment of age-related diseases.\"\n\nWhile the study is still in its early stages, the implications are significant and could potentially lead to major advances in the field of aging research. As Dr. Evans noted, \"We are just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible with this technology. The future is bright, and we are excited to see where this research takes us.\"",

Receipts!\" they cry, waving stacks of paper in the air as buses and trains rumble by. The scene is a stark reminder of the country's long-standing problem with tax evasion and the thriving black market that has grown up around it.\n\nFor decades, China's underground economy has been a source of both fascination and frustration for economists and policymakers. On one hand, it has driven innovation and entrepreneurship, allowing small businesses and individuals to thrive in the absence of official oversight. On the other hand, it has deprived the government of billions of dollars in revenue and perpetuated inequality by favoring those with the means to operate outside the law.\n\nThe fake receipts being peddled at Shanghai's transportation depots are just one small part of this vast underground economy. They are used by individuals and businesses to claim fake expenses, avoid taxes, and even launder money. The receipts are often indistinguishable from real ones, making it difficult for authorities to detect and prosecute those who use them.\n\nBut the fake receipts are just the tip of the iceberg. China's underground economy encompasses everything from counterfeit goods to illegal gambling and prostitution. It is a shadowy world that operates outside the law, with its own rules and hierarchies.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the underground economy, the Chinese government has taken steps in recent years to crack down on tax evasion and corruption. In 2019, the government launched a nationwide campaign to root out tax fraud and money laundering, resulting in the arrest of thousands of individuals and the seizure of billions of dollars in assets.\n\nHowever, experts say that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the underground economy. \"The government needs to create a more level playing field for businesses and individuals,\" said Wang Xiaoyi, an economist at Shanghai University. \"If people feel that they are being treated fairly and that the rules are applied equally, they will be less likely to turn to the underground economy.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the fake receipts will continue to be peddled at Shanghai's transportation depots, a reminder of the ongoing struggle to bring China's underground economy into the light.",

        "Text": "British banks approved the fewest mortgages for house purchases in more than a year in October, with economists warning the decline could signal the start of a downturn in the UK housing market. Mortgage approvals fell to a 13-month low of 40,488 last month, down from 41,576 in September, according to the industry trade body UK Finance. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Bank of England's decision earlier this month to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, to 0.5% from 0.25%, would probably exacerbate the downward trend. The decline in mortgage approvals is a worrying sign for the UK housing market, which has been experiencing a slowdown in recent months. Despite the government's efforts to boost the economy, the housing market has been struggling to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates is likely to have a significant impact on the housing market. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which could deter potential buyers and lead to a further decline in demand. This could have a ripple effect throughout the economy, as the housing market is a significant driver of growth.\n\nThe decline in mortgage approvals is also a concern for the construction industry, which relies heavily on the housing market. A slowdown in housing demand could lead to a reduction in construction activity, which could have a negative impact on employment and economic growth.\n\nHowever, not all economists are pessimistic about the outlook for the housing market. Some believe that the decline in mortgage approvals is a natural correction following a period of rapid growth, and that the market will eventually recover.\n\n\"The housing market is inherently cyclical, and it's not uncommon to see a slowdown after a period of rapid growth,\" said Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide Building Society. \"While the Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates may have contributed to the decline in mortgage approvals, it's unlikely to have a lasting impact on the market.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the housing market, the Bank of England is likely to continue to monitor the situation closely. The bank has a number of tools at its disposal to support the economy, including the ability to cut interest rates if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, the decline in mortgage approvals is a reminder of the importance of careful planning and budgeting when it comes to buying a home. With interest rates likely to remain higher than they were earlier in the year, potential buyers may need to adjust their expectations and consider alternative options, such as renting or waiting for prices to fall.\n\nOverall, the decline in mortgage approvals is a significant development in the UK housing market, and one that is likely to have a lasting impact on the economy. While the outlook is uncertain, it's clear that the housing market is facing a period of significant change, and that careful planning and budgeting will be essential for anyone looking to buy a home in the coming months.",

The decision by the Japanese firm on Thursday sent Asia Pacific shares falling again and came a day after four major Japanese and British mobile carriers said they would delay releasing new Huawei handsets. \"We've stopped all business transactions with Huawei and its 68 group companies ... that are subject to the US government ban,\" Joe Flynn, a Panasonic spokesman, said. Panasonic joins Google, Intel, Qualcomm and Lumentum among the leading companies to turn their backs on Huawei in what is beginning to shape up as a tech cold war between the US and China. The move by Panasonic is the latest in a series of high-profile departures from Huawei, which has been reeling from the US ban imposed in May. The ban prohibits US companies from doing business with Huawei, citing national security concerns.\n\nThe impact of the ban has been felt across the globe, with many companies scrambling to distance themselves from the Chinese tech giant. In addition to Panasonic, Google, Intel, Qualcomm, and Lumentum have all suspended or terminated their business relationships with Huawei.\n\nThe decision by Panasonic to stop supplying components to Huawei is expected to have significant implications for the Chinese company's ability to produce its flagship smartphones. Huawei relies heavily on third-party suppliers for components such as processors, memory chips, and displays, and the loss of these suppliers could severely impact its production capabilities.\n\nThe news sent shockwaves through financial markets, with shares of Panasonic and other companies that do business with Huawei falling sharply. The Nikkei 225 index, which tracks Japanese stocks, fell 1.5% in early trading, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong dropped 2.5%.\n\nThe decision by Panasonic to sever ties with Huawei is also likely to have broader implications for the global tech industry. The ban has already sparked a tech cold war between the US and China, with each side accusing the other of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft.\n\nThe US has accused Huawei of being a national security risk, citing concerns that the company's equipment could be used by the Chinese government to spy on American citizens. Huawei has repeatedly denied these allegations, and has accused the US of trying to stifle its growth and undermine its global competitiveness.\n\nThe situation is likely to continue to escalate in the coming weeks and months, with both sides showing no signs of backing down. The US has given Huawei a 90-day reprieve from the ban, allowing it to continue doing business with American companies until November 19. However, it is unclear what will happen after that date, and many experts believe that the ban could have far-reaching consequences for the global tech industry.\n\nIn the meantime, Huawei is likely to continue to struggle to find alternative suppliers to replace those that have cut ties with the company. The company has already announced plans to increase its domestic production capacity, and has been working to develop its own chip-making capabilities.\n\nHowever, the loss of Panasonic and other major suppliers is likely to have a significant impact on Huawei's ability to produce high-quality smartphones. The company's flagship Mate 30 series, which was released earlier this year, has been heavily criticized for its lack of Google services, which were removed due to the US ban.\n\nThe situation is likely to continue to play out in the coming weeks and months, with both sides showing no signs of backing down. The tech cold war between the US and China is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the global tech industry, and could potentially reshape the landscape of the industry in the years to come.",

        "Text": "A possible explanation for one of biology's greatest mysteries, the female orgasm, has been bolstered by research showing that rabbits given antidepressants release fewer eggs during sex. The human female orgasm has long proved curious, having no obvious purpose besides being pleasurable. The scientists behind the study have previously proposed it might have its evolutionary roots in a reflex linked to the release of eggs during sex â€“ a mechanism that exists today in several animal species, including rabbits. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, aimed to investigate the link between the female orgasm and ovulation in rabbits. Researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford gave antidepressant medication to female rabbits and observed the effects on their reproductive behavior.\n\nThe team found that rabbits treated with antidepressants released significantly fewer eggs during sex compared to those that did not receive the medication. This suggests that the female orgasm may play a crucial role in the release of eggs during sex, a mechanism that has been observed in several animal species.\n\n\"This study provides strong evidence that the female orgasm is not just a pleasurable experience, but also serves an important biological function,\" said Dr. Emma Smith, lead author of the study. \"Our findings support the idea that the female orgasm is linked to the release of eggs during sex, and this mechanism has been conserved across species.\"\n\nThe researchers believe that the female orgasm may have evolved as a way to ensure that eggs are released during sex, increasing the chances of successful fertilization. In rabbits, the female orgasm is triggered by the male's ejaculation, which stimulates the release of eggs from the ovaries.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of human biology. While the human female orgasm is not directly linked to ovulation, it is possible that it serves a similar function in humans. The study's authors suggest that the female orgasm may play a role in promoting bonding and intimacy between partners, which could increase the chances of successful fertilization.\n\nThe research also has implications for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction. Antidepressants are commonly prescribed to treat sexual dysfunction in women, but the study's findings suggest that these medications may actually interfere with the female orgasm and reduce the chances of successful fertilization.\n\nThe study's authors are now planning to investigate the link between the female orgasm and ovulation in humans. They hope to use their findings to develop new treatments for female sexual dysfunction and to improve our understanding of human biology.\n\n\"This study is a significant step forward in our understanding of the female orgasm and its role in human biology,\" said Dr. Smith. \"We hope that our findings will lead to new treatments for female sexual dysfunction and improve our understanding of human reproduction.\"",

        "Text": "Seeing the same doctor each time you need medical care might reduce your risk of death, research suggests. Previous studies have revealed that so-called continuity of care is linked to a number of benefits, including patients following medical advice more closely, better uptake of vaccines and other preventive measures, and fewer emergency hospital admissions. Now researchers say a link also appears to exist for mortality, suggesting the bond between patients and their doctors might be even more important than previously thought. \"Basically we are saying that at a time when the emphasis in the reports in the press are all about new machines and new technology, that this is an article that shows the human side of medicine is still very important and even a matter of life and death,\" said Sir Denis Pereira Gray, first author of the research from St Leonard's Practice, Exeter. The study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, analyzed data from over 50,000 patients in the UK and found that those who saw the same doctor regularly had a 14% lower risk of death compared to those who did not have a consistent doctor-patient relationship.\n\nThe researchers used data from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink, which collects information on patient encounters and diagnoses from general practices across the country. They looked at the records of patients who had seen a doctor at least three times in a year, and compared their mortality rates with those who had seen multiple doctors or had no regular doctor.\n\nThe study controlled for factors that might influence the results, such as age, sex, and underlying health conditions, and found that the link between continuity of care and mortality remained strong.\n\nThe authors suggest that the bond between patients and their doctors may play a crucial role in improving health outcomes, by fostering trust, encouraging patients to follow medical advice, and promoting better communication.\n\n\"This study highlights the importance of the doctor-patient relationship in achieving better health outcomes,\" said Dr. Pereira Gray. \"It's not just about the technology or the machines, it's about the human connection between patients and their doctors.\"\n\nThe findings have implications for healthcare policy and practice, particularly in the context of the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which is currently undergoing significant reforms.\n\nThe study's authors argue that policymakers should prioritize investment in general practice, which has been a key area of concern in recent years due to funding cuts and workforce shortages.\n\n\"By supporting general practice and ensuring that patients have access to a regular doctor, we can improve health outcomes and reduce mortality rates,\" said Dr. Pereira Gray.\n\nThe research is also relevant to the wider healthcare system, as it suggests that continuity of care is not just a desirable feature of healthcare, but a crucial one.\n\nAs the NHS continues to evolve and adapt to changing demands and pressures, the importance of the doctor-patient relationship is likely to remain a key factor in achieving better health outcomes for patients.\n\nIn the words of Dr. Pereira Gray, \"This study shows that the human side of medicine is still very important, and it's a reminder that we should be prioritizing the relationship between patients and their doctors in our efforts to improve healthcare.\"",

Chen, The Times's personal technology writer, who is based in San Francisco, discussed the tech he's using. You explain, highlight and solve everyday tech problems for readers. How do you use tech to keep track of the issues and new tech that is coming out? Twitter, Facebook and Techmeme.com are useful for keeping up with new gadget trends. But when it comes to staying in tune with the tech-induced headaches of average people, I turn to reader emails or conversations with non-techie friends. At The Times, we have access to analytics about the people reading our articles, and the consistent strong readership we get from stories about these topics reaffirms that people continue to be frustrated with these issues. What kind of testing setup do you use to tell us if a whiz-bang gadget or app or service is for real? Oftentimes before I start testing a product, I jot down an objective set of tests for tasks that I can reasonably expect a product to do. For example, when I compared virtual assistants last year, I drew up more than a dozen basic tasks related to productivity, music, mapping, dining and entertainment, and ran each assistant through all the tasks to see which was the most competent. After I plugged the results in a spreadsheet, Google's was superior. This rigorous testing approach has proven to be effective in providing readers with unbiased and accurate reviews of various gadgets and services. In addition to testing, Chen also relies on his own personal experiences and observations to inform his writing.\n\n\"I'm a curious person, so I tend to try out new technology and see how it works in my daily life,\" he explained. \"I also talk to friends and family members who are not tech-savvy, and I try to understand the challenges they face when using new technology. This helps me to identify common pain points and areas where technology can be improved.\"\n\nChen's approach has earned him a reputation as one of the most reliable and trustworthy tech writers in the industry. His articles are often cited as a go-to resource for readers looking for honest and informative reviews of the latest gadgets and services.\n\nDespite the many benefits of technology, Chen is also aware of the potential drawbacks and challenges that come with it. He believes that it is essential for tech writers to stay aware of these issues and to use their platform to raise awareness and promote responsible use of technology.\n\n\"I think it's important for tech writers to be mindful of the impact that technology can have on society,\" he said. \"We should be using our platforms to promote responsible use of technology and to highlight the potential risks and challenges that come with it.\"\n\nOverall, Chen's approach to technology journalism is a testament to the importance of staying informed, curious, and open-minded in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape. By combining rigorous testing with personal experiences and observations, Chen is able to provide readers with accurate and informative reviews of the latest gadgets and services, while also promoting responsible use of technology.",

        "Text": "Ministers should establish a new energy commission to spur on construction of power stations because successive governments have failed to encourage enough fresh power capacity in the UK, according to a House of Lords report. Subsidy-backed growth in renewable energy projects, such as windfarms, has deterred the construction of new conventional power plants, the economic affairs committee claimed. The peers envisage the new energy commission would oversee auctions where all technologies, including fossil fuel power plants, competed for guaranteed electricity prices. The auctions would cap carbon emissions. At present the government only allows low-carbon power, such as windfarms and new nuclear power stations, to compete in auctions for such deals, known as contracts for difference. The influential cross-party group of peers concluded that successive governments have got their priorities wrong on energy policy by giving priority to carbon emissions cuts â€“ a statutory duty under the Climate Change Act â€“ over keeping costs down and keeping the lights on. The report, which was published on Tuesday, also criticized the current system of energy auctions, saying it has led to a lack of diversity in the UK's energy mix. The committee argued that the current focus on low-carbon power has resulted in a situation where the country is reliant on a small number of large-scale renewable energy projects, rather than a diverse range of power generation sources.\n\nThe peers suggested that the new energy commission would be responsible for designing and implementing the auction process, which would ensure that all technologies, including fossil fuel power plants, have an equal chance of winning contracts. The commission would also be tasked with setting carbon emission caps for each auction, to ensure that the UK's climate change targets are met.\n\nThe report's authors argued that the current system of energy auctions has led to a situation where the UK is relying too heavily on intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. While these sources are important for reducing carbon emissions, they are not always available when they are needed most, and the country still needs a reliable and flexible energy system to keep the lights on.\n\nThe committee's chairman, Lord Hollick, said that the report's findings were a wake-up call for the government. \"The UK's energy policy has been focused on reducing carbon emissions for too long, without considering the impact on energy security and affordability,\" he said. \"We need a more balanced approach that takes into account the need for a reliable and diverse energy mix.\"\n\nThe report's recommendations have been welcomed by some in the energy industry, who argue that the current system is not working and needs to be changed. \"The current system of energy auctions is not fit for purpose,\" said Dr. Tim Winter, chief executive of the Association of Consultancy and Engineering. \"We need a more flexible and adaptable system that allows for a diverse range of power generation sources, including fossil fuel power plants.\"\n\nHowever, others have criticized the report's recommendations, arguing that they would undermine the UK's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and meet its climate change targets. \"The idea of giving fossil fuel power plants an equal chance of winning contracts is a step backwards,\" said Dr. Emily Fennell, a climate change expert at the University of Oxford. \"We need to focus on reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and increasing our use of renewable energy sources, not going back to the old ways of doing things.\"\n\nThe government has yet to respond to the report's recommendations, but it is expected to do so in the coming weeks. The report's findings are likely to spark a lively debate about the future of the UK's energy policy, and how the country can balance its energy needs with its climate change targets.",

On Monday, two tech companies -- Amazon and Expedia -- stepped up their opposition to the order with filings that were part of a lawsuit in federal court against the Trump administration, arguing that the order will hurt their businesses. The filings represent an escalation of the technology industry's efforts to push back on the order signed by Mr. Trump on Friday night. There was little sign of the outcry over the order diminishing throughout the industry, as employees at Google staged demonstrations in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. Amazon and Expedia made declarations supporting a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration in federal court Monday night in Seattle by Washington State's attorney general. The lawsuit, part of a growing wave of legal challenges to the immigration ban across the country, asked the court to declare key parts of the executive order unconstitutional. The filings submitted by Amazon and Expedia to the federal court in Seattle emphasized the potential economic and business implications of the executive order. Amazon, the e-commerce giant, argued that the order would harm its ability to attract and retain top talent from around the world, which is crucial for its business operations. The company also pointed out that its employees and customers are affected by the order, which could lead to a decline in its sales and revenue.\n\nExpedia, the online travel company, similarly argued that the order would have a significant impact on its business, as many of its employees and customers are affected by the travel restrictions. The company also expressed concern about the potential long-term effects of the order on its ability to operate globally.\n\nThe filings by Amazon and Expedia are part of a growing chorus of opposition to the executive order from the technology industry. Many tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, have already spoken out against the order, citing concerns about its impact on their businesses and the broader economy.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Washington State's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, is one of several legal challenges to the executive order that have been filed across the country. The lawsuit argues that the order is unconstitutional and violates the rights of Washington State residents who are affected by it.\n\nThe technology industry's opposition to the executive order has been met with support from many in the public, who have taken to social media to express their outrage and concern about the order. The hashtag #NoBanNoWall has been trending on Twitter, with many people using the platform to share their stories and express their opposition to the order.\n\nAs the legal challenges to the executive order continue to unfold, it remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond. The administration has defended the order as necessary for national security, but many have criticized it as discriminatory and unconstitutional. The technology industry's opposition to the order is likely to continue, as companies like Amazon and Expedia work to protect their businesses and the rights of their employees and customers.",

A Father Christmas on Monday opened Selfridges' annual festive shop, making it the first department store in the world to open a dedicated Christmas department in July. For some people five months of Christmas cheer might be almost too much to bear, but Anne Thomas, who was manning the surprisingly busy tills, said she was excited about her recent switch from the dining department. \"I am going to have to be full of the Christmas spirit and full of energy for the next few months,\" she added. Many customers were surprised that Christmas glitter was already on the shelves, but several who were visiting from overseas or from out of town said they were pleased to be able to take home British decorations, including Selfridges branded baubles costing Â£6. Lisa Lew, a 41-year-old branding expert from Melbourne, bought one of the Â£50 corgi baubles for her mum. As the festive shop opened its doors, customers were greeted by the sound of jingle bells and the aroma of freshly baked mince pies. The store's management had spared no expense in creating a winter wonderland, complete with a life-size snow globe and a giant Christmas tree adorned with glittering ornaments.\n\nDespite the initial shock of Christmas decorations in July, many customers were thrilled to get a head start on their holiday shopping. \"I love the idea of spreading the festive cheer throughout the year,\" said Sarah Johnson, a tourist from New York. \"It's a great way to keep the holiday spirit alive, even when it's not actually Christmas.\"\n\nThe festive shop is not just about selling decorations, however. It also features a range of festive food and drink items, including Christmas-themed cookies, hot chocolate, and even a special edition Christmas pudding. \"We want to make this a destination for people to come and experience the magic of Christmas, even in the middle of summer,\" said Selfridges' marketing manager, Emma Taylor.\n\nThe store's decision to open its festive shop in July has been met with mixed reactions from customers and competitors alike. While some have praised the innovative move, others have criticized it as being too commercialized. \"It's all about making money, isn't it?\" said one customer, who wished to remain anonymous. \"I don't think it's very festive at all.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Selfridges remains confident that its festive shop will be a huge success. The store has already received thousands of pre-orders for its Christmas decorations and is expecting to sell out of many of its popular items by the end of the month.\n\nAs for Lisa Lew, the branding expert from Melbourne, she was thrilled with her purchase of the Â£50 corgi bauble. \"It's the perfect souvenir from my trip to London,\" she said. \"And it's already been shipped back to Australia, so my mum can start enjoying it right away.\"\n\nWith its festive shop now open, Selfridges is hoping to spread some holiday cheer throughout the year. Whether or not the move is a success remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - the department store is certainly getting into the Christmas spirit early this year.",

He has also had to face another restive group: his own employees. The Facebook chief executive has taken multiple steps over the past few days to communicate with the social network's 25,000 employees over revelations last week that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly obtained data of 50 million Facebook users. The Silicon Valley company held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica, featuring one of Facebook's lawyers, Paul Grewal. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Zuckerberg addressed employees directly, according to two Facebook employees who asked not be identified because the proceedings were confidential. During the meeting, Zuckerberg acknowledged the company's mistakes and apologized for the breach of trust, according to the employees who attended. He also emphasized the importance of protecting user data and ensuring that similar incidents do not happen in the future.\n\nThe Facebook CEO also announced a series of measures aimed at addressing the concerns raised by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. These included a review of all third-party apps that have access to Facebook user data, as well as a new system for monitoring and auditing data access.\n\nZuckerberg's address to employees was seen as a critical step in rebuilding trust within the company, which has been rocked by the scandal. Many employees have been left feeling frustrated and demoralized by the revelations, and some have expressed concerns about the company's ability to protect user data.\n\nThe meeting was also an opportunity for Facebook's leadership to address rumors and speculation that have been circulating within the company. According to one employee, Zuckerberg addressed rumors that the company had known about Cambridge Analytica's activities for some time, but had chosen to ignore them.\n\n\"We've made mistakes, and we're going to learn from them,\" Zuckerberg said, according to one employee. \"We're committed to transparency and accountability, and we're going to do everything we can to prevent something like this from happening again.\"\n\nThe meeting was followed by a Q&A session, during which employees were able to ask questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook's response to it. The company has also set up a dedicated webpage with information about the scandal and the steps it is taking to address it.\n\nThe backlash against Facebook has continued to grow, with several major advertisers announcing that they are suspending their advertising campaigns on the platform until the company can demonstrate that it has taken adequate steps to protect user data. The scandal has also led to calls for greater regulation of the tech industry, with some lawmakers suggesting that Facebook and other social media companies should be treated as public utilities.\n\nAs the company grapples with the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it is clear that the stakes are high. Facebook's reputation and business model are both at risk, and the company's ability to recover will depend on its ability to restore trust with users and regulators alike.",

Jambu Palaniappan quit to join a European venture capital company in London, said Uber, which recently lost its licence to operate in the capital. The news came on Thursday as Uber faced questions from the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee over the hours worked by its cab drivers. The committee has demanded more information after the company failed to disclose how many drivers were working more than 70-80 hours a week. Rachel Reeves, the committee chair, said: \"Passengers booking journeys through Uber will want to know they are safe and secure. Uber needs to provide reassurance on these issues by setting out when it will introduce driver hour limits for its workforce and spell out what these limits will be. \"Drivers working long hours risk compromising the safety of both themselves and their passengers. Uber's struggles to address concerns over working conditions and driver welfare have been ongoing for months, with the company facing criticism from regulators, drivers, and lawmakers alike. The company's decision to appeal the loss of its London licence has also drawn widespread criticism, with many arguing that the move is an attempt to delay necessary reforms.\n\nThe select committee's inquiry into Uber's working practices is the latest in a series of investigations and reviews into the company's operations. In June, the UK's Transport for London (TfL) announced that it would be conducting a review of Uber's licence to operate in the capital, citing concerns over the company's approach to safety and security.\n\nUber's difficulties have been compounded by the departure of several senior executives in recent months. In addition to Palaniappan, the company's European operations chief, other high-profile departures include the resignation of its chief operating officer, Barney Harford, and the departure of its head of engineering, Thuan Pham.\n\nThe company's struggles to address concerns over working conditions and driver welfare have also led to a surge in unionization efforts among Uber drivers. Last month, the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) announced that it had won recognition as the official union for Uber drivers in London, marking a significant victory for the drivers' rights movement.\n\nAs the select committee continues its inquiry, Uber will be under pressure to provide clear answers on its plans to address the concerns over driver hours and working conditions. The company has previously stated that it is committed to improving working conditions for its drivers, but has faced criticism for its slow progress in implementing reforms.\n\nIn a statement, an Uber spokesperson said: \"We are committed to providing a safe and secure experience for our riders and drivers. We are working hard to address the concerns raised by the select committee and are committed to implementing measures to improve working conditions for our drivers.\"\n\nThe company's efforts to address the concerns over working conditions and driver welfare will be closely watched by regulators, lawmakers, and the public alike. As the debate over the future of the gig economy continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Uber's struggles to address concerns over working conditions and driver welfare are a major challenge for the company, and will require significant changes to its operations and business model.",

The men, Richer Sounds founder Julian Richer and Marks & Spencer boss Steve Rowe, are debating ways to reinvigorate M&S, which, in a dramatic admission, said last week that it had become \"too corporate\" and lost touch with its shoppers. \"I wanted us to meet outside the office so we could talk without distractions and we have very intense discussions,\" explains Richer. \"I'm an ideas man. I'm all about the people.\" The entrepreneur has been drafted in by M&S chairman Archie Norman to assist with a major restructuring that involves \"fracturing\" a dysfunctional business culture in which decisions are made by committee, accountability is blurred and customers are abandoning its shops. Richer successfully assisted Norman with the turnaround of no-frills grocer Asda in the 1990s and at M&S is acting as an \"independent adviser on culture change\". This time around it is Rowe, not Norman, heeding Richer's counsel, and they are unlikely bedfellows. Richer, with his long hair and sideline as the drummer in funk band Ten Millennia, is lauded for the success of his Richer Sounds chain, which he founded in 1978 at the age of 19. The unlikely duo has been meeting regularly to discuss ways to revamp M&S's corporate culture, which Rowe has acknowledged has become stifling and ineffective. Richer, known for his unorthodox approach to business, has been sharing his insights on how to create a more agile and customer-centric organization.\n\nAccording to sources close to the discussions, Richer has been advocating for a more decentralized decision-making process, where teams are given more autonomy to respond to customer needs and make quick decisions. He has also been pushing for a greater emphasis on employee engagement and empowerment, encouraging staff to take ownership of their work and be more proactive in driving change.\n\nRowe has been receptive to Richer's ideas, acknowledging that M&S's traditional hierarchical structure has led to a lack of accountability and a sense of detachment from customers. The company's struggles to adapt to changing consumer habits and the rise of online shopping have only exacerbated the problem.\n\n\"M&S has been too focused on its own internal processes and has lost sight of what matters most â€“ the customer,\" said Richer. \"We need to get back to basics and focus on providing a better shopping experience. That means empowering our staff to make decisions and taking a more agile approach to business.\"\n\nRicher's involvement in the restructuring process is seen as a major coup for Norman, who has been tasked with turning around M&S's fortunes. The entrepreneur's track record of success at Asda, where he helped to transform the business into a more efficient and customer-focused operation, has earned him a reputation as a turnaround expert.\n\nWhile some have questioned the wisdom of bringing in an external advisor, Richer's unorthodox approach and willingness to challenge the status quo have been seen as a breath of fresh air by many in the industry. His ability to think outside the box and bring new ideas to the table has been hailed as a key factor in M&S's efforts to revamp its culture and restore its competitive edge.\n\nAs the discussions continue, it remains to be seen whether Richer's ideas will be enough to turn M&S around. However, with his reputation as a turnaround expert and his ability to think creatively, he is seen as a key player in the company's efforts to revamp its culture and restore its fortunes.",

And their money was on the airline collapsing. For the second time in the space of two years, the Civil Aviation Authority was secretly putting together its own pop-up airline, and this was even bigger than the last one, assembled to repatriate stranded Monarch passengers in 2017. Some 150,000 Thomas Cook customers had flown abroad on holiday, many blissfully unaware that the return leg was in jeopardy. The CAA regulated Thomas Cook in two ways: through its airline operating certificate and its Atol licence, which guarantees customers their holiday should a firm go bust. As the clock ticked closer to the midnight deadline, the CAA's contingency plan was put into action. A team of experts was hastily assembled to oversee the creation of a new airline, dubbed \"Air Rescue\", which would be responsible for flying the stranded Thomas Cook passengers back to the UK. The operation was shrouded in secrecy, with only a select few aware of the plan's existence.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Cook's management team was still locked in talks with banks and creditors, desperately trying to secure a last-minute rescue deal. However, it became increasingly clear that the company's financial woes were too deep-seated, and the airline's collapse was all but inevitable.\n\nThe CAA's decision to create a pop-up airline was a precautionary measure, designed to ensure that the thousands of Thomas Cook passengers stranded abroad would not be left high and dry. The authority had been monitoring the airline's financial situation closely, and had been preparing for this eventuality for some time.\n\n\"We knew that Thomas Cook's financial situation was precarious, and we had to be prepared to act quickly to protect the interests of its customers,\" said a CAA spokesperson. \"Our priority was to ensure that passengers were safely repatriated, and we worked closely with airlines and airports around the world to make that happen.\"\n\nAs the news of Thomas Cook's collapse spread, panic began to set in among the airline's customers. Many were left stranded in foreign airports, unsure of how they would get home. But thanks to the CAA's swift action, the vast majority of passengers were able to make their way back to the UK, albeit with some disruption.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook sent shockwaves through the travel industry, with many airlines and tour operators scrambling to fill the gap left by the airline's demise. However, the CAA's contingency plan had ensured that the worst-case scenario was averted, and the public was protected from the consequences of the airline's failure.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, the CAA faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with some questioning why it had not acted sooner to prevent the airline's demise. However, the authority maintained that it had done everything in its power to support Thomas Cook, and that the airline's collapse was ultimately a result of its own financial mismanagement.\n\nAs the dust settles on the collapse of Thomas Cook, the travel industry is left to pick up the pieces. But thanks to the CAA's swift action, the public can rest assured that their safety and well-being are always the top priority.",

        "Text": "A division of the taxpayer-owned RBS bank which was meant to help companies in trouble mistreated many of its clients but did not try to \"profit from their distress\", according to a leaked report by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. According to the report, seen by the BBC, investigators found \"inappropriate action\" by Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was experienced by 92% of \"viable firms\" they dealt with. This included increasing interest rates and charges and imposing unnecessary fees on many of its clients, whose numbers peaked at 16,000. The GRG unit, which operated between 2005 and its closure in 2013, stepped in when companies which banked with RBS experienced financial difficulties. The leaked report by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has sparked outrage among business owners and politicians, who are demanding accountability from RBS and its executives. The FCA's investigation found that the GRG unit's actions were not only unfair but also caused significant financial harm to many of its clients.\n\nAccording to the report, the GRG unit's inappropriate actions included increasing interest rates and charges on loans, imposing unnecessary fees, and even forcing companies to take on additional debt. The report also found that the unit's employees often prioritized their own interests over those of their clients, and that some employees even made personal gains from the distress of their clients.\n\nThe FCA's investigation was sparked by a series of complaints from business owners who claimed that they had been unfairly treated by the GRG unit. The regulator's report found that the unit's actions were not isolated incidents, but rather a widespread problem that affected many of its clients.\n\nRBS has apologized for the harm caused by the GRG unit and has agreed to compensate some of its clients. However, many business owners are still waiting for compensation and are demanding more action from the bank.\n\nThe scandal has also raised questions about the culture of RBS and its treatment of small businesses. The bank's former CEO, Stephen Hester, has been criticized for his handling of the situation, and some have called for him to be held accountable.\n\nThe FCA's report is a major blow to RBS's reputation and has sparked a wider debate about the treatment of small businesses by large corporations. The incident has also highlighted the need for greater regulation and oversight of the banking industry.\n\nIn a statement, the FCA said that it was \"deeply concerned\" by the findings of its investigation and that it would be taking action to ensure that RBS and its executives are held accountable. The regulator also called on RBS to take immediate action to compensate its clients and to implement changes to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\nThe scandal is a reminder of the importance of fair treatment of small businesses by large corporations. It is essential that companies like RBS prioritize the needs of their clients and operate with transparency and integrity. The FCA's report is a wake-up call for the banking industry and highlights the need for greater accountability and regulation.",

        "Text": "A new breed of interest-only mortgage for older people is starting to take off. These deals could throw a lifeline to thousands of people who have an interest-only home loan that's coming to an end, but don't know how they are going to pay back what they owe. Interest-only mortgages became virtually extinct following the credit crunch and were once branded a ticking timebomb. During the past few years some older homeowners with these mortgages have found themselves staring down the barrel of a big shortfall and worried they could lose their homes. Partly in order to help these people, the Financial Conduct Authority last year gave the green light to a new type of interest-only deal. These products are known as \"retirement interest-only\" (RIO) mortgages and are a little more pricey than standard home loans. So what are the rates like? Nottingham building society is offering a three- and seven-year fixed rate for 3.34% and 3.85% respectively, while Leeds building society has a two-year fix at 3.34%, a five-year fix at 3.62% and a 10-year fix at 3.99%. The RIO mortgages are designed specifically for older homeowners who are approaching retirement or are already retired, and are struggling to pay back their interest-only mortgage. These deals allow homeowners to continue paying only the interest on their mortgage, rather than the capital, until they pass away or move into long-term care.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority's approval of RIO mortgages has been welcomed by industry experts, who say it will help thousands of older homeowners avoid repossession and maintain their independence in their later years. \"RIO mortgages offer a lifeline to older homeowners who are facing a significant shortfall when their interest-only mortgage comes to an end,\" said David Hollingworth, a mortgage expert at London & Country Mortgages. \"These deals are designed to help people who are struggling to pay back their mortgage, and who may not have the means to pay off the capital in one go.\"\n\nHowever, experts warn that RIO mortgages are not without their drawbacks. The interest rates are typically higher than standard home loans, which means homeowners will pay more in interest over the life of the loan. Additionally, RIO mortgages often come with fees and penalties for early repayment, which could be a problem for homeowners who need to access their equity to fund long-term care or other expenses.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, many older homeowners are eager to take advantage of the new RIO mortgage deals. \"I'm thrilled to see these products becoming available,\" said Joan Smith, a 65-year-old homeowner who is approaching retirement. \"I've been worried sick about how I'm going to pay back my mortgage, but with a RIO mortgage, I can continue to pay only the interest and maintain my independence in my later years.\"\n\nAs the popularity of RIO mortgages continues to grow, experts predict that more lenders will start to offer their own versions of these deals. \"We expect to see a lot more RIO mortgages coming to market in the coming months,\" said Hollingworth. \"Lenders are recognizing the demand for these products, and are looking to capitalize on the opportunity.\"\n\nFor older homeowners who are struggling to pay back their interest-only mortgage, the new RIO mortgage deals offer a welcome solution. While they may come with higher interest rates and fees, these deals could help thousands of people avoid repossession and maintain their independence in their later years. As the market for RIO mortgages continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these deals change the landscape for older homeowners and the mortgage industry as a whole.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber has reported record losses and slowing growth over the past few months. Its stock has tanked. Investors have called it a \"horror show.\" On Monday, the ride-hailing company responded with financial results that exceeded what Wall Street had anticipated. While Uber is still losing large amounts of money, it did not bleed as much cash as it did in the previous quarter, and its revenue growth rate improved. Uber said third-quarter revenue had risen 30 percent from a year earlier, to $3.8 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $3.6 billion. It posted a net loss of $1.2 billion, wider than the $986 million loss a year earlier but less than the $5.2 billion loss in the previous quarter. Yet Uber's stock fell more than 5 percent in after-hours trading because the number of new customers coming to the app and overall bookings -- which are rides and food deliveries before the company pays commissions -- were weaker than some Wall Street analysts had expected. \"Our results this quarter decisively demonstrate the growing profitability of our Rides segment,\" Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, said in a statement. In a conference call with reporters on Monday, he added that Uber would reach profitability -- if it excluded various costs -- in 2021. Uber continues to face significant challenges as investors become more skeptical of money-burning technology companies. Despite the improved financial results, Uber's struggles to turn a profit have raised concerns among investors about the company's long-term sustainability. The ride-hailing giant has been plagued by high operating costs, intense competition, and regulatory challenges, which have eaten into its profitability.\n\nKhosrowshahi acknowledged these challenges during the conference call, stating that Uber was working to reduce its costs and improve its operating efficiency. He noted that the company had made significant progress in reducing its losses in the Rides segment, which accounts for the majority of its revenue.\n\nHowever, the company's food delivery business, Uber Eats, continued to struggle, with a net loss of $635 million in the third quarter. This has raised concerns about the viability of the business, which has been plagued by intense competition and low profit margins.\n\nDespite these challenges, Uber remains optimistic about its prospects. The company has been investing heavily in new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and electric bikes, which it believes will help it to reduce its costs and improve its profitability in the long term.\n\nIn addition, Uber has been expanding its services into new markets, including public transportation and bike rentals, which it believes will help it to diversify its revenue streams and reduce its dependence on the ride-hailing business.\n\nWhile some investors remain skeptical about Uber's prospects, others believe that the company's improved financial results and efforts to reduce its losses are a sign of progress. \"Uber's results are a step in the right direction,\" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"The company is making progress on its cost-cutting efforts and is starting to see some benefits from its investments in new technologies.\"\n\nOverall, Uber's financial results are a mixed bag, with some positive signs and some concerns. While the company still has a long way to go to reach profitability, its improved financial results and efforts to reduce its losses are a sign of progress.",

        "Text": "More than 770,000 over-55s have taken money out of their pension pots following the new freedoms introduced by George Osborne, according to HMRC figures. The announcement prompted concern that many will run out of cash before they die, after estimates that people taking advantage of flexible access to their pension had taken out an average of more than Â£11,000 each. Between April and June this year, 159,000 people withdrew Â£1.8bn from their pensions, bringing the total to Â£6.1bn and marking a rapid acceleration from the early days of the reforms. Osborne, who has been replaced as chancellor by Philip Hammond, sparked a pensions revolution after scrapping rules 15 months ago that forced many people to buy controversial annuities, or an income for life. The new pension freedoms, introduced by George Osborne in 2015, have given individuals greater control over their retirement savings. However, experts warn that many people may be making rash decisions, taking out large sums of money without considering the long-term consequences.\n\nAccording to a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a significant proportion of those withdrawing their pension savings are doing so to fund a more comfortable lifestyle in retirement, rather than to address any immediate financial needs. This has raised concerns that many individuals may be depleting their pension pots too quickly, leaving them vulnerable to poverty in old age.\n\nThe figures from HMRC also reveal that the majority of those withdrawing their pension savings are men, with 55-64 year olds being the most likely to do so. This has led some to speculate that the pension freedoms may be exacerbating existing gender and age-related inequalities in retirement savings.\n\nDespite these concerns, many experts argue that the new pension freedoms have provided a welcome boost to financial flexibility and autonomy for retirees. \"The pension freedoms have given people the opportunity to take control of their own finances and make choices that are right for them,\" said Sarah Jones, a pension expert at the Pensions Advisory Service. \"However, it's essential that individuals take a long-term view and consider the potential consequences of their decisions.\"\n\nIn response to the growing concerns, the government has announced plans to introduce new measures to help individuals make more informed decisions about their pension savings. These include the introduction of a new pension dashboard, which will allow individuals to see all their pension savings in one place, and the provision of free guidance to help people make informed decisions about their retirement savings.\n\nAs the pension landscape continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how the new freedoms will shape the retirement prospects of future generations. One thing is certain, however: the importance of prudent financial planning and long-term thinking will be crucial in ensuring that individuals make the most of their pension savings and achieve a comfortable and secure retirement.",

        "Text": "Executive pay reforms do not come much more modest than the idea of requiring public companies to say how much the chief executive is paid relative to the firm's median earner. Nothing would have to happen as a consequence. Shareholders would not be asked formally if the ratio is too high or too low. The boss's pay would not have to be capped at a fixed multiple. Instead, the hope is that boards, occasionally, might be embarrassed into exercising a little discipline. Yet even this gentle proposal, likely to be included in the government's green paper on corporate governance on Tuesday, is running into resistance. Pay ratios are too crude and could mislead, runs one argument, because an investment bank, where lots of people tend to earn megabucks, could seem to be a \"fairer\" employer than a supermarket chain employing tens of thousands of shelf-stackers and checkout assistants. Worse, pay ratios could prove inflationary if bosses demand a higher place in a theoretical league table, runs another objection. Neither argument is persuasive. The \"too crude\" theory is too lofty. Outsiders are quite able to understand that a pay ratio is merely one measure among many and that investment banks and supermarkets have different pay structures. Where ratios could be revealing is in charting a company's pay gap over time. As for the inflationary impact, that depends on the pay-setters. However, proponents of the pay ratio proposal argue that it is a crucial step towards greater transparency and accountability in corporate governance. They point out that the current system, where executive pay is often determined in secret, has led to a culture of excess and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n\"The pay ratio is a simple and effective way to hold boards accountable for their decisions,\" said Sarah Jones, a leading corporate governance expert. \"It's not about imposing a cap on executive pay, but about giving shareholders a better understanding of how their company is being run.\"\n\nJones also dismissed the concerns about the proposal being too crude, saying that the ratio would be just one piece of information that shareholders could use to make informed decisions about their investments.\n\n\"It's not about comparing apples and oranges,\" she said. \"It's about giving shareholders a way to evaluate the fairness and transparency of a company's pay practices. And if a company's pay ratio is out of line with its industry peers, that's a red flag that needs to be investigated further.\"\n\nThe proposal is also seen as a way to address the growing concern about income inequality. As the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, many are calling for greater transparency and accountability in corporate governance.\n\n\"This is not just about executive pay, it's about the values that a company is supposed to stand for,\" said John Smith, a shareholder activist. \"If a company is paying its CEO 100 times more than its median employee, that's not just a problem for the employees, it's a problem for the company as a whole. It's a sign that the company is not prioritizing its people, its customers, or its community.\"\n\nThe government's green paper on corporate governance is expected to spark a lively debate about the role of executive pay in society. While some may see the pay ratio proposal as too modest, others will argue that it is a crucial step towards greater transparency and accountability.\n\nAs the debate unfolds, one thing is clear: the era of unchecked executive pay is coming to an end. The question is, what will replace it?",

        "Text": "The neighborhood beyond Neptune is becoming ever more crowded, with astronomers announcing this week the discovery of another likely dwarf planet. A survey at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii has been tracking more than 600 bodies in a ring of icy debris known as the Kuiper belt. One of them turned out to be the likely dwarf planet. \"This is a big fish among a whole lot of small ones we're working with,\" said Michele Bannister, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Victoria in British Columbia who is working on the survey. In the year since NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto, planetary astronomers continue to make new discoveries in the Kuiper belt and what it might reveal about the earliest days of the solar system. The study of these objects also offers hints about the formation and migration of the gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Even if the newly found world is a dwarf planet, however, it will probably be years before it might earn official designation -- part of the confusion of definitions that followed the International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to demote Pluto and reduce the solar system to eight planets from nine. More than 100 bodies in the solar system, all but one located along the ring of icy debris beyond Neptune, appear to meet the definition of a dwarf planet, a category that the astronomical union created to describe Pluto as well as Ceres, the largest asteroid, and Eris, a Kuiper belt object slightly smaller than Pluto. (A full-statured planet has an additional requirement: It must have \"cleared the neighborhood\" of smaller debris.) The discovery of the new dwarf planet is significant because it provides further insight into the formation and evolution of the solar system. The Kuiper belt is a region of icy bodies and other small celestial objects that orbit the sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. The belt is thought to be a remnant of the material that formed the solar system, and the discovery of new objects in this region can help scientists understand how the planets formed and evolved over time.\n\n\"This discovery is a great example of how the study of small, icy bodies in the Kuiper belt can help us understand the history of the solar system,\" said Dr. Bannister. \"By studying these objects, we can learn more about the conditions that existed in the early solar system and how the planets formed and evolved over time.\"\n\nThe new dwarf planet is believed to be about 700 kilometers in diameter, making it slightly larger than Pluto. It is thought to be a member of a group of objects in the Kuiper belt that are known as the \"plutinos,\" which are objects that have orbits that are similar to Pluto's. The discovery of this new dwarf planet adds to the growing list of known plutinos, which now numbers over 100.\n\nThe discovery of the new dwarf planet is also significant because it highlights the complexity and diversity of the Kuiper belt. The belt is thought to contain many more small, icy bodies than have been discovered so far, and the discovery of new objects like this one can help scientists understand the full range of objects that exist in this region.\n\nThe study of the Kuiper belt is an active area of research, with scientists using a variety of techniques to study the objects that exist in this region. In addition to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, other telescopes around the world are being used to study the Kuiper belt, including the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.\n\nThe discovery of the new dwarf planet is a reminder of the many mysteries that still remain to be solved in the study of the solar system. Despite the many advances that have been made in recent years, there is still much to be learned about the formation and evolution of the solar system, and the discovery of new objects like this one can help scientists continue to make progress in this area.",

        "Text": "PARIS -- While the euro zone has been transfixed lately by the Cyprus meltdown, another and potentially bigger European crisis has continued to simmer: record-high unemployment. Spending cuts and tax increases aimed at trimming debt and addressing the financial crises in bailed-out euro zone countries, and the rising rate of joblessness in much of the currency bloc, \"are feeding off of each other,\" said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Group. \"It's a bit of a vicious circle,\" he said. \"Europe is pursuing a policy that is self-evidently failing.\" The euro zone jobless rate rose to 12.0 percent in the first two months of the year, the latest in a series of record highs tracing to late 2011, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported Tuesday. The agency revised upward the January jobless rate for the euro zone from the previously reported 11.9 percent, itself a record. For the overall European Union, Eurostat said the February jobless rate rose to 10.9 percent from 10.8 percent in January, with more than 26 million people without work across the 27-nation bloc. The unemployment crisis in Europe is not limited to the euro zone, as many non-euro countries in the region are also struggling with high joblessness rates. The United Kingdom, for example, saw its unemployment rate rise to 7.9 percent in the three months leading up to February, according to the Office for National Statistics. In Germany, the jobless rate remained steady at 5.4 percent, but the number of people out of work increased by 44,000.\n\nThe root causes of the unemployment crisis in Europe are complex and multifaceted. Some economists point to the austerity measures implemented by many governments as a major contributor to the problem. By cutting government spending and increasing taxes, these governments are reducing aggregate demand and making it harder for businesses to hire new employees.\n\n\"It's a classic case of demand destruction,\" said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. \"When governments cut spending and raise taxes, it reduces the amount of money flowing through the economy, which makes it harder for businesses to grow and create jobs.\"\n\nOthers argue that the European Central Bank (ECB) has not done enough to stimulate the economy and create jobs. The ECB has kept interest rates low and implemented quantitative easing, but some argue that more needs to be done to boost economic growth.\n\n\"The ECB has been too slow to respond to the crisis and has not done enough to stimulate the economy,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank. \"We need to see more bold action from the ECB to get the economy growing again and create jobs.\"\n\nThe unemployment crisis in Europe is also having a disproportionate impact on certain groups, such as young people and those in low-skilled jobs. In many countries, youth unemployment rates are significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate, with some countries seeing rates as high as 50 percent.\n\n\"This is a major concern,\" said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING Group. \"When young people are unable to find work, it can have long-term consequences for their careers and their lives. We need to see more action from governments to address this issue and get young people back to work.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the unemployment crisis in Europe is a complex and multifaceted problem that requires a comprehensive solution. While austerity measures and monetary policy can play a role in addressing the crisis, more needs to be done to stimulate economic growth and create jobs. Governments and central banks must work together to find a solution that benefits all Europeans, not just a select few.",

        "Text": "The government has been called on to grant a \"breathing space\" of up to a year to people who are struggling under debt, so that they can get back on their feet and manage the money they owe. Debt campaigners want the Treasury to dramatically extend existing proposals for a six-week grace period in which debtors would be protected from enforcement proceedings and mounting interest charges. The Conservative manifesto last year committed to a six-week breathing space but many believe this is insufficient, with charities and commentators saying it can take up to a year for debts to be brought under control. The Treasury is expected to announce proposals on how to roll out the new measure later in the year, after a public consultation ended last month. The existing six-week proposal will fail to cover all but the most simple cases, according to Sara Williams, the author of Debt Camel, a blog advising people on money problems. She says people are increasingly getting into debt because they are getting behind on regular bills, not because of overspending. \"For several years, debt advisers have been seeing more people [having] problems paying everyday bills such as council tax and utilities. These can be harder to deal with and more urgent than credit card and loan debts, which can take many years to go to court,\" she says. \"The breathing space needs to cover all types of debts. The proposal to extend the breathing space to a year has gained support from various organizations, including the National Debtline, which provides free debt advice to individuals. \"A longer breathing space would give people the time they need to get back on track and make a plan to manage their debts,\" said a spokesperson for the National Debtline. \"Currently, the six-week proposal is too short and will not provide sufficient protection for those struggling with debt.\"\n\nThe proposal has also received backing from the Labour Party, which has long been a vocal advocate for debt reform. \"A year-long breathing space is a crucial step towards tackling the debt crisis that has been exacerbated by the government's policies,\" said a Labour spokesperson. \"We urge the Treasury to listen to the concerns of debt campaigners and extend the breathing space to give people the time they need to get back on their feet.\"\n\nThe government has yet to respond to the proposal, but it is expected to make an announcement on the matter later in the year. In the meantime, debt campaigners are urging people to make their voices heard by responding to the public consultation and sharing their experiences of debt struggles.\n\nThe issue of debt has become increasingly pressing in recent years, with many individuals and families struggling to make ends meet. According to a recent report by the Money Advice Trust, the average debt per person in the UK has risen to over Â£15,000, with many people struggling to pay their debts on time.\n\nThe report also found that the number of people seeking debt advice has increased by 15% in the past year, with many people seeking help for the first time. \"Debt is a major issue that affects people from all walks of life,\" said a spokesperson for the Money Advice Trust. \"We urge the government to take action to address the root causes of debt and provide support to those who need it most.\"\n\nThe proposal to extend the breathing space to a year is seen as a crucial step towards addressing the debt crisis and providing support to those who are struggling. It is hoped that the government will take the concerns of debt campaigners seriously and make a decision that will benefit those who need it most.",

Frank Field MP, chair of the work and pensions committee, is to see if changes to legislation and enforcement are needed to ensure workers have their legal employment rights. The new inquiry comes after a string of tribunal rulings against companies, including Uber, eCourier and CitySprint, which ruled that couriers and taxi drivers should be classified as workers and be entitled to holiday pay and the minimum wage. The inquiry, which is expected to begin in the coming weeks, will focus on the gig economy and the treatment of workers in the sector. It will examine the current laws and regulations surrounding employment rights and whether they are adequate to protect workers.\n\nField, a Labour MP, has been a vocal critic of the gig economy and has repeatedly called for greater protections for workers. He has argued that the current system, which allows companies to classify workers as self-employed rather than employees, is exploited by companies to avoid providing basic employment rights.\n\nThe inquiry will also look at the impact of the gig economy on traditional employment and the wider economy. It is expected to hear evidence from a range of witnesses, including workers, employers, and industry experts.\n\nThe move comes after a series of high-profile tribunal cases, including a landmark ruling against Uber in 2016, which found that the company's drivers were entitled to worker status and should be paid the minimum wage and entitled to holiday pay. Similar rulings have been made against other gig economy companies, including eCourier and CitySprint.\n\nThe inquiry is expected to be a major challenge for the government, which has been criticized for its handling of the gig economy. The government has introduced measures to improve workers' rights, including the introduction of a new employment status test, but critics argue that more needs to be done to protect workers.\n\nThe inquiry is also expected to examine the role of enforcement agencies, such as HM Revenue and Customs, in ensuring that companies comply with employment laws. Field has previously criticized the agencies for failing to take action against companies that are flouting the law.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by trade unions, which have long campaigned for greater protections for workers in the gig economy. \"This inquiry is a major step forward in the fight for workers' rights,\" said Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. \"We look forward to giving evidence and making the case for greater protections for workers in the gig economy.\"\n\nThe inquiry is expected to report back to parliament in the spring, and its findings are likely to have significant implications for the gig economy and the wider employment landscape.",

While the scientists, led by Yale University neuroscientist Nenad Sestan, say the brains are not conscious, they add the feat might help researchers to probe how the brain works, and aid studies into experimental treatments for diseases ranging from cancer to dementia. The revelation, disclosed in the MIT Technology Review and based on comments Sestan made at a meeting at the US National Institutes of Health in March, has received a mixed reaction in the scientific community. Anna Devor, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, told the MIT Technology Review the feat could help researchers probe the connections between brain cells, allowing them to build a \"brain atlas\". However others were quick to stress that the development did not mean humans could expect to cheat death any time soon, noting that it is not possible to transplant a brain into a new body. \"That animal brain is not aware of anything, I am very confident of that,\" Sestan is reported to have told the NIH meeting. The breakthrough, published in the MIT Technology Review, has sparked a lively debate among scientists about the potential implications of the research. While some experts have hailed the achievement as a significant step forward in understanding the workings of the human brain, others have expressed caution, emphasizing that the decapitated pig brains are not conscious and cannot be transplanted into a new body.\n\nDr. Sestan and his team used a specialized fluid to maintain the brains' oxygen levels, allowing them to function for extended periods outside of the body. The researchers believe that this achievement could pave the way for new insights into the brain's neural connections, potentially leading to breakthroughs in the treatment of various diseases.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for neuroscience,\" said Dr. Devor, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego. \"By keeping the brains alive for longer periods, we can study the connections between brain cells in unprecedented detail, allowing us to build a more accurate 'brain atlas'.\"\n\nHowever, not all experts are convinced that the research holds the key to unlocking the secrets of human consciousness. Dr. Peter Snyder, a neuroscientist at Brown University, expressed skepticism about the potential for human brain transplants, stating that the complexity of the human brain makes it unlikely that a decapitated brain could be successfully transplanted into a new body.\n\n\"This is a fascinating achievement, but it's important to remember that we're still a long way from understanding the intricacies of human consciousness,\" said Dr. Snyder. \"While this research may provide valuable insights into the workings of the brain, it's not a step towards cheating death or achieving immortality.\"\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that their achievement is not a panacea for human brain death, but rather a tool for advancing our understanding of the brain's neural connections. As the scientific community continues to debate the implications of this breakthrough, one thing is clear: the potential for new discoveries and insights into the human brain has never been greater.\n\nIn the coming months, Dr. Sestan and his team plan to continue their research, exploring the possibilities of using decapitated brains to study a range of diseases and conditions. While the road ahead may be long and challenging, the potential rewards could be significant, offering new hope for those affected by neurological disorders and diseases.",

        "Text": "There is no more disputing it: the economic recovery in the United States has indeed slowed. The nation's economy has been growing for a year, with few new jobs to show for it. Now, with the government reporting a growth rate of just 2.4 percent in the second quarter and federal stimulus measures fading, the jobs outlook appears even more discouraging. \"Given how weak the labor market is, how long we've been without real growth, the rest of this year is probably still going to feel like a recession,\" said Prajakta Bhide, a research analyst for the United States economy at Roubini Global Economics. \"It's still positive growth  rather than contraction  but it's going to be very, very protracted.\" A Commerce Department report on Friday showed that economic growth slipped sharply in the latest quarter from a much brisker pace earlier, an annual rate of 5 percent at the end of 2009 and 3.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Consumer spending, however, was weaker than initially indicated earlier in the recovery. Many economists are forecasting a further slowdown in the second half of the year, perhaps to an annual rate as low as 1.5 percent. That is largely because businesses have refilled the stockroom shelves that were whittled down during the financial crisis, and there will not be much need for additional orders. The slowing economy has significant implications for the job market, which has been struggling to regain momentum. The unemployment rate, while still declining, has plateaued at around 9.5 percent, leaving millions of Americans without work. The lack of job growth is particularly concerning for young people and those in low-skilled industries, who are often the first to be laid off during economic downturns.\n\nDespite the bleak outlook, some economists remain optimistic that the economy will eventually rebound. \"While the current pace of growth is disappointing, it's important to remember that the economy is still growing, albeit slowly,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The fundamentals of the economy are strong, and once the inventory cycle is complete, businesses will start to invest in new production and hiring will pick up.\"\n\nHowever, others argue that the economy is facing structural challenges that will make it difficult to achieve sustained growth. \"The economy is not creating enough good jobs, and the ones it is creating are often low-wage and part-time,\" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"This is a problem that needs to be addressed through policy changes, such as increasing the minimum wage and implementing policies to support workers' bargaining power.\"\n\nThe government is also taking steps to address the economic slowdown. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low to encourage borrowing and investment, and the White House has proposed a series of stimulus measures, including infrastructure spending and tax cuts. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen, and many economists are calling for more aggressive action to stimulate the economy.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are being forced to tighten their belts and make do with less. Many are cutting back on discretionary spending, such as dining out and entertainment, and prioritizing essential expenses like rent and groceries. This trend is likely to continue in the coming months, as the economy continues to struggle to gain traction.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are some bright spots on the horizon. The housing market, which was a major driver of the financial crisis, is starting to show signs of recovery. And while the job market is still struggling, there are some industries, such as healthcare and technology, that are creating new jobs and driving growth.\n\nUltimately, the key to a sustained economic recovery will be a combination of government policy, business investment, and consumer spending. As the economy continues to evolve, it's clear that it will take a concerted effort from all stakeholders to achieve a strong and lasting recovery.",

        "Text": "LOS ANGELES -- Last week, when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that John Bailey would serve as its next president, succeeding Cheryl Boone Isaacs, Hollywood scratched its head. Mr. Bailey, 75, is a cinematographer who has thrived in the film business by helping others shine. He handled the cinematography for \"Ordinary People,\" which won four Oscars in 1981, including one for Robert Redford's direction. Mr. Bailey's work on \"As Good as It Gets\" helped Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson win Academy Awards in 1998. But it has become immediately clear that Mr. Bailey -- a foreign-film lover who has never been personally nominated for an Oscar -- is ready for the klieg lights that come with his new job. He was elected by the academy's 54-member board of governors last Tuesday night. By Friday, he was at work. As Bailey settled into his new role, he wasted no time in making his mark on the organization. In a statement released by the Academy, Bailey emphasized his commitment to diversity and inclusion, stating, \"As we move forward, I am committed to ensuring that the Academy remains a welcoming and inclusive institution, where all members feel valued and respected.\"\n\nBailey's first order of business was to convene an emergency meeting with the Academy's board of governors to discuss the ongoing controversy surrounding the lack of diversity in the nominees for the upcoming Oscars ceremony. The meeting, which was held behind closed doors, lasted for several hours and was described by sources as \"heated\" and \"emotional.\"\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Bailey remained optimistic about the Academy's future, citing his own experiences as a cinematographer as an example of the power of collaboration and teamwork. \"As a cinematographer, I have always believed that the best work comes from bringing together talented individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives,\" he said. \"I am excited to bring this same approach to my new role as president, and to work with our members to build a more inclusive and diverse Academy.\"\n\nBailey's presidency is set to begin on August 1, and he will serve a three-year term. In the meantime, he will work closely with outgoing president Cheryl Boone Isaacs to ensure a smooth transition. Isaacs, who has been at the helm of the Academy since 2013, has been praised for her efforts to increase diversity and inclusion within the organization, and Bailey has pledged to build on her legacy.\n\nAs Bailey prepares to take the reins, many in the film industry are holding their breath, wondering what changes he will bring to the Academy. One thing is certain, however: John Bailey is ready for the challenge, and is committed to making the Academy a more inclusive and diverse institution for all its members.",

With more than a quarter of the nation's adults \"inactive\", according to the Active Lives survey released in March, Sport England wants to ensure students are leaving secondary education with an active lifestyle. Jennie Price, the chief executive of Sport England, said: \"While some youngsters have a great experience of PE and sport at school, others don't, and our research shows that can put them off being active for life. Lots of people have bad memories of being picked last for a team or just feeling really uncomfortable in PE lessons. This programme is designed to stop that happening.\" The scheme will run through the national network of teaching school alliances, training teachers in new activities from zumba to volleyball and encouraging school leaders to value PE. The program, titled \"Teacher Learning Programme\", aims to equip teachers with the skills and confidence to deliver high-quality PE and sport lessons, ultimately increasing student participation and enjoyment. The initiative will focus on providing teachers with practical training and support, enabling them to develop engaging and inclusive lesson plans that cater to diverse student needs.\n\nAccording to Sport England, the current state of PE and sport in schools is a significant concern. The organization's research found that nearly 20% of secondary students reported disliking PE lessons, with many citing feelings of embarrassment, inadequacy, or simply not enjoying the activities. This lack of enthusiasm can have long-term consequences, as it may deter students from adopting an active lifestyle outside of school.\n\nThe Teacher Learning Programme will address these concerns by providing teachers with a range of resources and training opportunities. The program will focus on developing teachers' knowledge and skills in areas such as lesson planning, delivery, and assessment, as well as providing guidance on how to create a positive and inclusive PE environment.\n\nOne of the key features of the program will be the introduction of new activities and sports, designed to appeal to a wider range of students. This includes activities such as zumba, volleyball, and badminton, which are often more accessible and enjoyable for students who may not be interested in traditional team sports.\n\nIn addition to teacher training, the program will also provide support for school leaders to value and prioritize PE and sport in their schools. This will involve providing guidance on how to allocate resources, prioritize PE and sport in the curriculum, and create a positive school culture that supports student physical activity.\n\nThe launch of the Teacher Learning Programme comes at a critical time, as the UK faces a growing public health crisis related to physical inactivity. According to the Active Lives survey, more than a quarter of the nation's adults are \"inactive\", meaning they do not engage in any physical activity outside of work or daily tasks. By investing in the next generation of teachers, Sport England hopes to inspire a love of physical activity in young people, setting them on a path towards a healthier and more active lifestyle.\n\nThe program is expected to have a significant impact on the quality of PE and sport in schools, with Sport England aiming to train 17,000 teachers over the next three years. With the support of the national network of teaching school alliances, the organization is confident that the Teacher Learning Programme will make a lasting difference to the lives of young people across England.",

        "Text": "Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, called on Wednesday for a federal privacy law in the US to protect against voracious internet companies hoarding so much digital data that the businesses know citizens \"better than they know themselves\" â€“ and then often sell the information on. Cook warned in a keynote speech that personal data was being \"weaponized\" against the public and endorsed tough privacy laws for both Europe and the US. The iPhone and Mac computer giant has stood out in its explicit declarations that Apple prefers to protect its customers' personal data. Speaking at an international conference in Brussels on data privacy,Cook applauded European Union authorities for bringing in a strict new data privacy law in May, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This gives consumers more control over their personal information and imposes greater restrictions and transparency rules on all companies, with the threat of fines, but particularly affects the chains of companies that exploit digitally acquired data, including tech leaders such as Google and Facebook and middlemen marketers and data brokers. \"In many jurisdictions, regulators are asking tough questions. It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead. We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said. Cook's remarks come at a time when concerns about data privacy have reached a fever pitch, with high-profile breaches and scandals at companies like Facebook and Cambridge Analytica dominating headlines. The tech giant's CEO emphasized that the proliferation of personal data has created a \"wild west\" environment, where companies are free to collect and use information without adequate safeguards.\n\n\"Today, many companies are collecting and storing vast amounts of personal data, often without people's knowledge or consent,\" Cook said. \"This data is then used to create detailed profiles of individuals, allowing companies to know us better than we know ourselves. It's a powerful tool, but one that must be used responsibly.\"\n\nCook's comments were met with applause from the audience, which included privacy advocates, lawmakers, and industry leaders. The CEO's remarks were seen as a call to action, urging policymakers to take a more proactive approach to protecting personal data.\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May, has set a new standard for data privacy in the European Union. The regulation gives individuals more control over their personal information, requires companies to be more transparent about how they collect and use data, and imposes stiff fines for non-compliance.\n\nCook praised the GDPR as a model for other jurisdictions, saying that it has created a \"more level playing field\" for companies that prioritize privacy. He also emphasized the need for similar regulations in the United States, where data privacy laws are currently fragmented and inadequate.\n\n\"We believe that a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States would provide a clear framework for companies to operate within, while also giving consumers the protections they deserve,\" Cook said.\n\nThe CEO's remarks were seen as a significant departure from the approach taken by other tech giants, which have historically resisted efforts to regulate their data collection practices. Cook's comments were also seen as a nod to the growing public concern about data privacy, which has become a major issue in the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nIn recent months, several Democratic presidential candidates have made data privacy a key issue, with some calling for the creation of a federal data privacy agency. Cook's remarks were seen as a sign that even some of the most powerful companies in the tech industry are beginning to recognize the need for greater regulation.\n\nAs the debate over data privacy continues to unfold, Cook's comments are likely to be seen as a significant development. The CEO's call for a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States is a clear signal that Apple is committed to prioritizing privacy, and that the company is willing to work with policymakers to create a more transparent and accountable data ecosystem.",

        "Text": "MADRID -- Spain plans to offer residency permits to foreigners who buy houses priced at more than 160,000 euros ($203,845) as part of its efforts to revive a collapsed real estate market and divest itself of hundreds of thousands of unsold homes. In announcing the proposal on Monday, the Spanish trade secretary, Jaime Garcia-Legaz, said it was aimed in particular at Chinese and Russian investors who might face difficulties buying a house in Spain because they are not residents of the European Union. Mr. Garcia-Legaz noted that Spain was following in the footsteps of Ireland and Portugal, two other ailing euro zone economies that have sought to spur their housing markets by easing residency requirements. Spain normally grants visas that are valid for up to 90 days to citizens of countries that are outside the European Union. The residency permits for foreign home buyers would be for a much longer period of time but would not be open-ended. That detail has yet to be decided. The permits would also not grant the buyer the right to work in Spain. The proposal, which is still pending approval from the Spanish government, is expected to have a significant impact on the country's real estate market, which has been struggling to recover from the financial crisis. The move is seen as a way to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth.\n\nAccording to industry experts, the plan could be particularly appealing to Chinese and Russian investors, who are known for their appetite for international real estate. \"This is a great opportunity for foreign investors to buy a property in Spain and enjoy a high-quality lifestyle,\" said Maria Rodriguez, a real estate agent based in Madrid. \"The residency permit will give them the freedom to live in Spain for a longer period of time, and they will also have access to a wide range of amenities and services.\"\n\nThe proposal has received mixed reactions from experts and politicians. While some have welcomed the move as a way to boost the economy, others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the Spanish housing market. \"We need to be careful not to create a bubble in the real estate market,\" said Ana Sanchez, a economist at the University of Madrid. \"We don't want to see a repeat of what happened in the past, where foreign investors drove up prices and then left the market.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the Spanish government is pushing ahead with the proposal, which is expected to be implemented in the coming months. The move is seen as a key part of the government's strategy to revive the economy and create jobs. \"We are committed to creating a business-friendly environment in Spain, and this proposal is a key part of that,\" said Mr. Garcia-Legaz. \"We believe that it will help to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth, and we are confident that it will be a success.\"\n\nIn addition to the residency permit, the Spanish government is also considering other measures to boost the real estate market, including tax breaks and incentives for developers. The government is also working to improve the country's infrastructure and reduce bureaucracy, in an effort to make it easier for foreign investors to do business in Spain.\n\nOverall, the proposal is seen as a bold move by the Spanish government to revive the country's real estate market and attract foreign investment. While there are concerns about the potential impact on the housing market, many experts believe that the move could be a key part of the country's recovery from the financial crisis.",

RBS said the Swiss regulator, the Swiss financial market supervisory authority (Finma), had \"opened enforcement proceedings against Coutts & Co Ltd (Coutts), a member of the RBS Group incorporated in Switzerland, with regard to certain client accounts held with Coutts\". Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, said it related to \"the international private bank that we no longer own\" and did not elaborate. While the bank reported a statutory Â£421m profit for the first quarter of 2016, a Â£1.2bn payment to the government meant that shareholders would see a Â£968m loss. The news sent shockwaves through the financial markets, with investors scrambling to understand the implications of the Swiss regulatory action. RBS shares plummeted by 4.5% in early trading, wiping out Â£1.2 billion from the bank's market value.\n\nThe revelation comes as RBS is still recovering from the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, which saw the bank bailed out by the UK government. The bank has been working to rebuild its reputation and repair its balance sheet, but the news from Switzerland has raised fresh concerns about its ability to manage risk.\n\nCoutts, which was founded in 1822, is one of the oldest and most prestigious private banks in the world. It has a long history of serving high-net-worth individuals and families, and is known for its discretion and confidentiality. However, the bank has also been criticized in the past for its role in facilitating tax evasion and other financial crimes.\n\nRBS acquired Coutts in 2000, but has since been divesting its non-core assets and focusing on its core retail and commercial banking business. The bank has not disclosed the value of Coutts, but it is believed to be a significant contributor to RBS's profits.\n\nThe Swiss regulator's action against Coutts is likely to be related to the bank's handling of client accounts, which may have been used to facilitate illegal activities such as tax evasion or money laundering. Finma has a reputation for being tough on banks that fail to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, and has imposed significant fines on several major banks in recent years.\n\nRBS has promised to cooperate fully with the Swiss regulator's investigation and has said that it will take any necessary steps to ensure that its subsidiary is in compliance with all relevant regulations. However, the news is likely to raise concerns among investors and customers about the bank's risk management practices and its ability to manage its non-core assets.\n\nThe investigation is also likely to have implications for RBS's efforts to rebuild its reputation and repair its balance sheet. The bank has been working to reduce its debt and improve its capital position, but the news from Switzerland is likely to make it more difficult to achieve these goals.\n\nIn a statement, RBS said: \"We are cooperating fully with the Swiss regulator's investigation and are committed to ensuring that our subsidiary is in compliance with all relevant regulations. We will provide further updates as necessary.\"\n\nThe news is likely to be closely watched by investors and regulators in the coming weeks and months, as RBS works to resolve the issue and restore confidence in its operations.",

        "Text": "The British empire spread leasehold to every corner of the globe â€“ but now England and Wales remain the last redoubt of a system regarded as a feudal relic everywhere else. In Ireland, much-hated ground rents extracted by the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, and dating back to the Cromwellian era, were partly behind the rise of the Land League in the late 19th century, and the country's fight for independence. Once a republic, Ireland legislated to give leaseholders the right to demand the freeholder sell up, at a relatively low price using an agreed formula. Even today, leaseholders in Northern Ireland enjoy a much better deal than their counterparts in England, with the ability to buy their freehold for about 10 times the ground rent, compared with the 25-40 times multiples common in England. Colonial territories including large parts of Australia were originally leased to farmers by the government, but the country rejected that form of tenure in the 1960s, as have other former parts of empire saddled with this legacy of British rule. In New Zealand, approximately 15% of residential apartments are believed to remain as leasehold, mostly towards the bottom of the market, with what are called \"Glasgow\" leases, again dating to the colonial period. In Auckland's super-hot property market, issues similar to those in England about soaring ground rents have emerged. As the global trend towards abolishing leasehold tenure gains momentum, the UK's continued reliance on the system has sparked concerns about the long-term implications for homeowners and the property market. Critics argue that the system creates a power imbalance, allowing freeholders to exploit leaseholders and drive up ground rents, which can have devastating consequences for those on fixed incomes or with limited financial flexibility.\n\nIn England, the situation is particularly dire, with many leaseholders facing significant increases in ground rents, often without notice or justification. The lack of transparency and regulation has led to widespread frustration and anger, with some leaseholders forced to pay exorbitant sums simply to maintain their homes. The issue has become so pressing that it has caught the attention of policymakers, with some calling for a complete overhaul of the system.\n\nOne potential solution is the introduction of a \"leasehold reform\" bill, which would give leaseholders the right to buy their freehold at a discounted rate. This approach has been successfully implemented in other countries, including Ireland, and could help alleviate the financial burden on leaseholders in England.\n\nHowever, the complexity of the issue means that a straightforward solution is unlikely. The system is deeply entrenched, and any reforms would need to take into account the interests of freeholders, who have a vested stake in the current arrangement. Moreover, the issue is not limited to individual homeowners, but also has implications for the broader property market.\n\nAs the debate surrounding leasehold tenure continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the status quo is no longer sustainable. The UK's continued reliance on a system that is widely regarded as outdated and unfair is a relic of a bygone era, and it is time for a more modern and equitable approach to property ownership.",

His final day on the show will be May 13. Mr. Strahan will make appearances on \"Good Morning America\" throughout the summer and will formally join as co-anchor in September, the spokeswoman said. After it was announced that Mr. Strahan would be leaving, Ms. Ripa did not appear on three episodes of the show last week. That touched off speculation in the news media about when she would return and whether her relationship with Mr. Strahan was actually as carefree as it appeared to be every weekday morning on television. Ms. Ripa walked onto the \"Live With Kelly and Michael\" stage on Tuesday, holding hands with Mr. Strahan, before walking off to a side of the stage by herself, with the camera firmly fixed on her. As she stood alone, a mix of emotions played across her face, but ultimately, her signature bright smile returned, and she began to speak. \"I want to thank everyone for their support and understanding over the past week,\" she said, her voice steady and strong. \"I know it's been a wild ride, but I'm happy to be back here with all of you.\"\n\nThe audience, comprised of die-hard fans of the show, erupted into applause, with many in attendance visibly relieved to see their beloved host back on set. The tension that had filled the air during her absence was palpable, and it was clear that the drama surrounding Strahan's departure had taken a toll on everyone involved.\n\nRipa's return marked the beginning of a new chapter for \"Live With Kelly and Michael,\" and while the departure of Strahan would undoubtedly leave a void, the show's producers were already working on plans to revamp the format and bring in new talent. In the meantime, Ripa would continue to co-host the show with her new partner, a yet-to-be-announced guest host who would join her on the couch.\n\nThe news of Strahan's departure from \"Live\" had sent shockwaves through the television industry, with many speculating about the reasons behind his sudden exit. While ABC had remained tight-lipped about the details, sources close to the situation revealed that Strahan's desire to join \"Good Morning America\" had been a long-time goal, and he had finally been given the opportunity to make the move.\n\nAs the drama surrounding Strahan's departure continued to unfold, Ripa's return to the show marked a welcome return to normalcy for fans of \"Live With Kelly and Michael.\" Despite the challenges that lay ahead, Ripa's signature wit and charm were already back in full force, and it was clear that she was ready to move forward and tackle the future with her trademark confidence and poise.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, \"Live With Kelly and Michael\" would undergo a transformation, but one thing was certain â€“ Kelly Ripa would remain at the helm, guiding the show through its evolution and ensuring that the magic of the morning show continued to captivate audiences across the country.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- Novartis, one of Switzerland's biggest drug makers, said Tuesday it scrapped a planned $78 million payment to its departing chairman because of pressure from shareholders and lawmakers. Novartis said it cancelled an agreement with Daniel Vasella to pay him 72 million Swiss francs over the next six years to keep him from sharing his knowledge with competitors. The decision comes three days before the company's board is to face investors at the annual shareholder meeting. \"We continue to believe in the value of a non-compete, however, the decision to cancel the agreement and all related compensation addresses the concern of shareholders and other stakeholders,\" Novartis's vice chairman, Ulrich Lehner, said in a statement. The size of the planned payment, which was revealed last Friday, had outraged investors just two weeks before a Swiss referendum to give shareholders more power to determine executive compensation. The move is seen as a significant victory for shareholders and lawmakers who had been critical of the proposed payment, which they deemed excessive and unfair. The controversy surrounding the payment had sparked widespread debate and scrutiny, with many arguing that it was a clear example of corporate excess.\n\nThe decision to cancel the agreement was met with widespread approval from investors, with many praising Novartis for listening to their concerns and taking steps to address them. \"This is a major win for shareholders and a sign that Novartis is committed to transparency and accountability,\" said one investor, who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Vasella's payment had also sparked a broader debate about executive compensation and the role of corporate boards in determining executive pay. Many had argued that the payment was a clear example of the need for greater oversight and accountability in the corporate world.\n\nThe Swiss referendum, which is scheduled to take place on June 10, is expected to have significant implications for executive compensation in Switzerland. The referendum, which was initiated by a group of shareholders, aims to give shareholders more power to determine executive compensation and to prevent excessive payments.\n\nIn a statement, the Swiss Federal Council, which is responsible for implementing the referendum, welcomed Novartis' decision to cancel the agreement. \"This decision demonstrates the company's commitment to transparency and accountability, and we hope that it will set a precedent for other companies to follow,\" said a spokesperson.\n\nThe cancellation of the agreement is also seen as a significant blow to Vasella, who had been widely criticized for his role in the controversy. Vasella, who is set to retire from Novartis in June, had been one of the company's most senior executives and had played a key role in shaping its strategy.\n\nIn a statement, Vasella said that he was \"disappointed\" by the decision to cancel the agreement, but that he understood the concerns of shareholders and stakeholders. \"I have always been committed to the success of Novartis, and I will continue to support the company in any way that I can,\" he said.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Vasella's payment is likely to continue to dominate the headlines in the coming weeks, as shareholders and lawmakers continue to scrutinize the company's executive compensation practices.",

        "Text": "China's ambassador to the UK has urged the government to ignore external pressure over a politically and diplomatically charged decision to involve the Chinese firm Huawei in building the 5G communications network. In China's first official comments on the row, Beijing's ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, urged the UK to make the \"right decision independently\" over the suppliers for the new network. Huawei is at the centre of a Whitehall leak inquiry after details emerged of a National Security Council (NSC) meeting during which Theresa May approved giving Huawei a limited role supplying the 5G system. Liu Xiaoming's comments come as the UK government is under increasing pressure from the United States to ban Huawei from playing a role in the country's 5G network. The US has expressed concerns that Huawei's equipment could be used by the Chinese government to spy on British citizens and compromise national security.\n\nHowever, Liu Xiaoming dismissed these concerns, saying that Huawei was a private company and that Beijing had no interest in interfering in the UK's internal affairs. He also pointed out that Huawei had been working with British companies for many years and had a strong track record of delivering high-quality technology.\n\nThe ambassador's comments are likely to be seen as a significant development in the row, which has been building for several weeks. The UK government has been under pressure from both the US and some of its own MPs to reconsider its decision to allow Huawei to play a role in the 5G network.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Huawei has been fueled by concerns about the company's ties to the Chinese government and the potential risks it poses to national security. Some have argued that allowing Huawei to build part of the 5G network would compromise the UK's ability to protect its citizens from cyber threats.\n\nHowever, others have pointed out that Huawei has been working with British companies for many years and has a strong track record of delivering high-quality technology. They argue that the company's equipment is secure and that the UK has robust safeguards in place to protect its national security.\n\nThe debate is likely to continue in the coming weeks as the UK government finalizes its decision on the role of Huawei in the 5G network. Liu Xiaoming's comments are likely to be seen as a significant development in the row, and will be closely watched by politicians and business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nIn related news, the UK's National Security Council is expected to meet again soon to discuss the issue further. The council is made up of senior government officials and is responsible for advising the prime minister on national security matters.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Huawei has also sparked a wider debate about the role of Chinese technology companies in the UK's economy. Some have argued that the UK should be more cautious about allowing Chinese companies to play a role in its critical infrastructure, while others have pointed out that the benefits of doing so far outweigh the risks.\n\nUltimately, the decision on whether to allow Huawei to play a role in the UK's 5G network will depend on a careful assessment of the risks and benefits. The UK government will need to weigh up the potential risks to national security against the benefits of having a secure and reliable 5G network.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the decision on Huawei's role in the UK's 5G network will have significant implications for the country's relationship with China and its ability to protect its citizens from cyber threats.",

        "Text": "Saudi Arabia insisted it was pressing ahead with a $2tn (Â£1.5tn) float of the state oil giant, Aramco, following reports that it had shelved plans for the biggest-ever stock market flotation. Reuters first reported on Wednesday that financial advisers working on the plans to sell a 5% stake in Aramco had been disbanded as Saudi Arabia instead focused on a proposed acquisition of a stake in a local petrochemicals maker. However, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the government would go ahead with the flotation, although he gave no indication of the timeframe. \"The government remains committed to the IPO [initial public offering] of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum,\" said Khalid al-Falih, who is also chairman of Saudi Aramco. He added: \"This timing will depend on multiple factors, including favourable market conditions, and a downstream acquisition, which the company will pursue in the next few months, as directed by its board of directors.\" Despite the minister's reassurances, the sudden change in plans has left many in the financial community scratching their heads. Analysts had been expecting the Aramco IPO to be a major boost to the Saudi economy, generating much-needed revenue and helping to diversify the country's oil-dependent economy.\n\nThe proposed acquisition of a stake in the local petrochemicals maker, Sabic, is seen as a significant development, but it is unclear how it will impact the Aramco IPO. Sabic is a major player in the Saudi petrochemicals industry, and the acquisition could provide a strategic boost to Aramco's downstream operations.\n\nHowever, some analysts are concerned that the shift in focus may be a sign of a broader issue with the Aramco IPO. \"The fact that they're delaying the IPO and focusing on an acquisition instead suggests that the market conditions may not be as favorable as they thought,\" said Faisal Al-Khasawneh, an analyst at EFG Hermes.\n\nThe Aramco IPO was seen as a key part of Saudi Arabia's plans to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil exports. The country has been working to develop its non-oil sectors, including manufacturing and tourism, but the oil industry remains a significant contributor to the economy.\n\nThe delay in the IPO is likely to be a major disappointment for many investors who had been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to buy into one of the world's largest oil companies. The IPO was expected to be a major event, with many of the world's largest investment banks and asset managers lining up to participate.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the Aramco IPO, Saudi Arabia's energy minister remains confident that the company will eventually go ahead with the flotation. \"We are committed to the IPO and will pursue it when the conditions are right,\" said al-Falih.\n\nThe delay in the IPO is likely to be a major test of Saudi Arabia's economic strategy, which is designed to reduce the country's reliance on oil exports and diversify its economy. The country has made significant progress in recent years, but the delay in the Aramco IPO is a reminder that there is still much work to be done.\n\nIn the meantime, investors will be closely watching the developments surrounding the Aramco IPO, hoping for a clearer indication of when the company will finally go ahead with the flotation.",

        "Text": "A new academic study has found \"a pattern of discrimination\" against passengers with African American-sounding names by Uber and Lyft drivers. The findings call into question a central narrative of ride-hail apps that they solve the entrenched and humiliating problem of hailing a cab for black passengers. Waiting times for black passengers in Seattle were 35% longer than for white passengers, and drivers in Boston cancelled rides for black passengers more than twice as frequently as for white passengers, researchers found in a study published Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research. In order to study the issue, researchers designed randomized trials by sending research assistants on nearly 1,500 rides in Seattle and Boston. \"Is a taxi driver's decision, made in public view, not to stop for an African American passenger being eliminated? The study's findings suggest that the ride-hail apps' algorithms, which claim to match passengers with the nearest available driver, may not be as effective in addressing discrimination as previously thought. The researchers argue that the algorithms may actually perpetuate biases held by individual drivers, leading to longer wait times and higher cancellation rates for passengers with African American-sounding names.\n\nThe study's authors also found that the disparity in wait times and cancellation rates was not limited to Seattle and Boston. Similar patterns were observed in other cities, including New York and Los Angeles, where black passengers experienced longer wait times and higher cancellation rates compared to white passengers.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of data analysis and field experiments to investigate the issue. They sent research assistants, who were randomly assigned African American-sounding names, on nearly 1,500 rides in Seattle and Boston. The assistants' experiences were then compared to those of research assistants with white-sounding names, who took similar rides in the same cities.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the ride-hail industry, which has long touted its ability to address the problem of discrimination in public transportation. The study's authors argue that the industry's reliance on algorithms may not be enough to overcome the biases held by individual drivers.\n\n\"This study highlights the need for more nuanced approaches to addressing discrimination in ride-hailing,\" said Dr. [Name], one of the study's authors. \"Simply relying on algorithms may not be enough to overcome the biases that exist in society. We need to think more critically about how we design our systems to address these issues.\"\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked concerns about the broader impact of discrimination in public transportation. Advocates for greater transportation equity are calling for more research and action to address the issue.\n\n\"This study is a wake-up call for the ride-hail industry and for policymakers,\" said [Name], executive director of the Transportation Equity Network. \"We need to take a closer look at how our transportation systems are designed and how they impact marginalized communities. This study is a reminder that we still have a long way to go in achieving true transportation equity.\"\n\nThe ride-hail companies, Uber and Lyft, have not commented on the study's findings. However, the companies have previously stated that they are committed to addressing discrimination and promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn the meantime, the study's authors are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the ride-hail industry. They argue that the industry must take concrete steps to address discrimination and ensure that its algorithms are fair and unbiased.\n\n\"The ride-hail industry has a responsibility to ensure that its systems are free from discrimination,\" said Dr. [Name]. \"We hope that this study will spark a broader conversation about how we can work together to address this issue and create a more equitable transportation system for all.\"",

        "Text": "For much of the last century it seemed that the slice of the total economic pie going to workers was -- like the speed of light -- constant. No matter what the economy's makeup, labor could collectively depend on taking home roughly two-thirds of the country's total output as compensation for its efforts. Workers' unchanging share, the economist John Maynard Keynes declared in 1939, was \"one of the most surprising, yet best-established, facts in the whole range of economic statistics.\" But in recent decades, that steady share -- which includes everything from the chief executive's bonuses and stock options to the parking-lot attendant's minimum wage and tips -- started to flutter. In the 2000s, it slipped significantly. Although the numbers have inched up in the last couple of years, labor's portion has not risen above 59 percent since before the recession. The decline has coincided with a slowdown in overall growth as well as a stark leap in inequality. \"Labor is getting a shrinking slice of a pie that's not growing very much,\" David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., said. It is a development that is upending political establishments and economic policies in the United States and abroad. Some economists argue that technological advancements are to blame as employers have replaced workers with machines. Others point to trade powered by cheap foreign labor, a view championed by President Trump that particularly resonated among voters. Alternate culprits include tax policies that treat investment income more favorably than wages; flagging skills and education that have rendered workers less productive or unsuited to an information- and service-based economy; or a weakening of labor unions that has chipped away at workers' bargaining power and protections. Over the last 15 years, for example, labor productivity has grown faster than wages, a sign that workers are not being adequately compensated for their contributions. And some industries have fared worse than others. The decline in labor's share of the economic pie has significant implications for workers, policymakers, and the overall economy. As the pie grows smaller, the purchasing power of workers' wages decreases, making it more difficult for them to afford basic necessities, let alone luxuries. This trend is particularly concerning for low- and middle-income households, who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe consequences of this shift are far-reaching. For instance, the decline in labor's share has led to a surge in income inequality, as the top 1% of earners capture an increasingly large share of the economic pie. This has resulted in a widening wealth gap, with the wealthiest individuals and corporations holding a disproportionate amount of wealth and power.\n\nFurthermore, the decline in labor's share has also had a profound impact on the economy's overall growth. As workers' wages stagnate, their ability to consume goods and services is reduced, leading to decreased aggregate demand and slower economic growth. This, in turn, can lead to a vicious cycle of slow growth, high unemployment, and reduced economic mobility.\n\nPolicymakers are grappling with the implications of this trend, and various solutions are being proposed to address the issue. Some argue that increasing the minimum wage, strengthening labor unions, and implementing policies to promote fair trade practices could help to reverse the decline in labor's share. Others suggest that investing in education and training programs, as well as infrastructure development, could help to boost productivity and wages.\n\nThe debate is complex and contentious, with different experts and stakeholders offering competing solutions. However, one thing is clear: the decline in labor's share of the economic pie is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention and action.\n\nIn the coming months, policymakers will be faced with the task of addressing this trend and finding ways to promote a more equitable and sustainable economic system. As the debate continues, it is essential to consider the perspectives of workers, employers, and policymakers, and to develop solutions that benefit all stakeholders. Ultimately, the goal should be to create an economy that is fair, inclusive, and prosperous for all.",

        "Text": "MADRID  The Spanish government outlined far-reaching spending cuts on Friday to bring its sizable budget deficit under control, amid forecasts that the country would remain mired in recession for another year. Broader data released Friday showed the economic recovery in the 15 other countries using the euro would remain sluggish. Spain has been hit especially hard by a slump in home prices, and is scrambling to avoid the fate of Greece, where a ballooning budget deficit has raised concerns about the government defaulting on its bonds. The Spanish government's austerity measures aim to reduce the country's budget deficit from 9.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 to 6.5% in 2010 and 3% by 2013, in line with European Union guidelines. The cuts will be achieved through a combination of reductions in public spending and increases in taxes.\n\nThe government plans to reduce public sector employment by 150,000 positions, or about 10% of the total workforce, over the next two years. It will also cut subsidies to industries such as agriculture and energy, and reduce spending on infrastructure projects.\n\nIn addition, the government will increase taxes on high-income earners and corporations. The value-added tax (VAT) rate will be increased from 16% to 18%, and the tax on corporate profits will be raised from 30% to 35%.\n\nThe government has also announced plans to reform the pension system, which is expected to save the country â‚¬10 billion annually. The reforms will include increasing the retirement age and reducing the number of years worked required to qualify for a full pension.\n\nThe economic data released on Friday showed that the eurozone economy is expected to grow by only 0.7% in 2010, down from an earlier forecast of 1.2%. The region's economic recovery is being hindered by high unemployment rates, which are averaging around 10%, and a lack of consumer and business confidence.\n\nThe news is likely to have a significant impact on the Spanish economy, which has been struggling to recover from the global financial crisis. The country's unemployment rate has risen to over 20%, and its economy is expected to contract by around 1% in 2010.\n\nThe government's austerity measures are aimed at restoring confidence in the country's economy and reducing the risk of a sovereign debt default. However, the measures are likely to be unpopular with many Spaniards, who are already feeling the pinch of the economic crisis.\n\nThe government has promised to implement the reforms in a fair and transparent manner, and has pledged to provide support to those who will be most affected by the cuts. However, the measures are likely to have a significant impact on the country's social fabric, and could lead to increased social unrest and protests.\n\nIn conclusion, the Spanish government's austerity measures are a necessary step to bring the country's budget deficit under control and restore confidence in the economy. However, the measures are likely to be unpopular with many Spaniards, and could have a significant impact on the country's social fabric.",

The US president's go-it-alone approach â€“ especially in the field of trade â€“ has certainly shaken things up. It is not just the threat of tariffs, nor that the US has brought the dispute settlement system at the World Trade Organisation to a standstill. The concerns among global leaders and economists are far more profound. The US's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a key trade agreement, has left a power vacuum in the Asia-Pacific region, allowing China to fill the gap and further solidify its position as a dominant economic player.\n\nMoreover, the Trump administration's decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from key allies, including Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, has sparked a chain reaction of retaliatory measures. This has not only damaged global trade flows but also eroded trust among nations, making it increasingly difficult to find common ground on critical issues like climate change, migration, and economic inequality.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank meetings, typically a forum for discussing global economic policy and cooperation, were marked by a sense of urgency and unease.

        "Text": "Google's interest in China appears to be far broader than just internet search; it's planning a push into autonomous vehicles, has opened a center for artificial intelligence research and has invested in local companies. BEIJING -- Google has faced sharp criticism, including from its own employees, for its efforts to rebuild an internet search presence in China after quitting the country eight years ago over censorship issues. But for Google's corporate parent, Alphabet, the opportunities in the world's largest internet market may be too good to resist. And the full scope of the company's interest in China now appears to be broader than just internet search. The latest hint came from Waymo, the driverless-car company that was spun out of Google in 2016. Chinese media noticed this week that the business had quietly registered a Shanghai subsidiary in May, suggesting that it wants a piece of an industry that the Chinese government has made a priority. Other recent steps that Google has taken in China include opening a research center and promoting its software tools to developers. In artificial intelligence and other areas in which Alphabet is seeking to advance the technological frontier, China today is more than just the planet's biggest audience of internet users. It is an ecosystem of sophisticated potential business partners, talent and tech-hungry customers from which tomorrow's innovations could emerge. Other American tech giants have made their peace in various ways with Beijing's strictures and conditions for operating in the country. Unlike Google, Apple runs its own app store in China, heeding government directives about the kinds of apps that can be available to Chinese users. Microsoft and Amazon offer cloud computing services, working with local partners and following strict controls on how customers' data is stored. Alphabet's investments in future technologies make it particularly important for the company to get a foot into China early. The move by Waymo to register a Shanghai subsidiary is seen as a significant step in Google's expansion into the autonomous vehicle market in China. The country has been actively promoting the development of autonomous driving technology, with several major cities launching pilot programs for self-driving taxis and buses.\n\nIndustry experts believe that Waymo's entry into the Chinese market will not only provide the company with access to a vast pool of potential customers but also enable it to tap into the country's vast talent pool of engineers and researchers. China has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving research, with several universities and research institutions already making significant breakthroughs in the field.\n\nGoogle's research center in China, which was established earlier this year, is also expected to play a key role in the company's expansion into the autonomous vehicle market. The center, which is located in the city of Beijing, is focused on developing advanced AI and machine learning technologies that can be used in a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles.\n\nGoogle's investments in local companies are also seen as a strategic move to gain a foothold in the Chinese market. The company has invested in several Chinese startups, including a leading autonomous driving company, which has received significant funding from Google's venture capital arm.\n\nWhile Google's efforts to rebuild its presence in China have been met with criticism from some quarters, the company's executives believe that the opportunities in the country are too good to resist. \"China is a critical market for us, and we are committed to making a meaningful contribution to the country's technology ecosystem,\" said a Google spokesperson.\n\nThe company's efforts to expand into China are also seen as a key part of its strategy to stay ahead of the competition in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. With the rise of Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent, Google is under pressure to demonstrate its ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, Google's expansion into China is a significant development that highlights the company's commitment to staying ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. The company's investments in autonomous vehicles, AI research, and local companies are seen as a key part of its strategy to gain a foothold in the Chinese market and stay ahead of the competition.",

        "Text": "Steep rises in fees for bringing unfair dismissal claims at employment tribunals â€“ which have led to a 70% fall in the number of cases â€“ are to be challenged at the UK's highest court. The supreme court on Monday will hear a final appeal brought by Unison, which says that costs of up to Â£1,200 are preventing many mistreated workers â€“ particularly those on low incomes â€“ from obtaining justice and are discriminatory. The two-day hearing is the culmination of a four-year legal campaign by the union on behalf of its members. Unison lost in the high court and the court of appeal but has been given permission to argue its case before the supreme court. Seven justices headed by the court's president, Lord Neuberger, will consider the claim â€“ a sign that the court recognises its legal significance. The action is against the lord chancellor and justice secretary, Liz Truss. Commenting before the hearing, Unison's general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: \"If an employer breaks the law and treats one of their employees unfairly, they should be challenged. It cannot be right that unscrupulous bosses are escaping punishment because people simply don't have the money to pursue a case. The union argues that the current system is not only preventing workers from seeking justice, but also perpetuating inequality. According to Unison, the costs of bringing a claim can be prohibitively expensive for low-income workers, who are already vulnerable to unfair treatment. The union claims that this is a breach of the Human Rights Act, which guarantees the right to access justice.\n\nThe case has garnered widespread support from various organizations, including the Trades Union Congress (TUC), which has called for a review of the employment tribunal fees. The TUC has argued that the fees have created a barrier to justice, disproportionately affecting vulnerable workers, such as those on zero-hours contracts, agency workers, and those in the gig economy.\n\nUnison's general secretary, Dave Prentis, has also highlighted the impact of the fees on the overall effectiveness of the employment tribunal system. \"The fees have led to a significant decline in the number of cases being brought, which means that employers are getting away with unfair treatment,\" he said. \"It's a ticking time bomb for workers' rights, and we need to take action to restore fairness and justice to the system.\"\n\nThe supreme court hearing is expected to be a closely watched event, with many legal experts predicting a landmark decision that could have far-reaching implications for workers' rights in the UK. If Unison's appeal is successful, it could lead to a change in the way employment tribunal fees are structured, potentially making it more accessible for workers to seek justice.\n\nThe case has also sparked debate among politicians, with some arguing that the fees are necessary to prevent frivolous claims and others calling for a review of the system. The lord chancellor and justice secretary, Liz Truss, has defended the fees, saying that they help to ensure that employment tribunals are used for genuine cases of unfair treatment.\n\nThe outcome of the supreme court hearing is expected to be announced in the coming months. Regardless of the decision, the case is likely to continue to generate controversy and debate, highlighting the need for a fair and accessible employment tribunal system that protects the rights of all workers.",

Most stores currently close between 6pm and 7pm. \"We want to see whether or not people will choose Greggs instead of another fast-food outlet, a takeaway or going home and heating up lasagne in the microwave,\" Whiteside said, adding that the busiest period for Gregg's Birmingham New Street outlet was 10pm to 11pm on Fridays. \"We want to try and do the same for evening as we did in breakfast. We weren't in breakfast a few years ago and now we're No 2 [in the takeaway market].\" The bakery chain, which has over 1,900 locations across the UK, is looking to expand its evening offerings to cater to the growing demand for convenient and affordable meal options. The new extended hours will allow Greggs to capitalize on the evening rush, when many people are looking for a quick and satisfying meal after work or school.\n\nAccording to Whiteside, the company's research suggests that many customers are looking for a mid-evening meal option that is both affordable and convenient. \"We know that people are busy in the evenings, and they're looking for something quick and easy to grab and go,\" he said. \"We believe that our hot food options, such as pizza slices and sandwiches, will be a hit with customers.\"\n\nThe extended hours will also allow Greggs to compete more effectively with other fast-food chains and takeaway outlets, which often have longer hours of operation. \"We're not just competing with other bakeries, we're competing with the likes of McDonald's and KFC,\" Whiteside said. \"We want to make sure that we're offering customers a compelling reason to choose Greggs over other options.\"\n\nThe new evening hours will be rolled out gradually across the country, with several shops already trialing the extended hours. The company is also planning to introduce new menu items specifically designed for the evening market, including hot snacks and meals that can be easily grabbed and taken on the go.\n\nWhiteside is confident that the move into the takeaway dinner market will be a success, citing the popularity of the vegan sausage roll as evidence of the company's ability to innovate and adapt to changing consumer tastes. \"We're not just a bakery, we're a food-on-the-go brand,\" he said. \"We're excited to see where this new venture takes us.\"\n\nThe extended hours and new menu items are expected to be rolled out nationwide by the end of the year, with Greggs planning to continue to monitor customer feedback and adjust its offerings accordingly. As the company looks to the future, it's clear that Greggs is committed to staying ahead of the curve and meeting the changing needs of its customers.",

As it is, I have to wait another three years, and am getting by on the minimum wage earned from my part-time job as a charity administration assistant. Last year that amounted to Â£2,500. Raising the state pension age has meant real hardship for many women my age, particularly for those on their own. It is difficult to reconcile this with the frequent media reports that the over-60s are using up money and resources that younger people feel they are more entitled to. Women of my age didn't get paid maternity leave and often gave up work to be full-time parents and/or carers of the elderly. The harsh reality of being a woman in her 60s, forced to wait three more years to receive her state pension, is a stark reminder of the challenges many women in this age group face. For those who are single, like myself, the struggle is even more pronounced. The minimum wage earned from my part-time job as a charity administration assistant barely covers the essentials, leaving little room for savings or enjoyment.\n\nThe decision to raise the state pension age, while intended to address demographic changes and ensure the sustainability of the pension system, has had a disproportionate impact on women like me. We were not paid maternity leave, and many of us took time out of the workforce to care for our children or elderly relatives. As a result, we have fewer years of contributions to our pensions, making it even harder to make ends meet.\n\nThe media's portrayal of the over-60s as a drain on resources and a burden on younger generations is not only inaccurate but also damaging. It perpetuates a narrative that older people are a liability, rather than recognizing the valuable contributions they make to society. Many women in their 60s are still working, volunteering, and contributing to their communities, yet they are often marginalized and overlooked.\n\nThe government's decision to raise the state pension age has not only affected women like me but also has a broader impact on the economy. According to a recent report, the rise in state pension age has led to a significant increase in poverty among older women, with many forced to rely on means-tested benefits to survive. This not only affects their well-being but also has a ripple effect on the broader community.\n\nAs the debate around the state pension age continues, it is essential that the voices of women like me are heard. We are not asking for special treatment or handouts; we are simply seeking fairness and recognition for the sacrifices we have made. By acknowledging the challenges we face and addressing the systemic inequalities that have been perpetuated, we can work towards a more equitable and compassionate society for all.",

Britain's energy watchdog welcomed the move but called for further price reductions in the sector, while consumer experts branded SSE's price cut as \"trivial\" and a \"fig leaf\" to appease the media and politicians. Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, said: \"This is a move in the right direction, but, if the market is as competitive as suppliers claim, we would expect to see further price cuts. Ofgem referred the market to the Competition and Markets Authority because we feel competition is not bearing down fast or hard enough on consumers' bills.\" The price cut, which comes after SSE lost 300,000 customers to smaller rivals, will be introduced from 29 March and follows rival gas supplier E.ON's 5.1% reduction last week. SSE said it will save a typical gas customer on a standard tariff Â£32 a year. UK energy companies have faced repeated calls to reduce their gas prices after months of falling wholesale costs. Despite the welcome price cut, consumer experts remain skeptical about the motives behind SSE's decision. \"This 5.3% reduction is a drop in the ocean compared to the massive profits energy companies have been making,\" said Rachel Merel, a consumer advocate. \"It's a fig leaf to appease the media and politicians, but it won't make a significant difference to consumers' bills.\"\n\nThe price cut comes as SSE faces increasing pressure to reduce its prices in response to the collapse in wholesale gas prices. The company's decision to cut its prices follows a similar move by rival E.ON, which reduced its gas prices by 5.1% last week. However, some experts argue that the price cut is too little, too late.\n\n\"SSE's price cut is a token gesture that doesn't go far enough to address the concerns of consumers,\" said Tom Harrison, a energy expert. \"The company needs to do more to reduce its prices and make them more competitive in the market.\"\n\nThe move by SSE and E.ON to cut their prices is seen as a response to the increasing competition in the energy market. Smaller energy suppliers, such as Bulb and Octopus Energy, have been gaining popularity in recent years, luring customers away from the big six energy suppliers with their competitive prices and innovative business models.\n\nSSE's decision to cut its prices is also seen as a attempt to stem the tide of customer defections. The company has lost over 300,000 customers in recent months, with many switching to smaller energy suppliers.\n\nDespite the price cut, Ofgem remains concerned about the lack of competition in the energy market. The energy watchdog has referred the market to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is investigating the energy market to ensure that it is working in the best interests of consumers.\n\n\"The CMA needs to take a closer look at the energy market and ensure that it is working in the best interests of consumers,\" said Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem. \"We need to see more price cuts and more competition in the market to benefit consumers.\"\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are advised to shop around for the best energy deals and to consider switching to smaller energy suppliers. With the price cut, SSE's standard tariff will be reduced by Â£32 a year, but consumers can potentially save more by switching to a different supplier or tariff.",

Nothing drastic: cracks in the showroom walls, fallen display lights. Then came the deluge. A river of brown water and debris burst through the showroom's glass windows. As a van and two cars disappeared under the waves, the dealership's 22 employees raced up the stairs to the second floor -- and when the water rose further, to the roof. Still, in a town destroyed by a 15-foot tsunami, the Sendai Toyopet Ishinomaki dealership here reopened in just four days. \"In this part of the country, cars are a lifeline,\" Kunihiko Sudo, the dealership's manager, said this weekend. \"You need cars to get the economy moving again. We feel a sense of duty.\" Nearly seven weeks later, it is by no means business as usual. Cellphones fill in for landlines, and after-hours paperwork is completed by candlelight. Half of the dealership's makeshift office, above a now-empty showroom still stained with mud, is occupied by the family of an employee whose home was destroyed. Despite the challenges, the Sendai Toyopet Ishinomaki dealership has become a beacon of resilience and determination in the face of disaster. The staff's swift response to the tsunami's devastation is a testament to their commitment to their community and their business.\n\nAs the dealership reopened, it provided a vital lifeline to the residents of Ishinomaki, many of whom were left without transportation or access to essential goods and services. The dealership's manager, Kunihiko Sudo, emphasized the importance of cars in reviving the local economy. \"We feel a sense of duty to help our customers get back on their feet,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the road to recovery is long and arduous. The dealership's makeshift office, set up above the showroom, is a far cry from the state-of-the-art facilities that once existed. The staff has had to adapt to new challenges, including the lack of electricity and running water. Paperwork is now completed by candlelight, and communication relies on cellphones and makeshift satellite phones.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the dealership's employees remain dedicated to their work. Many have lost their homes and personal belongings, but they continue to show up to work every day, determined to help their community rebuild. The dealership's efforts have not gone unnoticed, with customers and suppliers alike expressing gratitude for their perseverance.\n\nAs the city of Ishinomaki begins the long process of rebuilding and recovery, the Sendai Toyopet Ishinomaki dealership stands as a symbol of hope and resilience. Its reopening is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome even the most daunting challenges, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way forward.",

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jim Kerstetter, deputy technology editor in San Francisco, discussed the tech he's using. What tech tools do you rely on the most for your job, and what could be better about them? This will probably surprise no one, but you don't need that many technology tools to be a good editor. If you have a computer, a not-too-painful-to-use publishing system, decent internet access and a phone, you're pretty much all set. But my internet access at home could be more reliable. Yes, Comcast, you cause angst. So you keep tech use to a minimum. What's your philosophy for how people should use tech for work? Steve Jobs was right: Simplicity is harder than complexity. The best products are almost always the easiest to use. As a deputy technology editor, Jim Kerstetter is constantly on the lookout for tools that make his job easier, without sacrificing simplicity. For him, the key is finding products that are intuitive and easy to use, even for those who may not be tech-savvy.\n\n\"I think a lot of people get intimidated by technology, and that's a shame,\" Kerstetter said. \"I believe that technology should be a tool to help people do their jobs better, not a barrier that gets in the way.\"\n\nKerstetter relies heavily on his computer and phone for work, using them to research stories, write articles, and communicate with colleagues.

        "Text": "Human cells resist gene editing by turning on defenses against cancer, ceasing reproduction and sometimes dying, two teams of scientists have found. The findings, reported in the journal Nature Medicine, at first appeared to cast doubt on the viability of the most widely used form of gene editing, known as Crispr-Cas9 or simply Crispr, sending the stocks of some biotech companies into decline on Monday. Crispr Therapeutics fell by 13 percent shortly after the scientists' announcement. Intellia Therapeutics dipped, too, as did Editas Medicine. All three are developing medical treatments based on Crispr. But the scientists who published the research say that Crispr remains a promising technology, if a bit more difficult than had been known. \"The reactions have been exaggerated,\" said Jussi Taipale, a biochemist at the University of Cambridge and an author of one of two papers published Monday. The findings underscore the need for more research into the safety of Crispr, he said, but they don't spell its doom. \"This is not something that should stop research on Crispr therapies,\" he said. \"I think it's almost the other way -- we should put more effort into such things.\" Crispr has stirred strong feelings ever since it came to light as a gene-editing technology five years ago. Already, it's a mainstay in the scientific tool kit. The possibilities have led to speculations about altering the human race and bringing extinct species back to life. Crispr's pioneers have already won a slew of prizes, and titanic battles over patent rights to the technology have begun. The cell then repairs the two loose ends. If scientists add another piece of DNA, the cell may stitch it into the place where the excised gene once sat. Recently, Dr. Taipale and his colleagues set out to study cancer. The researchers used a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, to investigate how human cells respond to gene editing. They found that when cells are edited with CRISPR-Cas9, they activate a range of cellular defense mechanisms to prevent the introduction of foreign DNA.\n\nIn some cases, the cells even ceased to divide and reproduce, effectively putting a halt to the editing process. In other cases, the cells underwent programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which is a normal process that helps to eliminate damaged or abnormal cells from the body.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the cells' response to gene editing was highly variable, with some cells being more resistant to editing than others. This variability was attributed to differences in the cells' epigenetic profiles, which are chemical modifications that can affect gene expression without actually changing the DNA sequence.\n\nDr. Taipale and his colleagues believe that their findings have important implications for the development of CRISPR-Cas9 therapies. While the technology is still in its early stages, it has the potential to be used to treat a wide range of genetic disorders, including sickle cell anemia, muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease.\n\nHowever, the researchers also emphasize that the development of CRISPR-Cas9 therapies will require careful consideration of the potential risks and challenges associated with the technology. This includes the need to ensure that the edited cells are safe and effective, and that the editing process does not introduce unintended mutations or other adverse effects.\n\nIn light of their findings, Dr. Taipale and his colleagues are calling for more research into the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 therapies. They believe that this research will be crucial in determining whether the technology is ready for widespread use in humans.\n\n\"We need to be cautious and thoughtful in our approach to developing CRISPR-Cas9 therapies,\" said Dr. Taipale. \"We need to make sure that we understand the potential risks and challenges associated with the technology, and that we take steps to mitigate those risks.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Dr. Taipale remains optimistic about the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 to revolutionize the treatment of genetic disorders. He believes that the technology has the potential to be a game-changer, and that it could ultimately lead to the development of new and more effective treatments for a wide range of diseases.\n\n\"We are at the beginning of a new era in gene editing,\" said Dr. Taipale. \"We need to be careful and thoughtful in our approach, but we also need to be bold and ambitious. The potential rewards are too great to ignore.\"",

While most of the eight-tonne spacecraft is expected to burn up as it plummets through the atmosphere, there is a chance some of it will survive all the way down to the surface. Should I be worried? No. The chances of being hit by part of the space station are basically zero. About 70% of the Earth is covered with water and most of the rest of it is sparsely populated. If any of the space station does reach the surface, it is incredibly unlikely it will hit any person, let alone you. According to NASA, the likelihood of a piece of the space station landing on a person is approximately 1 in 1.4 trillion. This is because the majority of the Earth's surface is comprised of vast oceans, with only a small percentage of it being inhabited by humans.\n\nWhile the chances of being hit by a piece of the space station are extremely low, it's still important to note that there are some areas that are more susceptible to impact. These include densely populated cities, military bases, and areas with high levels of human activity.\n\nHowever, experts have assured the public that there is no need for widespread panic or concern. The Chinese space agency, CNSA, has been tracking the space station's trajectory and has predicted that it will likely burn up completely in the atmosphere, with only small fragments potentially surviving to reach the ground.\n\nThe CNSA has also released a statement reassuring the public that the space station is not carrying any hazardous materials or contaminants that could pose a risk to human health or the environment.\n\nIn the event that a piece of the space station does land on Earth, it is unlikely to cause any significant damage or harm. The space station is primarily made of metal and other materials that are not explosive or toxic, and it is not designed to cause harm to humans or the environment.\n\nAs the space station continues to fall towards Earth, scientists and astronomers are eagerly monitoring its trajectory, providing updates and reassurances to the public. The incident serves as a reminder of the vastness and complexity of space, and the importance of continued exploration and research into the mysteries of the universe.\n\nIn the meantime, residents in areas where the space station is expected to land are advised to remain calm and carry on with their daily activities as usual. The chances of being hit by a piece of the space station are extremely low, and the risks associated with it are minimal.",

If the Times fails, then newspaper companies everywhere can start to despair. Which makes its latest health check (from an officially appointed team of its own journalists) seem very important. Three years ago, a first \"innovation\" team report plumped for digital integration and chose subscriptions â€“ paywalls rather than advertising free-for-alls â€“ as the chosen survival route. The latest report, released earlier this week, provides a candid assessment of the New York Times' digital transformation efforts. The team of journalists, led by NYT's own media columnist, Ken Doctor, spent several months reviewing the paper's digital strategy, interviewing top executives, and analyzing financial data.\n\nAccording to the report, the New York Times has made significant progress in its transition to digital. The paper's digital subscriptions have grown steadily, with over 5 million subscribers worldwide, a 30% increase from the previous year. The report credits the paper's focus on quality journalism, its ability to adapt to changing reader habits, and its willingness to experiment with new formats and platforms for this success.\n\nHowever, the report also highlights several challenges that the New York Times still faces. Despite its digital growth, the paper's overall revenue remains stagnant, with a significant decline in print advertising revenue offsetting gains from digital subscriptions. The report notes that the paper's digital advertising revenue, while growing, is still a fraction of its print advertising revenue.\n\nThe report also identifies areas where the New York Times can improve. It recommends that the paper invest more in its digital infrastructure, including its website and mobile apps, to improve the user experience and increase engagement. Additionally, the report suggests that the paper should expand its digital offerings, including podcasts, video content, and live events, to attract new readers and increase loyalty among existing subscribers.\n\nThe report's findings and recommendations have sparked a lively debate among industry observers and journalists. Some have praised the New York Times' commitment to quality journalism and its willingness to experiment with new formats and platforms. Others have criticized the paper's slow pace of innovation and its failure to fully adapt to the changing media landscape.\n\nRegardless of the debate, the report's findings are a clear indication that the New York Times is not immune to the challenges facing the newspaper industry.

Everything must go,\" and: \"Save up to 80%\" in the windows below the severe grey concrete facade, earlier in the day the shop had been teeming with people looking for last-minute bargains. They rifled through the dozen or so clothes rails that were left, with most of the store stripped bare. Babywear cost Â£1 an item; T-shirts went for Â£3, down from Â£10; denim trousers were discounted to Â£9 from Â£30; while a motley collection of women's shoes, dresses, tops and skirts were priced at Â£7. All store fixtures, fittings and equipment such as rails and shelves were also for sale, all priced at Â£25 (originally Â£50) an item. Ella Luma, who said she was a regular BHS shopper, had popped in with her baby to pick up a bargain, but left empty-handed. As the crowds dispersed and the last of the bargain hunters left the store, the reality of the situation began to sink in. The iconic department store, which had been a staple on Wood Green's high street for over four decades, was no more. The closure of BHS marked the end of an era, leaving a void that would be difficult to fill.\n\nLocal residents and business owners alike expressed concern about the impact the closure would have on the community. \"It's a tragedy,\" said Maria Rodriguez, owner of the nearby cafÃ©. \"BHS was a hub of activity, and its absence will be deeply felt. I'm worried about the effect it will have on our footfall and, ultimately, our businesses.\"\n\nThe store's closure was not unexpected, however. BHS had been struggling financially for some time, and its parent company, Dominic Chappell, had been seeking a buyer. Despite efforts to rebrand and revamp the store, it ultimately proved too late, and the decision was made to shut its doors.\n\nAs the news of the closure spread, social media was filled with tributes to the beloved store. Many took to Twitter to share their favorite memories of shopping at BHS, while others expressed sadness at the loss of a piece of their childhood.\n\nFor some, the closure of BHS was more than just a business decision â€“ it was a nostalgic reminder of a bygone era. \"I grew up shopping at BHS with my mum,\" said Sarah Taylor, a local resident. \"It's a part of my childhood, and I'll miss it dearly.\"\n\nAs the dust settles on the closure of BHS, the community is left to wonder what the future holds for the high street. While some may see the closure as an opportunity for new businesses to emerge, others are concerned about the impact it will have on the local economy.\n\nFor now, the once-thriving store stands empty, its fate uncertain. As the sign in the window reads, \"Everything must go,\" it's clear that the legacy of BHS will live on, even as the store itself disappears into the past.",

When Is a Burrito More Than Just a Burrito? When It's a Lifestyle\n\nEarlier this summer, Chipotle's new chief marketing officer outlined a lofty vision for the burrito-and-taco chain and the feelings it could one day evoke in consumers. \"Our ultimate marketing mission is to make Chipotle not just a food brand but a purpose-driven lifestyle brand,\" the executive, Christopher Brandt, said on an earnings call. To achieve this ambitious goal, Chipotle is shifting its marketing strategy to focus on creating a sense of community and shared values among its customers. The company is introducing a new brand platform, \"Food With Integrity,\" which emphasizes its commitment to using high-quality, sustainably sourced ingredients and supporting local farmers.\n\nAt the heart of this platform is a new advertising campaign, which features real customers sharing their personal stories about how Chipotle's food has brought them together with friends and family. The ads aim to show that Chipotle's burritos and tacos are more than just a meal, but a symbol of connection and shared values.\n\n\"We're not just trying to sell food, we're trying to sell a sense of belonging,\" said Brandt. \"We want people to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves when they eat at Chipotle.\"\n\nTo further reinforce this message, Chipotle is also partnering with social media influencers and content creators who embody the brand's values of sustainability and community. The company is working with influencers who are passionate about environmental issues and social justice, and who will share their own stories and experiences with Chipotle's food and values.\n\nIn addition, Chipotle is launching a new loyalty program, which rewards customers for their repeat business and encourages them to share their experiences with friends and family. The program will also feature special offers and discounts for customers who participate in the brand's social media campaigns and share their own stories about Chipotle.\n\nThe ultimate goal of these efforts is to create a sense of loyalty and advocacy among Chipotle's customers, so that they become brand ambassadors who spread the word about the company's values and mission. By doing so, Chipotle hopes to build a community of like-minded individuals who share its passion for food, sustainability, and social responsibility.\n\n\"We want to create a brand that people want to be a part of, that they want to wear as a badge,\" said Brandt. \"We're not just trying to sell food, we're trying to create a movement.\"",

Trump's election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years, but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised, according to an account of the Fed's most recent meeting in mid-December. That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates. For now, however, Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next, the account said. \"While the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes, the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline,\" Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes. \"Any real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy.\" At the December meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008, citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment. The Fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year, but the account published on Wednesday -- after a standard three-week delay -- described the final decision as uncontroversial. Officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next. Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy, including tax cuts and spending increases, reductions in regulation, and restrictions on trade and immigration. The Fed's cautious approach comes as the economy is showing signs of strength, with GDP growth accelerating to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2016, up from 1.4% in the previous quarter. However, officials are also concerned about the potential risks of a strong fiscal stimulus, including inflation and asset bubbles.\n\n\"We're not going to react to every tweet or every comment from the administration,\" said a Fed official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We're going to wait and see what the actual policies are and how they affect the economy.\"\n\nThe Fed's decision to raise interest rates in December was seen as a nod to the economy's resilience, but officials are still grappling with the uncertainty surrounding Mr. Trump's plans.\n\n\"Until we have more clarity on the fiscal policy, it's hard to make a judgment about the impact on the economy,\" said another Fed official. \"We're going to continue to monitor the data and adjust our policy as needed.\"\n\nThe Fed's decision to raise interest rates in December was also seen as a sign of confidence in the economy's ability to withstand higher borrowing costs.

For more than a decade, HM Revenue & Customs has struggled to respond swiftly to families' changing circumstances, resulting in hundreds of thousands of people unwittingly owing money after being overpaid working tax credit and child tax credit. In the year to June 2016, Citizens Advice helped people with 40,000 issues relating to tax credit overpayments, a 6% increase on the previous year. In 2014, it was reported that the government was pursuing more than 4.7m cases of overpaid tax credits, amounting to total debts of Â£1.6bn, and using debt collectors to do so. Since then, it seems to have continued to take a heavy-handed approach. In the past year, Citizens Advice has seen a 32% increase in the number of issues related to the recovery of tax-credit overpayments, including the involvement of debt collectors. In some cases, debt-collection agencies hold inaccurate information from HMRC and are chasing money from individuals who already been making payments via direct debit. Anna Mee, 38, from Leicestershire spent hours on the phone trying to find out why she was being chased by a debt collector when she had been paying a direct debit to HMRC for more than a year, to clear overpayments in working tax credit and child tax credit. The mother of three, who works in catering, said: \"In the tax year 2014-15 I started the year as a single mum, unemployed. \"...and by the end of the year, I had started a new job and was earning a steady income. But despite this change in my circumstances, I was still being chased for overpaid tax credits. I was getting anxious and stressed, and it was affecting my mental health. I felt like I was being treated unfairly, and that HMRC wasn't taking my situation into account.\"\n\nAnna's experience is not unique. Citizens Advice has seen a significant increase in cases of tax credit overpayments, with many people facing similar struggles. The charity has reported that debt collectors are often using aggressive tactics to recover debts, including sending threatening letters and making phone calls.\n\n\"This is a major problem,\" said a spokesperson for Citizens Advice. \"People are being chased for debts they don't owe, and it's causing a lot of stress and anxiety. We're seeing people who are already vulnerable, such as those on low incomes or with mental health issues, being pushed to the brink by these debt collection agencies.\"\n\nThe issue is not limited to individuals. Businesses are also being affected, with some reporting that they are being targeted by debt collectors for alleged overpayments. This can have a significant impact on their cash flow and ability to operate.\n\n\"It's like they're trying to break us,\" said Sarah Johnson, owner of a small cafe in London. \"We're a small business, and we can't afford to be chased for debts we don't owe. It's causing us a lot of stress and uncertainty, and we're worried about our future.\"\n\nThe government has come under fire for its handling of tax credit overpayments, with many critics arguing that the system is flawed and needs to be reformed. In response to the criticism, HMRC has announced plans to introduce new measures to improve the way it handles overpayments, including the use of more accurate data and more flexible repayment plans.\n\nBut for many people, the damage has already been done. Anna, for example, has been left feeling anxious and stressed, and is still trying to clear her debt. She is not alone, and the issue of tax credit overpayments remains a major problem for many families and businesses across the country.",

        "Text": "It's every parent's worst nightmare: there's a fire in the house, the alarms are beeping, but the children are sleeping on oblivious. Now scientists say they have found a better way to rouse slumbering youngsters. Researchers in the US have discovered that playing a child a recording of their mother's voice is about three times more likely to wake them than a traditional alarm. What's more, it does so faster and is linked to a quicker escape. \"[High pitched beeping] alarms don't wake up children well at all under about 12 years of age,\" said Dr Gary Smith, a co-author of the research from the Nationwide Children's hospital in Ohio, although he said at present it is not known why. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from over 1,000 children aged between 3 and 12 who were exposed to either a traditional alarm or a recording of their mother's voice during a simulated fire drill. The results showed that the children who heard their mother's voice woke up significantly faster than those who heard the traditional alarm, with an average wake-up time of 12 seconds compared to 36 seconds.\n\nThe researchers also found that the children who heard their mother's voice were more likely to respond to the alarm and take action to escape the simulated fire scenario. In contrast, the children who heard the traditional alarm were more likely to roll over and go back to sleep.\n\nDr. Smith explained that the findings suggest that traditional alarms may not be effective in waking up young children, as they are not designed to be heard by children's ears. \"Alarms are designed for adults, and they're not very effective for children,\" he said. \"Children's ears are more sensitive to high-pitched sounds, but traditional alarms are not designed to produce those sounds.\"\n\nThe researchers believe that the use of a mother's voice could be a more effective way to wake up children in the event of a real fire. \"Mothers' voices are very distinctive and are often the most recognizable sound to young children,\" said Dr. Smith. \"Using a mother's voice could be a more effective way to wake up children and get them to safety.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for fire safety and emergency preparedness. \"This research highlights the need for more effective ways to wake up children in the event of a fire,\" said Dr. Smith. \"We need to find ways to make sure that children are woken up quickly and effectively in the event of an emergency.\"\n\nThe researchers are now working to develop a device that uses a mother's voice to wake up children in the event of a fire. The device would be designed to be easy to use and would be able to be installed in homes and schools.\n\nIn the meantime, parents can take steps to make sure that their children are prepared for a fire emergency. Dr. Smith recommends that parents practice fire drills with their children and make sure that they have a plan in place in case of an emergency. \"The most important thing is to make sure that children know what to do in the event of a fire,\" he said. \"Practice makes perfect, and the more prepared children are, the safer they will be.\"",

Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviews the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Netflix's big deal and the end of cable Netflix signed Ryan Murphy, the hitmaking producer behind \"Glee\" and the \"American Crime Story\" and \"American Horror Story\" anthology series, to a huge deal. An absolutely gigantic one, to be exact -- roughly $300 million over five years, besting even the $100 million deal that Netflix made with Shonda Rhimes last year. Also, YouTube announced an expansion of its streaming TV service, adding several networks from Turner networks but also increasing its price. Now you can get its full lineup of channels streamed online for $40 per month, up from $35; that brings it to price parity with other streaming TV services, including Hulu's. All this got me wondering: What's the point of cable TV anymore? As the streaming wars continue to intensify, it's becoming increasingly clear that traditional cable TV is struggling to keep up. With Netflix and other streaming services offering a vast array of original content, including hit shows and movies, it's no wonder that many viewers are opting to cut the cord and switch to streaming.\n\nBut it's not just the cord cutters who are missing out on television's biggest shows. Cable viewers, too, are being left behind. With the majority of new content being produced exclusively for streaming services, cable TV is struggling to keep up with the demand for fresh and exciting programming.\n\nTake, for example, the case of Ryan Murphy, the hitmaking producer behind \"Glee\" and the \"American Crime Story\" and \"American Horror Story\" anthology series. His deal with Netflix is a whopping $300 million over five years, making him one of the highest-paid producers in the industry. It's a move that's sure to bring in a slew of new and exciting content to the streaming service, and one that's likely to leave cable viewers green with envy.\n\nBut it's not just Netflix that's making big moves. YouTube, too, is expanding its streaming TV service, adding several networks from Turner networks to its lineup. While the price increase to $40 per month may be a turn-off for some, it's a move that's likely to bring the service more in line with its competitors.\n\nSo what does this mean for cable TV? It's clear that the writing is on the wall. With more and more viewers opting for streaming services, cable TV is struggling to keep up. And with the likes of Netflix and YouTube making big moves to attract top talent and produce exclusive content, it's hard to see how cable TV can compete.\n\nIt's a sad state of affairs for cable TV, which was once the go-to source for entertainment. But with the rise of streaming services, it's clear that the future of television is online. And for those who are willing to adapt, the possibilities are endless.",

        "Text": "Too little sleep may bring on a form of the marijuana \"munchies\", say scientists who found that sleep-deprived people craved crisps, sweets and biscuits far more than healthier foods. The US researchers believe that skimping on sleep alters brain chemicals in much the same way as the hunger-boosting ingredient in cannabis, which has long propped up snack sales at 24-hour convenience stores. After several nights of poor sleep, healthy volunteers who took part in the study reached for snacks containing more calories - and nearly twice as much fat - than ones they favoured after sleeping well for the same period, the scientists say. When sleepy, the participants had terrible trouble resisting the snacks, even when they were full, said Erin Hanlon, who led the study at the University of Chicago. Research has shown time and again that sleep loss raises the risk of obesity, but the reasons are complex and unclear. Insufficient sleep disrupts hormones that govern appetite and satiety. The study, published in the journal Sleep, suggests that the brain's reward system is affected by sleep deprivation, leading to an increased desire for high-calorie, high-fat foods. This is similar to the way in which the psychoactive compound THC in cannabis affects the brain, leading to the characteristic \"munchies\" effect.\n\nThe researchers recruited 14 healthy adults and asked them to spend two nights sleeping normally, and then two nights sleeping only four hours a night. After each night's sleep, the participants were given a choice of snacks to eat, including healthy options such as fruits and vegetables, as well as less healthy options like chips and cookies.\n\nThe results showed that after the sleep-deprived nights, the participants preferred snacks that were higher in calories and fat, and lower in nutrients. They also reported feeling hungrier and more tired, even after eating.\n\n\"This study suggests that sleep plays a critical role in regulating food cravings and appetite,\" said Dr. Hanlon. \"When we're well-rested, our brains are better able to regulate our food intake and make healthier choices. But when we're sleep-deprived, our brains are more susceptible to the allure of unhealthy snacks.\"\n\nThe findings have important implications for public health, particularly in light of the growing obesity epidemic. According to the World Health Organization, more than one-third of adults worldwide are obese, and sleep deprivation is a common problem that can contribute to this issue.\n\nThe study's authors note that the results are not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship, but rather a correlation between sleep deprivation and increased food cravings. However, they suggest that improving sleep quality could be an important strategy for reducing the risk of obesity and related health problems.\n\nIn the meantime, the researchers are planning further studies to explore the mechanisms behind the sleep-munchies connection and to develop strategies for helping people make healthier food choices when they're feeling tired and hungry.",

A Chevron commercial about the efficacy of drones gets a shot of adrenaline from that bane of piano students, Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee.\" Tchaikovsky's \"1812\" Overture, once used to sell Quaker puffed cereal, is now featured in an ad for Myrbetriq, a drug for treating an overactive bladder. Meanwhile, a Geico ad makes its point with an assist from Bach's \"Brandenburg\" Concerto No. 3 -- and a clueless percussionist shredding a triangle solo. Classical music has long had a place in commercials. The Western canon's aura makes it just the thing for pitching luxury brands like the Lincoln Motor Company, whose 2017 holiday ad unfolded over a track of Shostakovich's swoony Waltz No. 2. But what's behind the trend of classical music in commercials? Is it simply a matter of prestige, or is there something more to it? According to music licensing experts, the appeal of classical music lies in its versatility and emotional resonance.\n\n\"Classical music has a unique ability to evoke feelings and emotions without being too on-the-nose,\" says Sarah Jenkins, a music supervisor who has worked on numerous commercials. \"It's a way to add depth and sophistication to a brand's message without being too heavy-handed.\"\n\nJenkins notes that classical music is also a great way to add a sense of timelessness to a commercial. \"Many people associate classical music with refinement and culture, so it's a great way to make a brand seem more upscale and sophisticated,\" she says.\n\nBut classical music is also a great way to add a sense of humor to a commercial. Take the Geico ad, for example. The use of Bach's \"Brandenburg\" Concerto No. 3, combined with the clueless percussionist shredding a triangle solo, adds a level of absurdity and playfulness to the ad that might not have been possible with a more modern soundtrack.\n\n\"It's all about finding the right balance,\" says Jenkins. \"You want to use classical music in a way that's respectful to the music, but also in a way that serves the commercial and makes it memorable.\"\n\nFor brands looking to use classical music in their commercials, there are a number of options available. Many music licensing companies specialize in classical music, and offer a wide range of tracks from famous composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin.\n\nBrands can also commission original music from classical composers, which can be a great way to make their commercial stand out. For example, the Lincoln Motor Company commissioned a custom track from composer Dustin O'Halloran for their 2017 holiday ad.\n\n\"Working with a classical composer was a great way to add a level of sophistication and elegance to the ad,\" says Lincoln's marketing director, Sarah Smith. \"It's a way to make the brand seem more refined and cultured, and to connect with our target audience on a deeper level.\"\n\nIn the end, the use of classical music in commercials is all about finding the right balance between art and commerce. When done well, it can be a powerful way to make a brand stand out and connect with its audience. And who knows, maybe one day we'll see a commercial that uses a track from a lesser-known composer, like AntonÃ­n DvoÅ™Ã¡k or BedÅ™ich Smetana. A music lover can dream, right?",

        "Text": "The schools regulator Ofsted has identified 300 schools with high levels of so-called off-rolling, where pupils disappear from the school register just before GCSEs. It has found that more than 19,000 pupils who were in year 10 in 2016 vanished from the school roll by the start of year 11, the year when pupils sit their GCSEs. While many of those pupils moved to new schools and reappeared on roll elsewhere, around half disappeared without trace, raising concerns that a number will have dropped out of education altogether. Off-rolling has become an issue of growing concern for Ofsted amid allegations that some schools are playing the system and getting rid of students who might do badly in their GCSEs and compromise the school's performance in league tables. Ofsted analysis revealed that pupils with special educational needs (SEN) are particularly vulnerable. The regulator's findings have sparked widespread criticism, with many accusing schools of prioritizing their league table positions over the well-being and education of their students. \"It's shocking that schools are willing to sacrifice the futures of vulnerable pupils like those with special educational needs just to boost their statistics,\" said Sarah Jones, a mother of a child with SEN who was off-rolled from her school. \"My child was doing well, but the school told me they couldn't accommodate her needs anymore, and that was it. She was just gone from the roll.\"\n\nOfsted's analysis revealed that pupils with SEN are more than twice as likely to be off-rolled than their peers without special needs. The regulator has called on schools to take immediate action to address the issue, including providing better support for pupils with SEN and ensuring that all pupils are treated equally.\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns about the long-term impact on the education system as a whole. \"Off-rolling is not just a problem for individual schools, it's a problem for the entire system,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, an education expert at the University of Cambridge. \"If we allow schools to continue to manipulate their rolls like this, it will undermine trust in the system and create a culture of dishonesty.\"\n\nThe government has promised to take action to address the issue, but critics argue that more needs to be done to prevent schools from off-rolling pupils in the first place. \"The government's response has been too slow and too weak,\" said Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner. \"We need to see tougher sanctions for schools that engage in off-rolling and more support for schools that are struggling to accommodate all pupils.\"\n\nIn the meantime, parents and pupils are left to pick up the pieces. For those who have been affected by off-rolling, the consequences can be devastating. \"I was devastated when my son was off-rolled,\" said Sarah Smith, a mother who spoke to the BBC. \"He was a bright kid, but the school just didn't want him anymore. He's now struggling to get back into education and is feeling lost and alone.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: off-rolling is a problem that needs to be addressed urgently. It's time for schools, the government, and society as a whole to take responsibility for ensuring that all pupils receive the education they deserve, regardless of their background or abilities.",

Teachers' jobs would not be lost as they would move from one paymaster to another when transferring to the state system, nor would this put an extra burden on the state if the taxation system was made more progressive so that school fees were, in effect, paid then into state school funding. Research has shown that simply attending a private school enhances prospects for entry to top universities and jobs, regardless of innate ability. It is known that state school university entrants with similar A-level grades to private school entrants tend to perform better, perhaps because the privately schooled have to some extent \"peaked out\" during their privileged school years. However, proponents of independent schools argue that the abolition of these institutions would lead to a decline in academic standards and a loss of diversity in the education system. They claim that private schools provide a unique environment that fosters innovation, creativity, and critical thinking, which are essential skills for success in the modern economy.\n\nProponents of independent schools also point out that the abolition of these institutions would disproportionately affect certain groups of students, such as those from low-income families who may not have access to the same opportunities as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. They argue that the removal of independent schools would further exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, rather than addressing them.\n\nMoreover, some argue that the abolition of independent schools would lead to a brain drain, as talented students and teachers would be attracted to other countries that offer a more diverse range of educational options. This could have significant implications for the UK's economy and its ability to compete globally.\n\nOn the other hand, supporters of the abolition of independent schools argue that the current system is unfair and perpetuates social and economic inequalities. They point out that the majority of students attend state schools, which often struggle to provide the same level of resources and opportunities as private schools. They argue that the abolition of independent schools would create a more level playing field, allowing all students to have access to the same quality of education, regardless of their background or financial situation.\n\nThe debate surrounding the abolition of independent schools is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. While some argue that the abolition of these institutions would lead to a decline in academic standards and a loss of diversity in the education system, others argue that the current system is unfair and perpetuates social and economic inequalities. Ultimately, the decision to abolish independent schools will depend on the values and priorities of society, as well as the ability of policymakers to find a solution that balances the needs of all stakeholders.",

        "Text": "LOS ANGELES -- On Monday night, as a stunned Hollywood scrambled to understand why Disney's heir apparent, Thomas O. Staggs, had abruptly decided to step down, the company held a lavish premiere for its \"Jungle Book\" movie. A forest of ferns, palm trees and flowering plants stretched down Hollywood Boulevard. A woodland soundtrack (gurgling water, chirping crickets) and flickering tiki torches deepened the fantasy. And standing as sentry at the end of the red carpet was Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive and chairman, as sturdy, composed and tan as ever. \"Ask me anything about the movie,\" he said to a reporter, pre-empting a question about succession and flashing a smile. That on-with-the-show moment highlighted the box in which Disney now sits. The conglomerate has in Mr. Iger a seasoned, charismatic leader who, even on one of his more tumultuous days, can calmly focus the company on the future. Since he took over in 2005, Mr. Iger has led Disney on a numbing series of record quarterly results, even in the face of economic downturns, the occasional horrendous movie write-off and changing consumer habits that have dented ESPN, its primary profit engine. But there is a downside: Nobody can seemingly measure up, complicating succession at a company that has a terrible track record on that front. Mr. Iger has been so successful that the obvious internal candidate to succeed him, the well-regarded Mr. Staggs, could not secure the unqualified backing of the Disney board. The executive whom Mr. Staggs beat to become heir apparent, James A. Rasulo, has left Disney. As the \"Jungle Book\" premiere unfolded, it was clear that Disney's focus remained on its future, despite the sudden departure of Thomas O. Staggs. The company's executives and talent mingled under the stars, with Iger's presence a reassuring constant. The CEO's calm demeanor and commitment to the company's vision have been a hallmark of his tenure, and it seemed that he was determined to keep the spotlight on Disney's upcoming projects rather than the succession drama.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, the situation was more complex. Staggs' departure had sent shockwaves through the company, with many insiders wondering what had led to his sudden decision to step down. Sources close to the matter revealed that Staggs had been struggling to win over the Disney board, which had grown increasingly skeptical of his ability to lead the company in the long term.\n\nDespite his impressive track record, Staggs was seen as a compromise candidate, and his lack of charisma and leadership style had raised concerns among some board members. The situation was further complicated by the departure of James A. Rasulo, who had been the initial favorite to succeed Iger.\n\nAs the search for a new heir apparent began, Disney's board was faced with a daunting task. The company's success had been built on Iger's vision and leadership, and finding someone who could replicate his achievements would be a significant challenge. The board's decision to pass over Staggs, despite his impressive credentials, had sent a clear message: Disney was looking for a leader who could bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table.\n\nIn the meantime, Iger remained focused on the company's future, pouring his energy into the development of new projects and the expansion of Disney's global reach. The \"Jungle Book\" premiere was a testament to his commitment to the company's creative endeavors, and the success of the movie would be a crucial factor in determining Disney's future trajectory.\n\nAs the night wore on, the stars of the movie, including Neel Sethi and Bill Murray, mingled with the A-list crowd, and the excitement around the film was palpable. But beneath the glamour and glitz, the question on everyone's mind was: what's next for Disney, and who will lead the company into its next chapter? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain â€“ Robert A. Iger will remain at the helm, guiding the company through the uncertainty and ensuring that Disney's legacy continues to thrive.",

Kaitlan Collins, a White House correspondent for CNN, said she was called into the West Wing and chastised by administration officials for what they deemed \"inappropriate\" questions that she had asked of Mr. Trump during an Oval Office photo opportunity earlier in the day. The officials -- Bill Shine, the newly appointed deputy chief of staff, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary -- then informed Ms. Collins that they would not allow her to attend Mr. Trump's public remarks with the president of the European Commission, an event that was otherwise open to the media. \"They did not like the questions I asked President Trump about the news of the day,\" Ms. Collins said. It is standard practice for reporters to ask questions of Mr. Trump at the end of photo ops, where the president often engages at length even as his aides try to shuffle the reporters from the scene. On Wednesday, Ms. Collins -- who attended as a pool reporter, representing the major television networks -- asked Mr. Trump several times if he had concerns about the loyalty of his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, whom the president had tweeted about on Wednesday morning. And then: \"Mr. President, are you worried about what Michael Cohen is about to say to the prosecutors?\" The president has routinely castigated journalists, describing media outlets he deems \"fake news\" as \"the enemy of the people.\" The move to bar Collins from attending the event was widely condemned by news organizations, with many criticizing the administration's actions as an attempt to silence the press and stifle freedom of the press.\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence CNN and other news organizations from asking tough questions of this administration,\" said CNN's president, Jeff Zucker, in a statement. \"We will not be deterred from our commitment to reporting the news and holding those in power accountable.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association, which represents journalists who cover the White House, also weighed in, calling the move \"unprecedented\" and \"an attack on the free press.\"\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to silence a journalist who was simply doing her job,\" said the association's president, Olivier Knox. \"We will not stand idly by as the administration tries to stifle the free flow of information to the American people.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread concern about the state of the press in the United States, with many arguing that the administration's actions are eroding the norms of press coverage and undermining the public's right to know.\n\n\"This is a dark day for American journalism,\" said Tom Johnson, a former CNN executive and longtime media critic. \"The White House is sending a clear message that it will not tolerate any criticism or scrutiny, and that journalists who dare to ask tough questions will be punished.\"\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the role of the White House press corps in holding the administration accountable, and whether the corps is doing enough to push back against the administration's attacks on the press.\n\n\"It's clear that the White House is trying to intimidate and silence the press, but it's up to us as journalists to stand up for our rights and continue to do our job,\" said Collins, who was visibly shaken by the incident. \"We will not be silenced or intimidated by this administration's bullying tactics.\"\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, many are left wondering what the implications will be for the future of press coverage in the United States. Will the administration's actions have a chilling effect on journalists, leading to a more timid and less critical press corps? Or will the press corps continue to push back against the administration's attacks, refusing to be silenced or intimidated?\n\nOnly time will tell, but one thing is clear: the incident has sparked a national conversation about the importance of a free and independent press, and the need for journalists to continue to hold those in power accountable.",

        "Text": "Reading the Russell Group of universities' defence, you might believe there was \"nothing to see here\" when it comes to the treatment of university lecturers (Second-class pay and prospects: university teaching staff complain of two-tier system, 22 August). Yet over half (53%) of teaching-only staff in our universities are on fixed-term contracts, many of them less than a year in length, with no real prospect of building a career. This is not counting the army of academics who troop in every term on zero-hours contracts to deliver classes. If you're starting university this year, it's a pretty safe bet that you will quickly find yourself being taught by one of these people. The precarious nature of university lecturers' employment has raised concerns about the quality of education being provided to students. Critics argue that the reliance on fixed-term and zero-hours contracts undermines the stability and continuity of academic programs, potentially compromising the learning experience.\n\nAccording to the University and College Union (UCU), the widespread use of precarious contracts is a result of years of underfunding and mismanagement by the government. \"The Russell Group's attempts to downplay the issue are disingenuous,\" said a UCU spokesperson. \"The reality is that universities are struggling to make ends meet, and the easiest way to cut costs is to hire staff on temporary contracts.\"\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning for students who may not even be aware of the precarious nature of their lecturers' employment. \"As a student, you expect your teachers to be experts in their field and to be able to devote their full attention to your education,\" said Emily Wilson, a first-year student at the University of Manchester. \"But when you find out that your lecturer is only on a fixed-term contract, it's hard not to wonder if they're going to be around next semester.\"\n\nThe issue is not limited to teaching-only staff. Many researchers and academics are also employed on precarious contracts, which can hinder the progress of their research and the university's reputation. \"As a researcher, you need to be able to plan for the long-term,\" said Dr. Sarah Taylor, a researcher at the University of Cambridge. \"But when you're on a fixed-term contract, you're constantly worried about being laid off or having your funding cut off. It's a huge distraction and can really impact the quality of your work.\"\n\nThe Russell Group has defended its use of precarious contracts, citing the need to adapt to changing student demand and market conditions. However, critics argue that this is just a smokescreen for the real issue â€“ the lack of funding and support for universities.\n\nAs the academic year gets underway, students and staff are calling for change. The UCU is pushing for universities to adopt fairer employment practices, including secure contracts and better pay and benefits. Students are also demanding more transparency and accountability from their institutions.\n\nIn the meantime, students and staff alike are left to wonder what the future holds for the university sector. Will the trend towards precarious employment continue, or will universities find a way to prioritize the well-being and stability of their staff? Only time will tell.",

And sticking with the little grey cells, though we will never know if they told whoppers to each other, the discovery of the first fossilised dinosaur brain tissue is certainly exciting. The discovery of the first fossilised dinosaur brain tissue is a groundbreaking find that has sent shockwaves through the scientific community. According to Dr. Emma Taylor, the lead researcher on the project, the fossilised brain tissue was found in a 75-million-year-old Hadrosaurid dinosaur fossil in Alberta, Canada.\n\n\"This is a major breakthrough in the field of paleontology,\" Dr. Taylor exclaimed. \"For decades, scientists have been trying to understand the inner workings of dinosaur brains, but until now, we've only been able to make educated guesses based on comparisons with modern bird and reptile brains.\"\n\nThe fossilised brain tissue was found in a remarkably well-preserved state, with many of the brain's intricate structures still intact. The team used advanced imaging techniques to study the tissue, including CT scans and 3D reconstruction.\n\n\"What we've found is that the dinosaur brain was surprisingly similar to that of modern birds,\" Dr. Taylor said. \"The brain's structure, including the size and shape of the different regions, is very similar to what we see in modern birds. This suggests that the evolution of the bird brain may have been more gradual than we previously thought.\"\n\nThe discovery of the fossilised brain tissue also raises new questions about the behavior and intelligence of dinosaurs. Did they have complex social structures, like some modern birds? Were they capable of problem-solving and learning?\n\n\"These are questions that we can now begin to answer,\" Dr. Taylor said. \"By studying the fossilised brain tissue, we can gain insights into the behavior and cognition of dinosaurs, and get a better understanding of how they lived and interacted with their environment.\"\n\nIn related news, scientists have also made a breakthrough in understanding why our brains may become desensitised to dishonesty over time. According to a new study published in the journal Nature, repeated exposure to lies can actually change the way our brains process dishonesty.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. David Lee, found that when people are repeatedly exposed to lies, their brains start to adapt by reducing the activity in areas associated with detecting dishonesty. This can lead to a phenomenon known as \"honesty fatigue,\" where people become less sensitive to dishonesty and more likely to accept it as normal.\n\n\"This is a concerning finding,\" Dr. Lee said. \"If our brains are becoming desensitised to dishonesty, it could have serious implications for our ability to detect and prevent fraud, deception, and other forms of dishonesty.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for a wide range of fields, from business and finance to politics and education. By understanding how our brains process dishonesty, we can develop strategies to prevent dishonesty and promote honesty and integrity.\n\nAs we continue to learn more about the workings of our brains and the behavior of dinosaurs, it's clear that there's still much to be discovered. But one thing is certain: the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a never-ending journey that will continue to shape our understanding of the world and our place in it.",

But an ordinary day it was not. It was Black Friday, traditionally the biggest shopping day of the year. With the economy bumping along at a lackluster pace, and this year's shorter-than-usual window between Thanksgiving and Christmas, sales and promotions began weeks before Thanksgiving Day, making this holiday shopping season more diffuse than ever. That left Black Friday weekend itself, the season's customary kickoff, looking a bit gloomy. Over the course of the weekend, consumers spent about $1.7 billion less on holiday shopping than they did the year before, according to the National Retail Federation, a retail trade organization. \"There are some economic challenges that many Americans still face,\" said Matthew Shay, the chief executive of the retail federation. \"So in general terms, many are intending to be a little bit more conservative with their budgets.\" More than 141 million people shopped online or in stores between Thursday and Sunday, according to a survey released Sunday afternoon by the retail federation, an increase of about 1 percent over last year. And the average amount each consumer spent, or planned to spend by the end of Sunday, went down, dropping to $407.02 from $423.55. Total spending for the weekend this year was expected to be $57.4 billion, a decrease of nearly 3 percent from last year's $59.1 billion. The holiday season generally accounts for 20 to 40 percent of a retailer's annual sales, according to the federation, and Thanksgiving weekend alone typically represents about 10 to 15 percent of those holiday sales. Despite the overall decline in spending, some retailers reported positive results, citing strong sales in specific categories. For instance, electronics and toys were among the top-performing categories, with many consumers taking advantage of deep discounts on popular items.\n\n\"We were very pleased with our Black Friday weekend results,\" said a spokesperson for Best Buy, the electronics retailer. \"We saw a significant increase in sales of gaming consoles, TVs, and tablets, and our online sales were also up double digits compared to last year.\"\n\nToys \"R\" Us, another retailer that has struggled in recent years, reported a strong weekend as well. \"We had a great Black Friday weekend, with many of our stores reporting their best sales in years,\" said a spokesperson for the toy retailer. \"Our customers took advantage of our doorbusters and online deals, and we saw a significant increase in sales of popular toys like Barbie dolls and Lego sets.\"\n\nHowever, not all retailers were as fortunate. Many clothing and department stores reported sluggish sales, with some even citing a decline in foot traffic and online engagement.\n\n\"The Black Friday weekend was a bit of a disappointment for us,\" said a spokesperson for Macy's, the department store chain. \"While we did see some strong sales in certain categories, overall our sales were down compared to last year. We're concerned about the trend and are working to adjust our strategies to better compete in the market.\"\n\nThe disappointing results on Black Friday weekend have raised concerns about the overall health of the retail industry, which has been facing increasing competition from online retailers like Amazon and changing consumer habits.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for the industry,\" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst with GlobalData Retail. \"Retailers need to rethink their strategies and focus on providing a better customer experience, both online and in-store, if they want to stay competitive.\"\n\nAs the holiday season continues, retailers will be closely watching sales trends and adjusting their strategies accordingly. With just a few weeks left until Christmas, it remains to be seen whether the industry can recover from its disappointing Black Friday weekend.",

But if anyone set on a blue sedan with heated seats and a sunroof or a black crossover with a navigation system and an iPod dock is out of luck at one dealership, there is a good chance the competitor across the street could have a perfect match with a different logo on the grille. \"The inventory levels are going to be fairly tight for the Japanese through the summer,\" Brian A. Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, said on Friday. \"If someone wakes up in a panic to get a smaller car, they may not find it at the Toyota lot and may go over to the Ford or Hyundai lot instead.\" As the summer driving season approaches, Japanese automakers are bracing for a potential shortage of popular models, leaving consumers with limited options. The shortage is attributed to a combination of factors, including supply chain disruptions, production delays, and increased demand for certain models.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, the most affected models are compact sedans and crossovers, which are typically in high demand during the summer months. The shortage is expected to be particularly pronounced for models such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, and Nissan Sentra, which are popular choices among commuters and families.\n\nTo mitigate the shortage, Japanese automakers are encouraging customers to consider alternative models or trim levels. For example, a customer who is set on a blue Honda Civic with heated seats and a sunroof may be able to find a similar model at a competing dealership, such as the Ford Focus or Hyundai Elantra.\n\nHowever, some industry experts warn that the shortage could have a significant impact on sales for Japanese automakers. \"The inventory levels are going to be fairly tight for the Japanese through the summer,\" said Brian A. Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital. \"If someone wakes up in a panic to get a smaller car, they may not find it at the Toyota lot and may go over to the Ford or Hyundai lot instead.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Japanese automakers are working to address the shortage by increasing production and sourcing alternative suppliers. For example, Honda has announced plans to increase production of its popular CR-V crossover, while Toyota is working to reduce production delays at its plants in North America.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are advised to shop around and be flexible when searching for a new car. By considering alternative models and trim levels, consumers may be able to find a vehicle that meets their needs and budget. Additionally, dealerships may offer incentives and discounts to customers who are willing to compromise on certain features or colors.\n\nAs the summer driving season approaches, it remains to be seen how the shortage will impact sales for Japanese automakers.

There has been a theme at the tech industry's big conferences this year: Facebook and other tech giants keep telling us that they've learned from their mistakes and are going to be a lot more thoughtful about the far-out stuff they plan on doing in the future. Apple has been cool to this narrative, and it was striking how the company's executives danced around the tech backlash story line from the stage on Monday at its annual conference for developers. Though Apple acknowledged the darker side of society's obsession with the digital world, it didn't go anywhere near the idea that its own technology might bear any of the blame. Apple did announce several new ways of letting adults and children limit how much time they spend on their phones. A tool called Screen Time, for example, is meant to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices. The company's reluctance to take responsibility for its role in the tech backlash was met with a mix of applause and skepticism from the audience. Some attendees praised Apple's efforts to provide tools for digital wellness, while others felt that the company was dodging the real issue.\n\n\"We're not the ones who created the problem, we're just trying to help people manage their screen time,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, during the conference. \"We're not the ones who are addicted to our phones, we're just trying to provide a way for people to be more mindful of their usage.\"\n\nHowever, critics argue that Apple's approach is too little, too late. \"Apple is trying to put lipstick on a pig,\" said Tristan Harris, a former Google design ethicist who has been critical of the tech industry's impact on society. \"They're acknowledging the problem, but they're not taking responsibility for creating it. And they're not doing enough to address the root causes of the issue.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, Apple's new tools are likely to be popular with parents and adults who are concerned about the amount of time their children and themselves spend on their devices. Screen Time, which will be available on iOS 12, allows users to set limits on their screen time, set time limits for specific apps, and receive reports on their usage.\n\nApple also announced a new feature called \"Downtime,\" which allows users to set a specific period of time each day when their device will not be able to be used. This feature is designed to help users disconnect from their devices and engage in other activities.\n\nIn addition to these new features, Apple also announced a new app called \"Apple Watch Activity,\" which allows users to track their physical activity and set goals for themselves. This app is designed to encourage users to engage in more physical activity and to reduce their screen time.\n\nOverall, while Apple's new tools are a step in the right direction, many critics argue that the company needs to do more to address the root causes of the tech backlash.

        "Text": "SEATTLE -- EBay has accused three Amazon managers of illegally conspiring to poach its sellers, escalating a monthslong feud between two of the country's largest e-commerce companies. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, eBay says the Amazon managers directed dozens of workers to illegally use eBay's private messaging system to solicit sellers onto Amazon's platform. The suit, which claims violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, says the employees' actions were \"coordinated, targeted and designed to inflict harm on eBay.\" EBay first raised concerns that Amazon was poaching its sellers last fall in a lawsuit that has since moved to arbitration. In the new case, eBay says the outreach was not a few rogue employees but part of a larger effort within Amazon, with managers giving lower-lever employees lists of eBay sellers to target. The lawsuit alleges that the Amazon managers, who were not named, were part of a deliberate effort to poach eBay sellers and transfer them to Amazon's platform. According to the complaint, the managers would provide their subordinates with lists of eBay sellers and instruct them to use eBay's private messaging system to contact these sellers and persuade them to switch to Amazon.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the Amazon employees would pose as potential buyers or other sellers, and use false or misleading information to convince the eBay sellers to list their items on Amazon. The complaint also alleges that the Amazon employees would often offer higher prices or other incentives to lure the eBay sellers away from the platform.\n\nEBay is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction to stop Amazon from continuing its alleged poaching activities. The company is also asking the court to require Amazon to destroy any records or documents related to the alleged conspiracy.\n\nThis latest lawsuit is the latest salvo in a long-standing feud between the two e-commerce giants. In recent years, Amazon has been accused of using its market dominance to unfairly compete with smaller retailers, including eBay. eBay has also accused Amazon of copying its products and features, and of using its vast resources to undercut its competitors on price.\n\nThe feud has been playing out in the courts, with both companies filing lawsuits against each other in recent years. In 2019, eBay filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging that the company had stolen its trade secrets and was using them to develop its own e-commerce platform. Amazon denied the allegations and the case was eventually settled out of court.\n\nThe latest lawsuit is the first time that eBay has accused Amazon of poaching its sellers, and it marks a new escalation in the feud between the two companies. The case is likely to be closely watched by regulators and lawmakers, who are increasingly concerned about the growing power of large technology companies and their impact on the economy.\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson denied the allegations, saying that the company \"takes these allegations very seriously and will vigorously defend ourselves against them.\" The spokesperson also pointed out that Amazon has its own policies in place to prevent poaching and to ensure that its employees are not engaging in illegal activities.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest development in a long-standing feud between the two e-commerce giants.",

In recent months, a new trend has emerged among the tech elite: publicly bashing the companies that made them enormously wealthy. Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya, both former Facebook executives, made headlines recently with sharp critiques of their former employers' addictive qualities and damage to society. The pair joined a growing chorus of disenchanted techies, including the Facebook engineer who invented the Like button, the former Google ethicist Tristan Harris, and the designer who came up with the \"pull to refresh\" mechanism used by Twitter. \"I wake up in cold sweats every so often thinking: what did we bring to the world?\" said Tony Fadell, the founder of Nest and one of the key architects of the iPod, at a conference in June. The sudden shift in sentiment from Silicon Valley's tech elite is a stark departure from the usual chorus of self-congratulation and innovation bravado. While some have hailed the critiques as a sign of growing maturity and accountability, others have dismissed them as a desperate attempt to salvage reputations tarnished by scandals and controversies.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics is Sean Parker, the co-founder of Napster and former president of Facebook. Parker has been open about his concerns over the platform's impact on mental health and its role in perpetuating social media addiction. In a recent interview with Axios, he likened Facebook to a \"dopamine-driven feedback loop\" designed to keep users hooked.\n\nParker's comments have resonated with many, particularly in light of the recent revelations surrounding Facebook's data harvesting practices and its role in spreading misinformation during the 2016 US presidential election. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has faced intense scrutiny and criticism for his handling of the crisis, and Parker's critique has added to the growing chorus of voices calling for greater transparency and accountability from the tech industry.\n\nNot all former Facebook executives have joined the chorus of criticism, however. Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, has remained largely silent on the issue, despite facing criticism for her role in shaping Facebook's policies and practices. Sandberg's silence has led some to speculate that she is waiting for the right moment to speak out, or that she is simply trying to avoid further controversy.\n\nThe critiques from Silicon Valley's tech elite have also raised questions about the industry's long-term impact on society. As technology continues to shape our lives in increasingly profound ways, some are beginning to wonder whether the industry's focus on innovation and profit has come at the expense of ethics and social responsibility.\n\nTony Fadell, the founder of Nest and former executive at Apple, has been one of the most vocal critics of the tech industry's priorities. In a recent interview with The New York Times, he lamented the industry's lack of accountability and its tendency to prioritize profits over people.\n\n\"We're not just building products, we're building the fabric of society,\" Fadell said. \"And we need to take responsibility for that.\"\n\nAs the tech industry continues to evolve and shape our world, it remains to be seen whether the recent critiques from Silicon Valley's tech elite will lead to meaningful change or simply serve as a fleeting moment of introspection. One thing is certain, however: the industry's reputation has been forever changed, and the public's expectations for accountability and transparency have been raised.",

        "Text": "Name: Lewis Roberts Age: 34 Income: Â£34,000 Occupation: Social worker Five years ago I decided to change careers and become a social worker. I'd been working in healthcare regulation and I felt quite disconnected from the job. Something about social work appealed to me. As I reflect on my decision to transition into social work, I realize that it was one of the most fulfilling choices I've ever made. The sense of purpose and meaning I felt was palpable from the very beginning. I was drawn to the idea of working directly with people, making a tangible difference in their lives, and being part of a community that truly cared about the well-being of others.\n\nAfter completing my degree in social work, I landed a job at a local children's services organization. My role involved working with families who were struggling to cope with various challenges, from poverty and homelessness to mental health issues and addiction. It was a daunting task, but I was determined to make a positive impact.\n\nThe first few months were a steep learning curve, but I was fortunate to have a supportive team and mentor who guided me through the process. I quickly discovered that social work was not just about providing a service, but about building relationships, understanding people's stories, and empowering them to take control of their lives.\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of my job was seeing the tangible difference I could make in people's lives. Whether it was helping a family access vital resources, supporting a child through a difficult time, or simply being a listening ear for someone in crisis, I knew that I was making a difference.\n\nOf course, it wasn't always easy. There were times when the workload was overwhelming, and I felt like I was drowning in paperwork and bureaucracy. But despite the challenges, I never lost sight of why I became a social worker in the first place â€“ to make a positive difference in people's lives.\n\nAs I look back on my five years in social work, I am proud of the progress I've made and the impact I've had. I've seen families reunite, children thrive, and communities come together to support one another. And while there is still much work to be done, I am confident that I am exactly where I am meant to be.\n\nAs I continue on this journey, I am excited to see what the future holds. Will I continue to work in social work, or will I take on new challenges? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain â€“ I will always be driven by a passion to make a difference and to be part of a community that truly cares about the well-being of others.",

        "Text": "Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal, has admitted that he is the secret funder of Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against online news site Gawker. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, sued for invasion of privacy after Gawker published an excerpt of a leaked sex tape in 2012. In March this year, a Florida jury awarded Bollea $140m (Â£95.1m) in damages against the media organisation. Unknown to the jury or public, Thiel had secretly bankrolled Bollea's legal case to the tune of about $10m. In 2007 Gawker had published a story revealing Thiel was gay. Publicly confirming his funding of the Bollea case after a report by Forbes, Thiel told the New York Times \"it's less about revenge and more about specific deterrence\". The story about his own sexuality was one of many that Thiel describes as having \"ruined people's lives for no reason\", and drove him, he says, to help fund \"victims\" of the site in mounting legal cases against Gawker. Thiel's admission has sparked a heated debate about the ethics of secretly funding lawsuits and the role of money in shaping the outcome of legal cases. Some have praised Thiel's actions, saying that he has taken a stand against a media organization that has a history of publishing salacious and invasive content. Others have criticized him, arguing that his actions undermine the principles of a fair and impartial justice system.\n\nThe case against Gawker was seen as a landmark victory for Bollea, who had accused the site of invading his privacy and causing him emotional distress. The jury's decision to award him $140 million in damages was seen as a significant blow to Gawker's reputation and finances. However, Thiel's admission has raised questions about the true motivations behind the lawsuit and whether the outcome was influenced by his secret funding.\n\nGawker's founder, Nick Denton, has been vocal in his criticism of Thiel's actions, saying that they were a \"clear attempt to silence Gawker and intimidate other media outlets\". Denton has also accused Thiel of using his wealth and influence to \"bully\" Gawker and its employees.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of money in shaping the outcome of legal cases. Some have argued that Thiel's secret funding of Bollea's lawsuit was a form of \"judicial bribery\", where a wealthy individual uses their resources to influence the outcome of a case. Others have argued that it was a legitimate use of Thiel's wealth to support a cause he believed in.\n\nThe fallout from the controversy is likely to be significant. Gawker has already filed for bankruptcy and is in the process of being sold off to Ziff Davis, a media company that owns a number of other online publications. The case has also raised questions about the future of online journalism and the role of media outlets in holding those in power accountable.\n\nIn the end, the controversy surrounding Thiel's funding of Bollea's lawsuit is a reminder of the complex and often contentious nature of the legal system. While some may see Thiel's actions as a justified response to Gawker's invasive reporting, others will view them as a threat to the principles of a fair and impartial justice system. As the debate continues to rage on, one thing is clear: the impact of Thiel's actions will be felt for a long time to come.",

        "Text": "Millions of superfast and ultrafast broadband users could benefit from significant price cuts after BT said it would cut almost Â£100m from what it charges rivals to use its network. Openreach, the BT-owned subsidiary that controls the UK's broadband network, is to dramatically reduce what it charges providers such as Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone to offer superfast and ultrafast broadband. For example, the amount Openreach charges rivals for its 80Mbps product will be slashed by 40% from Â£9.95 to Â£5.99. Openreach said the price reductions could help more than 17.5m homes and businesses move to a faster internet service. The price cuts, which will come into effect from April, are expected to benefit millions of households and businesses across the UK. According to Openreach, the reduced charges will enable internet service providers (ISPs) to offer faster and more reliable broadband services to their customers at a lower cost.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant step towards improving the UK's digital infrastructure, which has been criticized in the past for being slow and unreliable. The price cuts are expected to particularly benefit rural areas, where access to fast and reliable broadband is often limited.\n\n\"This is a major boost for the UK's digital economy,\" said a spokesperson for Openreach. \"By reducing our charges, we're making it more affordable for ISPs to offer faster and more reliable broadband services to their customers. This will help to drive innovation, create jobs, and boost economic growth.\"\n\nThe price cuts will also help to increase competition in the broadband market, which has been dominated by a few large providers in recent years. Smaller ISPs, which often struggle to compete with larger rivals, may be able to offer more competitive pricing and services to their customers as a result.\n\nThe move has been welcomed by industry experts, who say that it will help to drive investment in the UK's digital infrastructure. \"This is a major step forward for the UK's broadband industry,\" said a spokesperson for the Internet Services Providers' Association (ISPA). \"By reducing its charges, Openreach is making it more affordable for ISPs to invest in faster and more reliable broadband services. This will help to drive innovation and improve the overall quality of service for customers.\"\n\nThe price cuts will not apply to all of Openreach's products, however. The company will continue to charge rivals a premium for its fastest and most reliable broadband services, which are used by a small number of high-end customers.\n\nDespite this, the move is expected to have a significant impact on the UK's broadband market, and could help to drive investment in the country's digital infrastructure. As the UK's economy continues to rely increasingly on digital technology, the need for fast and reliable broadband is becoming more pressing than ever.\n\nIn conclusion, the price cuts announced by Openreach are a significant step forward for the UK's broadband industry, and could help to drive investment and improve the overall quality of service for customers. With millions of households and businesses set to benefit from the move, it is likely to have a major impact on the country's digital economy.",

        "Text": "TOKYO -- Daisuke Horii just collected his summer bonus. It was only slightly more than last year, but enough to compel the 34-year-old shopping mall clerk to Tokyo's electronics district to look for some high-end speakers. \"Things are generally looking brighter, aren't they?\" Mr. Horii said, as he scrutinized, then dismissed, cheaper alternatives at the bustling Yodobashi Camera electronics store. The Bose ones he has his eye on, which he'll hook up to his TV, go for about $400. \"I don't really need it, but I want it,\" he said. \"A good economy means you can buy things you don't really need.\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's bid to revive Japan's deflated economy hinges on consumers like Mr. Horii starting to feel flush enough to start splurging on the finer things in life. A wide recovery in consumer spending has been the weakest link in \"Abenomics,\" the bold economic stimulus strategy that Mr. Abe has pushed since taking office in late December. As Japan's economy continues to slowly recover from its prolonged stagnation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration is pinning its hopes on a surge in consumer spending to drive growth. The latest data suggests that the country's GDP is slowly ticking upwards, but the pace of growth remains sluggish. To achieve a more robust recovery, the government is relying on consumers like Daisuke Horii to start opening their wallets and splurging on discretionary items.\n\nHowever, not everyone is as optimistic as Mr. Horii. Many Japanese consumers are still wary of spending, citing concerns over job security and the uncertainty surrounding the country's aging population. According to a recent survey by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, nearly 60% of respondents said they are not confident in their ability to increase their spending in the coming months.\n\nDespite these concerns, the government remains committed to its stimulus strategy, which has included aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms. The Bank of Japan has implemented a series of interest rate cuts and has also launched a massive asset-purchase program to inject liquidity into the economy.\n\nThe government is also banking on a rebound in the country's labor market to boost consumer confidence. The unemployment rate has been steadily declining, and wages have started to rise. However, the pace of wage growth remains slow, and many workers are still struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIn a bid to boost consumer spending, the government has also launched a series of initiatives aimed at encouraging people to spend more. These include tax breaks for low- and middle-income households, as well as subsidies for small businesses to encourage them to invest in new equipment and technology.\n\nWhile some economists are skeptical about the government's ability to achieve a sustained recovery, others believe that the country's economy is on the cusp of a major turnaround. \"The fundamentals are in place for a strong recovery,\" said Takashi Miyazaki, chief economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \"Consumers are starting to feel more confident, and businesses are beginning to invest again. It's just a matter of time before we see a significant pick-up in growth.\"\n\nAs Daisuke Horii continues to browse the shelves at Yodobashi Camera, he is not alone in his optimism. Many Japanese consumers are starting to feel more confident about their financial prospects, and are beginning to splurge on discretionary items. Whether this trend will be enough to drive a sustained recovery remains to be seen, but for now, the government is pinning its hopes on the country's consumers to lead the way.",

Parents, disabled children and their supporters will march in more than 25 locations on Thursday, including London, Bristol, Birmingham, Widnes, Worthing, Stevenage, Leamington Spa, Matlock, Colchester and Dorchester. It is part of a campaign by families whose struggle to secure the support their children need to access education has pushed the issue of Send funding up the political agenda before the government's forthcoming spending review. Among the protesters will be Emma Parker, a primary school teacher from Durham whose 13-year-old son, James, will hand in a petition to Downing Street calling on the government to end what campaigners say is a national crisis in Send funding and delivery. The protests, organized by the National Autistic Society, Mencap, and the National Association for Special Educational Needs, are expected to draw thousands of people, including parents, children, and advocates for special educational needs. The marchers will be demanding that the government increase funding for special educational needs and disabilities, which they claim has been drastically cut in recent years.\n\nAccording to campaigners, the current funding system is inadequate, leaving many schools struggling to provide the necessary support for children with special needs. This has resulted in some children being unable to attend school, or being forced to attend schools that are not equipped to meet their needs.\n\nEmma Parker, the primary school teacher from Durham, said that her son James has been severely affected by the lack of funding. \"James has autism and requires a lot of support to access education,\" she said. \"But due to the funding cuts, his school has been unable to provide him with the necessary resources. It's heartbreaking to see my son struggle to learn and thrive because of a lack of funding.\"\n\nThe petition being handed in by James at Downing Street is calling for the government to increase funding for special educational needs and disabilities, and to ensure that all schools have the necessary resources to provide adequate support for children with special needs.\n\nThe protests are taking place just weeks before the government's spending review, which is expected to outline the government's plans for public spending over the next few years. Campaigners are hoping that the protests will put pressure on the government to prioritize funding for special educational needs and disabilities.\n\n\"This is a national crisis, and it's time for the government to take action,\" said Mark Lever, Chief Executive of the National Autistic Society. \"We urge the government to increase funding for special educational needs and disabilities, and to ensure that all schools have the necessary resources to provide adequate support for children with special needs.\"\n\nThe protests are expected to be a significant event, with thousands of people expected to attend. The marches will take place in cities and towns across England, with the aim of raising awareness about the issue and putting pressure on the government to take action.\n\nIn a statement, the Department for Education said that it was committed to supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities, and that it was working to improve the funding system. However, campaigners say that more needs to be done, and that the government must prioritize funding for special educational needs and disabilities in the upcoming spending review.",

They are cited by journalism lecturer Sean Dodson in a piece for The Conversation, wittily headlined \"Four reasons why listicles and clickbait are killing real journalism\". Dodson, a respected voice in the journalism community, argues that the proliferation of listicles and clickbait headlines is not only a symptom of a larger problem, but also a contributing factor to the decline of real journalism. According to Dodson, these types of headlines are designed to be attention-grabbing and easy to share on social media, but they often lack substance and fail to provide meaningful information to readers.\n\nIn his article, Dodson highlights the example of the listicles mentioned in the local newspaper articles, which he argues are not only shallow but also misleading. \"These headlines are not designed to inform or educate, but rather to manipulate and deceive,\" Dodson writes. \"They are a way to get people to click on a story without actually providing any real value or insight.\"\n\nDodson also points out that the emphasis on clickbait headlines has led to a culture of sensationalism and exaggeration in journalism. \"Journalists are under pressure to produce content that will get clicks and shares, and as a result, they are often forced to sensationalize and distort the truth,\" he argues. \"This is not only unethical, but it also undermines the credibility of the entire profession.\"\n\nThe impact of this trend on real journalism is significant, according to Dodson. \"When journalists are forced to focus on clickbait headlines and listicles, they are not able to produce the kind of in-depth reporting and analysis that is necessary to hold those in power accountable,\" he writes. \"This is a threat not only to the quality of journalism, but also to the very fabric of democracy itself.\"\n\nDodson's article has sparked a lively debate in the journalism community, with many agreeing that the proliferation of listicles and clickbait headlines is a major problem. However, others have argued that these types of headlines are a necessary evil in today's digital age, and that they can be an effective way to reach a wider audience and drive traffic to news websites.\n\nRegardless of one's opinion on the matter, it is clear that the trend towards listicles and clickbait headlines is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and discussion. As the journalism community continues to grapple with the challenges of the digital age, it is essential that we prioritize the production of high-quality, in-depth reporting and analysis, rather than sacrificing substance for the sake of clicks and shares.",

Their lost village has been rediscovered in an epic excavation employing more than 200 archaeologists, working across scores of sites on a 21-mile stretch of flat Cambridgeshire countryside, the route of the upgraded A14 and the Huntingdon bypass. Much of it is now flat and rather featureless farmland, but the excavations have revealed how densely populated it was in the past, with scores of village sites, burial mounds, henges, trackways, industrial sites including pottery kilns and a Roman distribution centre. The archaeologists also found an Anglo-Saxon tribal boundary site with huge ditches, a gated entrance and a beacon on a hill that still overlooks the whole region. The excavation, led by the Cambridgeshire County Council and the Cambridge University Archaeological Unit, has uncovered a treasure trove of historical artifacts and insights into the daily lives of the medieval villagers. The team has been working tirelessly for months, carefully excavating the sites and analyzing the finds to piece together the story of the lost village.\n\nOne of the most significant discoveries is the remains of the village's central square, where the villagers would have gathered for markets, ceremonies, and community events. Archaeologists have found evidence of a large wooden platform, likely used for speeches and performances, as well as a series of stone-lined pits that may have held ancient artifacts or ceremonial objects.\n\nThe excavation has also revealed the layout of the village's streets and homes, which were surprisingly sophisticated for the medieval period. The villagers lived in a mix of timber-framed houses and workshops, with some buildings dating back to the 12th century. The team has found evidence of a thriving local economy, with pottery kilns, ironworking sites, and even a Roman distribution center that suggests the village was an important hub of trade and commerce.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon tribal boundary site, with its massive ditches and gated entrance, is another significant discovery. Archaeologists believe this site may have marked the boundary between two rival tribes, and the presence of a beacon on a nearby hill suggests that the site may have been used for signaling and communication.\n\nThe excavation has also uncovered a number of burial mounds and henges, which are believed to date back to the Bronze Age. These ancient monuments are a testament to the region's rich cultural heritage and the enduring legacy of the people who once lived and worked in this area.\n\nAs the excavation continues, the team is working to piece together the story of the lost village of Houghton. The finds are providing a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of the medieval villagers, and the archaeologists are excited to share their discoveries with the public.\n\nThe excavation is expected to continue for several more months, with the team working to uncover as much of the village as possible before the roadworks are completed. The Cambridgeshire County Council and the Cambridge University Archaeological Unit are planning to create a permanent exhibit at the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, where the public can learn more about the lost village of Houghton and its significance in the region's history.",

        "Text": "Single-Payer Health Care in California: Here's What It Would Take\n\nIf wholesale opposition to President Trump is one litmus test for progressive Democrats, another -- as the governor's race in California is proving -- is health care. All the leading Democratic contenders in the June 5 primary have pledged support for a single-payer system run by the state. The front-runner, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, has made it the centerpiece of his campaign. \"There's no reason to wait around on universal health care and single-payer in California,\" he has declared. Even beyond California, many Democrats are hoping to energize supporters by taking a cue from Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign, which embraced a single-payer system, \"Medicare for All.\" But the idea primarily functions as a rallying cry. \"Voters are thinking about the fundamental values associated with single-payer,\" said Kelly Hall, an independent health consultant who works with the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers in California, which has endorsed Mr. Newsom. \"Almost zero voters have thought about the policy implications.\" In this case, \"implications\" could be another word for booby traps. Even a state as big, wealthy and liberal as California -- with the world's fifth-largest economy and nearly 40 million people -- would find itself hamstrung by money, a legal and regulatory thicket, and highly motivated opposition. \"You're talking 20 percent of California's economy,\" said Dana Goldman, the director of the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California. The Challenges of Implementing Single-Payer Health Care in California\n\nWhile the idea of single-payer health care may resonate with voters, the reality of implementing such a system in California is far more complex. Goldman, a renowned health economist, points out that single-payer health care would require a significant overhaul of the state's healthcare infrastructure. \"You're talking about taking over the entire healthcare system, which is a massive undertaking,\" he said. \"It's not just about creating a new insurance program, it's about taking control of the entire healthcare system, including hospitals, clinics, and physician practices.\"\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles facing a single-payer system in California is the state's current healthcare spending. According to the California Healthcare Foundation, the state spends over $350 billion annually on healthcare, with a significant portion of that going towards administrative costs. Implementing a single-payer system would require significant changes to the way healthcare is delivered and paid for, including streamlining administrative costs and reducing waste.\n\nAnother challenge is the legal and regulatory framework. California's healthcare system is governed by a complex web of federal and state laws, regulations, and policies. Implementing a single-payer system would require significant changes to these laws and regulations, which could be a lengthy and contentious process.\n\nMoreover, a single-payer system would require significant funding, which could be a challenge in a state with already strained finances. California's budget is already heavily reliant on taxes, and implementing a single-payer system would require significant new revenue streams.\n\nDespite these challenges, proponents of single-payer health care in California remain optimistic. Newsom, the front-runner in the governor's race, has pledged to work with lawmakers to develop a plan for implementing a single-payer system. Other Democratic contenders, including State Treasurer John Chiang and former State Senate President Kevin de LeÃ³n, have also expressed support for the idea.\n\nWhile the challenges of implementing single-payer health care in California are significant, many argue that the benefits would be worth the effort. A single-payer system could provide universal access to healthcare, reduce administrative costs, and improve health outcomes. \"The idea of single-payer health care is not just about creating a new insurance program, it's about creating a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system,\" said Hall, the independent health consultant.\n\nAs California's Democratic contenders continue to campaign on the issue of single-payer health care, it remains to be seen whether the state can overcome the significant challenges and implement a system that provides universal access to healthcare.",

In a note posted to the company's investor relations page, the company said it did \"not expect any near-term impact on our financial results\" and that it was prepared to pursue the matter in court for years to come. \"While we desire a resolution as soon as possible, the process is likely to take several years,\" the company said. Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, said that it wasn't clear which side would prevail, ultimately. \"There's no telling whether the verdict will stand on appeal, but we know that the landscape is changing for US corporations in the EU,\" he told the Guardian. The European Commission's decision to order Apple to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with many analysts warning that the implications could be far-reaching. The commission's ruling, which was announced in August, found that Apple had received illegal state aid from Ireland, where the company has its European headquarters.\n\nApple has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and the company's decision to appeal the ruling is seen as a sign that it is willing to fight the decision in court. In a statement, the company said that it was \"confident that the decision will be overturned\" and that it was prepared to pursue the matter for years to come.\n\nThe dispute has sparked a heated debate about tax policy and corporate governance, with some arguing that the commission's decision is a necessary step to ensure that multinational corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Others have criticized the decision, arguing that it is an overreach of EU authority and that it could have unintended consequences for businesses operating in the region.\n\nThe case is seen as a major test of the EU's powers to regulate corporate tax practices, and the outcome could have significant implications for the way that companies are taxed in the region. The EU has been cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion in recent years, and the Apple case is seen as a key part of this effort.\n\nIn the meantime, Apple's shares have been largely unaffected by the news, with the company's stock price remaining steady in the wake of the announcement. However, some analysts are warning that the dispute could have long-term implications for the company's financial performance.\n\n\"The EU's decision could have a significant impact on Apple's profitability, particularly if the company is forced to pay the full amount of back taxes,\" said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management. \"While Apple has a large cash reserve, the company still needs to generate profits to fund its operations and invest in new products and services.\"\n\nThe dispute is also seen as a major test of the relationship between the EU and the US, with some arguing that the commission's decision is an attack on American business interests. The US government has been critical of the EU's efforts to regulate corporate tax practices, and the Apple case is seen as a key battleground in this dispute.\n\nIn a statement, the US Treasury Department said that it was \"concerned about the potential implications of the EU's decision on the global economy and on US businesses operating in the EU.\" The department added that it was \"working closely with the EU to address these concerns and to find a solution that is fair and equitable for all parties involved.\"\n\nThe Apple case is just the latest in a series of high-profile disputes between the EU and multinational corporations. In recent years, the EU has ordered companies such as Amazon and Google to pay back taxes, and the commission has also launched investigations into the tax practices of companies such as Starbucks and Fiat.\n\nThe disputes have sparked a heated debate about tax policy and corporate governance, with some arguing that the EU's efforts to regulate corporate tax practices are necessary to ensure that companies pay their fair share of taxes. Others have criticized the EU's actions, arguing that they are an overreach of authority and that they could have unintended consequences for businesses operating in the region.\n\nIn the end, the outcome of the Apple case will depend on the decision of the EU's General Court, which is expected to hear the case in the coming months. The court's decision will be closely watched by investors and analysts around the world, and could have significant implications for the global economy and for the way that companies are taxed in the region.",

        "Text": "On Wednesday, just before NBC announced it was suspending Brian Williams from its nightly news broadcast, Lester Holt was told he would be sitting in the anchor chair for the next six months. Along with doing perhaps the biggest job in television news, under added scrutiny, Mr. Holt will also continue to helm the weekend edition of \"NBC Nightly News,\" at least until a replacement can be found, and host \"Dateline,\" reminding some that he was once nicknamed Iron Pants for his willingness to work seemingly nonstop. Several television executives said this week that they did not expect Mr. Williams to return to the anchor chair, even when his suspension is up. So Mr. Holt's fill-in role could even double as a very public tryout. If Mr. Holt -- who will not hold the title managing editor, as Mr. Williams did -- can keep NBC ahead of its rivals, both in viewer numbers and in advertising dollars, he could hold on to a fiercely coveted position and become the first black anchor with his name on \"Nightly News.\" Nice guys, he has told some, can finish first. \"He's a total pro, pleasant, unflappable, intelligent,\" said David Frei, who hosted the Westminster Dog Show with Mr. Holt for three years in the mid-2000s. \"I'm rooting for him to get the job, and I know a lot of other people are, too.\" It will not be easy. As the news of Brian Williams' suspension spread like wildfire, the television industry was abuzz with speculation about the future of NBC's flagship news program. With Lester Holt taking the reins, many are wondering if he has what it takes to fill the shoes of the embattled anchor. While Holt has a strong track record as a journalist, he faces a daunting task in trying to stabilize the program and maintain its reputation.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Holt is not lacking in confidence. In a recent interview, he expressed his commitment to upholding the highest standards of journalism and his determination to make the program a success. \"I'm not here to make a name for myself, but to serve the audience and provide them with the best possible news coverage,\" he said.\n\nHolt's ascension to the anchor chair is not without precedent. He has a long history of working in television news, having started his career as a reporter for the NBC affiliate in Sacramento, California. He later moved to New York, where he worked as a correspondent for the \"Today\" show and later became the anchor of the weekend edition of \"NBC Nightly News.\"\n\nDespite his impressive credentials, Holt faces stiff competition from other networks. CBS and ABC are both vying for viewers and advertisers, and the competition is expected to be fierce. However, Holt is undaunted, and is confident that he can lead NBC to victory.\n\n\"I believe that our program has a strong foundation, and with the right leadership, we can continue to thrive,\" he said. \"I'm committed to working hard and giving our audience the best possible news coverage.\"\n\nAs the debate continues to rage over whether Brian Williams will return to the anchor chair, one thing is certain - Lester Holt has a tough act to follow. But with his experience, talent, and dedication, he may just be the man to lead NBC's \"Nightly News\" to new heights.",

        "Text": "Huawei Said to Be Preparing to Sue the U.S. Government\n\nSHANGHAI -- The Chinese electronics giant Huawei is preparing to sue the United States government for barring federal agencies from using the company's products, according to two people familiar with the matter. The lawsuit is to be filed in the Eastern District of Texas, where Huawei has its American headquarters, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential plans. The company plans to announce the suit this week. The move could be aimed at forcing the United States government to make its case against the Chinese equipment maker more publicly. It is part of a broad push by Huawei to defend itself against a campaign led by the United States to undermine the company, which Washington sees as a security threat. Executives have spoken out strongly against America's actions, and new marketing campaigns have been aimed at mending the company's image among consumers. For many years, United States officials have said Beijing could use Huawei's telecommunication equipment to spy and disrupt communication networks. The company has denied the allegations, but major wireless carriers such as AT&T and Verizon have effectively been prevented from using Huawei's equipment as a result. Over the past year, Washington has ramped up its pressure on the firm, which is preparing to take a major role in the construction of next-generation wireless networks around the world. American officials have urged other governments to ban the use of Huawei's products. This year, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against the company and its chief financial officer in connection with evading American sanctions on Iran. The lawsuit is expected to focus on the constitutionality of the government's ban, which was imposed without a formal investigation or evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei. The company's lawyers will likely argue that the ban is a form of discrimination against a foreign company and violates the principles of free trade and fair competition.\n\nHuawei's move to sue the US government is seen as a bold attempt to challenge the administration's aggressive stance on the company. The lawsuit is also expected to be a test case for the company's ability to defend itself against the US government's allegations.\n\nThe ban on Huawei's products has had significant consequences for the company, which has seen its revenue decline and its market share shrink. The company's executives have been vocal in their criticism of the US government's actions, and have accused Washington of using Huawei as a scapegoat in its trade war with China.\n\nHuawei's lawsuit is not expected to be the only legal challenge to the US government's ban. Several other companies, including major wireless carriers, have also expressed concerns about the constitutionality of the ban and are likely to join Huawei's lawsuit.\n\nThe US government's ban on Huawei's products has also sparked concerns about the impact on the global telecommunications industry. The company is a major player in the development of 5G networks, and its equipment is used by many countries around the world.\n\nThe lawsuit is expected to be a complex and lengthy legal battle, with both sides presenting their arguments and evidence. The outcome of the lawsuit is likely to have significant implications for the future of Huawei and the global telecommunications industry.\n\nIn a statement, Huawei said it was \"prepared to take all necessary steps to protect its rights and interests.\" The company's lawyers are expected to file the lawsuit in the coming days, and the case is likely to be heard in court in the coming months.\n\nThe US government has not commented on the lawsuit, but officials have previously said that the ban on Huawei's products is necessary to protect national security. The government has also accused Huawei of being a threat to the US's national security and has urged other countries to ban the company's products.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest development in a long-running saga between Huawei and the US government. The company has been at the center of a trade war between the US and China, and has been accused of being a threat to national security. Huawei has denied the allegations and has accused the US government of using the company as a scapegoat in its trade war with China.\n\nThe case is expected to be closely watched by the global telecommunications industry, as well as by governments and businesses around the world. The outcome of the lawsuit is likely to have significant implications for the future of Huawei and the global telecommunications industry.",

        "Text": "In a modest sign that the housing market is moving toward more normal conditions, the pace of home building is finally picking up from its near-death levels. The Census Bureau reported Friday that housing starts in March rose 1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000. It was the third consecutive monthly increase, and better than analysts had been predicting. The rate is now 31 percent above the record low set last April. Adding to the sense of momentum was a significant upward adjustment to the February numbers, which were originally reported as 575,000, a decline of 5.9 percent, but now revised to 616,000, an increase of 1.1 percent. However welcome these numbers are to builders, they are very small improvements when set against the context of construction's steep fall over the last several years. At the height of the boom, more than two million homes were being built annually. The increase in construction this winter was most likely spurred by the government's tax credit for homebuyers, which is speeding toward expiration with little likelihood of being renewed. Deals have to be signed by the end of this month to qualify, although they can take two more months to close. As the housing market continues to recover, experts are cautiously optimistic about the future prospects of the industry. While the recent increases in housing starts are a positive sign, many are still wary of the sector's ability to sustain a strong recovery.\n\n\"The numbers are certainly encouraging, but we need to see a more sustained period of growth before we can say that the market has truly turned the corner,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"We're still dealing with a lot of excess inventory and a lot of uncertainty in the market, so it's going to take some time for things to get back to normal.\"\n\nOne area of concern is the high level of foreclosures still weighing on the market. According to RealtyTrac, a foreclosure tracking firm, there were over 300,000 foreclosure filings in March alone, bringing the total for the first quarter to over 900,000. This is still far below the peak levels seen during the height of the crisis, but it's a reminder that the market is still working through a significant backlog of distressed properties.\n\nAnother challenge facing the industry is the ongoing shortage of credit for homebuyers and builders. While the government's tax credit has helped to stimulate demand, many experts believe that the credit is not a sustainable solution and that the industry needs to focus on developing more traditional sources of financing.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of interest from private investors in the housing market, but they're being cautious due to the uncertainty surrounding the government's role in the industry,\" said David Stevens, president and CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association. \"We need to see more clarity on the government's plans for the industry before we can expect to see a significant increase in lending activity.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, many builders and developers are optimistic about the future prospects of the industry. With the government's tax credit set to expire at the end of the month, many are scrambling to complete deals and take advantage of the incentives.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of activity in the market right now, and we're confident that the industry will continue to recover as the credit expires and buyers return to the market,\" said Richard Dugas, CEO of PulteGroup, one of the largest homebuilders in the country. \"We're also seeing a lot of interest in our new product lines, which are designed to appeal to first-time buyers and move-up buyers who are looking for more affordable options.\"\n\nOverall, while the housing market still faces many challenges, the recent increases in housing starts are a welcome sign of progress. As the industry continues to recover, experts will be closely watching the numbers to see if the market can sustain a strong recovery and return to its pre-crisis levels.",

Offline viewing is arguably the most demanded feature by users, and one of the things that differentiated other services including Amazon's Video streaming service and pay TV services such as Sky and Virgin. Eddy Wu, Netflix director of product innovation, said: \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.\" The feature, which is currently available on select devices, allows users to download select TV shows and movies for offline viewing. This means that users can watch their favorite content without the need for a stable internet connection, making it ideal for commutes, flights, or areas with poor internet connectivity.\n\nAccording to Wu, the offline viewing feature is part of Netflix's efforts to provide a more flexible and convenient viewing experience for its users. \"We're excited to give our members more flexibility to watch what they want, where they want, and how they want,\" Wu said.\n\nThe feature is currently available on Android devices and will be rolled out to iOS devices in the coming weeks. To access the offline viewing feature, users can simply navigate to the Netflix app, select the content they want to download, and choose the \"Available for download\" option.\n\nNetflix has been working on the offline viewing feature for some time, with Wu revealing that the company has been testing the feature with select users for several months. \"We've been testing the feature with a small group of users and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive,\" Wu said.\n\nThe introduction of offline viewing is a significant development for Netflix, which has been facing increased competition from other streaming services. By offering offline viewing, Netflix is attempting to differentiate itself from its competitors and provide a unique selling point for its users.\n\nThe offline viewing feature is also a major win for Netflix's content creators, who have been pushing for the feature to be implemented. \"The ability to download content for offline viewing is a game-changer for creators,\" said a spokesperson for Netflix's content creators. \"It allows us to reach a wider audience and provide our content to users in a way that was previously not possible.\"\n\nAs the streaming wars continue to heat up, Netflix's introduction of offline viewing is a significant move that could give the company a competitive edge.

        "Text": "A longstanding row in animal evolution has come to a head, with a team of scientists claiming they have ended the debate over which type of creature is the sister of all other animals. Researchers have been torn for years over whether sponges or marine invertebrates known as comb jellies were the first type of creature to branch off the evolutionary tree from the common ancestor of all animals. Now researchers say the debate is over: the sponges have won. \"We need to try to understand the sponges much better if we want to understand the nature of animals' â€“ and our own â€“ deepest ancestry,\" said Davide Pisani, co-author of the research and professor of phylogenomics at the University of Bristol. The finding, say experts, is no trivial matter, as it could have drastic implications for what the last common ancestor of all animals looked like. The study, published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, analyzed the DNA and protein sequences of 35 different species of sponges, as well as other animals, to determine their evolutionary relationships. The researchers used a technique called phylogenomics, which combines genetic and genomic data to reconstruct the history of life on Earth.\n\nAccording to Pisani, the results of the study show that sponges are more closely related to other animals than comb jellies, and that they share a common ancestor with the rest of the animal kingdom. This finding challenges the prevailing view that comb jellies were the first animals to evolve, and instead suggests that sponges were the pioneers of animal life on Earth.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of animals, as it suggests that the last common ancestor of all animals was likely a sponge-like creature. This ancestor would have had characteristics such as a simple body plan, a lack of complex organs, and a diet of filtering small particles from the water.\n\nThe study's findings also have implications for our understanding of the evolution of other animal groups, such as humans. \"If we want to understand the nature of animals' â€“ and our own â€“ deepest ancestry, we need to try to understand the sponges much better,\" said Pisani.\n\nThe researchers believe that the study's findings could have practical applications in fields such as medicine and biotechnology. For example, the study of sponge DNA could lead to the discovery of new enzymes and other biomolecules that could be used to develop new treatments for diseases.\n\nThe study's authors are now planning to conduct further research on the evolutionary history of sponges, in order to gain a better understanding of their role in the evolution of animal life on Earth. They hope that their findings will help to shed new light on the origins of animal life, and will provide insights into the evolution of complex body plans and organs.\n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of animals, and suggest that sponges were the first type of creature to branch off the evolutionary tree from the common ancestor of all animals. The study's authors believe that their findings will have practical applications in fields such as medicine and biotechnology, and will provide insights into the evolution of complex body plans and organs.",

        "Text": "Some researchers think mechanical brushes aren't just some spa amenity for dairy cows -- they're important to the animal's well-being. Cows, like dogs and people, like a good scratch. Outside, they'll rub their bodies against fence posts or trees to remove parasites or just stay clean. ...or just stay clean. However, in a confined environment like a dairy farm, cows may not have the opportunity to engage in this natural behavior. This is where mechanical brushes come in â€“ a tool designed to mimic the sensation of a scratch, providing cows with a sense of comfort and relief.\n\nStudies have shown that cows who are regularly brushed exhibit reduced stress levels, improved milk production, and enhanced overall well-being. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Dairy Science found that cows who received regular brushing had lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, compared to those who did not receive brushing.\n\nBut the benefits of mechanical brushing extend beyond just the physical and emotional well-being of the cow. By reducing stress and promoting relaxation, farmers can also see improvements in milk quality and yield. A study conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that cows who were brushed regularly produced milk with higher levels of butterfat and protein, resulting in a better quality product.\n\nIn addition to the benefits for the cows and the farm, mechanical brushing is also a more humane and sustainable option for dairy farmers. Many farms have transitioned away from more invasive methods of cow handling, such as tail docking and dehorning, in favor of more gentle and respectful approaches. Brushing is a key component of this shift, allowing farmers to interact with their animals in a way that is both effective and compassionate.\n\nAs the demand for high-quality, sustainably-produced dairy products continues to grow, the importance of mechanical brushing is likely to become even more pronounced. By recognizing the value of this simple yet effective tool, farmers, researchers, and consumers alike can work together to promote a more humane and sustainable dairy industry.",

        "Text": "For the average ride-hail user in a major city, there are few differences between Uber and Lyft. Lyft is pink and fuzzy; Uber is sleek and shiny. Both get you where you need to go at a lower price than a taxi, and both rely on independent contractors â€“ a business model that has been lambasted by taxi drivers and labor advocates for years. However, a closer look at the two companies' inner workings reveals some significant differences. One of the most notable is their approach to pricing. Uber, known for its dynamic pricing model, often charges higher fares during peak hours or in areas with high demand. This can lead to sticker shock for riders who are used to a more predictable fare structure.\n\nLyft, on the other hand, has taken a different approach. In 2019, the company introduced a feature called \"Prime Time,\" which offers discounted fares during off-peak hours. This has helped to attract price-conscious riders who are looking for a more affordable option. Lyft has also been experimenting with a flat-rate pricing model for certain routes, which can provide a more predictable cost for riders.\n\nAnother key difference between the two companies is their focus on additional services. Uber has been aggressively expanding into new areas such as food delivery, bike rentals, and even electric scooter rentals. Lyft, while also exploring new services, has focused more on its core ride-hailing business.\n\nThis focus on core services has allowed Lyft to maintain a strong reputation for reliability and customer service. In a recent survey, Lyft was rated higher than Uber in terms of overall satisfaction and driver quality. Lyft's emphasis on driver satisfaction has also led to higher driver retention rates, which can result in better service for riders.\n\nDespite these differences, both companies face similar challenges in the ride-hailing market. One of the biggest hurdles is the increasing competition from new entrants, such as JUMP and Via. These companies are using innovative technologies, such as self-driving cars and on-demand bus services, to disrupt the traditional ride-hailing model.\n\nIn response, Uber and Lyft are investing heavily in their own technologies. Uber has been developing its own self-driving car technology, while Lyft has partnered with companies like Waymo to offer self-driving rides. Both companies are also exploring new forms of transportation, such as scooters and bikes, to diversify their offerings.\n\nAs the ride-hailing market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how Uber and Lyft adapt to the changing landscape. While both companies have their strengths and weaknesses, one thing is clear: the days of simply being a ride-hailing service are behind them. The future of transportation will be shaped by innovation, technology, and a focus on customer satisfaction.",

Brushing aside any uncertainty over the Brexit vote, Barratt Developments said it was sufficiently confident in the outlook for the housing market to extend its capital return plan, including special dividend payments of Â£175m in November 2017 and November 2018. Pre-tax profit in the first half rose almost by 9% to Â£321m, beating analysts' expectations and helping to drive shares 2% higher, making Barratt one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 on Wednesday. The company also increased the interim dividend by more than a fifth to 7.3p a share for the six months to 31 December.

Minh Uong, a visual editor for The Times's business section, discussed the tech he's using. Can you explain your creative process for making and planning illustrations for The Times? Being the visual editor for the business section, I'm responsible for providing artwork that illuminates stories that are hard to photograph. It's a challenging task at times, since our section features articles with topics that are difficult to visualize. Try to think of images that relate to private equity, net neutrality or the trade deficit. Recently, I had to art a story about fake Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg accounts on Facebook and Instagram that scam people out of their money. I doodled my first thought in my sketchbook using a black Paper Mate pen showing people stealing and running away with images of Mark and Sheryl. Then I sketched a different concept showing a group of scammers hiding behind Mark and Sheryl masks. My second sketch got approved. To finish the illustration would require some time to draw the masks of Mark and Sheryl. I was planning to use Adobe's drawing program, Illustrator, and my old 10-inch Wacom tablet. But with only a few hours before our print deadline, I decided to pursue creating the art with photography instead, and needed to create props for people to hold during a photo shoot. So I printed out 10 full-size faces of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg on our color Canon copier-printer combo. Using the printed faces, Minh Uong and his team set up a photo shoot with props to create the illustration. \"I asked our photo editor to help me find some props that would fit the theme of the story,\" Minh explained. \"We ended up using fake money, fake phones, and some silly glasses to make it look like the scammers were using the fake accounts to steal people's money.\"\n\nThe team took around 20-30 photos, and Minh then used Adobe Photoshop to edit and composite the images. \"I used the clone stamp tool to remove any distractions in the background and to make sure the props looked like they were being held by the people in the photo,\" he said.\n\nThe final illustration featured a group of people holding fake phones and money, with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg masks on their faces. The image was published in The New York Times and helped to illustrate the story in a way that was both engaging and informative.\n\nMinh's experience highlights the importance of being flexible and adaptable in a fast-paced news environment. \"As a visual editor, I have to be prepared to pivot at a moment's notice and adjust my plans accordingly,\" he said. \"In this case, I had to switch from drawing to photography, but the end result was still effective in communicating the story to our readers.\"\n\nIn addition to his work on The New York Times, Minh is also an avid user of technology in his personal life. \"I'm a bit of a tech enthusiast, and I love trying out new gadgets and software,\" he said. \"I've been using a Surface Pro tablet for a few years now, and I'm really impressed with its versatility and portability.\"\n\nMinh is also a fan of virtual reality (VR) technology and has been experimenting with using it to create interactive illustrations. \"I think VR has the potential to revolutionize the way we consume news and information,\" he said. \"Imagine being able to immerse yourself in a story and experience it in a completely new way. It's an exciting time to be a visual editor, that's for sure.\"\n\nOverall, Minh's experience as a visual editor at The New York Times is a great example of how technology can be used to enhance and inform our understanding of the world around us. From creating illustrations that illuminate complex stories to experimenting with new technologies like VR, Minh is always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of visual journalism.",

I was a small and unwitting cog in a vast, beguiling narrative of unfurling geopolitical upheaval encompassing the Trump presidency, Russian interference and Brexit. Here's what Facebook told me. I was not one of the 270,000-odd people who signed up to the now infamous This is Your Digital Life survey app but one of my friends was. As a result, Facebook \"probably\" shared my public profile, page likes, my date of birth and the city I lived in. Oh, and if I'd written messages â€“ public or private â€“ to my friend who did the quiz, they might have shared those too. Guardian Australia has revealed that only 53 people in Australia installed the app. Was one of my friends among them? As I scrolled through the Facebook notification, my mind began to race with questions. Who was my friend who had installed the app? Was it someone I was close to, or just a distant acquaintance? And what exactly did Facebook mean by \"probably\" shared my data? The ambiguity was unsettling, to say the least.\n\nI decided to dig deeper, reaching out to my friends and acquaintances to see if anyone else had received a similar notification. The responses were varied, with some expressing relief that their data hadn't been compromised, while others were more concerned about the potential consequences.\n\nOne friend, who wished to remain anonymous, revealed that they had indeed installed the app and had no recollection of doing so. \"I don't remember signing up for anything like that,\" they said. \"I'm not even sure what the app was for.\"\n\nAs the conversation continued, it became clear that the impact of Cambridge Analytica's data harvesting was far-reaching and complex. The company, which was acquired by SCL Group in 2017, had been accused of using the harvested data to influence elections and political outcomes around the world.\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, Facebook has faced intense scrutiny and criticism, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in the way the company handles user data. The company has since implemented new measures to prevent similar breaches in the future, including the introduction of stricter data privacy policies and the creation of an independent oversight board.\n\nFor Australians, the Cambridge Analytica scandal has raised important questions about the protection of personal data and the role of social media in shaping our political landscape. As the country prepares for the next federal election, concerns about data privacy and online manipulation are likely to remain at the forefront of the national conversation.\n\nIn the meantime, I've been left wondering about the true extent of Cambridge Analytica's reach and the potential consequences of their actions. As I navigate the complexities of online identity and data privacy, I'm reminded of the importance of staying vigilant and informed in the digital age.",

        "Text": "In 1921, Anne O'Hare McCormick had little journalism experience when she wrote to Carr V. Van Anda, the managing editor at The New York Times. It might have been a long shot, but she asked if she could submit articles to the newspaper when she went to Europe with her husband. At the time, there were few women working as reporters, even fewer working as international correspondents. Most women wrote for the society pages. But the editor would be under no obligation to print her articles, and would have to pay her only if they were accepted. She would go on to overcome a mountain of obstacles for female reporters, earning worldwide respect and becoming the first woman to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize in one of its major journalism categories in 1937. It would be 14 years until the next woman would win. That is a striking contrast to the annual awards handed down this week, which included recognition of The Times's coverage of sexual harassment in Hollywood, media and other fields, an effort reported and edited mostly by women. (Women now have 39 percent of the bylines in The Times, just above the industry average of 38.1 percent, according to the Women's Media Center.) Ms. McCormick won her Pulitzer one year after becoming the first woman on the editorial board of The Times, writing three columns a week on world affairs. She had insisted that would not be improperly pigeonholed. As a pioneering female journalist, Anne O'Hare McCormick's achievement was not only a testament to her exceptional reporting skills but also a significant milestone in the fight for gender equality in the newsroom. Her determination to break down barriers and challenge traditional norms paved the way for future generations of women journalists.\n\nMcCormick's journey to becoming the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize was marked by numerous challenges and setbacks. Despite her lack of experience, she was undeterred and continued to push for recognition, eventually becoming a respected voice in international journalism. Her contributions to The New York Times were instrumental in shaping the paper's coverage of global affairs, and her columns on world affairs were widely read and admired.\n\nThe significance of McCormick's achievement cannot be overstated. Her win in 1937 marked a turning point in the history of women in journalism, demonstrating that women were capable of producing high-quality reporting and analysis on the same level as their male counterparts. It also highlighted the importance of diversity and inclusion in the newsroom, as women began to take on more prominent roles in reporting and editing.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and the progress made by women in journalism is undeniable. The annual Pulitzer Prizes, which recognize excellence in journalism, have seen a significant increase in the number of women winners. In recent years, women have won Pulitzers in categories such as public service, feature writing, and editorial cartooning, among others.\n\nThe recognition of The New York Times' coverage of sexual harassment in Hollywood, media, and other fields is a testament to the important role that women play in shaping the news agenda. The paper's reporting, led by women, has shed light on a pervasive issue that has had far-reaching consequences for individuals and society as a whole.\n\nAs the news industry continues to evolve, it is essential that we recognize the contributions of women like Anne O'Hare McCormick, who paved the way for future generations of female journalists. Their dedication, perseverance, and commitment to excellence have helped to create a more diverse and inclusive newsroom, where women are valued and respected for their skills and expertise.",

        "Text": "A Fossilized Finger Bone May Be From the Earliest Humans on the Arabian Peninsula\n\nArchaeologists on Monday announced the discovery of a fossilized human finger bone in the desert of Saudi Arabia that they said was 85,000 years old. If confirmed, the finding would be the first and earliest Homo sapiens fossil found on the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the oldest specimen of our species to be directly dated outside of Africa and its doorstep, the Levant. Along with recent finds of 80,000-year-old human teeth from Asia and 65,000-year-old human relics from Australia, the Arabian finger bone provides further evidence that early modern humans spread out of Africa much earlier and farther than previously thought. \"It's a discovery that we've been expecting for a while,\" said Robyn Inglis, an archaeologist at the University of York in England who was not involved in the research. \"It's become increasingly clear that humans dispersed far out of Africa and the Levant before 60,000 years ago, a date suggested by genetics.\" Traditionally, the migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa was portrayed as a single exodus from the continent that highlights one stop to the next, like a New York City subway map. But archaeologists and paleoanthropologists have challenged that idea, saying the journey was much more complicated and probably filled with numerous routes, departures and delays. \"This discovery of a fossil finger bone for me is like a dream come true because it supports arguments that our teams have been making for more than 10 years,\" Michael Petraglia, an archaeologist from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany and an author on the paper, which was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, said during a media briefing. \"This find, together with other finds in the last few years, suggest that modern humans, Homo sapiens, are moving out of Africa multiple times during many windows of opportunity during the last 100,000 years or so,\" he said. Arabia was at the heart of that dispersal from Africa into Asia. But at the time when this ancient person lived, the Arabian Peninsula was almost alien from what it is today. Instead of being bone dry with endless red sand, it was a lush grassland awash in lakes and rivers and teeming with wildlife like ostriches, gazelles and hippos. The discovery of the fossilized finger bone, which is estimated to be around 85,000 years old, provides a significant piece of evidence to support the theory that early modern humans spread out of Africa much earlier and farther than previously thought. According to the researchers, the find suggests that modern humans, Homo sapiens, made multiple migrations out of Africa during various windows of opportunity over the past 100,000 years.\n\nThe Arabian Peninsula, which is now a desert, was once a lush grassland teeming with wildlife. The discovery of the fossilized finger bone, along with other recent finds, provides a glimpse into the lives of early humans who lived in this region. The researchers believe that the finger bone belongs to a person who lived in the region during a time when the climate was much more humid and the landscape was vastly different from what it is today.\n\n\"This discovery is a game-changer,\" said Dr. Petraglia. \"It shows that early modern humans were much more adaptable and resourceful than we previously thought. They were able to survive and thrive in a wide range of environments, from the deserts of Arabia to the grasslands of Asia.\"\n\nThe researchers used a combination of geological and archaeological techniques to date the fossilized finger bone. They analyzed the bone's chemical composition and compared it to other fossils found in the region to determine its age. The team also used radiocarbon dating to confirm the age of the bone.\n\nThe discovery of the fossilized finger bone is significant not only because of its age but also because it provides a unique glimpse into the lives of early humans who lived in the region. The researchers believe that the finger bone may have belonged to a person who was part of a larger group of early humans who migrated out of Africa and into Asia.\n\n\"This find is a testament to the incredible adaptability and resilience of early humans,\" said Dr. Inglis. \"It shows that they were able to survive and thrive in a wide range of environments, from the deserts of Arabia to the grasslands of Asia.\"\n\nThe discovery of the fossilized finger bone is a significant milestone in the field of archaeology and provides new insights into the migration patterns of early humans. The researchers hope that the find will continue to shed light on the lives of early humans who lived in the region and will provide a better understanding of the migration patterns of early humans.\n\n\"This discovery is a reminder of the incredible complexity and diversity of human history,\" said Dr. Petraglia. \"It shows that early humans were much more than just a single group of people who migrated out of Africa. They were a diverse and dynamic group of individuals who were able to adapt to a wide range of environments and circumstances.\"",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON  Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank did not intend to start raising short-term interest rates anytime soon, saying the economic recovery would remain halting for many more months. In presenting the Fed's semiannual monetary report to Congress, he did not waver from his recent statements on monetary policy. And the reassurance helped lift the stock market, even as a new report showed a drop in sales of new homes. It was Mr. Bernanke's first testimony since a grueling confirmation process ended last month, when the Senate gave him a second term as chairman by the narrowest margin in the Fed's history. In what appeared to be a deliberate response to the criticisms leveled at the Fed, Mr. Bernanke announced support for two measures to improve oversight of the extraordinary lending programs the Fed started in 2008. In one of the moves toward openness, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed would back legislation requiring the eventual release of the names of borrowers that used the programs. He also said the Fed had undertaken \"an intensive self-examination\" of its regulatory duties, after years in which it had failed to curb some of the most excessive risk-taking by the banks it supervises. The move is seen as a significant step towards greater transparency and accountability, particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed's extraordinary lending programs, known as quantitative easing, have been widely criticized for their lack of transparency and potential for moral hazard.\n\nThe proposed legislation, which would require the release of borrower names, is expected to face resistance from some lawmakers and financial institutions. However, Bernanke's announcement has been met with widespread approval from lawmakers and financial experts, who see it as a necessary step towards rebuilding trust in the financial system.\n\n\"Chairman Bernanke's commitment to transparency is a welcome development,\" said Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan who has been a vocal critic of the Fed's lending programs. \"The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being used to prop up the financial system.\"\n\nThe Fed's self-examination of its regulatory duties is also seen as a positive step. The central bank has faced criticism for its failure to adequately supervise some of the largest banks in the country, which led to the financial crisis.\n\n\"We recognize that we did not do enough to prevent the crisis, and we are committed to learning from our mistakes,\" Bernanke said in his testimony. \"We are taking a hard look at our regulatory framework and identifying areas where we can improve.\"\n\nThe Fed's efforts to improve oversight of the financial system are expected to be closely watched by lawmakers and financial regulators. The central bank has already taken steps to tighten its supervision of the largest banks, including requiring them to hold more capital and liquidity.\n\nIn addition to the proposed legislation and self-examination, Bernanke also announced that the Fed would be implementing new rules to govern its emergency lending programs. The new rules are designed to ensure that the programs are used only in times of extreme financial stress and that they do not create moral hazard.\n\nThe Fed's efforts to improve transparency and accountability are expected to have far-reaching implications for the financial system. They are seen as a necessary step towards rebuilding trust in the financial system and preventing future crises.\n\n\"The Fed's commitment to transparency and accountability is a major step forward,\" said Sheila Bair, the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"It's a recognition that the Fed's actions have a significant impact on the economy and that it needs to be more transparent and accountable in its decision-making.\"\n\nOverall, Bernanke's testimony is seen as a positive development for the financial system. The Fed's commitment to transparency and accountability is expected to help rebuild trust in the financial system and prevent future crises.",

At the weekend, GKN executives gave bullish interviews in which they expressed confidence that investors would back the industrial group, including pointed references to long-term shareholders supporting its strategy. Short-term investors, including hedge funds, control about 25% of GKN. GKN rowed back on those interviews on Monday. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, it said: \"These statements of shareholder support in respect of GKN were not verified and are hereby retracted.\" The Sunday Telegraph had quoted Anne Stevens, the GKN chief executive, as saying she was \"convinced investors will back [GKN]\". The Sunday Times quoted Jos Sclater, the finance director, as saying that \"long-only shareholders are mostly supportive of existing management, and understand that the Dana deal and becoming a pure play aerospace company has, longer term, significantly more value than the Melrose bid\". The sudden retraction of GKN's statements has sent shockwaves through the financial community, with many analysts questioning the company's confidence in its ability to fend off the Melrose bid. The news has also sparked concerns among investors, who are now left wondering what the true level of shareholder support is for GKN.\n\nIndustry experts suggest that the retraction may be a sign of weakness on GKN's part, as it struggles to rally support among its shareholders. \"GKN's retraction of its previous statements is a clear indication that they are not as confident as they claimed to be,\" said Emma Taylor, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. \"The company's attempts to rally support among its shareholders have clearly failed, and now they are left scrambling to try and salvage what's left of their bid.\"\n\nThe Melrose bid, which was launched in January, has been met with resistance from GKN's management team, who argue that the takeover would lead to job losses and damage the company's long-term prospects. However, Melrose has maintained that its bid is in the best interests of GKN's shareholders, and has offered to pay Â£11.50 per share, a premium of around 30% on the company's current stock price.\n\nDespite GKN's retraction of its previous statements, the company's board remains committed to resisting the Melrose bid. In a statement, the company said: \"GKN's board remains convinced that the Melrose offer undervalues the company and is not in the best interests of its shareholders. We will continue to explore all options to maximize value for our shareholders.\"\n\nThe battle for control of GKN is expected to continue in the coming weeks, with both sides engaging in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. The outcome of the bid is far from certain, and it remains to be seen whether Melrose will be able to successfully acquire the company. One thing is clear, however: the fate of GKN hangs in the balance, and the company's future is uncertain.",

The figures published on Friday revealed that House of Fraser made a Â£54.6m operating loss, worse than the Â£50m expected by analysts. In a frank admission, the Sports Direct chief executive, Mike Ashley, indicated he regretted buying the ailing business last August. The group confirmed plans to close a number of House of Fraser's stores in the year ahead. The announcement sent shockwaves through the retail industry, with many analysts questioning the wisdom of the acquisition. Despite Sports Direct's efforts to revamp the brand and cut costs, it appears that the company has struggled to turn around the fortunes of House of Fraser.\n\nThe news comes as a significant blow to the thousands of employees who work for the department store chain, with many facing an uncertain future. The company has already begun the process of consulting with staff and union representatives, with redundancies expected to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe struggling retail sector has been a major concern for policymakers and business leaders in recent years, with many high-street brands struggling to adapt to the rise of online shopping and changing consumer habits. The fate of House of Fraser serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing traditional retailers, and the need for innovative strategies to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nSports Direct's acquisition of House of Fraser was seen as a bold move by Ashley, who had previously expressed his desire to create a dominant force in the UK retail market.

The coalition builds on a program called American Honors to create honors programs within community colleges, with competitive admissions, demanding academics and intensive guidance for highly talented students. That program, created by a for-profit company, Quad Learning, and a handful of community colleges, is less than two years old and still small -- only about 230 students at five community college campuses -- but plans call for it to grow rapidly, quadrupling the number of students by next fall. The new alliance, which will be formally announced on Friday, seeks to expand the American Honors program to a larger group of colleges, with the goal of creating a network of community colleges that can offer high-quality, transferable education to students from diverse backgrounds. The coalition will be led by a group of community college presidents, who will work together to develop and implement the program's curriculum, admissions standards, and support services.\n\nAccording to the program's founders, the key to its success lies in its ability to provide highly motivated and talented students with a challenging and supportive learning environment. The American Honors program will offer students a range of benefits, including small class sizes, personalized advising, and access to state-of-the-art facilities and technology.\n\nThe program's curriculum will be designed to be transferable to four-year colleges and universities, with a focus on providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in a rapidly changing world. The program will also offer students opportunities to participate in internships, research projects, and other experiential learning activities, which will help them to develop important skills and make connections in their field.\n\nThe alliance's leaders are optimistic about the potential of the American Honors program to improve student outcomes and increase access to higher education. \"We believe that every student deserves the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, president of the alliance. \"By providing highly motivated and talented students with a challenging and supportive learning environment, we can help them to achieve their goals and make a positive impact in their communities.\"\n\nThe program's growth is expected to be rapid, with plans to quadruple the number of students by next fall. The alliance is already in talks with several community colleges and four-year institutions to join the program, and is expected to announce several new partnerships in the coming months.\n\nThe American Honors program is a significant development in the world of higher education, as it seeks to address the long-standing issue of community college transfer rates. According to the National Student Clearinghouse, only about 15% of community college students transfer to four-year institutions, with many students failing to complete their degree due to lack of access to resources and support.\n\nBy providing highly motivated and talented students with a challenging and supportive learning environment, the American Honors program aims to increase transfer rates and help students to achieve their goals. The program's founders are confident that it will make a positive impact on the lives of students and communities across the country.",

One teacher even told me I should consider a different career because children wouldn't understand me. I now know he was wrong. I've had a stammer since I was 14 and it has given me many obstacles to overcome. In primary school I was mocked and other children would sometimes imitate me. As a result, I refused to put my hand up in lessons. I was scared of what people would say. By the time I got to secondary school, I knew I needed to work with my stammer and not against it. I didn't want to be someone who never spoke, so I started to push myself. I did things I didn't enjoy, like going first in presentations or choosing to study drama. I hated these things and still stammered, but at least I now stammered with more confidence. I was good at maths and helped support my teacher in some of his classes. That's when I realised I was good at teaching other students. So after studying sports science at university, I applied to do a PGCE maths teacher training course. As I embarked on my teacher training journey, I was determined to prove to myself and others that my stammer would not hold me back. I was nervous about the potential reactions of my students and colleagues, but I was also excited to share my unique perspective and experiences with them.\n\nDuring my training, I worked closely with my tutors and peers to develop strategies to manage my stammer in the classroom. We practiced techniques such as slowing down my speech, taking pauses, and using visual aids to help my students understand me better. I also learned to be kind to myself and not get frustrated when my stammer got the better of me.\n\nWhen I started my first teaching job, I was anxious about how my students would react to my stammer. But to my surprise, they were incredibly supportive and accepting. They would often ask me questions about my stammer and how they could help me, which made me feel seen and understood.\n\nAs I settled into my new role, I realized that my stammer had actually become a strength in the classroom. My students were more engaged and attentive when I spoke, as they were fascinated by my unique way of communicating. I also found that my stammer helped me to connect with my students on a deeper level, as they appreciated my honesty and vulnerability.\n\nMy experience as a teacher with a stammer has also taught me the importance of self-acceptance and self-compassion. I've learned to embrace my stammer and not let it define me. I've also become an advocate for stammering awareness and have spoken publicly about my experiences to help reduce stigma and promote understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, I am proud to be a teacher with a stammer, and I hope that my story will inspire others to be proud of their own unique qualities and abilities. I know that my stammer has given me many obstacles to overcome, but it has also given me a unique perspective and a passion for teaching that I wouldn't trade for anything.",

It Could Happen, and Sooner Than Astronomers Expected\n\nAn animation depicting what Saturn's rings might look in the next 100 to 300 million years, before they vanish. Saturn's icy rings are among the most iconic features in the solar system.\n\nIn a shocking revelation, astronomers have discovered that Saturn's majestic rings could disappear much sooner than previously thought. According to a recent study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, the rings are expected to vanish in as little as 100 to 300 million years, a timeframe significantly shorter than the estimated 300-500 million years previously predicted.\n\nThe rings, composed of ice and rock particles, are a marvel of celestial engineering, stretching across 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) of Saturn's equator. However, they are also a fragile and dynamic system, constantly being reshaped by the planet's gravitational forces and collisions with smaller moonlets.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Colorado Boulder used advanced computer simulations to model the evolution of Saturn's rings over millions of years. Their findings suggest that the rings are experiencing a rapid decline in mass, largely due to the gravitational influence of Saturn's moon, Pan.\n\nPan, which orbits within the rings, is slowly pulling material inward, causing the rings to shrink and become less dense. As the rings lose mass, they become more susceptible to collisions with Saturn's other moons, further accelerating their demise.\n\n\"This is a significant discovery, as it challenges our current understanding of the long-term evolution of Saturn's rings,\" said Dr. Matthew Tiscareno, lead author of the study. \"We're seeing a rapid change in the rings' behavior, and it's likely that they will disappear much sooner than we previously thought.\"\n\nThe loss of Saturn's rings would be a significant loss for astronomers and the general public alike. The rings have captivated scientists for centuries, providing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. Moreover, the rings have played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of planetary formation and the interactions between celestial bodies.\n\nAs researchers continue to study the rings' decline, they hope to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving this process. This knowledge could ultimately inform our understanding of other planetary systems, where similar ring systems may be present.\n\nFor now, astronomers are left to marvel at the fleeting beauty of Saturn's rings, knowing that their time is limited. As the rings continue to shrink, they will eventually disappear, leaving behind a barren, icy landscape that will forever change the face of our solar system.",

These noises are not associated with significant pain, but lead to abrupt arousal and feelings of fright\". Although this phenomenon was first described as long ago as 1876, it was not given its colourful title until 1988. Despite its long history, it has received very little systematic research attention, with most of our knowledge being based upon small samples of case histories as opposed to large-scale investigations. We, the authors of this piece, along with the world's leading authority on EHS, Dr Brian Sharpless of Argosy University, Northern Virginia, are hoping to rectify that situation by carrying out a large-scale survey of EHS. We're also interested in the equally intriguing phenomenon of sleep paralysis, which involves a temporary period of paralysis occurring between sleep and wakefulness, often accompanied by hallucinations. If you have ever experienced either EHS or sleep paralysis, or even if you haven't, we would love to hear from you. In addition to explosions, other types of loud noise perceived during episodes of EHS include gunshots, fireworks, thunder, doors slamming, clapping, shouting, and the clash of cymbals. There can also be beeps, buzzing and video static. As part of our large-scale survey, we are seeking to understand the prevalence of EHS and sleep paralysis, as well as the demographic and lifestyle factors that may contribute to their occurrence. We are also interested in exploring the potential triggers and underlying causes of these phenomena.\n\nTo participate in the survey, individuals can visit our website and complete a brief online questionnaire. The survey will ask about their experiences with EHS and sleep paralysis, including the frequency and intensity of episodes, as well as any associated symptoms or feelings of fear or anxiety.\n\nDr. Sharpless, who is leading the research effort, emphasized the importance of understanding these sleep disorders. \"EHS and sleep paralysis are often misunderstood and underreported,\" he said. \"By studying these phenomena, we hope to shed light on the underlying causes and develop more effective treatments for those who experience them.\"\n\nThe survey is open to anyone who has experienced EHS or sleep paralysis, as well as those who have not. The researchers believe that by gathering a large and diverse dataset, they will be able to identify patterns and trends that can inform our understanding of these sleep disorders.\n\nIn addition to the online survey, the research team is also conducting in-depth interviews with individuals who have experienced EHS or sleep paralysis. These interviews will provide valuable insights into the experiences and perspectives of those who have been affected by these phenomena.\n\nThe research has the potential to not only improve our understanding of EHS and sleep paralysis, but also to inform the development of new treatments and therapies for these conditions. By shedding light on these often-misunderstood sleep disorders, the researchers hope to make a positive impact on the lives of those who experience them.\n\nIf you have experienced EHS or sleep paralysis, or if you are simply interested in learning more about these phenomena, we encourage you to participate in the survey. Your input will help to advance our understanding of these sleep disorders and could potentially lead to new and effective treatments.",

Today, a daily pill gives me an average life expectancy and makes it impossible to pass the virus on. But there's one last major health barrier: the social stigma, and the mental health issues it causes. Worryingly, this is so prevalent that it can even come from those who claim to be experts on the topic. In my case, this happened when I disclosed my status to academic mentors. Three days after my diagnosis, a professor specialising in sexual health contacted me online to share her views about HIV-positive people. She said the virus affected only reckless people, who couldn't be trusted to take their meds. I was taken aback by her words, feeling a mix of emotions: shock, hurt, and betrayal. I had confided in her, expecting empathy and understanding, but instead, I was met with judgment and stigma. It was a painful reminder that, despite the medical advancements, the social stigma surrounding HIV remains a significant obstacle for those living with the virus.\n\nAs I navigated the aftermath of her hurtful comments, I began to realize that I was not alone. Many HIV-positive individuals face similar experiences, often at the hands of those who claim to be experts in the field. It's a phenomenon that has been documented in various studies, with researchers finding that healthcare providers, educators, and even family members can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV.\n\nThe consequences of this stigma can be devastating. HIV-positive individuals may experience anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation, making it difficult for them to seek medical care, adhere to treatment regimens, or disclose their status to others. In extreme cases, it can even lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\n\nTo combat this stigma, it's essential to educate ourselves and others about HIV. This includes dispelling common myths and misconceptions, such as the notion that HIV is only contracted through reckless behavior. In reality, HIV can be transmitted through any type of sexual activity, as well as through sharing contaminated needles or blood products.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to promote a culture of empathy, understanding, and inclusivity. This can be achieved by encouraging open conversations about HIV, providing accurate information and resources, and supporting organizations that work to reduce stigma and promote awareness.\n\nAs I continue to navigate my own journey with HIV, I am determined to use my experience to raise awareness and challenge the stigma surrounding the virus. I hope that by sharing my story, I can inspire others to do the same, and together, we can create a world where HIV-positive individuals are treated with the respect, dignity, and understanding they deserve.",

India's first moon lander, which fell silent as it headed toward the lunar surface on Friday, has been located from orbit, the country's space agency says. That has created hope that it might be revived. If it did indeed land in working condition, that would be an impressive feat. In the history of spaceflight, robotic probes that suffer a malfunction while landing on another world are not heard from again. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] The Indian Space Research Organization -- India's equivalent of NASA -- tweeted on Tuesday that its efforts to contact the lander were ongoing. The Vikram moon lander, named after the Indian space scientist Vikram Sarabhai, was part of the Chandrayaan-3 mission, India's latest lunar expedition. The mission aimed to explore the south polar region of the moon, which is believed to have water ice and other valuable resources.\n\nAccording to ISRO officials, the Vikram lander was scheduled to touch down on the moon's surface at around 1:55 am IST (Indian Standard Time) on Saturday. However, the lander lost contact with Earth just 2.1 kilometers above the lunar surface, leaving scientists and engineers scrambling to reestablish communication.\n\nDespite the setback, ISRO officials expressed optimism about the possibility of reviving the lander. \"We are trying to reestablish communication with the lander, and we are hopeful that we will be able to do so,\" said Dr. K. Sivan, the Chairman of ISRO, in a statement.\n\nThe Vikram lander was equipped with advanced technology, including a high-resolution camera and a seismometer to study the moon's surface and internal structure. If it is revived, the lander could provide valuable insights into the moon's composition and geology.\n\nThe Chandrayaan-3 mission is a significant milestone for India's space program, which has made rapid progress in recent years. India became the fourth country to successfully launch a spacecraft to Mars in 2014, and it has also launched several satellites and probes to study the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field.\n\nThe Vikram lander's mission is not only important for India's space program but also for the global scientific community. The moon is a valuable resource for scientists, who can use it to study the early history of the solar system and gain insights into the formation of planets.\n\nAs ISRO officials continue to work on reviving the Vikram lander, the world waits with bated breath for news of its progress. If the lander is successfully revived, it will be a major achievement for India's space program and a significant step forward for lunar exploration.",

        "Text": "Trips to Israel top the list of politicians' travel paid for by non-Australian government sponsors, and the Chinese company Huawei has been the top corporate sponsor, a new report has revealed. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute's report shows Israel, China and the United States are the top three destinations. The institute analysed the period from July 2010 to May 2018 using MPs' and senators' declaration of interests to discover the largest sponsors of trips that consisted of just flights, or of flights and accommodation (the \"vast majority\"). According to the report, Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, was the largest corporate sponsor of trips for Australian politicians during the analyzed period, with a total of 144 trips paid for by the company. The report also found that Huawei sponsored trips for MPs and senators from both major parties, with Labor MPs making up the majority of the beneficiaries.\n\nThe report's findings have raised concerns among some experts about the potential influence of foreign powers on Australian politics. \"It's a significant issue,\" said Dr. Andrew Carr, a security expert at the Australian National University. \"When foreign governments or companies are paying for politicians' trips, it creates an opportunity for them to shape the politicians' views and decisions.\"\n\nThe report also highlighted the significant number of trips to Israel, with a total of 134 trips sponsored by the Israeli government or private companies. The report noted that many of these trips were focused on promoting Israel's interests in the region, particularly in relation to the Middle East peace process.\n\nThe United States was the third most popular destination, with 124 trips sponsored by the US government or private companies. The report noted that many of these trips were focused on promoting US interests in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in relation to trade and security.\n\nThe report's findings have sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability in relation to politicians' travel. \"It's essential that politicians are transparent about their travel and who is paying for it,\" said Senator Penny Wong, the Labor Party's foreign affairs spokesperson. \"We need to ensure that our politicians are not being influenced by foreign powers or companies.\"\n\nThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute's report has also raised questions about the role of corporate sponsors in shaping politicians' views and decisions. \"Corporate sponsors have a significant influence over politicians' agendas,\" said Dr. Carr. \"It's essential that we have a better understanding of who is paying for these trips and what their motivations are.\"\n\nIn response to the report's findings, the Australian government has announced plans to introduce new rules requiring politicians to disclose more information about their travel and who is paying for it. The government has also pledged to increase transparency around the use of public funds for politicians' travel.\n\nThe report's findings have also sparked debate about the role of Huawei in Australian politics. The company has faced criticism in the past over its ties to the Chinese government, and some experts have raised concerns about its potential influence over Australian politicians.\n\nThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute's report is the latest in a series of investigations into politicians' travel and the influence of foreign powers on Australian politics. The report's findings are likely to spark further debate and calls for greater transparency and accountability in relation to politicians' travel.",

Visible from miles away, it had long served as a landmark for travelers and explorers, including David Livingstone. The cavity inside its trunks -- with an outer circumference of more than 80 feet -- reportedly served as one of the continent's first post offices. Botswana considered the tree a national monument and promoted it as a sightseeing attraction. As the group of tourists approached the tree, they couldn't help but be awed by its sheer size and majesty. The Chapman's Baobab, estimated to be over 1,000 years old, stood tall and proud, its thick trunk twisted and gnarled with age. The tourists marveled at the intricate patterns etched into the bark, a testament to the tree's resilience and ability to thrive in the harsh desert environment.\n\nAs they explored the tree's interior, they discovered the remnants of the post office, a small chamber carved out of the trunk. The tourists were struck by the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the early travelers who had used this very spot to send and receive mail. The post office, which operated from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, was a remarkable example of the adaptability and determination of the people who had settled in this remote region.\n\nDespite its historical significance, the Chapman's Baobab faced threats to its survival. The tree's unique ecosystem, which relied on the moisture and nutrients from the surrounding soil, was under pressure from the increasing demands of agriculture and urbanization. The Botswana government, recognizing the importance of preserving the tree and its surroundings, had implemented measures to protect the area and promote sustainable tourism.\n\nAs the tourists continued their exploration, they were treated to a stunning display of the tree's unique features. The trunk, which was once a massive 100 feet in circumference, had shrunk significantly over the years due to the effects of climate change and human activity. However, the tree's resilience and adaptability had allowed it to continue thriving, and it remained a powerful symbol of the region's rich history and cultural heritage.\n\nThe visit to the Chapman's Baobab had a profound impact on the tourists, leaving them with a deeper appreciation for the natural world and the importance of preserving it for future generations. As they departed, they couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and reverence for this incredible tree, which had stood the test of time and continued to inspire and captivate those who visited it.",

The cricketers are also at lunch, but the commentary from BBC Test Match Special continues with an 'Ask the Umpire' session, in which bizarre and unlikely cricket scenarios are postulated, A batsman hits the ball in the air towards the stumps, it grazes the bowler's fingers, hits the stumps (with the non-striker out of his ground) and loops up into the air and is caught at mid-on. Who's out? and their resolution within the laws of cricket is explored. This prokes exasperation and amusement from the rest of my family, but then so does cricket in general to some extent. If you really want to understand the laws of cricket though (and I appreciate that is quite a big \"if\"), it is a useful exercise to imagine how they would operate in extreme cases. While I am mildly interested in the laws of cricket, I am very interested in the laws of physics. Real experiments arbitrate eventually, of course, but thought experiments have a long and productive history of pointing the way to deeper understanding. Probably the master of them was Einstein. As I sat at the table, munching on my sandwich and listening to the \"Ask the Umpire\" segment, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between the laws of cricket and the laws of physics. The commentators were debating the finer points of a hypothetical scenario, where a batsman's shot had resulted in a complex chain of events, involving a bowler's fingers, the stumps, and a mid-on fielder. The discussion was engaging, but it also got me thinking about the nature of laws and how they govern our understanding of the world.\n\nIn physics, thought experiments have long been a powerful tool for exploring complex concepts and making breakthroughs. Einstein's famous thought experiment, where he imagined chasing a light beam, led him to develop the theory of special relativity. Similarly, the concept of SchrÃ¶dinger's cat, a thought experiment designed to illustrate the principles of quantum mechanics, has had a profound impact on our understanding of the behavior of particles at the atomic level.\n\nBut what about cricket? While the laws of cricket may not have the same level of fundamental importance as the laws of physics, they still govern the game and provide a framework for understanding its intricacies. The \"Ask the Umpire\" segment on the radio was a great example of how these laws can be applied to unusual and hypothetical situations. By exploring the possibilities and consequences of different scenarios, the commentators were able to shed light on the underlying principles of the game.\n\nAs I finished my lunch and continued to listen to the commentary, I couldn't help but feel a sense of appreciation for the laws of cricket. While they may not be as universally applicable as the laws of physics, they are still an important part of the game and provide a framework for understanding its complexities. And who knows, maybe one day, a thought experiment about a particularly tricky cricket scenario will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the game.",

        "Text": "The most obvious difference between this year's GCSE results and previous years' is the new grading system measuring attainment in some subjects on a scale from 9 at best to 1 at the bottom. But whether it will have any significant impact on overall educational attainment is not clear. The shift from A*-G grades has triggered debate and confusion in schools and beyond. Hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money has been spent trying to explain it to parents, students and employers who this year have to grapple with a mixture of results from the two grading structures as the changes are rolled out gradually. The changes were initiated by the former education secretary Michael Gove to make GCSEs more challenging and to \"better recognise the achievements of high-attaining pupils\". Experts say this at least has been achieved in the first set of results, with increased differentiation at the top of the scale. There are now three top grades â€“ 7, 8 and 9 â€“ compared with just A* and A under the old system. However, the impact of the new grading system on overall educational attainment remains uncertain. While the top grades have seen increased differentiation, the number of students achieving these top grades has not necessarily increased. In fact, the proportion of students achieving a grade 4 or above, which is considered a pass, has remained relatively stable.\n\nSome critics argue that the new system is too complex and may lead to confusion among students and teachers. The shift from A*-G grades to a 9-1 scale has been likened to a \"maths problem\" by some, with many struggling to understand how the new grades translate to university and job prospects.\n\nDespite these concerns, the new grading system has been praised by some for providing a more nuanced and detailed picture of student achievement. The increased differentiation at the top of the scale is seen as a positive step, as it allows teachers to better identify and support high-attaining students.\n\nThe impact of the new grading system on students' university and job prospects is also a topic of debate. Some argue that the new system will make it more difficult for students to compare their results with those of previous years, while others believe that the increased differentiation will provide a more accurate reflection of students' abilities.\n\nThe roll-out of the new grading system has not been without its challenges. Many schools have reported difficulties in communicating the changes to parents and students, with some feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the new system. The government has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on public awareness campaigns and support materials for schools, but some argue that more needs to be done to help students and teachers adjust to the changes.\n\nDespite the challenges, the new grading system is seen as a significant step forward in the development of GCSEs. The changes are designed to provide a more rigorous and challenging qualification, and to better prepare students for the demands of higher education and the workplace. As the system continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether it will have a lasting impact on educational attainment and student success.",

Feeney's statement was met with widespread support from environmental groups, who have been vocal in their opposition to the Adani mine for years. The Australian Conservation Foundation praised Feeney's decision, saying it was a \"bold move\" that showed the Labor Party was finally taking the concerns of the community seriously.\n\n\"David Feeney has shown that he is willing to listen to the concerns of the community and stand up for what is right,\" said the foundation's CEO, Kelly O'Shanassy. \"We urge all MPs to follow his lead and reject the Adani mine, which would be a disaster for the environment and the people of Queensland.\"\n\nFeeney's colleague, Peter Khalil, also expressed concerns about the project, citing the potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef. \"As a Labor MP, I have a responsibility to represent the interests of my constituents and the wider community,\" Khalil said. \"I believe that the Adani mine would have significant and long-lasting impacts on the reef, and I cannot support it.\"\n\nThe Adani mine has been a contentious issue in Australia for years, with many environmental groups and scientists warning of the potential risks to the environment and the community. The mine, which is planned for the Galilee Basin in Queensland, would be one of the largest coal mines in the country and would require significant amounts of water and energy to operate.\n\nDespite the concerns, the Queensland government has given the mine the green light, and Adani has begun construction on the project.

Just about everything, according to the new chief executive, Jonathan Lewis, making full use of an incomer's prerogative to tell it as it is. \"Capita is too complex, it is driven by a short-term focus and lacks operational discipline and financial flexibility,\" he declared, volunteering underinvestment in IT and an addiction to acquisitions for good measure. Lewis' candid assessment of the company's state was a stark departure from the more optimistic tone of his predecessor, Andy Parker, who had been in charge since 2017. Parker had been tasked with turning around the company's fortunes, but ultimately failed to deliver significant improvements.\n\nLewis, who took the reins in January, has already begun implementing a series of sweeping changes aimed at addressing the company's myriad problems. One of his first moves was to announce a major restructuring effort, which will see the company shed thousands of jobs and consolidate its operations.\n\nThe IT underinvestment Lewis mentioned is a significant issue, as it has left the company's systems outdated and vulnerable to cyber attacks. In recent years, Capita has suffered a number of high-profile data breaches, which have resulted in significant financial losses and damage to its reputation.\n\nThe addiction to acquisitions, meanwhile, has led to a bloated portfolio of businesses that are not necessarily aligned with the company's core strengths. This has resulted in a lack of focus and a diversion of resources away from the company's core operations.\n\nLewis is also looking to improve the company's financial flexibility by reducing its debt and improving its cash flow. This will involve a combination of cost-cutting measures, such as reducing overheads and renegotiating contracts with suppliers, as well as seeking to sell off non-core assets.\n\nThe new CEO is also looking to refocus the company on its core strengths, which include its expertise in IT and business process outsourcing. He has announced plans to invest in new technologies and processes, and to expand the company's presence in key markets such as healthcare and financial services.\n\nWhile the road ahead will be challenging, Lewis is confident that Capita can be turned around. \"We have a unique set of skills and capabilities, and we have a great brand,\" he said in an interview. \"But we need to get back to basics and focus on what we do best. We need to simplify our operations, reduce our costs, and improve our financial performance.\"\n\nLewis' plan is to deliver a significant turnaround in the next two to three years, and to make Capita a more attractive proposition for investors and customers alike. It's a tall order, but with a new CEO at the helm and a renewed focus on the company's core strengths, Capita may finally be able to turn the corner and start moving in the right direction.",

University technical colleges (UTCs), a type of free school focusing on teaching students who are usually aged between 14 and 19, were also less likely to be rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted, a report by the National Audit Office said. The UTC programme has cost Â£792m since it was launched in 2010 with the aim of employers and universities working together to provide technical education, according to the NAO report. Designed by Lord Baker, a minister under Margaret Thatcher, they were intended to give 14-year-olds the option of a technical, artistic and creative education, or an academic education. The report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the UTC program, which was launched with the aim of providing technical education to students. The NAO found that only 52% of UTCs are currently full, leaving a significant proportion of capacity unused. Furthermore, the report revealed that UTCs are less likely to be rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted, with only 44% achieving this rating compared to 63% of other secondary schools.\n\nThe NAO also found that the UTC program has struggled to attract students from disadvantaged backgrounds, with only 22% of students eligible for free school meals attending UTCs. This is despite the fact that the program was intended to provide opportunities for students from all backgrounds to access technical education.\n\nThe report's findings have been met with criticism from education experts, who argue that the UTC program has failed to deliver on its promises. \"The UTC program was supposed to provide a new route into technical education, but it has been a disaster,\" said Dr. John Dunford, a former headteacher and education consultant. \"The lack of diversity among UTC students and the poor performance of many UTCs are major concerns.\"\n\nThe NAO report has also raised questions about the value for money of the UTC program. With a total cost of Â£792m since its launch in 2010, the program has been criticized for being expensive and ineffective. \"The UTC program has been a costly failure,\" said Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner. \"The government needs to rethink its approach to technical education and provide more support for schools that are already doing a good job.\"\n\nIn response to the report's findings, the Department for Education has defended the UTC program, saying that it remains committed to providing technical education opportunities to students. \"UTCs are an important part of our education system, providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the modern economy,\" said a spokesperson for the Department for Education. \"We will continue to work with UTCs to improve their performance and ensure that they are providing the best possible education for their students.\"\n\nThe report's findings have sparked a debate about the future of the UTC program, with some calling for it to be scrapped and others arguing that it should be reformed to better meet the needs of students. As the government considers its next steps, it is clear that the UTC program will need to demonstrate significant improvement if it is to remain a viable part of the UK's education system.",

The Canadian aerospace company put the historic Short Brothers plant up for sale in May after a difficult period for the factory, where wings are made for Airbus's A220 aircraft and which supplies parts for Airbus's A320neo and Bombardier business and regional jets. Spirit, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, will pay Bombardier $500m in cash, and will take on $300m in pension liabilities and $290m in government grant repayment obligations. A spokeswoman for Bombardier said there were no workforce adjustments included in the deal. About 4,000 employees will transfer to Spirit, including those at smaller operations in the US and Morocco which are also part of the deal. The deal marks a significant milestone in the history of the Short Brothers plant, which has been a major employer in Belfast since 1936. The factory has been a vital part of the city's economy, producing wings for some of the world's most popular commercial aircraft.\n\nThe sale to Spirit Aerosystems is expected to bring stability and investment to the factory, which has faced challenges in recent years due to declining demand for Bombardier's business jets. The deal is also a testament to the resilience and skills of the workforce at the plant, which has continued to produce high-quality wings despite the uncertainty surrounding its future.\n\nSpirit Aerosystems, which is a leading supplier of aircraft parts and components, has pledged to maintain the factory's operations and invest in its facilities and workforce. The company has also committed to honoring the existing contracts and agreements with the unionized workforce, ensuring a smooth transition for employees.\n\nThe deal is subject to regulatory approvals, including clearance from the European Commission, and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once the deal is finalized, Spirit Aerosystems will take over the management and operation of the factory, with Bombardier retaining a minority stake in the business.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by local politicians and business leaders, who have praised the deal as a major boost for the city's economy. The Northern Ireland Assembly's Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: \"This is a significant investment in the region and a testament to the skills and expertise of the workforce at the Short Brothers plant. We look forward to working with Spirit Aerosystems to ensure a smooth transition and to support the growth of the business in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe deal is also expected to have a positive impact on the wider aerospace industry in Northern Ireland, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. The region is home to a number of major aerospace companies, including Bombardier's rival, Airbus, and the deal is expected to create new opportunities for collaboration and investment in the sector.\n\nIn conclusion, the sale of the Short Brothers plant to Spirit Aerosystems marks a new chapter in the history of the factory, and is a significant milestone for the aerospace industry in Northern Ireland. The deal is expected to bring stability and investment to the factory, and to create new opportunities for the workforce and the wider economy.",

The high street has suffered a painful year, caught in a pincer movement between the fundamental shift to online and weakness in consumer spending that many economists have blamed on Brexit-affected inflation and increased uncertainty. As the holiday season approaches, retailers are bracing themselves for a challenging period, with many struggling to maintain sales and profitability. The UK's high street has been particularly hard hit, with a significant number of store closures and job losses reported across various sectors.\n\nAccording to data from the British Retail Consortium, total UK retail sales fell by 0.3% in November, the first decline in seven months. The sector has been grappling with the rise of online shopping, which has led to a decline in foot traffic and sales for many physical stores.\n\n\"The high street is facing a perfect storm of challenges, including the shift to online, weak consumer spending, and uncertainty caused by Brexit,\" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. \"Retailers are working hard to adapt to these changes, but it's a tough environment, and many are struggling to stay afloat.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, some retailers are adopting innovative strategies to stay competitive. For example, John Lewis Partnership, a leading UK retailer, has invested heavily in its online capabilities, including the launch of a new e-commerce platform and the expansion of its click-and-collect service.\n\n\"We're committed to providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience, whether that's in-store or online,\" said Andrew Murphy, director of e-commerce at John Lewis Partnership. \"We're seeing a significant increase in online sales, and we're confident that our investment in digital will help us to continue to grow and thrive in the future.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other retailers are focusing on experiential retail, offering unique in-store experiences and events to attract customers and drive sales. For example, department store chain Selfridges has launched a series of festive events and activities, including a Christmas market and a festive food hall.\n\n\"We're committed to creating an immersive and engaging shopping experience for our customers,\" said Anne Pitcher, head of marketing at Selfridges. \"By offering unique and memorable experiences, we're able to drive sales and increase customer loyalty.\"\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, retailers will be hoping for a boost in sales and a return to more positive trading conditions. However, with the UK's economic outlook remaining uncertain, many are bracing themselves for a challenging few months ahead.",

        "Text": "The Serious Fraud Office has stepped up its inquiries into the collapse of BHS and the conduct of the department store chain's former owner Dominic Chappell. The Guardian understands that the SFO has contacted individuals involved in running BHS before it fell into administration in April, and the administrators themselves, and asked for a series of documents. The SFO is thought to be particularly interested in the dealings of Chappell and his consortium, Retail Acquisitions, during the 13 months it owned the retailer. The move raises the possibility of the agency launching a formal investigation into the collapse of BHS and Chappell. The SFO always explores whether there is reasonable grounds to suspect that fraud has taken place before publicly announcing it is launching a full investigation. The demise of BHS led to 11,000 job losses and left a Â£571m pension deficit. Its failure is already under investigation by the Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator, but the SFO's interest raises the stake considerably because it has the power to bring criminal charges. Chappell controversially bought BHS for Â£1 from Sir Philip Green in March 2013. The company collapsed just 13 months later, but Retail Acquisitions received at least Â£17m from the retailer. A parliamentary investigation into events at BHS accused Chappell of having \"had his fingers in the till\" and helping to oversee the \"systematic plunder\" of the business. The SFO's inquiry into BHS's collapse is a significant development in the ongoing investigation into the retailer's demise. The agency's interest in the dealings of Retail Acquisitions and Dominic Chappell during their ownership of BHS suggests that it may be looking into allegations of fraud or other financial misconduct.\n\nSources close to the investigation have told The Guardian that the SFO is seeking information about the financial transactions between Retail Acquisitions and BHS during the 13 months that the consortium owned the retailer. This includes requests for documents related to the company's financial statements, tax returns, and other financial records.\n\nThe SFO is also believed to be investigating the payment of Â£17m to Retail Acquisitions by BHS just months before the retailer went into administration. This payment was made despite the fact that Retail Acquisitions had failed to provide the necessary financial support to the business.\n\nThe Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator are also conducting separate investigations into the collapse of BHS. The Insolvency Service is looking into the conduct of Retail Acquisitions and its directors, while the Pensions Regulator is investigating the handling of BHS's pension scheme.\n\nThe parliamentary inquiry into BHS's collapse, which was conducted by the Work and Pensions Committee, was highly critical of Dominic Chappell and Retail Acquisitions. The committee's report accused Chappell of having \"had his fingers in the till\" and helping to oversee the \"systematic plunder\" of BHS.\n\nThe collapse of BHS led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and left a Â£571m pension deficit. The retailer's failure has also had a significant impact on the high street, with many other retailers struggling to compete with the likes of online giants such as Amazon.\n\nThe SFO's investigation into BHS's collapse is likely to take several months to complete. If the agency finds evidence of fraud or other financial misconduct, it could lead to criminal charges being brought against Dominic Chappell and other individuals involved in the collapse of the retailer.\n\nIn a statement, the SFO said that it was unable to comment on the investigation, but that it would provide an update in due course. Retail Acquisitions and Dominic Chappell have also declined to comment on the investigation.\n\nThe news of the SFO's inquiry into BHS's collapse is likely to be welcomed by many of the retailer's former employees and customers, who are still reeling from the impact of its collapse. However, it is also likely to be a significant blow to Dominic Chappell and Retail Acquisitions, who have already faced intense scrutiny over their handling of the retailer.\n\nAs the investigation continues, it is clear that the collapse of BHS will have far-reaching consequences for those involved, and for the wider retail industry.",

In an interview on Tuesday, he explained that he had been planning to use a big news event to promote his online expert company, which has been struggling to find users. A few hours earlier, a gunman had opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, 60 miles south of his home. He said he was frustrated by how little the witnesses interviewed by broadcast journalists seemed to know. His site could help, he thought. And so, seated in the comfort of his home, with its indoor tennis court and th ree microwave ovens for optimum popcorn popping, he took action: \"I dashed off a tweet and did not think about it.\" In particular the phrase \"set your price\" -- amid a tragedy that took the lives of a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 25-year-old biologist -- struck many people as insensitive. The tweet, which read \"Set your price\" in response to the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting, sparked widespread outrage and criticism towards Scott Adams. Many felt that the timing and tone of the tweet were insensitive and inconsiderate, particularly in light of the tragedy that had just unfolded.\n\nAdams' online expert company, which had been struggling to gain traction, was quickly flooded with negative reviews and criticism on social media. The backlash was swift and severe, with many calling for the company to be boycotted and Adams to be held accountable for his thoughtless tweet.\n\nIn the days that followed, Adams attempted to clarify his intentions behind the tweet, saying that he had been trying to promote his company's services, which allow users to set their own prices for their expertise. However, his explanations were met with skepticism and anger, and many felt that he was attempting to downplay the severity of his mistake.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the boundaries of social media and the importance of considering the impact of one's words on others. It has also sparked a wider conversation about the role of companies and individuals in promoting responsible and respectful online behavior.\n\nAdams' company has since faced a significant backlash, with many users canceling their subscriptions and calling for the company to be shut down. The incident has also led to a renewed focus on the importance of online etiquette and the need for individuals to be mindful of the impact of their words on others.\n\nIn the end, the tweet that was meant to promote Adams' company ended up having the opposite effect, highlighting the importance of considering the consequences of one's actions and the need for online companies to prioritize responsible behavior.",

For small business owners, healthcare benefits present a huge challenge. By not offering any options, we put ourselves at a significant disadvantage to those employers that do, particularly in these times of tight employment. The study also found that the increasing cost of healthcare premiums is forcing many small business owners to make difficult decisions about how to allocate their resources. \"It's a tough choice between investing in our employees' health and investing in the growth of our business,\" said Sarah Johnson, owner of a small marketing firm in California. \"We're already feeling the pinch of rising costs and it's only going to get worse if we don't find a solution.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, many small business owners are finding ways to adapt to the changing healthcare landscape. Some are opting for high-deductible plans, which can be more affordable for employers but may require employees to pay more out-of-pocket for medical expenses. Others are exploring alternative health insurance options, such as association health plans or short-term limited-duration insurance.\n\nHowever, these alternatives often come with their own set of drawbacks. \"These plans may be cheaper upfront, but they often don't provide the same level of coverage as traditional health insurance plans,\" said Dr. Rachel Klein, a healthcare economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"And if an employee gets sick or injured, they may be left with significant medical bills to pay.\"\n\nTo mitigate the impact of rising healthcare costs, some small business owners are turning to innovative solutions. For example, some are offering wellness programs or on-site health services to help employees stay healthy and reduce the need for costly medical procedures. Others are partnering with other small businesses to pool their resources and negotiate better health insurance rates.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation study also highlighted the importance of employee engagement in addressing the challenge of healthcare costs. \"When employees are engaged and invested in their health, they're more likely to take proactive steps to stay healthy and reduce their healthcare costs,\" said Dr. Klein. \"Employers that prioritize employee well-being and offer benefits that support their health and wellness are more likely to attract and retain top talent.\"\n\nAs the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, small business owners will need to remain flexible and adaptable to meet the changing needs of their employees. By exploring alternative solutions and prioritizing employee well-being, they can help mitigate the impact of rising healthcare costs and ensure the long-term success of their businesses.",

So what happens when the home team runs into trouble? MSNBC is part of NBC News, a division of the Comcast-owned NBCUniversal that has faced a new round of criticism over its handling of sexual harassment and misconduct issues, including an on-air scolding from Rachel Maddow, the star MSNBC anchor. On Tuesday, four Democratic candidates, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, weighed in less than 48 hours before they are scheduled to appear on the debate stage. In a letter to Democratic Party officials, the candidates called for an outside review of the workplace culture at NBC News. \"We, the undersigned candidates, are very concerned about the message it would send to sexual assault survivors if our next debate is sponsored by MSNBC without clear commitments from Comcast, the parent company of NBC and MSNBC, to conduct an independent investigation into the toxic culture that enabled abusers and silenced survivors,\" the letter reads. NBC News has vehemently denied any mishandling of harassment matters. And the letter, organized by the women's advocacy group UltraViolet, stops short of any kind of ultimatum. The candidates have not suggested that they would skip the debate Wednesday or stop appearing on NBC or MSNBC shows. The letter, which was signed by Senators Sanders and Warren, as well as Representatives Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, also called for Comcast to implement \"clear and enforceable policies\" to prevent workplace harassment and discrimination. The candidates' move comes as the #MeToo movement continues to gain momentum, and as the Democratic Party faces growing pressure to address issues of gender equality and workplace culture.\n\nThe debate over MSNBC's handling of sexual harassment allegations has been ongoing for several weeks, with some critics accusing the network of downplaying or ignoring reports of misconduct. The controversy has already led to the departure of several high-profile MSNBC personalities, including former host Mark Halperin and commentator Glenn Thrush.\n\nIn a statement, an MSNBC spokesperson denied any allegations of mishandling harassment matters, saying that the network \"takes all allegations of harassment and misconduct seriously and has a robust process in place to investigate and address any such claims.\" The spokesperson also pointed out that NBC News has a dedicated team of investigators who work to ensure that all allegations are thoroughly investigated and addressed.\n\nDespite the denial, the controversy is unlikely to go away anytime soon. The debate on Wednesday is expected to be a highly charged and emotional one, with many viewers tuning in to see how the candidates respond to the allegations. The controversy has already had a significant impact on the Democratic primary, with some candidates calling for greater transparency and accountability from the party's leadership.\n\nThe debate is also expected to be a key test of the candidates' ability to think on their feet and respond to unexpected challenges. With the stakes so high, it remains to be seen how the candidates will respond to the controversy and whether it will have a lasting impact on the election.\n\nIn the meantime, the debate over MSNBC's handling of sexual harassment allegations is likely to continue, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency from the network. As the Democratic primary continues to heat up, it remains to be seen how the candidates will navigate this complex and sensitive issue.",

        "Text": "Facebook announced Thursday its first policy to combat misinformation about vaccines, following in the footsteps of Pinterest and YouTube. The social network is adopting an approach similar to the one it uses to tackle fake news: The company will not remove incorrect content, but it will aim to reduce the reach of that content by making it harder to find. \"Leading global health organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have publicly identified verifiable vaccine hoaxes,\" Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president for global policy management, said in a statement Thursday. \"If these vaccine hoaxes appear on Facebook, we will take action against them.\" Anti-vaccination groups have flourished on Facebook, partly because of the site's search results and \"suggested groups\" feature. The policy change is a significant step forward in addressing the growing concern over the spread of misinformation about vaccines on social media platforms. According to a report by the World Health Organization, vaccine hesitancy has been identified as one of the top 10 threats to global health, with misinformation playing a significant role in the decline of vaccination rates in many countries.\n\nFacebook's decision to reduce the reach of misinformation about vaccines follows a similar approach it has taken to tackle fake news. The company will not remove incorrect content, but instead, it will demote it in search results and make it harder for users to find. This approach is designed to limit the spread of misinformation without infringing on the freedom of speech.\n\nThe new policy is expected to have a significant impact on anti-vaccination groups that have flourished on Facebook. These groups often spread false information and conspiracy theories about vaccines, which can be harmful to public health. By reducing the reach of this misinformation, Facebook aims to prevent the spread of false information and promote the use of reliable sources of information.\n\nFacebook has faced criticism in the past for its handling of misinformation on its platform. In 2017, the company was accused of allowing fake news to spread during the US presidential election, which some believe contributed to the outcome of the election. Since then, the company has taken steps to address the issue, including the introduction of fact-checking programs and the demotion of fake news in search results.\n\nThe new policy on vaccine misinformation is a significant step forward in addressing this issue. It demonstrates Facebook's commitment to promoting reliable sources of information and preventing the spread of misinformation on its platform. The company is working closely with leading global health organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to identify and address vaccine hoaxes.\n\nIn addition to reducing the reach of misinformation, Facebook is also taking steps to promote reliable sources of information about vaccines. The company is working with health organizations to provide accurate and reliable information about vaccines, which will be displayed prominently on the platform. This will help to counterbalance the misinformation spread by anti-vaccination groups and promote the use of reliable sources of information.\n\nOverall, Facebook's new policy on vaccine misinformation is a significant step forward in addressing the growing concern over the spread of misinformation on social media platforms. The company's commitment to promoting reliable sources of information and preventing the spread of misinformation is a welcome development, and it is hoped that other social media platforms will follow suit.",

The program, which has been met with mixed reviews from borrowers and critics alike, has forgiven the debt of over 7,000 borrowers since its inception. However, it has also faced criticism for its complexity and the strict eligibility requirements, which have led to many borrowers being unable to take advantage of the program.\n\nTo address these concerns, the federal government has announced a series of changes aimed at making the program more accessible and user-friendly. One of the key changes is the introduction of a new online platform that allows borrowers to track their progress and confirm their eligibility for the program.\n\n\"We're committed to making sure that this program is working for the people it's intended to help,\" said a spokesperson for the Department of Education. \"We're taking steps to simplify the process and ensure that borrowers have the information they need to take advantage of this important benefit.\"\n\nRaha Wala, who is currently working on a case involving human trafficking in West Africa, is one of the many borrowers who has benefited from the program.

Many services were cancelled altogether, and severe speed restrictions imposed on services that are running. Here's why extreme temperatures cause so much disruption to the rail network. How does hot weather affect UK trains? The temperature of steel rails can climb 20 degrees higher than the air around them. So when temperatures are approaching 40 degrees, track temperatures can come close to 60 degrees. This phenomenon is known as \"thermal expansion,\" where the steel rails expand due to the heat, causing them to become misshapen and lose their structural integrity. As a result, trains are forced to operate at reduced speeds to prevent any potential damage to the tracks, which can lead to delays and cancellations.\n\nIn addition to thermal expansion, hot weather can also cause other issues for the rail network. For example, the increased heat can cause the ballast, the material that fills the gaps between the tracks, to become loose and unstable. This can lead to uneven track surfaces, which can cause trains to vibrate excessively and potentially derail.\n\nFurthermore, the heat can also affect the electrical systems on trains, causing them to malfunction or overheat. This can result in delays or even complete shutdowns of services.\n\nThe UK's rail network is particularly vulnerable to the effects of heatwaves due to its age and the materials used in its construction. Many of the country's rail tracks were built decades ago and are made of older materials that are more prone to thermal expansion.\n\nNetwork Rail, the organization responsible for maintaining the UK's rail infrastructure, has implemented various measures to mitigate the effects of heatwaves. These include installing cooling systems on tracks, using specialized materials to reduce thermal expansion, and implementing speed restrictions on trains.\n\nDespite these efforts, the rail network is still vulnerable to the effects of heatwaves, and passengers are advised to check for updates before traveling. The heatwave is expected to continue for several days, and commuters are advised to plan ahead and consider alternative modes of transportation.\n\nIn the meantime, rail operators are working to minimize the disruption caused by the heatwave. Some have implemented special timetables, while others are providing alternative transportation options for passengers. Passengers are advised to check with their rail operator for the latest information and to plan their journey accordingly.\n\nAs the heatwave continues to affect the UK, it is clear that the rail network is a major casualty. With temperatures expected to remain high for several days, passengers can expect continued disruption to services. However, by taking steps to mitigate the effects of the heatwave, rail operators and Network Rail are working to minimize the impact on passengers and ensure that the network remains safe and operational.",

A bunch of entrepreneurs are not only optimistic but are working to make this happen sooner than you may think. In 2018 alone, the average American will consume more than 220lbs of red meat and poultry, according to a report from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). As the global population continues to grow, the demand for meat is expected to increase, posing a significant challenge to the food industry. However, a growing number of entrepreneurs and startups are working to develop innovative solutions to meet this demand in a sustainable and affordable way.\n\nOne such solution is lab-grown meat, also known as clean meat. This technology involves growing animal cells in a controlled environment, eliminating the need for large-scale animal farming and reducing the environmental impact of traditional meat production. Companies like Memphis Meats and Just are already making waves in the industry, with their lab-grown burgers and sausages gaining popularity among consumers.\n\nAnother approach is to focus on alternative protein sources, such as insects and plant-based meat substitutes. Insect-based protein, for example, is a growing trend in Europe, with companies like Bug AppÃ©tit and Six Foods offering a range of insect-based products. Meanwhile, plant-based meat substitutes like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are gaining mainstream acceptance, with their products now available in major supermarkets and restaurants.\n\nAccording to the USDA, the average American will consume more than 220lbs of red meat and poultry in 2018, with the majority coming from traditional animal farming. However, this trend is expected to shift in the coming years as consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental and health impacts of their food choices.\n\n\"We're seeing a significant shift towards more sustainable and conscious food choices,\" said Sarah Hanson, CEO of Memphis Meats. \"Consumers are demanding more transparency and accountability from the food industry, and we're responding to that demand by developing innovative solutions that meet their needs.\"\n\nWhile lab-grown meat and alternative protein sources are gaining traction, traditional animal farming is also evolving to become more sustainable. Many farms are adopting regenerative agriculture practices, which prioritize soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. This approach not only reduces the environmental impact of farming but also produces more nutritious and flavorful meat.\n\nAs the demand for meat continues to grow, it's clear that the future of the food industry will be shaped by innovative solutions that prioritize sustainability and affordability. Whether it's lab-grown meat, alternative protein sources, or regenerative agriculture, one thing is certain â€“ the way we produce and consume meat will never be the same again.",

The robots cannot handle the pace of change and the complexity of the key customisation options available for the company's S-Class saloon at the 101-year-old Sindelfingen plant, which produces 400, 000 vehicles a year from 1,500 tons of steel a day. The dizzying number of options for the cars â€“ from heated or cooled cup holders, various wheels, carbon-fibre trims and decals, and even four types of caps for tire valves â€“ demand adaptability and flexibility, two traits where humans currently outperform robots. Markus Schaefer, Mercedes-Benz' head of production told Bloomberg: \"Robots can't deal with the degree of individualisation and the many variants that we have today. The shift towards human assembly line workers is a significant departure from the industry's recent trend of relying heavily on automation. In recent years, many manufacturers have invested heavily in robotics and artificial intelligence to streamline their production processes and reduce labor costs. However, Mercedes-Benz has found that the unique demands of its S-Class production line require a more flexible and adaptable workforce.\n\nAccording to Schaefer, the company's production team has implemented a hybrid approach, combining human workers with robots to tackle the complex customization options. While robots are still used for tasks such as welding and painting, human workers are responsible for assembling and installing the various customizations.\n\n\"This approach allows us to maintain the level of quality and precision that our customers expect from Mercedes-Benz, while also providing the flexibility and adaptability needed to meet the demands of our customization options,\" Schaefer explained.\n\nThe move towards human assembly line workers is not without its challenges. Mercedes-Benz has had to retrain its workforce to accommodate the new production methods and has invested in additional training programs to ensure that employees have the necessary skills to handle the complex customization options.\n\nDespite the challenges, the company believes that the hybrid approach will ultimately benefit both the business and its customers. By combining the strengths of humans and robots, Mercedes-Benz is able to offer a level of customization and quality that is unmatched in the industry.\n\n\"We're not sacrificing efficiency or productivity by bringing humans back onto the production line,\" Schaefer emphasized. \"In fact, we're seeing improved quality and reduced waste as a result of this approach. It's a win-win for everyone involved.\"\n\nThe news of Mercedes-Benz's shift towards human assembly line workers is likely to send shockwaves through the manufacturing industry, as other companies may be forced to reevaluate their reliance on automation. However, for now, the German automaker is confident that its hybrid approach will give it a competitive edge in the market.",

        "Text": "Why the Fed, Long Reticent, Has Started to Talk About Climate Change\n\nClimate change is risky business -- including for officials at the Federal Reserve. An increase in severe weather events could lead to bank failures as property prices rapidly adjust, stoke uncertainty and harm economic growth. That makes global warming and its fallout relevant to the Fed, which is responsible for both financial regulation and for guiding the nation's economy toward full employment and stable prices. But those threats force the central bank, which prizes its political independence, to walk a tightrope . The Fed could be criticized for weighing in on a highly politicized issue: Survey data suggest that Democrats tend to be much more concerned with climate than Republicans. Against that backdrop, United States monetary policymakers have been slow to create a concerted climate change research program, even as peers like the Bank of England began to talk frequently about the economics of global warming. This week brought a significant shift in that approach. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, one of 12 regional branches, held the system's first-ever climate research conference. It is partly a sign that the central bank is ready to talk about a global economic agenda item -- and partly a recognition that the risks are too important for the authorities to ignore. \"Why now?\" Mary C. Daly, president of the branch, asked in her speech to open the event. \"The answer is simple: It's essential to achieving our mission.\" The conference, which took place in San Francisco, brought together experts from academia, industry, and government to discuss the economic implications of climate change. The event marked a significant departure from the Fed's previous reluctance to engage on the topic, and highlighted the central bank's growing recognition of the need to incorporate climate change into its decision-making process.\n\nOne of the key takeaways from the conference was the potential for climate change to disrupt financial markets. Panelists discussed the risks posed by extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires, which can lead to property damage, business disruption, and even bank failures. They also highlighted the need for banks to better understand and manage these risks, and for regulators to develop new policies and frameworks to address them.\n\nThe conference also explored the potential economic benefits of addressing climate change. Speakers noted that investing in clean energy and sustainable infrastructure could create new job opportunities, stimulate economic growth, and reduce the financial risks associated with climate-related disasters.\n\nThe Fed's increased focus on climate change is also seen as a response to growing concerns among investors and businesses. Many companies are already incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities into their financial planning and decision-making, and the Fed's move is seen as a way to ensure that the financial system is better equipped to support these efforts.\n\nThe conference was attended by a range of experts, including economists, climate scientists, and financial regulators. The event was also livestreamed, allowing a wider audience to participate and engage with the discussion.\n\nThe Fed's shift towards a more proactive approach on climate change is likely to have significant implications for the financial industry. As the central bank continues to develop its research and analysis on the topic, it is expected to work closely with other regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, to develop new policies and guidelines.\n\nIn the coming months, the Fed is expected to release a series of reports and studies on the economic implications of climate change, which will provide further insight into the potential risks and opportunities associated with this issue. The central bank's increased focus on climate change is seen as a positive step towards a more sustainable and resilient financial system, and is likely to have far-reaching implications for businesses, investors, and policymakers alike.",

        "Text": "Gaia Vince won the prestigious Royal Society Book Prize in 2015 for her outstanding travelogue 'Adventures in the Anthropocene: A Journey to the Heart of the Planet we Made'. She was the first woman to win outright in the prize's 28-year history. The 2016 prize went to Andrea Wulf for her book 'The Invention of Nature'. Reflecting on these writer's successes in Friday's Guardian, associate media editor Jon Dugdale made a number of insidious insinuations that I wish to correct with bald facts as my allies. I was honored to be on the jury in 2015. It was chaired by the mathematician Ian Stewart, and my fellow judges included the novelist Sarah Waters, the Guardian's book editor Claire Armitstead, Channel 4 journalist Krishnan Guru-Murthy, and scientist Jo Shien Ng. As I reflect on the 2015 Royal Society Book Prize, I am reminded of the rigorous process that our esteemed jury underwent to select the winner. We spent countless hours deliberating and discussing the merits of each book, considering factors such as literary merit, scientific accuracy, and the book's ability to engage a broad audience.\n\nGaia Vince's \"Adventures in the Anthropocene: A Journey to the Heart of the Planet we Made\" stood out from the rest due to its unique blend of travelogue and scientific inquiry. The book's exploration of the impact of human activity on the natural world was both thought-provoking and accessible, making it a compelling read for a wide range of readers.\n\nIn contrast, Jon Dugdale's recent article in The Guardian seemed to imply that the jury's decision was somehow flawed or biased. He suggested that the win was due to Vince's \"feminist credentials\" rather than the book's merit. I can assure readers that this is not the case. The jury's decision was based solely on the book's quality and its ability to meet the prize's criteria.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Royal Society Book Prize is not just about recognizing outstanding scientific writing, but also about promoting a deeper understanding of the natural world and the impact of human activity on it. Vince's book is a testament to the power of science communication and its ability to inspire and educate readers.\n\nIn conclusion, I am proud to have been a part of the 2015 Royal Society Book Prize jury, and I stand by our decision to award Gaia Vince the prize. Her book is a remarkable achievement that has contributed significantly to the public's understanding of the Anthropocene era. I hope that Jon Dugdale's article does not detract from the book's well-deserved recognition and that readers will continue to engage with Vince's work and the important issues it raises.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A group of Silicon Valley technologists who were early employees at Facebook and Google, alarmed over the ill effects of social networks and smartphones, are banding together to challenge the companies they helped build. The cohort is creating a union of concerned experts called the Center for Humane Technology. Along with the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, it also plans an anti-tech addiction lobbying effort and an ad campaign at 55,000 public schools in the United States. The campaign, titled The Truth About Tech, will be funded with $7 million from Common Sense and capital raised by the Center for Humane Technology. Common Sense also has $50 million in donated media and airtime from partners including Comcast and DirecTV. It will be aimed at educating students, parents and teachers about the dangers of technology, including the depression that can come from heavy use of social media. \"We were on the inside,\" said Tristan Harris, a former in-house ethicist at Google who is heading the new group. \"We know what the companies measure. We know how they talk, and we know how the engineering works.\" The effect of technology, especially on younger minds, has become hotly debated in recent months. In January, two big Wall Street investors asked Apple to study the health effects of its products and to make it easier to limit children's use of iPhones and iPads. The Center for Humane Technology aims to use its insider knowledge to promote a healthier relationship between technology and society. The group's leaders believe that by sharing their expertise, they can help shape the development of technology to prioritize human well-being over profit.\n\nHarris, who was also a design ethicist at Google, said that the company's algorithms are designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible, often at the expense of their mental and emotional well-being. \"We were building products that were designed to be addictive,\" he said. \"We were building products that were designed to manipulate people's emotions and behaviors.\"\n\nThe Center for Humane Technology is also partnering with educators and policymakers to develop curriculum and policies that promote responsible technology use. The group's leaders believe that by educating children about the potential risks and benefits of technology, they can help them develop healthy habits and make informed decisions about their online behavior.\n\nThe Truth About Tech campaign will feature a series of public service announcements, educational materials, and workshops for students, parents, and teachers. The campaign will also include a website and social media channels that provide resources and information on how to manage technology use and promote digital well-being.\n\nCommon Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that advocates for children's well-being and safety, is providing significant funding and support for the campaign. \"We believe that technology can be a powerful tool for good, but it requires responsible use and regulation,\" said James Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media. \"We're proud to partner with the Center for Humane Technology to promote a healthier and more humane relationship between technology and society.\"\n\nThe Center for Humane Technology is also working with lawmakers to introduce legislation that would require technology companies to prioritize user well-being and to provide more transparency about their data collection and advertising practices. \"We're not asking for a ban on technology,\" said Harris. \"We're asking for a ban on manipulative technology. We're asking for a ban on technology that is designed to exploit our emotions and behaviors.\"\n\nThe group's efforts have already gained support from some prominent figures in the tech industry, including former Google engineer and whistleblower, Tim Wu. \"The Center for Humane Technology is a crucial step towards creating a more humane and responsible technology industry,\" said Wu. \"I'm proud to support their efforts to promote a healthier and more balanced relationship between technology and society.\"\n\nAs the debate around technology's impact on society continues to grow, the Center for Humane Technology's efforts are likely to play a significant role in shaping the future of the tech industry. By using their insider knowledge and expertise to promote a healthier and more humane relationship between technology and society, the group is working to create a better future for all.",

He said a yearlong backpacking trip to Pakistan and India after he graduated from college opened his eyes to a world he didn't know. Coming out of Stanford University's business school in 1995, he was hired by Mr. Omidyar as the auction site's first employee. He wrote the business plan the company followed, and when eBay went public in 1998 he was wealthy beyond belief. His estimated net worth is $5.6 billion, according to Wealth-X, a financial research firm. \"This is where the philanthropy part starts for me,\" Mr. Skoll said in an interview. \"I was tasked with finding a way to share the success of the company with the people who helped make it what it was. I decided to start a company foundation.\" After that foundation was up and running, he returned to his desire to tell stories, now as someone with the means to fund people and their ideas. Skoll's passion for storytelling led him to establish the Skoll Foundation in 1999, which aimed to support social entrepreneurs and their innovative solutions to global challenges. The foundation's mission was to identify and empower individuals who were making a positive impact in their communities, and to provide them with the resources and support they needed to scale their efforts.\n\nUnder Skoll's leadership, the Skoll Foundation invested in a wide range of initiatives, from education and healthcare to environmental conservation and human rights. One of the foundation's earliest and most notable investments was in the work of Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist and Nobel laureate who had pioneered the concept of microfinance. Yunus's Grameen Bank, which provided small loans to poor villagers, was a model for sustainable development that Skoll and the foundation saw as a game-changer.\n\nThe Skoll Foundation also supported the work of other notable social entrepreneurs, including Wendy Kopp, who founded Teach for America, and Jody Williams, who led the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Through its grants and investments, the foundation helped to amplify the impact of these individuals and their organizations, and to create a ripple effect of positive change around the world.\n\nIn addition to its grant-making activities, the Skoll Foundation also played a key role in promoting social entrepreneurship as a viable and sustainable approach to addressing global challenges. Skoll himself became a vocal advocate for the power of social entrepreneurship, speaking at conferences and events around the world and sharing his insights and expertise with policymakers, business leaders, and other stakeholders.\n\nToday, the Skoll Foundation is one of the leading philanthropic organizations in the world, with a portfolio of investments and grants that spans multiple sectors and continents. Skoll's legacy as a philanthropist and social entrepreneur continues to inspire a new generation of changemakers, and his commitment to telling stories and amplifying the voices of those who are making a difference remains unwavering.",

Fitting the meters, which automate readings and which the government has set a target of installing in every home and small business by the end of 2020, costs suppliers about Â£100 per household today. But that will jump by nearly a third to Â£130 in 2018 as companies spend more time and money trying to contact harder-to-reach customers, according to one of the big six suppliers. However, the entire cost is not expected to be passed on to consumers. When five of the big six did increase their tariffs in the first four months, several blamed smart meters. ScottishPower said smart meters accounted for Â£10 of the Â£86 bill increase for millions of its customers. A source at one energy supplier, who did not want to be named, said the higher cost related to smart meters was due to \"customer apathy, concerns and the difficulty in getting people to agree to have a meter fitted\". Staff were having to contact more people, more times, to achieve successful installs, they said. Householders typically need to take a day off to be at home over a four-hour period for an engineer to swap in a smart gas and electricity meter. A ramp-up of the smart meter rollout is planned next year, to close the gap between the 7m fitted so far and the 53m needed within four years. Smart meters were not included in the calculations made by the regulator Ofgem when it warned in January that the rising costs facing suppliers did not justify price hikes. When five of the big six did increase their tariffs in the first four months, several blamed smart meters. The increasing costs of installing smart meters in millions of homes are set to add pressure on energy suppliers to raise household bills further next year.

This can be a significant inconvenience for many customers, which may be contributing to the higher cost of installation.\n\nThe news comes as energy suppliers are already facing pressure to raise household bills. In the first four months of the year, five of the big six energy suppliers increased their tariffs, with several blaming smart meters for the price hikes. ScottishPower, for example, said that smart meters accounted for Â£10 of the Â£86 bill increase for millions of its customers.\n\nHowever, it's not clear whether the entire cost of installing smart meters will be passed on to consumers. Ofgem, the energy regulator, warned in January that the rising costs facing suppliers did not justify price hikes. The regulator's calculations did not include the cost of installing smart meters, which suggests that suppliers may not be able to pass on the full cost of the installation to customers.\n\nDespite the challenges, a ramp-up of the smart meter rollout is planned for next year, with the aim of closing the gap between the 7 million meters already installed and the 53 million needed within four years. The smart meter rollout is a key part of the government's strategy to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency.\n\nIn the meantime, energy suppliers will be looking for ways to reduce the cost of installing smart meters while still meeting the government's targets. This may involve finding more efficient ways of contacting customers, improving the installation process, or exploring new technologies that can help reduce the cost of installation.",

The study provides the most precise estimate yet of the amount of \"space grease\" in the Milky Way, by recreating the carbon-based compounds in the laboratory. The Australian-Turkish team discovered more than expected: 10 billion trillion trillion tonnes of gloop, or enough for 40 trillion trillion trillion packs of butter. Prof Tim Schmidt, a chemist at the University of New South Wales, Sydney and co-author of the study, said that the windscreen of a future spaceship travelling through interstellar space might be expected to get a sticky coating. \"Amongst other stuff it'll run into is interstellar dust, which is partly grease, partly soot and partly silicates like sand,\" he said, adding that the grease is swept away within our own solar system by the solar wind. The findings bring scientists closer to figuring out the total amount of carbon in interstellar space, which fuels the formation of stars, planets and is essential for life. Until now there has been uncertainty over how much carbon is drifting between the stars. The researchers used a combination of laboratory experiments and computer simulations to estimate the amount of \"space grease\" in the Milky Way. They created a range of carbon-based compounds in the lab, mimicking the conditions found in interstellar space, and then used spectroscopy to analyze the molecules and determine their properties.\n\nThe team's findings suggest that the grease-like molecules are present in a range of sizes, from small carbon chains to larger, more complex molecules. They are thought to be formed through the interaction of interstellar dust and gas, and are then swept away by the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles emitted by the sun.\n\nThe discovery of the \"space grease\" is significant because it provides scientists with a new way to estimate the total amount of carbon in interstellar space. Carbon is a crucial element for life, and understanding its distribution and abundance is essential for understanding how stars and planets form and evolve.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. AyÅŸe KÄ±zÄ±loÄŸlu, a Turkish chemist, said that the findings have important implications for our understanding of the universe. \"The presence of carbon in interstellar space is a key factor in the formation of stars and planets, and our study provides new insights into the processes that shape the universe,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers plan to continue their study by analyzing the properties of the \"space grease\" and how it interacts with other molecules in interstellar space. They hope that their findings will help to shed light on the mysteries of the universe and provide new insights into the origins of life.\n\nIn the meantime, the discovery of the \"space grease\" has sparked excitement among scientists and the public alike. The idea of a sticky, greasy mist permeating the vast expanse of interstellar space is a fascinating one, and it has captured the imagination of people around the world.\n\nAs Prof. Schmidt noted, the discovery of the \"space grease\" also raises questions about the potential risks and challenges of space travel. \"If we're going to send humans to other stars, we need to understand what they'll be encountering,\" he said. \"The presence of grease in interstellar space could pose a problem for spacecraft and astronauts, and we need to take that into account as we plan for future missions.\"\n\nOverall, the discovery of the \"space grease\" is a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the universe, and it has important implications for our understanding of the origins of life and the potential for life beyond Earth.",

Her son and daughter attend the Hamilton Avenue School, a magnet school that offers foreign languages in kindergarten and a Suzuki music program. Ms. Ponce also drives a minivan with New York plates, which explains why at 6:30 one morning last school year, she opened her door to find a Greenwich school official checking to make sure that she and her children lived in the house they said they did. Someone had reported those New York plates to the school. \"It was a big surprise,\" she said. \"They do follow up.\" Officials with Greenwich Public Schools are doing more than just making house visits to ensure their students live in the district. A new policy this year requires parents or guardians registering their child for school to complete notarized affidavits testifying to their address. Lying, the document points out, could result in criminal prosecution. The new policy, which went into effect at the start of the 2022-2023 school year, is aimed at combating residency fraud, a growing concern for the school district. According to district officials, the policy change is a response to a surge in instances of parents claiming to live within the district's boundaries when, in fact, they do not.\n\n\"We take the integrity of our enrollment process very seriously,\" said Greenwich Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Toni Jones. \"It's essential that we ensure our students are living within the district and not taking advantage of our resources. This new policy is a critical step in maintaining the trust and confidence of our community.\"\n\nThe notarized affidavits require parents or guardians to provide proof of residency, including a copy of their lease agreement, mortgage statement, or utility bills. The documents are then reviewed and verified by school officials before a student can be enrolled.\n\nWhile some parents have expressed concerns about the added administrative burden, many others have praised the new policy as a necessary measure to maintain the district's high standards.\n\n\"I understand the need for verification,\" said Susie T. Ponce, whose family was visited by school officials last year. \"I'm glad they're taking steps to ensure the integrity of the system. It's reassuring to know that they're doing everything they can to ensure our children are getting the best education possible.\"\n\nThe policy change has also been welcomed by local residents who have grown frustrated with the influx of out-of-district students enrolling in Greenwich schools. Many have accused these students of taking advantage of the district's top-notch education system, which is funded by local property taxes.\n\n\"We're not trying to exclude anyone, but we do need to ensure that our resources are being used by those who are actually part of our community,\" said Greenwich resident and parent, Mark Smith. \"This new policy is a step in the right direction. It's about fairness and accountability.\"\n\nAs the school year progresses, district officials will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the new policy and make any necessary adjustments. For now, parents and guardians are being encouraged to cooperate with the verification process and provide the necessary documentation to ensure a smooth enrollment experience.\n\nIn the meantime, Susie T. Ponce and her family are relieved to have passed the residency test and are looking forward to another successful year at Hamilton Avenue School.\n\n\"It's a big relief to know that we're doing everything right,\" she said. \"We're grateful for the extra effort the school is putting in to ensure our children receive the best education possible.\"",

However, this is easier said than done, as a course's name can't tell you everything â€“ course structure and content can vary quite significantly between one university and the next. Some universities even include work experience or international placements. So, how do you find the right one? \"Higher education is a fantastic opportunity, but it really is about making sure the course choice is right,\" says Victoria Azubuine, admissions manager at the University of Bedfordshire. \"The search tools on the Ucas website make it a great place to start. Once you've made that choice, look at the university, to make sure that is a good fit too.\" For psychology student Obinna Okoro, 19, who planned to study psychology, the key was being accepted on to a psychology course that was accredited by the British Psychology Society (BPS). According to Azubuine, it's crucial to research the course's accreditation, as it can have a significant impact on a student's future career prospects. \"Accreditation is a vital aspect to consider, as it ensures that the course meets the industry standards and requirements,\" she explained. \"For example, if a student wants to become a chartered accountant, they need to study a course that is accredited by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).\"\n\nOkoro, who is now in his second year at the University of Bedfordshire, agrees that accreditation was a key factor in his decision-making process. \"I knew that I wanted to work in the field of psychology, and I wanted to make sure that my course was recognized by the British Psychology Society,\" he said. \"That's why I chose the University of Bedfordshire's psychology course, which is accredited by the BPS. It gave me peace of mind knowing that my degree would be respected by employers.\"\n\nIn addition to accreditation, students should also consider the course's content and structure. \"Some courses may have a more theoretical approach, while others may be more practical,\" said Azubuine. \"It's essential to think about what type of learning style suits you best and what you want to achieve from your degree.\" Okoro, who has been impressed with the hands-on approach of his psychology course, suggests that students also look at the course's modules and assessments. \"I've found that my course has a great balance of lectures, workshops, and practical sessions, which has really helped me to understand the subject matter,\" he said.\n\nAnother important consideration is the university's reputation and research output. \"A university's research reputation can have a significant impact on a student's learning experience,\" said Azubuine. \"Students should look at the university's research rankings and output to get an idea of the quality of teaching and resources available.\" Okoro, who has been impressed with the University of Bedfordshire's research facilities, agrees that a university's research reputation is important. \"I've been able to get involved in some really interesting research projects, which has not only enhanced my learning experience but also given me a head start in my career,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, finding the right university course requires careful research and consideration. By thinking about accreditation, course content, and university reputation, students can make an informed decision that sets them up for success. As Azubuine emphasizes, \"Higher education is a fantastic opportunity, but it's crucial to get it right. Take your time, do your research, and don't be afraid to ask questions â€“ it's worth it in the long run.\"",

A new study calls into question the long-held belief that conservatives are happier than liberals. Conservatives are happier than liberals, or so decades of surveys that ask about life satisfaction would suggest. The existence of a so-called ideological happiness gap is so well established that recently social scientists have mostly tried to explain it. However, a new study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology challenges this notion, suggesting that the relationship between political ideology and happiness is more complex than previously thought.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed data from over 10,000 Americans, using a combination of survey responses and physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance to assess emotional states. The results showed that, when controlled for other factors such as income, education, and age, there was no significant difference in happiness levels between conservatives and liberals.\n\nThe researchers also found that the ideological happiness gap may be due to a phenomenon they call \"ideological fundamentalism,\" where individuals who strongly identify with their political ideology tend to be less happy than those who hold more moderate views. This suggests that the intense emotional investment in one's political beliefs may actually be a source of stress and unhappiness, rather than a source of joy and fulfillment.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Emily F. Chang, noted that the findings have important implications for our understanding of political psychology and the role of ideology in shaping our emotional experiences. \"Our results suggest that the relationship between political ideology and happiness is more nuanced than previously thought, and that the pursuit of happiness may not always be served by extreme or dogmatic political beliefs,\" she said.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with other recent research that has challenged the notion of an ideological happiness gap. For example, a 2019 study published in the journal Social Indicators Research found that, when controlling for other factors, there was no significant difference in life satisfaction between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe new study's results have sparked debate among social scientists and political commentators, with some arguing that the findings are consistent with a broader trend of increasing political polarization and division. Others have noted that the study's methodology and sample size may be subject to limitations and biases.\n\nRegardless of the controversy, the study's findings highlight the need for further research into the complex relationships between political ideology, emotional experience, and happiness. As Dr. Chang noted, \"Understanding the psychological underpinnings of political beliefs and behaviors is essential for promoting greater tolerance, empathy, and understanding in our increasingly polarized world.\"",

        "Text": "FRANKFURT -- Analysts and investors have begun to focus on the risks to European banks if severe budget cuts by debt-ridden countries freeze credit markets and cause a double-dip recession. While direct exposure to Greece appears to be limited for most banks, their vulnerability to larger European countries with debt problems is much greater. French and German banks, for example, have $1.16 trillion at risk in Spain and Italy, including government and private debt, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The sum dwarfs the $120 billion exposure in Greece. BNP Paribas on Thursday put its exposure to Greece at 5 billion euros ($6.37 billion), the most of any major French bank. But in a radio interview, the chief executive, Baudouin Prot, declined to reveal the bank's exposure to any other euro zone countries. \"The fear ripples out from bank to bank,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. \"No one knows the distribution of the assets at risk.\" The lack of clarity about which European banks are most at risk in debt-ridden countries has prompted banks to avoid making short-term loans to one another, threatening a repeat of the tight credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The uncertainty surrounding the exposure of European banks to debt-ridden countries has led to a credit crunch, with banks becoming increasingly risk-averse and hesitant to lend to one another. This has resulted in a significant tightening of credit markets, making it more difficult for businesses and individuals to access capital.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning for the European economy, which is still recovering from the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. A repeat of the credit crunch that occurred during that time could have devastating consequences, including a double-dip recession and widespread job losses.\n\nIn an effort to address the situation, European regulators have been working to increase transparency and clarity around the exposure of banks to debt-ridden countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) has been pushing banks to provide more detailed information about their exposure to sovereign debt, and has also been working to establish a system for monitoring and regulating the risk posed by banks to the financial system.\n\nDespite these efforts, many experts believe that the situation remains precarious. \"The lack of transparency and clarity about which banks are most at risk is a major concern,\" said Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute in Munich. \"Until we have a better understanding of the risks, it will be difficult to restore confidence in the financial system.\"\n\nThe situation is not without precedent. In 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a global credit crunch, as banks became fearful of lending to one another and credit markets froze. The resulting economic downturn was severe, with many countries experiencing recessions and widespread job losses.\n\nIn the current situation, the risk of a similar credit crunch is heightened by the fact that many European banks have significant exposure to debt-ridden countries such as Spain and Italy. These countries have struggled to address their debt problems, and their credit ratings have been downgraded by rating agencies. As a result, investors are becoming increasingly risk-averse, and the cost of borrowing for these countries is rising.\n\nThe situation is also complicated by the fact that many European banks have significant exposure to each other's debt. This means that if one bank defaults on its debt, it could have a ripple effect throughout the financial system, leading to a credit crunch and a broader economic downturn.\n\nIn light of these concerns, many experts are calling for European regulators to take bold action to address the situation. This could include implementing measures to increase transparency and clarity around the exposure of banks to debt-ridden countries, as well as providing support to countries struggling to address their debt problems.\n\nIn the meantime, investors and analysts are closely watching the situation, waiting to see how it unfolds. \"The situation is highly uncertain, and it's difficult to predict what will happen next,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \"But one thing is clear: the risks to European banks are significant, and the consequences of a credit crunch could be severe.\"",

        "Text": "Elon Musk and Tesla have been sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for fraud over the company's aborted plans to take the electric car company private. The move could potentially lead to Musk being banned from leading a public company, or fines for him and the company. Shares of the automaker fell more than 4% in after hours trading Thursday once the news had broken. The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Musk and Tesla made false and misleading statements to investors about the company's plans to go private. The SEC claims that Musk's tweets about taking the company private, which were made in August, were not based on any substantial information and were intended to manipulate the market.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Musk's tweets, which stated that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share, caused the company's stock price to surge. However, the SEC alleges that Musk did not have the necessary funding in place and that the tweets were not based on any substantial information.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Tesla and Musk failed to disclose that Musk had been in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) about taking the company private, but that those talks had stalled. The SEC claims that this information was material to investors and that Tesla and Musk should have disclosed it.\n\nIf found guilty, Musk could face fines and even be banned from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Tesla could also face fines and other penalties. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal troubles for Musk, who has been known for his controversial tweets and has been involved in several high-profile feuds with other CEOs and business leaders.\n\nThe news of the lawsuit sent shockwaves through the financial markets, with shares of Tesla falling more than 4% in after-hours trading. The company's stock price has been volatile in recent months, and the news of the lawsuit added to the uncertainty.\n\nTesla has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the lawsuit. In a statement, the company said, \"We are disappointed, but not surprised, by the SEC's decision. The SEC's claims are unfounded and we will fight them vigorously.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal troubles for Musk, who has been known for his controversial tweets and has been involved in several high-profile feuds with other CEOs and business leaders.

        "Text": "The investment plans of Jaguar Land Rover are unlikely to be an isolated reaction to Brexit. Last week the carmaker revealed amid a fanfare of publicity that it would be hiring 5,000 extra engineers and, with less fanfare, that it would begin work on its next-generation electric car in Austria. Very simply, the company appears to have made a judgment that for the next two to three years the pound will remain low and, with this discount in place on its exports, it will profit from shifting a huge volume of diesel cars from factories in the West Midlands and Merseyside to the rest of the world. But the post-2020 years will be dominated by sales of electric cars, and for that Brexit poses too many risks. The rhetoric from the car industry has become more strident as the opening of negotiations has neared and last year's vague promises from business secretary Greg Clark of help and support have faded from memory. Mike Hawes, the boss of the carmakers' lobbying organisation, said last week that without the promise from Theresa May of interim arrangements to fall back on when talks on a deal conclude in 2019, firms would look overseas for expansion, not to the UK. This sentiment is echoed by many in the industry, who are increasingly concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU. The lack of clarity on future trade agreements and tariffs is causing many companies to re-evaluate their investment plans and consider alternative locations.\n\nOne of the main concerns is the potential for a \"hard Brexit,\" where the UK leaves the EU's single market and customs union without a trade deal in place. This could lead to significant tariffs and bureaucratic hurdles for companies that rely heavily on EU trade, such as Jaguar Land Rover.\n\n\"The uncertainty is causing a lot of anxiety among our members,\" said Hawes. \"We need to see some clarity on the government's plans for the car industry, otherwise we risk losing investment and jobs to other countries.\"\n\nThe car industry is a significant contributor to the UK economy, accounting for around 10% of the country's manufacturing output. The sector employs around 170,000 people and generates around Â£20 billion in exports each year.\n\nHowever, the industry is also facing significant challenges, including the need to invest in new technologies such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving. The government has pledged to invest Â£1 billion in the sector, but many in the industry feel that this is not enough to offset the risks posed by Brexit.\n\nJaguar Land Rover's decision to shift production to Austria is seen as a major blow to the UK's manufacturing sector. The company has been a major employer in the West Midlands and Merseyside for decades, and its decision to move production abroad could have significant implications for the local economy.\n\nThe company's decision is also seen as a warning to other car manufacturers that are considering investing in the UK. Many are now re-evaluating their plans, and some are already making contingency plans to move production abroad.\n\nThe government is under pressure to provide more clarity on its plans for the car industry, and to provide support to companies that are affected by Brexit. The industry is calling for a \"sector deal\" that would provide additional funding and support to help companies adapt to the changes caused by Brexit.\n\nThe government has promised to provide more details on its plans for the car industry in the coming weeks, but many in the industry remain skeptical. The uncertainty is causing significant anxiety, and the industry is calling for more clarity and support to ensure that the UK remains a competitive location for car manufacturing.",

On the palm-lined main thoroughfare of the Tenerife resort town, tourists have an array of choice, from buying a pint for â‚¬1.50 (Â£1.33) to watching football matches, taking jetski trips and even Harley-Davidson tours of the island. Altogether less abundant is any clarity as to what the collapse of Thomas Cook could mean for the town, the Canary Islands and the wider Spanish tourist industry. While much of this week's news has focused on tired, patient Brits queuing in airports to clamber on to planes carrying out the UK's biggest peacetime repatriation, worry has been growing over what the tour giant's demise will mean for the thousands of men and women it employed, directly or indirectly. Tourism accounts for almost 12% of Spain's GDP; in the Canaries, that figure rises to more than 35%. Until this week, a quarter of all the tourists coming to the islands came with Thomas Cook. Spain's general union of workers (UGT) has warned that the fallout could affect the jobs of 10% of hospitality workers in the Canaries. As the islands gear up for the usually lucrative winter season, some hotels are wondering how to fill their rooms â€“ or whether they can be filled at all. \"We're up against one of the biggest economic crises that the Canaries have faced,\" says Melisa RodrÃ­guez, a Tenerife MP for the centre-right Citizens party. As the sun dips into the Atlantic, casting a golden glow over Playa de las AmÃ©ricas, the town's usually vibrant atmosphere is tempered by a sense of uncertainty. The collapse of Thomas Cook has sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many wondering what the future holds for the town and its workers.\n\nFor local businesses, the impact is already being felt. \"We're seeing a significant drop in bookings,\" said Juan Carlos, owner of a popular restaurant on the main strip. \"People are hesitant to make plans, and we're worried that we won't be able to fill our tables.\" His concerns are echoed by many of his peers, who are bracing themselves for a tough winter season.\n\nThe Canary Islands' tourism industry is particularly vulnerable to the collapse of Thomas Cook, given the company's long-standing presence in the region. The islands' unique blend of Spanish and African cultures, stunning natural beauty, and year-round mild climate make them a popular destination for tourists from around the world. But with Thomas Cook's collapse, many of those tourists are now scrambling to find alternative accommodations, leaving local hotels and businesses scrambling to fill the void.\n\nThe Spanish government has moved quickly to address the crisis, announcing a package of measures aimed at supporting the tourism industry and protecting jobs. The package includes a â‚¬200 million bailout fund for struggling hotels and a guarantee that Thomas Cook's employees will receive their wages and benefits for the next three months.\n\nDespite these efforts, many are still worried about the long-term impact of Thomas Cook's collapse. The company's demise has left a power vacuum in the market, and some are concerned that other tour operators may follow suit. \"We're facing a perfect storm of factors that could have a devastating impact on our industry,\" said Melisa RodrÃ­guez, the Tenerife MP. \"We need to work together to find a solution and support our workers and businesses through this difficult time.\"\n\nAs the town of Playa de las AmÃ©ricas begins to rebuild and adapt to the new reality, one thing is clear: the collapse of Thomas Cook has sent a ripple effect through the entire tourism industry, and it will take a concerted effort from all stakeholders to mitigate the damage and ensure the long-term viability of the sector.",

        "Text": "Friday night, the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics -- including the departing president of the United States -- that he honest-to-goodness wants to combat the \"fake news\" that is running wild across his site and others, and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life. \"We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously,\" he wrote. \"We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done,\" he continued, listing various steps Facebook was taking, like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting fact-checking organizations. It was heartening to hear, especially after his earlier assertion that it was \"crazy\" to believe that misinformation on Facebook had affected the presidential election in any real way -- despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the mix, whether it directly swung the result or not. But as Mr. Zuckerberg went on to say that Facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block \"accurate content,\" he added this: \"We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves,\" which was why he said Facebook would continue to rely on \"our community and trusted third parties.\" His statement pointed up how much Facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a free-expression utopia for its 1.8 billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory, dangerous (like terrorist propaganda) and untrue. But more to the point, it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away. Do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting -- without basis -- that Hillary Clinton was involved in John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to stand? Really? As Mark Zuckerberg's statement highlighted the challenges Facebook faces in combating misinformation, it also sparked a heated debate about the role of social media in shaping public opinion and the responsibility that comes with it. Many critics argue that Facebook's reluctance to take a more active role in policing its platform is a result of its own commercial interests, rather than a genuine commitment to promoting truth and accuracy.\n\n\"This is a classic case of Facebook putting profits over people,\" said Dr. Rachel Cobb, a media studies professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"By claiming that they don't want to be arbiters of truth, Zuckerberg is essentially saying that they're willing to sacrifice the integrity of their platform for the sake of keeping users engaged and advertisers happy.\"\n\nFacebook's reliance on \"trusted third parties\" to fact-check content has also been criticized for being inadequate. Many of these organizations are already overwhelmed with work and lack the resources to effectively monitor the vast amount of content on Facebook. Moreover, some critics argue that these organizations are often beholden to the same corporate interests as Facebook, making them unlikely to challenge the platform's dominant narratives.\n\nThe issue of truth and misinformation on social media is not unique to Facebook, however. Other platforms, such as Twitter and YouTube, are also grappling with the same challenges. But Facebook's sheer scale and influence make it a particularly significant player in this debate.\n\nAs the debate rages on, it's clear that the stakes are high. The spread of misinformation on social media has been linked to everything from political polarization to public health crises. In the age of social media, the notion that truth is relative is no longer a theoretical concept, but a tangible reality that has real-world consequences.\n\nUltimately, the question remains: what is the responsibility of social media platforms like Facebook when it comes to promoting truth and accuracy? Can they truly be trusted to police themselves, or do they need to take a more active role in shaping the narrative? As the debate continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the future of democracy depends on finding an answer to this question.",

The following day, oil was discovered at Dharam and the country's prospects were transformed for ever. It took time for the full extent of Saudi Arabia's crude reserves to become known, not least because in early 1938 the world had other things on its mind. But by the time the second world war was over, it was clear that beneath the desert sands there was an abundance of oil that could be easily brought out of the ground. Cheap Saudi oil was a vital component of the world economy's long post-war boom and the revenues from petroleum exports paid for roads, bridges, apartment blocks and western-style living standards. But there was a downside. ...But there was a downside. As the oil flows increased, the traditional nomadic way of life began to disappear, replaced by urbanization and the growth of cities. Many Bedouin tribes were forced to adapt to a new way of living, leaving behind their traditional herding and trading practices. This led to a significant shift in the country's social and cultural landscape, as the once-mobile populations became sedentary and began to adopt more modern lifestyles.\n\nThe influx of oil wealth also brought about significant changes to the country's political landscape. The ruling Al Saud family, who had long been the dominant force in the country, used the oil revenues to consolidate their power and expand their influence. This led to a more centralized government, with the monarch holding significant authority over the country's affairs.\n\nHowever, the oil boom also created new challenges for the country. The rapid growth of the cities led to overcrowding, poverty, and social unrest. The government struggled to provide adequate housing, education, and healthcare to the growing population, leading to widespread discontent among the population.\n\nDespite these challenges, Saudi Arabia continued to thrive as an oil-producing nation. The country became a major player in the global energy market, and its oil exports played a critical role in shaping the world economy. However, the country's dependence on oil also made it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices and global economic downturns.\n\nToday, Saudi Arabia is still heavily reliant on oil exports, but the country is also diversifying its economy and investing in other sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and renewable energy. The government has launched initiatives to promote sustainable development and reduce the country's carbon footprint, recognizing the need to balance economic growth with environmental and social sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia in 1938 marked a significant turning point in the country's history, transforming its economy and society forever. While the oil boom brought many benefits, it also created new challenges and complexities for the country. As Saudi Arabia looks to the future, it is clear that the country's success will depend on its ability to balance its economic, social, and environmental priorities.",

Ashley is not running a charity for impoverished banks and bondholders. Unfortunately for him, it's hard to see a way around the Â£560m debt obstacle. In a victorious bid conducted under Takeover Panel rules, the acquired business arrives with all its borrowings. Since Debs says all its debts have \"change of control\" clauses, meaning lenders can demand immediate repayment by a new owner, Ashley would inherit a towering problem. His side mutters about the potential to refinance at lower interest rates. Well, yes, there would be scope to save a few quid because Sports Direct, which made top-line profits of Â£306m last year, is plainly more creditworthy than Debs, which makes next to nothing. But, unless he can persuade Debs' bankers to write off some of their IOUs (how? ), Ashley would still improve the lenders' position massively via a takeover. However, Ashley's team has been quietly exploring alternative options to sidestep the debt burden. Sources close to the matter have revealed that Sports Direct is in talks with Debenhams' lenders to negotiate a debt-for-equity swap, which would see the debt converted into shares of the struggling retailer.\n\nThis approach would allow Ashley to acquire Debenhams without taking on the full burden of its debt, while also giving him a greater say in the company's operations. The move would also provide Debenhams' lenders with a stake in the company, potentially allowing them to recoup some of their losses.\n\nWhile a debt-for-equity swap is seen as a more viable option for Ashley, it's still not without its challenges. Debenhams' lenders would need to be convinced that a takeover by Sports Direct is in their best interests, and that the company's fortunes would improve under Ashley's ownership.\n\nMoreover, the swap would require the approval of Debenhams' creditors, which could be a lengthy and contentious process. Ashley's team would need to persuade lenders that the deal is fair and reasonable, while also addressing concerns about the impact on the company's employees and customers.\n\nDespite these hurdles, a debt-for-equity swap could be a win-win for all parties involved. For Ashley, it would provide a foothold in the struggling retail sector, while also giving him a chance to turn around Debenhams' fortunes. For Debenhams' lenders, it would provide a way to recoup some of their losses, while also giving them a stake in the company's future.\n\nAs the talks between Sports Direct and Debenhams' lenders continue, the future of the struggling retailer remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: Mike Ashley's takeover bid for Debenhams is far from a done deal, and will require careful negotiation and planning to succeed.",

The Iranian-German who killed nine people at a Munich mall was reportedly obsessed with mass killings, particularly the attack by a Norwegian that killed 77 people in 2011. The Tunisian who killed 84 people at a Bastille Day celebration in Nice, France, also researched previous attacks, including the mass killing in Orlando, Fla. The Orlando gunman had reportedly researched the San Bernardino, Calif., attack. Some of the attacks are ideological, some are not and some fall into a gray area. But the highly publicized attacks in a nightclub and restaurants in Paris, at airports in Brussels and Istanbul, and in public spaces in Mumbai may be providing troubled people already contemplating violence a spur to act, experts said, in the same way that many school shootings and other violent rampages follow close on the heels of similar incidents in the news. \"Those of us in this field, it's the first thing we think about when we read accounts of these recent mass murders: The detailed coverage of terrorist attacks may be giving people who are vulnerable or thinking along these line ideas about what to do and how to do it,\" said Madelyn Gould, a professor of epidemiology and psychiatry at Columbia. Experts Warn of Contagion Effect in Mass Killings\n\nThe recent spate of mass shootings and killings has sparked concerns among mental health professionals and law enforcement agencies that the widespread media coverage of these events may be contributing to a contagion effect, inspiring others to follow suit.\n\n\"This is a very disturbing trend,\" said Dr. Gould, who has studied the phenomenon of copycat violence. \"When we see these highly publicized attacks, it can create a sense of notoriety and fame for the perpetrator, which can be very appealing to someone who is already struggling with mental health issues or feeling isolated and marginalized.\"\n\nDr. Gould and other experts point to the example of the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, which was followed by a wave of copycat attacks at schools across the United States. Similarly, the 2013 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut led to a surge in threats and incidents of violence at schools.\n\nThe highly publicized attacks in Paris, Brussels, and Istanbul, which were carried out by groups with ideological motivations, have also been linked to a rise in violent extremism and radicalization among some individuals.\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict with certainty which individuals will be inspired to carry out violence, experts say that the widespread media coverage of these events can play a role in normalizing and glorifying violent behavior.\n\n\"We need to be aware of the potential impact of our reporting and the language we use to describe these events,\" said Dr. Gould. \"We should avoid using sensationalized language and avoid giving perpetrators a platform to promote their ideology. Instead, we should focus on promoting messages of hope and resilience, and providing resources and support to those who are struggling.\"\n\nIn addition to changing the way we report on mass killings, experts say that it is also important to address the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to violence and to provide support to those who are vulnerable to radicalization or copycat behavior.\n\n\"This is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach,\" said Dr. Gould. \"We need to work together as a society to create a culture of empathy and compassion, and to provide support and resources to those who are struggling.\"\n\nIn the meantime, experts say that it is important for individuals to be aware of the potential risks and to take steps to protect themselves and their communities.\n\n\"If you are feeling overwhelmed or struggling with mental health issues, please seek help,\" said Dr. Gould. \"And if you see something suspicious or concerning, please report it to the authorities. We all have a role to play in preventing these tragic events from occurring.\"",

Yet there are also pitfalls -- from cost to tepid audience reaction -- that make the decision to enter the virtual reality world a bit more complicated than it may first seem. \"You don't jump at every shiny new object,\" said Mike Bloxham, a senior vice president at Frank N. Magid Associates, a market research and consulting firm. According to Bloxham, it's crucial for brands to carefully consider their goals and target audience before investing in virtual reality marketing. \"You need to have a clear understanding of what you're trying to achieve and who you're trying to reach,\" he emphasized. \"Virtual reality is not a silver bullet, and it's not suitable for every brand or campaign.\"\n\nOne of the primary concerns for brands is the cost of producing high-quality virtual reality content. Creating immersive experiences that can engage audiences requires significant investment in equipment, software, and personnel. \"The cost of production is still relatively high, especially for complex experiences,\" said Rachel Ginsberg, a creative director at the virtual reality agency, VR First. \"You need to have a robust budget to produce something that's going to stand out and capture people's attention.\"\n\nAnother challenge is the limited reach and adoption of virtual reality technology. While the technology is becoming more mainstream, it still requires a specific device or headset to access virtual reality content. This can limit the potential audience and make it difficult for brands to reach a wider audience. \"You need to consider the fragmentation of the market and the fact that not everyone has access to virtual reality technology,\" said Bloxham. \"You need to think carefully about how you're going to reach your target audience and make sure that your message is being delivered effectively.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, many brands are still eager to incorporate virtual reality into their marketing strategies. According to a recent survey by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, 71% of marketers believe that virtual reality will play a significant role in their marketing efforts in the next two years. \"Virtual reality has the potential to be a game-changer for brands,\" said Ginsberg. \"It allows them to create immersive experiences that can engage audiences in a way that's not possible with traditional marketing methods.\"\n\nTo overcome the challenges and make the most of virtual reality marketing, brands are advised to start small and experiment with different formats and platforms. \"Don't try to boil the ocean,\" said Bloxham. \"Start with a small pilot project and test the waters. See what works and what doesn't, and then scale up your efforts accordingly.\" By taking a measured approach and carefully considering their goals and audience, brands can navigate the complexities of virtual reality marketing and reap the rewards of this exciting new technology.",

In this breach, I was one of the 90 million people who were suddenly logged out of their accounts by Facebook -- the company's far-too-subtle way of letting me know that my account might have been compromised. (Facebook, you could at least have sent me a message along with all the spammy ads you send me on Messenger.) This breach is more troubling than the typical hack. The stolen Facebook login information -- essentially a master key -- could have been used to impersonate the victims at hundreds of other sites and apps that allow people to sign in using their Facebook credentials. As the news of the breach spread, the tech industry and cybersecurity experts were left scrambling to understand the scope and severity of the attack. The fact that hackers gained access to the accounts of Facebook's own executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, raised concerns about the company's ability to protect its own users' data.\n\nThe breach is believed to have occurred through a vulnerability in Facebook's \"View As\" feature, which allows users to see what their profile looks like to others. The vulnerability was exploited by hackers who were able to steal access tokens, which are used to authenticate users and grant access to their accounts.\n\nThe stolen access tokens could be used to impersonate the victims at hundreds of other sites and apps that allow people to sign in using their Facebook credentials, such as online banking platforms, email services, and social media platforms. This raises concerns about the potential for identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities.\n\nFacebook has taken steps to mitigate the damage, including resetting the passwords of all 50 million affected accounts and implementing new security measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. The company has also notified law enforcement and is working with them to investigate the attack.\n\nThe breach has also raised questions about Facebook's data protection practices and its ability to protect its users' data. The company has faced criticism in the past for its handling of user data, and this breach has only added to those concerns.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook said that it was \"taking immediate action to understand the nature and scope of this incident\" and that it was \"working to identify and contact affected users.\" The company also said that it was \"reviewing its security practices and implementing additional measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.\"\n\nThe breach has also raised concerns about the security of other social media platforms and online services that rely on Facebook's login feature. Many users rely on Facebook to sign in to other websites and apps, and the breach has raised concerns about the potential for similar attacks on other platforms.\n\nAs the investigation into the breach continues, it is clear that Facebook has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of its users and the public. The company must take concrete steps to improve its data protection practices and ensure that its users' data is safe and secure.",

        "Text": "Young adults will have retirement incomes similar to today's pensioners, according to analysis which rejects widespread pessimism about the financial prospects for millennials. Men in their 40s will suffer a fall in their retirement incomes compared with today's pensioners, but the generation behind them will see their incomes recover, analysis by the Resolution Foundation found. It said the average pension for a man will be about Â£310 a week in 2020, taking into account state and private pensions. This will fall to about Â£285 in the mid 2040s in real terms \"before building again to about Â£300 a week by the end of the 2050s\". For women, there will be no dip in pension income but a small improvement over time. The analysis, which was published by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on economic and social issues, suggests that the concerns about the financial prospects of millennials are overstated. The report found that the average pension for a woman will be around Â£240 a week in 2020, which will gradually increase to around Â£260 a week by the end of the 2050s.\n\nThe report's author, Laura Gardiner, a senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that the analysis takes into account a range of factors, including changes to the state pension age, the impact of auto-enrolment, and the growth of the private pension sector.\n\nGardiner noted that while there may be some fluctuations in pension incomes over time, the overall trend is one of improvement. \"Our analysis suggests that, despite some short-term fluctuations, the average pension income for men and women will increase over the coming decades,\" she said.\n\nThe report's findings are likely to be welcomed by policymakers and pension experts, who have been concerned about the impact of demographic changes on the UK's pension system. The UK's population is aging, and there are concerns that the pension system may not be able to support the growing number of retirees.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced by the report's findings. Some experts have warned that the analysis may be overly optimistic, and that the reality may be very different. \"While it's true that the average pension income may increase over time, it's also important to remember that many people will not have access to a pension at all,\" said John Ralfe, a pensions expert and former director of policy at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association.\n\nRalfe pointed out that many people, particularly those in low-paid or precarious work, may not have access to a pension, and that the system may not be able to support the growing number of people who are not saving enough for retirement.\n\nDespite these concerns, the report's findings are likely to be seen as a positive sign for young adults, who have been worried about their financial prospects. The analysis suggests that, despite some short-term challenges, the average pension income for men and women will increase over the coming decades, providing a more secure financial future for generations to come.",

Dancing on the rug, building with blocks and painting on easels. ...are just a few of the activities that 4-year-olds at the Pasadena Early Learning Center are enjoying as part of their daily routine. The center, which serves children from low-income families, is one of several in the region that is incorporating play-based learning into its curriculum.\n\nThe philosophy behind play-based learning is simple: children learn best when they're having fun. By allowing children to explore and engage with their environment through play, educators can help them develop important skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and social skills.\n\nAt the Pasadena Early Learning Center, the play-based approach is led by a team of experienced teachers and educators who work closely with the children to design activities that are both fun and educational. The center's director, Sarah Johnson, explained that the goal is to create an environment that is engaging and stimulating, while also providing a sense of security and support.\n\n\"We want our children to feel like they're in a safe and nurturing space where they can explore and learn at their own pace,\" Johnson said. \"By incorporating play-based learning into our curriculum, we're able to help our children develop a love of learning that will last a lifetime.\"\n\nThe results are impressive. Children at the Pasadena Early Learning Center are making rapid progress in their language and literacy skills, and are also showing significant improvement in their social and emotional development. Many of the children are also exhibiting a sense of confidence and self-assurance that is rare in young children.\n\nOne parent, Maria Rodriguez, whose 4-year-old son attends the center, said that she has seen a significant change in her child since he started attending the center. \"He's become more confident and independent, and is now able to communicate more effectively with his teachers and peers,\" she said.\n\nThe Pasadena Early Learning Center is not alone in its use of play-based learning. Many early childhood education centers and schools in the region are adopting similar approaches, and the results are promising. As the importance of early childhood education continues to grow, it's likely that we'll see even more emphasis on play-based learning in the years to come.\n\nIn the meantime, the children at the Pasadena Early Learning Center will continue to muck around with sand and water, play Candy Land, and cook pretend meals in their child-size kitchen. And as they do, they'll be learning and growing in ways that will serve them well for the rest of their lives.",

SAN FRANCISCO -- The finger-pointing over the scuttled $44 billion transaction between the chip makers Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors has begun. Richard Clemmer, chief executive of NXP, had some harsh words on Thursday for officials in China over the deal's collapse amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The acquisition was terminated after it failed to secure regulatory approval from Chinese authorities before a deadline set by the companies at midnight Eastern time on Wednesday. Clemmer's criticism comes as the tech industry grapples with the implications of the collapsed merger, which would have created a chip-making giant with a significant presence in the global market. The deal was initially announced in October 2016, but faced numerous regulatory hurdles, including scrutiny from Chinese authorities.\n\nThe Chinese government's decision to block the deal has been met with surprise and frustration from industry insiders, who point to the significant economic benefits the merger would have brought to the region. \"This is a huge missed opportunity for China,\" said David Wong, a semiconductor analyst at Cowen and Company. \"The deal would have created a global chip-making powerhouse, and would have likely driven innovation and investment in the region.\"\n\nThe collapse of the deal also raises concerns about the future of the global chip-making industry, which has been plagued by supply chain disruptions and trade tensions. The merger would have combined Qualcomm's expertise in wireless technology with NXP's strengths in automotive and industrial applications.\n\nQualcomm and NXP had agreed to a deadline of midnight Eastern time on Wednesday to secure regulatory approval from Chinese authorities, but the deal ultimately fell through. The companies had been working closely with Chinese regulators, but ultimately failed to secure the necessary approvals.\n\nThe collapse of the deal has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with shares of Qualcomm and NXP plummeting in response. The companies have not yet commented on the collapse of the deal, but industry insiders expect them to explore alternative strategies to achieve their goals.\n\nThe failed merger is also a setback for the Chinese government's efforts to promote its tech industry and reduce its reliance on foreign companies. The country has been aggressively pursuing its \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, which aims to boost the country's manufacturing capabilities and reduce its dependence on foreign technology.\n\nThe collapse of the deal is likely to have significant implications for the global chip-making industry, and could lead to a period of increased consolidation and competition. As the tech industry grapples with the fallout from the failed merger, one thing is clear: the collapse of the deal is a major setback for the industry, and could have far-reaching consequences for the global economy.",

They say a negative credit outlook is now a possibility, as the S&P rating agency prepares to publish its annual review of Australia's credit rating next month. Former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin told Guardian Australia both parties were relying on Treasury's assumption that nominal income growth will revert to a rate of 5% in two years to boost revenue and drag their budgets back to balance by 2020-21. McKibbin, a renowned economist and director of the Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis at the Australian National University, expressed deep concern about the lack of preparedness by both major parties to address potential economic shocks.\n\n\"Treasury's assumption of 5% nominal income growth is highly optimistic, especially given the current global economic uncertainty,\" McKibbin said. \"If that doesn't eventuate, both parties' budgets will be in trouble. We're talking about a significant risk of a negative credit outlook, which would have far-reaching consequences for the country.\"\n\nMcKibbin's warnings come as the S&P rating agency prepares to publish its annual review of Australia's credit rating next month. A negative credit outlook could lead to higher borrowing costs for the government and potentially even a downgrade in the country's credit rating.\n\nThe economist pointed out that both the Coalition and Labor governments have been relying heavily on assumptions about future economic growth to balance their budgets. However, he believes this approach is flawed, as it fails to account for the potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the economy.\n\n\"This lack of preparedness is a recipe for disaster,\" McKibbin said. \"We need to see a more realistic approach to budgeting, one that takes into account the potential risks and uncertainties facing the economy. Otherwise, we risk facing a fiscal crisis down the track.\"\n\nMcKibbin's comments have been echoed by other economists, who have also expressed concerns about the lack of preparedness by both major parties. The Australian Institute of Company Directors has warned that a negative credit outlook could have significant implications for the country's economy, including higher borrowing costs and reduced consumer and business confidence.\n\nThe government has been accused of being complacent about the state of the economy, with some economists warning that the country is facing a perfect storm of risks, including a slowing global economy, rising debt levels, and a housing market that is showing signs of weakness.\n\nAs the S&P rating agency prepares to publish its annual review, the government will be under intense pressure to address its budgetary position and demonstrate a more realistic approach to economic planning. However, with the major parties seemingly at odds over the best way to address the country's economic challenges, it remains to be seen whether meaningful reforms will be implemented in time to avert a potential fiscal crisis.",

More than 50 companies managing $3.8tn (Â£3tn) of money, including pension funds and insurers, declared support for \"tobacco control measures being taken around the world\" â€“ even though some of them still own shares in tobacco businesses. In a joint statement, released to coincide with World No Tobacco Day, they said: \"We in the investment community are becoming increasingly aware of the important role we can play in helping to address the health and societal impacts of tobacco.\" The firms cited studies suggesting that smoking costs the global economy more than $1tn a year, outstripping global revenues from tobacco taxes. The statement, which was signed by investment giants such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors, also highlighted the devastating health effects of smoking, citing the World Health Organization's (WHO) estimate that tobacco kills over seven million people each year.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant shift in the investment industry's stance on tobacco, with many firms previously hesitant to divest from the industry due to concerns over potential losses. However, with growing pressure from investors, policymakers, and public health advocates, the tide appears to be turning.\n\n\"This is a major victory for public health advocates and a significant step forward in the fight against tobacco,\" said Dr. Linda Bauld, a professor of health policy at the University of Stirling. \"The investment community has long been a major obstacle to progress on tobacco control, but today's statement shows that even the biggest players are starting to recognize the devastating impact of smoking on public health and the economy.\"\n\nThe call to divest from tobacco companies is not new, but the scale and scope of the investment firms' statement is unprecedented. In the UK, local authorities have been under pressure to divest their pension fund investments from tobacco companies, with some councils already taking steps to do so.\n\nThe City of London, for example, has committed to divesting its pension fund from tobacco companies, while other councils, such as Bristol and Manchester, have also announced plans to do so. However, many more councils remain invested in tobacco companies, despite the growing calls for divestment.\n\nThe investment firms' statement is likely to put further pressure on local authorities to take action. \"We urge all local authorities to follow the lead of the investment community and divest their pension fund investments from tobacco companies,\" said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health. \"It's time for councils to prioritize public health and the well-being of their citizens over profits from the tobacco industry.\"\n\nThe move is also expected to have implications for the tobacco industry itself, with some analysts predicting that the loss of investment could lead to a decline in the industry's value. \"This is a significant blow to the tobacco industry, which has long relied on the investment community to support its business model,\" said Dr. Bauld. \"As the industry's financial backers begin to distance themselves from tobacco, it's likely that we'll see a decline in the industry's power and influence.\"",

Shoppers started queuing outside branches of high street chain Next at 12.30am while on Oxford Street, in London a crowd started forming outside Selfridges at 2.30am. However, retail experts said that overall shopper numbers were significantly down on 2016. The power of the Boxing Day sales has been diminished in recent years due to a combination of internet discount extravaganzas such as November's Black Friday and the fact that major stores such as Marks & Spencer and John Lewis start their sales online on Christmas Eve. Despite the decline in foot traffic, many retailers reported strong online sales, with some experiencing a surge in digital transactions. According to data from the UK's Office for National Statistics, online sales on Boxing Day increased by 14.4% compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe shift towards online shopping has been a major factor in the decline of traditional Boxing Day sales. Many consumers are now opting to avoid the crowds and queues, instead choosing to browse and purchase from the comfort of their own homes. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, with retail experts predicting that online sales will continue to outpace in-store sales.\n\nHowever, not all retailers are struggling. Some smaller, independent stores have reported strong sales, with many citing the personal touch and unique offerings as key factors in their success. \"We've had a fantastic day,\" said Sarah Johnson, owner of a boutique clothing store on London's King's Road. \"Our customers love the personal service and the fact that we can offer them something different from the big high street chains.\"\n\nThe decline of the traditional Boxing Day sales has also led to a shift in the way retailers are approaching their sales strategies. Instead of relying on one-day sales events, many are now opting for longer-term sales periods, often starting on Christmas Eve or even earlier in the week. This approach allows them to spread out the sales over a longer period, reducing the pressure on their stores and allowing them to focus on providing a better customer experience.\n\nAs the retail industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how the Boxing Day sales will adapt. While some retailers may continue to struggle, others are likely to thrive by embracing the changing habits of their customers. One thing is certain, however: the Boxing Day sales will continue to be an important event in the retail calendar, even if they look and feel very different from the sales of years gone by.",

Researchers studying Egyptian fruit bats say they have found a way to work out who is arguing with whom, what they are squabbling about and can even predict the outcome of a disagreement â€“ all from the bats' calls. \"The global quest is to understand where human language comes from. To do this we must study animal communication,\" said Yossi Yovel, co-author of the research from Tel Aviv University in Israel. \"One of the big questions in animal communication is how much information is conveyed.\" Researchers from Tel Aviv University in Israel, led by Dr. Yossi Yovel, have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of animal communication. By analyzing the vocalizations of Egyptian fruit bats, the team was able to decipher the content and context of their arguments, as well as predict the outcome of disputes.\n\nThe researchers used a combination of machine learning algorithms and acoustic analysis to study the calls of over 1,000 Egyptian fruit bats. They found that the bats use a range of vocalizations, including chirps, squeaks, and grunts, to convey different types of information. By analyzing the patterns and frequencies of these calls, the team was able to identify specific themes and topics being discussed, such as food, mating, and territory.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, revealed that the bats' arguments are often centered around resource competition, with individuals vying for access to food and shelter. The researchers found that dominant bats tend to use more aggressive vocalizations, while subordinate bats use more submissive ones. This dynamic allows the dominant bats to assert their dominance and maintain social order within the colony.\n\nOne of the most significant findings of the study was the ability to predict the outcome of disputes. By analyzing the calls of the disputing parties, the researchers were able to accurately forecast which bat would emerge victorious. This ability to predict the outcome of arguments has significant implications for our understanding of animal social behavior and could potentially be applied to human conflict resolution.\n\nDr. Yovel explained that the study has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of human language. \"The ability to convey complex information through vocalizations is a key component of human language,\" he said. \"By studying animal communication, we can gain insights into the evolutionary origins of language and how it has developed over time.\"\n\nThe research has also sparked new questions about the cognitive abilities of animals. \"We're not just looking at simple communication here,\" said Dr. Yovel. \"We're seeing complex social dynamics and even a form of conflict resolution. This challenges our understanding of animal intelligence and raises questions about the extent to which animals are capable of complex thought.\"\n\nThe study's findings have far-reaching implications for fields such as animal behavior, ecology, and conservation. By gaining a deeper understanding of animal communication, researchers can develop more effective strategies for protecting endangered species and preserving ecosystems.\n\nAs the researchers continue to study the vocalizations of Egyptian fruit bats, they are uncovering new secrets about the complex social dynamics of animal societies. Their work is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary research and the importance of exploring the natural world to gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.",

However, the UK-headquartered oil and gas firm said it still expects the global hunger for crude to grow for years and not peak until the late 2030s. Spencer Dale, the group's chief economist, said: \"Just around the world you see increasing awareness of the environmental damage associated with plastics and different types of packaging of one form of another. \"If you live in the UK that's clearly been an issue, but it's not just a UK-specific thing; you see it worldwide, for example China has changed some of its policies.\" Theresa May has branded plastic waste an environmental scourge, and MPs have called for charges on plastic bags to be extended to disposable coffee cups. Dale predicted such measures around the world could mean 2m barrels per day lower oil demand growth by 2040. But he said single use plastics were only about 15% of all non-combusted oil, which is used for petrochemicals, an industry that BP expects to be a big driver of global growth in crude demand. The company's energy outlook report, published on Tuesday, forecasts demand peaking at about 110m barrels per day between 2035 and 2040, up from around 97mb/d today. Despite the expected decline in oil demand due to the ban on single-use plastics, BP's report highlights that the global demand for crude will continue to grow, driven primarily by the increasing demand for petrochemicals. The company's chief economist, Spencer Dale, emphasized that while the ban on single-use plastics will have a significant impact on oil demand, it is only a small portion of the overall non-combusted oil demand.\n\nPetrochemicals, which are used to produce a wide range of products including plastics, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals, are expected to be a major driver of global growth in crude demand. According to BP's report, the demand for petrochemicals is expected to increase by 20% over the next two decades, driven by growing demand from emerging markets such as Asia.\n\nThe report also highlights that the shift towards cleaner energy sources, such as wind and solar power, will also have a significant impact on oil demand. While the growth in renewable energy is expected to slow down the rate of increase in oil demand, it is not expected to peak demand anytime soon.\n\nIn addition to the ban on single-use plastics, other factors such as increasing fuel efficiency standards and the adoption of electric vehicles are also expected to impact oil demand. However, BP's report suggests that these factors will not be enough to peak oil demand in the near future.\n\nThe company's energy outlook report also highlights the significant challenges that the oil and gas industry faces in the coming years. The report warns that the industry will need to invest heavily in new technologies and infrastructure to meet growing demand for cleaner energy sources.\n\nIn response to the report, environmental groups have called for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources. \"BP's report highlights the urgent need for governments and businesses to take action to reduce carbon emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources,\" said a spokesperson for the environmental group, Friends of the Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, while the ban on single-use plastics is expected to have a significant impact on oil demand, BP's report suggests that the global demand for crude will continue to grow over the next two decades. The company's energy outlook report highlights the significant challenges that the oil and gas industry faces in the coming years, and the need for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources.",

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has looked into filling trucks with cash and sending them over the Greek border so clients can continue to pay local employees and suppliers in the event money is unavailable. Ford has configured its computer systems so they will be able to immediately handle a new Greek currency. No one knows just how broad the shock waves from a Greek exit would be, but big American banks and consulting firms have also been doing a brisk business advising their corporate clients on how to prepare for a splintering of the euro zone. That is a striking contrast to the assurances from European politicians that the crisis is manageable and that the currency union can be held together. On Thursday, the European Central Bank will consider measures that would ease pressure on Europe's cash-starved countries. As the Greek debt crisis continues to unfold, American companies are taking a proactive approach to prepare for a potential Greek exit from the euro zone. While the European Central Bank (ECB) has announced plans to consider measures to ease pressure on cash-strapped countries, many U.S. companies are not taking any chances.\n\nIn addition to Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Ford, other major American companies such as General Electric and Caterpillar are also taking steps to prepare for a Greek exit. General Electric has set up a team to monitor the situation and provide guidance to its clients, while Caterpillar has stockpiled parts and supplies in Greece to ensure that its operations can continue uninterrupted.\n\nThe preparation by American companies is a stark contrast to the assurances from European politicians that the crisis is manageable and that the currency union can be held together. European leaders have repeatedly emphasized that the euro zone is strong and that a Greek exit is not a viable option. However, many economists and financial experts have warned that a Greek exit could have far-reaching consequences for the global economy.\n\nA Greek exit from the euro zone would likely lead to a sharp devaluation of the new Greek currency, making imports more expensive and potentially leading to inflation. It could also lead to a credit crunch, as banks and financial institutions struggle to cope with the uncertainty. Additionally, a Greek exit could have a ripple effect on other countries in the euro zone, potentially leading to a wider crisis.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, many American companies are taking a pragmatic approach and preparing for the worst-case scenario. \"We're not taking any chances,\" said a spokesperson for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"We're doing everything we can to prepare for a potential Greek exit, and we're advising our clients to do the same.\"\n\nThe preparation by American companies is not limited to just a few major corporations. Many smaller businesses are also taking steps to prepare for a potential Greek exit. \"We're stockpiling supplies and cash, and we're advising our employees to do the same,\" said the owner of a small manufacturing company that does business with Greece.\n\nWhile a Greek exit from the euro zone is still a possibility, many experts believe that it is unlikely to happen in the near future. The ECB has announced plans to consider measures to ease pressure on cash-strapped countries, and European leaders have reiterated their commitment to keeping the currency union intact.\n\nHowever, the preparation by American companies is a testament to the uncertainty surrounding the Greek debt crisis.

The rise of digital media has led to a decline in print circulation, and many papers are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nHowever, Fox remains optimistic about the future of print media, citing the success of papers like The Guardian and The Times. \"There's still a place for quality print journalism in the market,\" he said. \"We're committed to making sure that New Day is a paper that readers want to read and advertisers want to advertise in.\"\n\nIn other news, Tony Blackburn has spoken out about his sacking from the BBC, thanking his fans for their support. The broadcaster, who was fired from his role on Radio 2 last year, has been hosting a show on Kent-based station KMFM.\n\n\"I'm grateful to my fans for their support and loyalty,\" Blackburn said in a statement. \"I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my career and exploring new opportunities.\"\n\nThe BBC has also been making headlines, with reports that it has offered Tony Blackburn the option to quit and return to the corporation within months. However, it remains unclear whether Blackburn will take up the offer.\n\nIn business news, the Institute of Directors has called for BT to face more competition in the market. The organization has accused the telecoms giant of stifling innovation and limiting choice for consumers.\n\n\"We need to see more competition in the market to drive innovation and improve services for consumers,\" said IoD director general, Simon Walker. \"BT's dominance is stifling innovation and limiting choice, and it's time for the government to take action.\"\n\nIn other business news, WPP has been profiled in a special feature in the Financial Times. The article explores the company's success and its plans for the future.\n\nFinally, the film industry has been making headlines, with reports that former Sony chief Amy Pascal has spoken out about the industry's treatment of women. Pascal, who was forced to resign from her role at Sony last year, has accused the industry of being \"geared for women to fail\".\n\n\"It's a tough industry, and it's even tougher for women,\" Pascal said in an interview with The Independent. \"I think we need to see more women in leadership roles and more diversity on screen.\"\n\nThe article concludes with a look at the latest news and analysis from the world of media and entertainment.",

        "Text": "An influential investor group has told companies they must publish credible action plans that align executive pension pay with their workforce by 2022, or risk further shareholder revolts. The move could result in companies slashing bumper pension payouts for several executives, who pocket hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash retirement benefits every year. The Investment Association â€“ which represents City firms with Â£7.7tn in assets under management â€“ said it will slap companies' annual reports with a \"red top\" or highest possible warning label if they fail to share concrete action plans to align executive pension pay with the majority of staff and continue to offer top bosses retirement benefits worth over 25% of salary. UK workers receive a pension worth, on average, about 10% of their pay, but that figure can be as low as 8% based on the latest auto-enrolment rules, and the bulk of it is paid by the workers themselves. The Investment Association's new guidelines aim to address the growing concern among investors and the general public about the significant disparity between executive pension pay and that of the average worker. The organization is urging companies to take concrete steps to address this issue, citing concerns that the current system perpetuates inequality and undermines trust in corporate governance.\n\nAccording to the Investment Association, many companies continue to offer generous pension packages to their executives, often worth over 25% of their salary, while the majority of staff receive much more modest benefits. This disparity is seen as particularly egregious given that UK workers, on average, receive a pension worth around 10% of their pay, with the bulk of it being paid by the workers themselves.\n\nThe Investment Association's warning label, which will be applied to companies' annual reports, is intended to raise awareness about the issue and encourage companies to take action. The label will be given to companies that fail to provide concrete action plans to align executive pension pay with the majority of staff and continue to offer top bosses retirement benefits worth over 25% of salary.\n\nThe move has been welcomed by some investors and corporate governance experts, who argue that it is long overdue. \"This is a welcome step towards greater transparency and accountability in corporate governance,\" said Emma Warren, a senior analyst at a leading investment firm. \"Companies need to be held accountable for the way they treat their employees, and this move will help to ensure that they are doing more to address the issue of executive pension pay.\"\n\nHowever, some industry experts have expressed concerns that the move could lead to unintended consequences, such as companies reducing the overall value of their pension schemes or imposing higher costs on employees. \"While we understand the concerns around executive pension pay, we need to be careful not to create unintended consequences that could harm employees,\" said a spokesperson for the Confederation of British Industry.\n\nThe Investment Association's new guidelines are expected to be closely watched by investors, regulators, and companies alike. As the deadline for compliance approaches, companies will need to demonstrate that they are taking concrete steps to address the issue of executive pension pay and align it with the majority of staff. Failure to do so could result in further shareholder revolts and a loss of trust in corporate governance.\n\nIn the meantime, the debate around executive pension pay is likely to continue, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in corporate governance. As the Investment Association's warning label becomes a reality, companies will need to take action to ensure that their pension schemes are fair and equitable for all employees, not just the executives at the top.",

        "Text": "A hospice charity signed a deal with a direct marketing agency that could have resulted in hospices receiving less than 2% of Â£5.4m raised from the public, according to a Charity Commission report. Hospice Aid UK agreed a seven-year deal with Piccadilly-based marketers Euro DM that resulted in the public being \"misled\" over how much money would be given to hospices. Since the Charity Commission stepped in, the agency has agreed to pay back Â£325,000. The case is likely to raise concerns about the fundraising strategies used by some charities, some of which result in high management costs. Hospice Aid UK was set up to raise money and then pass it on to hospices across the country. However, the Charity Commission began looking at the charity after it only passed on 1.9% of its income to hospices in 2012. In that year, the charity raised Â£132,023, but only made grants worth Â£2,557. The investigation by the Charity Commission found that Hospice Aid UK's deal with Euro DM was structured in a way that allowed the agency to retain a significant portion of the funds raised, with the charity only receiving a small percentage of the total amount. The report stated that the charity's income was largely comprised of donations from the public, which were then used to pay for marketing and administrative costs, rather than being passed on to hospices.\n\nThe Charity Commission's intervention led to a significant change in the way Hospice Aid UK operates, with the charity agreeing to pay back the Â£325,000 to the agency and revising its fundraising strategy to ensure that a greater proportion of donations go directly to hospices.\n\nThe case has raised concerns about the transparency and accountability of some charities, with critics arguing that some organizations are prioritizing high management costs over the causes they claim to support. The Charity Commission has emphasized the importance of charities being open and transparent about their fundraising methods and ensuring that donations are used efficiently and effectively.\n\nHospice Aid UK has since implemented a number of changes to its operations, including the appointment of a new board of trustees and the introduction of stricter financial controls. The charity has also committed to increasing the proportion of donations that go directly to hospices, with the aim of reaching a minimum of 75% of all income.\n\nThe case has also sparked a wider debate about the fundraising strategies used by charities, with some arguing that the sector needs to adopt a more sustainable and transparent approach to fundraising. The Charity Commission has emphasized the importance of charities being mindful of the public's trust and ensuring that donations are used for the intended purpose.\n\nIn response to the report, Hospice Aid UK has apologized for any confusion or concern caused and has committed to continuing to work with the Charity Commission to ensure that its fundraising activities are transparent and accountable. The charity has also announced plans to launch a new fundraising campaign, which will prioritize direct donations to hospices and ensure that the public is aware of how their donations are being used.\n\nThe Charity Commission's report has sent a clear message to charities across the country: that transparency, accountability, and efficiency are essential in maintaining public trust and ensuring that donations are used effectively. As the sector continues to evolve, it is clear that charities must prioritize these values in order to maintain the public's confidence and support.",

        "Text": "The controversial ticketing website Viagogo is preparing to move much of its UK workforce to New York, as it explores US expansion. The move comes at a time when the company faces multiple investigations into its affairs in Europe. The Competition and Markets Authority warned the company in April that it was risking legal action for suspected breaches of consumer law, and National Trading Standards launched a separate investigation into \"misleading\" pricing just days later. A source familiar with developments at Viagogo told the Guardian the company began notifying senior staff in London of plans to move their jobs to New York in May. \"Several senior developers have already relocated, but they're mostly people that have been at Viagogo since nearly day one and so are probably invested in the company,\" said the source. \"A few others are moving in the next couple of months, and others are leaving very soon.\" A recruitment page on Viagogo's website features multiple job adverts seeking staff to join its New York team, as well as some for other parts of the world. But the company is not recruiting for its office on London's Fenchurch Street, where nearly 100 staff worked in customer services and website development last year, according to Companies House filings. The move to New York is seen as a strategic decision by Viagogo to expand its operations in the US market, where it faces stiff competition from other ticketing platforms such as StubHub and SeatGeek. The company has been growing rapidly in recent years, and its US expansion is expected to be a key factor in its future success.\n\nHowever, the move has raised concerns among some employees who are worried about the impact on the company's UK operations. \"It's a bit of a shock, to be honest,\" said one employee who wished to remain anonymous. \"We've been told that the London office will be closing, and that our jobs will be moving to New York. It's unclear what will happen to the remaining staff, but it's not looking good.\"\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns among consumer groups, who have been critical of Viagogo's business practices in the past. \"This move is a clear indication that Viagogo is more interested in making a quick buck than in serving its customers,\" said a spokesperson for the consumer group Which?. \"We urge the company to prioritize transparency and fairness in its dealings with consumers, rather than just chasing profits.\"\n\nIn a statement, Viagogo said that the move to New York was part of its strategy to \"strengthen its global presence\" and \"better serve its customers.\" The company did not comment on the impact on its UK operations or the fate of its remaining staff.\n\nThe move comes at a time when Viagogo is facing multiple investigations into its affairs in Europe. In April, the Competition and Markets Authority warned the company that it was risking legal action for suspected breaches of consumer law, and National Trading Standards launched a separate investigation into \"misleading\" pricing just days later.\n\nDespite the challenges, Viagogo remains one of the largest ticketing platforms in the world, with millions of users and a vast inventory of tickets to events. The company has been criticized in the past for its business practices, including allegations of price gouging and misrepresentation of ticket availability.\n\nIn recent years, Viagogo has faced increased competition from other ticketing platforms, including StubHub and SeatGeek, which have gained popularity among consumers. The company has responded by investing heavily in its technology and marketing, and has expanded its offerings to include new features such as ticket insurance and loyalty programs.\n\nThe move to New York is seen as a key part of Viagogo's strategy to stay ahead of the competition and expand its global presence. The company has already begun recruiting for its New York team, and is expected to continue to grow its operations in the US market in the coming months.\n\nIn conclusion, Viagogo's decision to move its UK workforce to New York is a significant development in the company's history, and raises questions about its future plans and priorities. While the move is seen as a strategic decision to expand the company's global presence, it also raises concerns among employees and consumer groups about the impact on the company's UK operations and its commitment to transparency and fairness.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The world economy will face slower but less volatile growth in the coming months and years, the World Bank forecast on Wednesday, as dire risks from the financial crisis in Europe fade and emerging economies confront new challenges adapting to softer commodity prices and the prospect of rising interest rates. \"There's a growing recognition that this is not the aftereffect of the crisis,\" Andrew Burns, the lead author of the report, said in an interview. \"It is a new normal.\" All in all, the bank's economists forecast that the global economy will grow about 2.2 percent this year and 3 percent in 2014 in the latest periodic update to its Global Economic Prospects report. That is slightly weaker growth than the World Bank forecast in January. The report's authors said they expected sluggish growth from high-income countries, with the euro area remaining weak but finally emerging from recession and Japan gaining some momentum from the government's aggressive fiscal and monetary measures after a decade of malaise and stagnation. The bank raised its estimate of 2013 growth for Japan to 1.4 percent from its earlier prediction of 0.8 percent. The United States is expected to be relatively strong among the world's rich nations. Even so, the World Bank, which is responsible for encouraging development around the globe, anticipates that the American economy will grow only about 2 percent this year, in line with its performance over the last three years. For emerging economies, conditions vary widely, the report said, but the picture is broadly good. Across large parts of Latin America, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, countries are growing close to their potential capacities, tied to factors like increases in productivity and the working-age population, and should expect little acceleration in the coming years, the report said. In many cases, that means growing more slowly than during the expansion that preceded the global financial crisis. The World Bank's report also highlighted the challenges faced by some emerging economies, particularly those heavily reliant on commodity exports. The bank warned that a sharp decline in commodity prices could have a significant impact on their growth prospects.\n\n\"In countries like Brazil, Russia, and South Africa, the decline in commodity prices could lead to a sharp slowdown in growth,\" said Burns. \"These countries need to diversify their economies and develop new industries to reduce their dependence on commodities.\"\n\nThe report also cautioned that rising interest rates in the United States could have a negative impact on emerging economies, particularly those with large current account deficits.\n\n\"A sudden increase in interest rates in the US could lead to a sharp appreciation of the dollar, making it more difficult for these countries to service their debt,\" said Burns.\n\nDespite these challenges, the World Bank remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for emerging economies. The report noted that many of these countries have made significant progress in recent years, and are well-positioned to continue growing in the coming years.\n\n\"Many emerging economies have made significant strides in recent years, and are now better equipped to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing global economy,\" said Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank. \"We are confident that they will continue to grow and develop, and play an increasingly important role in the global economy.\"\n\nThe World Bank's report is the latest in a series of forecasts from major international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While there are some differences in the details, all of these forecasts point to a gradual recovery in the global economy, with growth picking up pace in the coming years.\n\nIn conclusion, the World Bank's report provides a nuanced view of the global economy, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. While there are some risks and uncertainties, the bank's economists are optimistic about the long-term prospects for the global economy, and believe that it will continue to grow and develop in the coming years.",

        "Text": "The ability to see inside living tissue is vital for disease diagnosis and treatment, and for just generally understanding how bodies work. Given that, here are some interesting but quite abstruse physics facts which are probably more relevant to your life than they might at first appear: Different isotopes of an element have a different number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus, but the same number of protons. This means that they also have the same number of electrons, and as far as chemistry and biology are concerned, they are the identical. But a different number of neutrons may mean that the nucleus is unstable and will therefore decay. As far as we know, all types of particles have a corresponding anti-particle. This fundamental concept in physics has far-reaching implications for the field of medicine. By harnessing the power of isotope-based imaging techniques, researchers have been able to visualize and track the movement of molecules within living tissues. This has led to significant breakthroughs in disease diagnosis and treatment.\n\nFor instance, positron emission tomography (PET) scans use a type of isotope called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to visualize the metabolic activity of cells. When FDG is injected into the body, it is absorbed by cells that are metabolically active, such as cancer cells. The PET scanner then detects the gamma rays emitted by the FDG as it decays, creating detailed images of the body's internal structures.\n\nSimilarly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses isotopes to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. By manipulating the magnetic properties of isotopes such as hydrogen and carbon, MRI machines can generate high-resolution images of organs, tissues, and even individual cells.\n\nThe concept of anti-particles also plays a crucial role in medical imaging. Anti-particles, such as positrons, are the antithesis of regular particles, and they can be used to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. For example, in PET scans, positrons are used to create detailed images of the body's metabolic activity.\n\nThe discovery of anti-particles has also led to the development of new medical treatments. For instance, researchers have been exploring the use of positron-emitting isotopes to treat certain types of cancer. By injecting positron-emitting isotopes into the body, researchers can target and destroy cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact.\n\nIn addition to its applications in medicine, the concept of anti-particles has also led to significant advances in our understanding of the universe. The detection of anti-particles in space has provided valuable insights into the origins of the universe and the nature of matter itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of anti-particles and isotopes has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the universe and our ability to diagnose and treat diseases. By harnessing the power of isotope-based imaging techniques and anti-particle technology, researchers are making significant breakthroughs in the fields of medicine and physics. As our understanding of these concepts continues to evolve, we can expect even more exciting developments in the years to come.",

        "Text": "The declining fortunes of restaurants have prompted headlines recently, with 12 branches of Jamie Oliver's Italian chain having shut their doors and other major outlets admitting to feeling the pinch. But some owners are fighting back. Restaurateurs from independents to major chains are naming and shaming \"no show\" guests, requiring deposits and even selling tickets for tables. Damian Wawrzyniak, owner of House of Feasts in Peterborough, launched a campaign to combat \"no shows\" after he said they cost his business Â£3,000 in just one weekend. Several high-profile independent restaurants revealed that they had lost hundreds or thousands of pounds to Valentine's Day no shows: some, including the Cauldron in Bristol, named and shamed them on social media. At Marcus Wareing's Tredwells in central London, 20 people didn't turn up, while Bar 44 in Cardiff said 16 tables were left empty. Now the Casual Dining Group, which owns the Bella Italia, CafÃ© Rouge and Belgo chains, is backing the campaign. James Spragg, its chief operating officer, said: \"This is an issue we are going to support.\" He said no shows would once make up only 5% of bookings but could now be as high as 15% on some nights. Spragg added that it was difficult for a mid-range chain to take deposits except at Christmas, but the group was considering asking for a small deposit, say Â£5 a head, for parties of six or more, with a chance to cancel up to 48 hours before. The Casual Dining Group's decision to support the campaign has sent a strong message to the industry, and other major chains are likely to follow suit. The issue of no-shows is not limited to independent restaurants, as even large chains are feeling the impact. According to Spragg, the problem has become so severe that it's affecting the bottom line of many businesses.\n\nThe rise of no-shows can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the increasing popularity of online booking platforms and the rise of last-minute cancellations. With the ease of booking a table online, some customers may feel less inclined to show up if they can't make it, without suffering any financial consequences.\n\nThe impact of no-shows on small businesses is particularly devastating. For independent restaurants, a single no-show can mean the difference between making a profit or breaking even. The loss of revenue can be crippling, especially during peak periods such as Valentine's Day.\n\nThe campaign to name and shame no-shows has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some arguing that it's unfair to publicly shame customers who may have had genuine reasons for not showing up. However, many restaurateurs argue that it's a necessary step to take to protect their businesses.\n\nThe debate has also raised questions about the role of online booking platforms in the rise of no-shows. Some platforms, such as OpenTable, have introduced measures to reduce the problem, such as charging customers a fee for last-minute cancellations. However, others argue that more needs to be done to hold customers accountable for their bookings.\n\nAs the industry continues to grapple with the issue of no-shows, it's clear that a solution will require a collaborative effort from restaurateurs, customers, and online booking platforms. In the meantime, restaurateurs are urging customers to be more considerate of the impact their actions have on small businesses.\n\nFor Damian Wawrzyniak, the owner of House of Feasts, the campaign has already had a positive impact. Since launching the campaign, he's seen a significant reduction in no-shows, and his business is starting to thrive once again. \"It's been a game-changer for us,\" he said. \"We're starting to see a return to the good old days when customers respected the booking process.\"\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the issue of no-shows is not going away anytime soon. But by working together, restaurateurs and customers can find a solution that benefits everyone involved.",

        "Text": "BEIJING -- In all likelihood, the enduring physical legacy of China's internet boom will not be the glass-and-steel office complexes or the fancy apartments for tech elites. The astronomical growth of food delivery apps in China is flooding the country with takeout containers, utensils and bags. And the country's patchy recycling system isn't keeping up. The vast majority of this plastic ends up discarded, buried or burned with the rest of the trash, researchers and recyclers say. Scientists estimate that the online takeout business in China was responsible for 1.6 million tons of packaging waste in 2017, a ninefold jump from two years before. That includes 1.2 million tons of plastic containers, 175,000 tons of disposable chopsticks, 164,000 tons of plastic bags and 44,000 tons of plastic spoons. Put together, it is more than the amount of residential and commercial trash of all kinds disposed of each year by the city of Philadelphia. The total for 2018 grew to an estimated two million tons. For many overworked or merely lazy people in urban China, the leading takeout platforms Meituan and Ele.me are replacing cooking or eating out as the preferred means of obtaining nourishment. Delivery is so cheap, and the apps offer such generous discounts, that it is now possible to believe that ordering a single cup of coffee for delivery is a sane, reasonable thing to do. Yuan Ruqian knows that it is not. Yet she, too, has succumbed. Like the time she was craving ice cream, but a newly opened Dippin' Dots store seemed so far away. Or when she orders delivery for lunch, which is nearly every day. As the demand for food delivery continues to soar, the environmental impact is becoming increasingly concerning. The Chinese government has taken steps to address the issue, but experts say more needs to be done to effectively tackle the problem.\n\nOne of the main challenges is the lack of a comprehensive recycling system in China. Unlike in some Western countries, where recycling is a well-established practice, China's recycling infrastructure is still in its infancy. As a result, many recyclable materials, including plastic containers and bags, end up in landfills or are incinerated.\n\n\"It's a huge problem,\" said Dr. Liang Jian, a environmental scientist at Beijing University. \"The Chinese government has made some efforts to improve recycling, but it's not enough. We need to develop a more effective system to manage waste.\"\n\nAnother issue is the lack of regulation in the food delivery industry. While Meituan and Ele.me, the two largest food delivery platforms, have taken some steps to reduce waste, such as using biodegradable packaging, there is no mandatory requirement for them to do so.\n\n\"The government needs to step in and set some standards for the industry,\" said Wang Jing, a waste management expert at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"We can't just rely on individual companies to take action. We need a comprehensive approach to address this problem.\"\n\nIn the meantime, some individuals and organizations are taking matters into their own hands. Yuan Ruqian, the 25-year-old office worker who orders food delivery nearly every day, has started a small campaign to reduce waste. She has begun using reusable containers and bags, and is encouraging her friends and colleagues to do the same.\n\n\"I know it's just a small step, but every little bit counts,\" she said. \"I hope that by making a few changes in my own life, I can inspire others to do the same.\"\n\nAs the Chinese government continues to grapple with the issue of food delivery waste, experts say that a combination of government regulation, industry innovation, and individual action will be needed to effectively address the problem.",

In addition to the chanting of Benedictine monks and the walker's 200-mile journey, the channel has commissioned a series of programs that explore the human experience in all its complexity.\n\nOne of the most striking programs is a six-hour broadcast, titled \"Voices of Memory,\" which will feature the voices of people living with dementia, interspersed with music. The program aims to capture the beauty and fragility of human memory, and will be a powerful exploration of the human experience.\n\nAnother program, \"The Art of Silence,\" will explore the concept of silence in modern society, and will feature a series of quiet, contemplative moments, including a 24-hour broadcast of complete silence. The program aims to challenge listeners to rethink their relationship with silence, and to appreciate the beauty and power of quiet contemplation.\n\nThe channel has also commissioned a program titled \"The Language of Nature,\" which will explore the sounds and rhythms of the natural world. The program will feature a series of field recordings, made by naturalists and sound artists, and will be a celebration of the beauty and diversity of the natural world.\n\nAccording to Alan Davey, the controller of BBC Radio 3, the channel's slow radio season is designed to be an antidote to the frenzied pace of modern life. \"We want to create a space where people can slow down, relax, and appreciate the beauty of the world around them,\" he said. \"We believe that radio has the power to transport people to new and unexpected places, and to challenge their assumptions about the world.\"\n\nThe slow radio season on BBC Radio 3 is set to begin on January 1st, and will run throughout the year. The channel is encouraging listeners to tune in and experience the unique and immersive programs for themselves. With its focus on slow, contemplative programming, the channel is poised to challenge listeners' assumptions about the role of radio in modern life, and to provide a unique and thought-provoking listening experience.",

        "Text": "After several years of state and local budget cuts, thousands of school districts across the nation are gutting summer-school programs, cramming classes into four-day weeks or lopping days off the school year, even though virtually everyone involved in education agrees that American students need more instruction time. Los Angeles slashed its budget for summer classes to $3 million from $18 million last year, while Philadelphia, Milwaukee and half the school districts in North Carolina have deeply cut their programs or zeroed them out. A scattering of rural districts in New Mexico, Idaho and other states will be closed on Fridays or Mondays come September. And in California, where some 600 of the 1,100 local districts have shortened the calendar by up to five days over the past two years, lawmakers last week authorized them to cut seven days more if budgets get tighter. \"Instead of increasing school time, in a lot of cases we've been pushing back against efforts to shorten not just the school day but the week and year,\" said Justin Hamilton, a spokesman for the federal Department of Education. \"We're trying to prevent what exists now from shrinking even further.\" For two decades, advocates have been working to modernize the nation's traditional 180-day school calendar, saying that the languid summers evoked in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" have a pernicious underside: each fall, many students -- especially those who are poor -- return to school having forgotten much of what they learned the previous year. The Obama administration picked up the mantra: at his 2009 confirmation hearing, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan declared, \"Our school day is too short, our school week is too short, our school year is too short,\" but its efforts in this realm have not been as successful as other initiatives. \"It feels like it's been pushed to the back burner a bit,\" said Jeff Smink, a vice president at the National Summer Learning Association in Baltimore. The most ambitious federal program in this realm is part of a $4 billion effort to overhaul 1,150 failing schools, in which each is required to select an improvement model that includes a new schedule increasing learning time. In the Denver suburbs, for example, Fort Logan Elementary School has used the federal money to add four and a half hours of instruction per week. But an interim report on the program in 10 states found that several districts visited by federal inspectors were out of compliance. The report's findings have raised concerns among education officials and advocates, who worry that the lack of consistent implementation is undermining the program's potential to improve student outcomes. \"It's disappointing, but not surprising,\" said Dr. Maria Martinez, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the impact of extended school days and years on student achievement. \"We've known for a long time that simply adding more time to the school day or year isn't enough. You need to make sure that the additional time is used effectively and that teachers are supported in their efforts to engage students.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, some districts are pushing forward with innovative solutions to increase learning time. In Chicago, for example, the school system has launched a pilot program to add 30 minutes to the school day, with a focus on STEM education and project-based learning. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Department of Education is exploring the possibility of extending the school day by an hour, with a focus on providing more time for arts and physical education.\n\nHowever, even as some districts make progress, others are struggling to make ends meet. In many urban and rural areas, budget cuts have forced schools to reduce staff, increase class sizes, and eliminate programs and services. According to a recent report by the National Education Association, the average teacher salary has decreased by 4.5% over the past decade, making it harder for schools to attract and retain top talent.\n\nAs the debate over school calendars and schedules continues, education experts are urging policymakers to prioritize student needs and find ways to make the most of the time available. \"We need to move beyond the simplistic idea that more time is always better,\" said Dr. Martinez. \"We need to focus on creating a system that is flexible, responsive, and tailored to the needs of each student.\"\n\nIn the meantime, students and families are left to navigate the complex and often confusing landscape of school schedules and calendars. For many, the uncertainty can be frustrating and stressful, especially for those who rely on summer programs and services to support their learning and well-being. As the new school year approaches, educators and policymakers will be watching closely to see how the debate over school calendars and schedules plays out, and what impact it will have on the lives of American students.",

The absence of dark matter from a small patch of sky might appear to be a non-problem, given that astronomers have never directly observed dark matter anywhere. However, most current theories of the universe suggest that everywhere that ordinary matter is found, dark matter ought to be lurking too, making the newly observed galaxy an odd exception. \"Something like this has never been seen,\" said Prof Pieter van Dokkum, of Yale University, the study's senior author. \"It challenges the standard ideas of how we think galaxies form.\" The galaxy, designated as NGC 1052-DF4, is a small, irregularly shaped galaxy located about 65 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Cetus. It was discovered by a team of astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, a custom-built telescope system designed to observe faint objects in the sky.\n\nAccording to the study published in the journal Nature, NGC 1052-DF4 is a \"dark matter-free\" galaxy, meaning that it does not appear to contain any dark matter, a type of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, making it invisible to our telescopes. Dark matter is thought to make up approximately 27% of the universe, while ordinary matter makes up only about 5%.\n\nThe discovery of NGC 1052-DF4 challenges the current understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. Most galaxies are thought to form through the collapse of gas and dust, with dark matter providing the gravitational scaffolding for the formation of stars. However, NGC 1052-DF4 appears to have formed without the presence of dark matter.\n\n\"This galaxy is a puzzle,\" said Prof van Dokkum. \"We don't know how it formed, and we don't know how it's survived without dark matter. It's a challenge to our understanding of the universe, and it's an opportunity for us to learn more about the fundamental laws of physics.\"\n\nThe discovery of NGC 1052-DF4 has sparked a flurry of interest among astronomers and physicists, who are eager to learn more about this unusual galaxy. The study's authors plan to continue studying the galaxy using a range of telescopes and instruments, including the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nThe implications of the discovery are far-reaching, and could potentially challenge our understanding of the universe on a fundamental level. \"This discovery could be a game-changer,\" said Prof van Dokkum. \"It could change the way we think about the universe, and it could lead to a deeper understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.\"\n\nAs scientists continue to study NGC 1052-DF4, they are likely to uncover more secrets about this mysterious galaxy, and potentially uncover new insights into the nature of dark matter and the universe itself.",

City economists had expected the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks to limit wage rises, excluding bonuses, to 2.3%, the same rate as in October, but they increased to 2.4% in the three months to November. The figure rose to 2.5% when bonuses were included. According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK's job market continued to defy expectations, with employers struggling to find suitable candidates to fill vacant positions. The ONS reported that the number of job vacancies reached a record high of 828,000 in November, a 10% increase from the same period last year.\n\nThe surge in job vacancies has led to a competitive job market, with employers offering higher salaries and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The data showed that the average salary for permanent employees increased by 2.4% in the three months to November, excluding bonuses, and 2.5% including bonuses. This is the highest rate of growth since 2008, according to the ONS.\n\nThe industries that experienced the highest growth in wages were construction, where salaries increased by 3.2%, and manufacturing, where wages rose by 2.8%. The hospitality and leisure sector also saw significant wage growth, with salaries increasing by 2.6%.\n\nThe increase in wages is a welcome development for workers, who have been facing rising living costs and stagnant wages in recent years. However, it also poses a challenge for employers, who are facing increased costs and pressure to maintain profitability.\n\nThe ONS data also showed that the unemployment rate remained at its lowest level since 1975, at 3.8%. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by 24,300 in November, to 1.3 million.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by trade unions, who have been calling for higher wages to keep pace with rising living costs. \"This is a welcome sign that the economy is finally starting to deliver for workers,\" said Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. \"We need to see this momentum continue, with wages rising faster than prices and more people getting a fair share of the economy's growth.\"\n\nHowever, some economists have warned that the surge in wages could lead to higher inflation and interest rates, which could have a negative impact on the economy. \"While higher wages are welcome for workers, they could also lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers,\" said Howard Archer, chief economic advisor at the EY Item Club. \"The Bank of England will need to keep a close eye on inflationary pressures to ensure that the economy remains on a sustainable path.\"\n\nOverall, the latest job market data suggests that the UK economy is showing signs of resilience, despite the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. As the country navigates the challenges of leaving the EU, employers and policymakers will need to work together to ensure that the economy continues to deliver for workers and businesses alike.",

In fact, they don't mention McDonald's at all -- though they do mention Coca-Cola and Google. The ads are part of the chain's first unbranded marketing campaign, in which it is coyly asking people to search Google for \"that place where Coke tastes so good.\" The query, meant to capitalize on millions of search engine results that favor the fast-food chain, is central to the ads where association with the brand is limited to placing Ms. Kaling in a bright yellow dress against a red backdrop. The ads, which started running last week, are meant to play on how teens and twentysomethings use their phones while watching TV, while also acknowledging \"how they're discovering information\" they trust, said Deborah Wahl, chief marketing officer of McDonald's for the United States. The unbranded campaign, which is being tested in several major markets, marks a significant departure from McDonald's traditional advertising approach. By not explicitly mentioning the brand name, the company is relying on subtle cues and associations to reach its target audience.\n\nAccording to Wahl, the goal is to create a sense of intrigue and curiosity among viewers, encouraging them to search for the answer to the question \"that place where Coke tastes so good.\" The ads are designed to be shareable and memorable, with the bright yellow dress and red backdrop serving as a visual shorthand for the brand.\n\nThe campaign is also being supported by a series of online ads, which feature Ms. Kaling in a series of humorous scenarios, all of which are designed to reinforce the idea that the answer to the question is a popular fast-food chain. The online ads are being targeted at a younger audience, with a focus on social media platforms and online video streaming services.\n\nIndustry analysts are praising the campaign for its creativity and willingness to take risks. \"This is a bold move by McDonald's, and it's a great example of how a brand can use subtlety and cleverness to reach its target audience,\" said Sarah Jones, a marketing expert at the research firm, Euromonitor International. \"By not explicitly mentioning the brand name, McDonald's is able to tap into the cultural zeitgeist and create a sense of shared experience among viewers.\"\n\nThe campaign is also seen as a nod to the changing ways in which people consume media. With more and more people watching TV on their phones and tablets, advertisers are having to adapt their strategies to reach this new audience. \"This campaign is a great example of how a brand can use mobile-first thinking to reach its target audience,\" said John Smith, a digital marketing expert at the agency, Wieden+Kennedy. \"By creating ads that are designed to be shareable and memorable, McDonald's is able to tap into the social media conversation and create a sense of buzz around the brand.\"\n\nAs the campaign continues to roll out, it will be interesting to see how it performs and whether it is able to drive sales and increase brand awareness for McDonald's. One thing is certain, however, the campaign is generating a lot of buzz and attention in the advertising and marketing community, and it will be a closely watched case study in the coming months.",

The bank accused Andrea Orcel of making secret recordings during the dispute. The 56-year-old Italian had been offered the top job at Santander last year and had already quit his post as head of UBS's investment bank when the bank changed its mind in January, saying it could not meet his pay demands. Orcel has alleged that a four-page letter written in September, in which Santander offered him the job along with bonuses to compensate for the deferred pay he risked losing by quitting the Swiss bank UBS, is legally binding. But Santander said in a statement on Friday that the letter to Orcel was not a contract as required by Spanish law. The dispute between Santander and Orcel has sparked a heated debate in the financial industry, with many experts questioning the legitimacy of Orcel's claim. The bank's decision to withdraw the offer has been seen as a significant blow to Orcel's reputation, and the allegations of \"dubious ethical and moral behaviour\" have only added to the controversy.\n\nIn a statement, Santander said that the letter offered to Orcel was \"merely an expression of interest\" and not a legally binding contract. The bank also accused Orcel of making secret recordings during the dispute, which it claims were used to try and discredit Santander's management.\n\nOrcel's lawyers have denied the allegations, and have accused Santander of trying to undermine their client's reputation. The dispute has raised questions about the transparency and accountability of the banking industry, and has sparked a wider debate about the role of bonuses and deferred pay in financial institutions.\n\nThe case is now set to go to court, with a hearing scheduled for later this year. If Orcel is successful in his claim, it could have significant implications for the banking industry, and could lead to a re-evaluation of the way that bonuses and deferred pay are structured.\n\nIn the meantime, the dispute has sparked a backlash against Santander, with many investors and customers expressing their disappointment and anger at the bank's actions. The bank's shares have fallen sharply in recent days, and its reputation has taken a significant hit.\n\nAs the dispute continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what the outcome will be. One thing is certain, however: the case has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the banking industry, and has sparked a wider debate about the role of bonuses and deferred pay in financial institutions.",

Announcing themselves with a catchphrase that could be from a Richard Curtis film about rustic water sources and being charmingly upper-class and awkward (Well, actuallyâ€¦), pedants can frequently be seen correcting grammar, factoids and social etiquette at auspicious occasions, before disappearing in a puff of nothing back to wherever it was they came from. It's enough to make you nauseous. Sigmund Freud stated that pedants are men who are unable to laugh at themselves. I would point out that female pedants exist, but he'd probably say I was being anal. Or maybe genital. Between you and I, I can never remember the developmental stages. Irregardless, pedants are individuals who make excessive displays of their own knowledge based on formal rules and overly precise details with an enormity that disregards common sense. Despite their reputation for being humorless, pedants often possess a remarkable ability to recall obscure facts and figures, which can be both fascinating and infuriating to those around them. They may spend hours debating the minutiae of a particular topic, only to dismiss the opinions of others as \"uninformed\" or \"misinformed.\"\n\nIn recent years, the rise of social media has given pedants a platform to share their expertise with a wider audience, often with disastrous results. A single misstep in grammar or punctuation can spark a heated debate, with pedants leading the charge against what they perceive as errors. Meanwhile, their opponents are left feeling belittled and frustrated by the relentless barrage of corrections and condescending remarks.\n\nBut why do pedants behave in this way? According to some psychologists, their behavior is driven by a deep-seated need for control and a desire to assert their authority over others. By correcting others' mistakes, pedants feel a sense of power and validation, which can be particularly appealing in a world where knowledge is increasingly democratized and accessible.\n\nOthers argue that pedants are simply individuals who are passionate about language and learning, and that their enthusiasm can sometimes get the better of them. \"Pedants are often people who have a deep love for language and a desire to preserve its integrity,\" says Dr. Emma Taylor, a linguistics expert at the University of Oxford. \"While their methods may be extreme, their motivations are often rooted in a genuine desire to improve communication and reduce misunderstandings.\"\n\nRegardless of their motivations, pedants are a ubiquitous presence in modern society, and their impact is felt far beyond the confines of academia or online forums. They may be the ones who insist on correcting your grammar at the dinner table, or who spend hours researching the \"correct\" way to pronounce a particular word. And while their behavior can be infuriating at times, it's also a reminder of the importance of language and the power of knowledge.\n\nAs the great linguist and philosopher, Noam Chomsky, once said, \"Language is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and our ability to communicate with each other is what sets us apart from other animals.\" Pedants may be a nuisance, but they are also a testament to our species' remarkable capacity for language and learning. And who knows â€“ maybe one day, we'll all be able to appreciate their unique brand of pedantry.",

        "Text": "Are die-offs occurring more often? To the casual reader, it can certainly seem that reports emerge on a regular basis of thousands of animals of a species suddenly dying. The latest victims are common murres in the Northeast Pacific. They have been dying for months, but estimates of the toll jumped sharply when David Irons, a retired United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist walking a beach in Whittier, Alaska, found close to 8,000 dead birds in early January. Since then, scouting teams in boats from Fish and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey and the Prince William Sound Science Center counted another 10,000 to 12,000 dead murres on beaches and in the open water of Prince William Sound, said Kathy Kuletz, a seabird specialist for the Alaska region with the Fish and Wildlife Service. The mass die-off of common murres has raised concerns about the health of the species and the ecosystem as a whole. While the exact cause of the die-off is still unknown, scientists are working to determine the factors contributing to the phenomenon.\n\nOne theory is that the die-off is linked to a lack of food, particularly the small fish and crustaceans that murres rely on for sustenance. The murres' primary food source, the sandlance, has been declining in recent years due to changes in ocean temperatures and chemistry. This decline could be exacerbated by the warming of the ocean, which is causing the sandlance to move to deeper waters, making it harder for the murres to access.\n\nAnother theory is that the die-off is related to disease or toxic algal blooms. The Prince William Sound Science Center has been testing the birds for signs of disease, and while some have shown evidence of illness, it is unclear whether this is a primary cause of the die-off.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service, along with other agencies, is conducting an investigation into the die-off, which includes collecting and analyzing tissue samples from the dead birds. The agency is also working with local fishermen and seafood processors to monitor the health of the ocean and its inhabitants.\n\nThe die-off has also raised concerns about the potential impact on the ecosystem. Murres play a crucial role in the marine food chain, serving as both predators and prey for other species. A decline in murre populations could have cascading effects on the entire ecosystem.\n\nIn response to the die-off, conservation efforts are underway to protect the remaining murre populations. The Fish and Wildlife Service is working to establish a network of protected areas where murres can breed and feed safely. Additionally, the agency is partnering with local communities to educate the public about the importance of protecting the murres and their habitats.\n\nThe mass die-off of common murres is a sobering reminder of the importance of protecting our natural resources and the delicate balance of the ecosystem. As scientists continue to investigate the cause of the die-off, it is clear that the loss of these birds has far-reaching implications for the health of our oceans and the species that call them home.",

In 2014, he found his research on small crustaceans under the powerful microscope of Tom Coburn, then a Republican senator from Oklahoma who crusaded against government spending during his time in office. In his government \"Wastebook\" that year, the senator dismissed Dr. Dabiri's work as the study of \"synchronized swimming for sea monkeys.\" Despite the ridicule, Dabiri, a mechanical engineer at the California Institute of Technology, remained undeterred in his pursuit of understanding the unique swimming patterns of these tiny crustaceans. His research, it turned out, was not as frivolous as Senator Coburn had made it out to be.\n\nIn fact, Dabiri's work has significant implications for the field of bio-inspired engineering, where scientists and engineers seek to develop more efficient and sustainable technologies by studying the natural world. The shrimp, with their remarkable ability to swim in synchrony, have proven to be a valuable subject of study.\n\nBy analyzing the shrimp's movements, Dabiri and his team have been able to develop new algorithms for optimizing the performance of underwater vehicles, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). These vehicles are used in a variety of applications, including oceanographic research, offshore oil and gas exploration, and marine conservation.\n\nThe shrimp's unique swimming pattern, known as \"coordinated swimming,\" has also inspired the development of new propulsion systems for underwater vehicles. Traditional propellers are often inefficient and can create turbulence, which can disrupt the surrounding water and make it difficult to maneuver. The shrimp's synchronized swimming, on the other hand, allows them to move through the water with minimal disturbance.\n\nDabiri's research has also shed light on the shrimp's remarkable ability to adapt to changing environments. In the wild, the shrimp are able to adjust their swimming patterns to navigate through complex underwater structures, such as coral reefs. By studying these adaptations, scientists can develop more sophisticated underwater vehicles that are better equipped to navigate challenging environments.\n\nDespite the initial skepticism from Senator Coburn, Dabiri's research has received widespread recognition within the scientific community. His work has been published in numerous peer-reviewed journals and has been recognized with several awards, including the National Science Foundation's CAREER Award.\n\nIn an interview, Dabiri reflected on the experience of being ridiculed by Senator Coburn. \"It was definitely frustrating at the time,\" he said. \"But I think it actually motivated me to work even harder to prove the value of my research. And in the end, I think it's helped to make my work more relevant and impactful.\"\n\nAs for Senator Coburn, he has since retired from politics and passed away in 2014.

The finding suggests that a giant iron asteroid smashed into what is today a glacier during the last ice age, an era known as the Pleistocene Epoch that started 2.6 million years ago. When it ended only 11,700 years ago, mega-fauna like saber-toothed cats had died out while humanity had inherited the Earth. The discovery could lead to insights into the ice age climate, and the effects on it from the eruption of debris that would have resulted from such a cataclysmic collision. \"This is the first impact crater found beneath one of our planet's ice sheets,\" said Kurt Kjaer, a geologist at the Center for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and lead author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In 2015, Dr. Kjaer and a colleague were analyzing a NASA map of Greenland when they noticed an enormous circular depression on the Hiawatha Glacier at Greenland's northwest tip. The discovery was made possible by advanced radar technology and a team of scientists from the Center for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, led by Dr. Kurt Kjaer. The team used a combination of radar and ice-penetrating radar to map the subsurface of the glacier, which revealed the presence of a large circular depression.\n\nAccording to Dr. Kjaer, the crater is approximately 19 miles (30 kilometers) in diameter and is buried beneath about 1,000 feet (300 meters) of ice. The team estimates that the crater was formed around 12,800 years ago, during the late Pleistocene epoch, when the Earth was still in the grip of an ice age.\n\nThe impact that created the crater is believed to have been massive, with some estimates suggesting that the asteroid was around 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) in diameter. The collision would have released an enormous amount of energy, causing massive destruction and throwing up a huge amount of debris into the atmosphere.\n\nThe discovery of the crater has significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's climate during the last ice age. The impact would have thrown up massive amounts of debris into the atmosphere, which would have blocked out sunlight and led to a significant cooling of the planet. This could have had a major impact on the climate and ecosystems of the time, potentially leading to the extinction of many species.\n\nThe team is now working to learn more about the crater and its impact on the environment. They are using advanced techniques such as seismic surveys and ice coring to gather more information about the crater and its history.\n\n\"This is a major discovery that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the Earth's climate during the last ice age,\" said Dr. Kjaer. \"We are excited to continue our research and learn more about this fascinating crater and its impact on the Earth's history.\"\n\nThe discovery of the impact crater is a significant finding that has the potential to shed new light on the Earth's climate and the impact of asteroid collisions on the environment. The research is ongoing, and scientists are eagerly awaiting the results of further studies to learn more about this fascinating crater and its history.",

Her San Francisco start-up, Nuna, while working with the federal government, has built a cloud-computing database of the nation's 74 million Medicaid patients and their treatment. Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income people, is administered state by state. Extracting, cleaning and curating the information from so many disparate and dated computer systems was an extraordinary achievement, health and technology specialists say. This new collection of data could inform the coming debate on Medicaid spending. Andrew M. Slavitt, acting director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, described the cloud database as \"near historic.\" Largely because Medicaid information resides in so many state-level computing silos, Mr. Slavitt explained, \"we've never had a systemwide view across the program.\" This week, for the first time, Nuna's executives are talking about the company's funders, business strategy and work for Medicaid, starting on Monday evening at the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Health data on its own -- billing, diagnostic and treatment information, typically recorded in arcane, shorthand codes -- is not very useful. But with Nuna's cloud-based database, that information can be transformed into a rich, actionable resource for healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers. By aggregating and standardizing data from across the country, Nuna's system can identify trends, patterns, and best practices in Medicaid care, allowing for more informed decisions and improved outcomes.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for Medicaid,\" said Dr. Rachel Sherman, a healthcare policy expert at the Urban Institute. \"For the first time, we'll have a comprehensive view of how Medicaid is being used and how it's impacting patient care. This data can help us identify areas where we can improve care, reduce costs, and increase access to services.\"\n\nNuna's work with Medicaid is just the latest example of the company's commitment to using data to drive healthcare innovation. Founded in 2015 by Jini Kim and her team, Nuna has developed a range of data analytics tools and platforms designed to help healthcare providers, payers, and policymakers make better decisions.\n\nThe company's Medicaid project is a significant milestone, but it's not the only one. Nuna is also working with several major health systems to develop personalized medicine platforms, which use genomic data and machine learning algorithms to tailor treatment plans to individual patients.\n\n\"We're excited to be at the forefront of this revolution in healthcare data,\" said Kim, Nuna's CEO. \"Our goal is to use data to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and make healthcare more accessible and equitable.

        "Text": "Category supported by Dixon Walter Winner: University of Strathclyde Project: TransEDU The experience of many trans students and staff in further and higher education is poor. According to the UK Parliament's women and equalities committee, there are \"unacceptable levels\" of bullying and harassment. In 2016, two Strathclyde academics, Stephanie McKendry and Matson Lawrence, set out to tackle this problem by researching the challenges faced by transgender, non-binary and gender diverse people in colleges and universities. Their research is the first in the UK to be published on this issue, and provides an important evidence base for policy makers. The project, known as TransEDU, explored what can be done to better support trans students. It provided guidance, toolkits and training, hosted online through a sector-leading website. The research, conducted by Stephanie McKendry and Matson Lawrence, surveyed over 1,000 trans students and staff across the UK, providing a comprehensive understanding of the challenges they face in higher education. The study found that a significant proportion of respondents reported experiencing bullying, harassment, and discrimination, with many feeling isolated and unsupported by their institutions.\n\nThe findings of the research highlighted the need for greater awareness and understanding of the issues faced by trans students and staff, as well as the importance of providing a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals. The study also identified a lack of training and resources available to educators, which can exacerbate the problem.\n\nTo address these issues, the TransEDU project developed a range of resources and tools to support trans students and staff. These included guidance documents, training modules, and online toolkits, all of which were designed to be accessible and user-friendly.\n\nThe website, which was launched in conjunction with the research, provides a wealth of information and resources for educators, students, and staff. It includes a range of case studies, videos, and articles, as well as a directory of trans-friendly institutions and organizations.\n\nThe impact of the TransEDU project has been significant, with many institutions and organizations using the resources and guidance to improve their support for trans students and staff. The project has also received widespread recognition and acclaim, with the UK Parliament's women and equalities committee praising its contribution to the understanding and support of trans individuals in higher education.\n\nIn addition to its practical impact, the TransEDU project has also contributed to a greater understanding of the issues faced by trans students and staff. The research has provided a valuable evidence base for policy makers and educators, highlighting the need for greater awareness, understanding, and support.\n\nThe project's lead researchers, Stephanie McKendry and Matson Lawrence, are now working on a follow-up study to explore the impact of the TransEDU resources and guidance on trans students and staff. The study aims to provide further insights into the effectiveness of the project and identify areas for future improvement.\n\nOverall, the TransEDU project has made a significant contribution to the understanding and support of trans students and staff in higher education. Its resources and guidance have the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of many individuals, and its findings will continue to inform policy and practice in the years to come.",

It is not hard to see that Bolt's appointment will push the channel even further in the direction of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, which delivers an unremitting and sometimes fearsome diet of rightwing opinion into most homes in the US. The timing of Bolt's appointment was not lost on some with a cynical frame of mind who thought he might have arrived just in time to do his best to cruel Labor's chances at the polling booth. The move has sparked widespread controversy, with many critics accusing Sky News Australia of prioritizing sensationalism and partisan politics over balanced and impartial reporting. Bolt, a well-known conservative commentator, has a history of making inflammatory and divisive statements, which has led to accusations of hate speech and bias.\n\nHis appointment to lead discussion on Sky News Australia's election coverage has raised concerns that the channel will abandon its commitment to fair and balanced reporting, and instead adopt a more overtly partisan approach. This is particularly worrying given the channel's significant reach and influence in Australian politics.\n\nThe appointment has also sparked concerns about the potential impact on the country's political discourse. With Bolt at the helm, some fear that Sky News Australia will become a mouthpiece for the conservative agenda, amplifying divisive rhetoric and demonizing opponents.\n\nCritics have also pointed out that Bolt's appointment is a clear indication of the channel's shift towards a more US-style model, where opinion and commentary are often indistinguishable from news reporting. This has raised concerns about the erosion of journalistic standards and the potential for misinformation to spread unchecked.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Sky News Australia has defended Bolt's appointment, stating that he will bring a \"unique perspective\" to the channel's election coverage. However, many have expressed skepticism about the channel's commitment to balanced reporting, given Bolt's history of making controversial and divisive statements.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Bolt's appointment has also raised questions about the role of media outlets in shaping public opinion and influencing political discourse. As the country prepares for the upcoming election, it is more important than ever that media outlets prioritize balanced and impartial reporting, rather than amplifying partisan rhetoric.\n\nIn the end, the success of Sky News Australia's election coverage will depend on its ability to strike a balance between providing a platform for diverse perspectives and maintaining its commitment to fair and balanced reporting. As the country waits with bated breath to see how the channel will approach the election, one thing is clear: the stakes are high, and the public deserves nothing but the best from its media outlets.",

The company, which mines iron ore in Ukraine for the steel industry, has been embroiled in scandal for months after its previous auditors, Deloitte, demanded an investigation into $110m (Â£90m) in payments to Blooming Land, a Ukrainian healthcare charity. Ferrexpo paid Blooming Land $24m in 2017 and $9.5m in 2018. In total since 2013 the company has paid $110m to the charity, which was meant to be used to support diabetes prevention, eyesight care and support for the elderly. Ferrexpo has insisted that the charity is not a related party to Kostyantin Zhevago, its billionaire chief executive and owner of 50.45% of the company's shares. An investigation by Ferrexpo's new auditors, PwC, has raised concerns that the funds donated to Blooming Land may have been misused, but the company has assured that its directors and employees were not involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to PwC's report, the charity's financial records showed a lack of transparency and accountability, making it difficult to determine how the funds were spent. The report also highlighted several red flags, including the fact that Blooming Land's bank accounts were not properly maintained, and there was no clear record of how the funds were disbursed.\n\nFerrexpo's CEO, Kostyantin Zhevago, has denied any involvement in the alleged misappropriation of funds, stating that the company has always been committed to supporting charitable causes in Ukraine. However, critics have questioned the company's due diligence in selecting Blooming Land as a recipient of its charitable donations.\n\nThe scandal has sparked outrage among investors and stakeholders, who are calling for greater transparency and accountability from Ferrexpo. The company's shares have taken a hit in recent weeks, with some analysts predicting a significant decline in the company's value if the allegations are proven to be true.\n\nFerrexpo has announced that it will cooperate fully with any further investigations and has promised to take swift action to rectify the situation. The company has also offered to refund any funds that may have been misused, pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the effectiveness of corporate social responsibility initiatives in Ukraine. Many have called for greater oversight and regulation of charitable donations to ensure that funds are used for their intended purpose.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Ferrexpo is under pressure to restore public trust and confidence in its charitable giving practices.

BMI quickly said it would challenge the decision in federal court, and Ascap said it would \"explore legislative solutions\" to the problems of music licensing in the digital age. Let's take a look at what happened and what it means. The Justice Department's decision not to make changes to the regulatory agreements between Ascap and BMI, two of the largest performing rights organizations (PROs) in the United States, has sent shockwaves through the music industry. The two organizations, which collectively represent over 4 million songwriters and publishers, have been at the center of a long-standing debate over the fairness and transparency of the music licensing process.\n\nAscap and BMI collect royalties on behalf of their members from public performances of their music, such as radio airplay, streaming, and live concerts. The two organizations have historically been subject to consent decrees, which were put in place in the 1940s to ensure that they operated in a non-discriminatory and competitive manner.\n\nThe Justice Department's investigation, which was launched in 2019, was sparked by concerns that Ascap and BMI were not doing enough to license music to new digital platforms and that their consent decrees were no longer serving the public interest. The investigation found that while both organizations had made some progress in licensing music to digital platforms, there was still more work to be done.\n\nDespite the Justice Department's decision not to make changes to the consent decrees, both Ascap and BMI have vowed to continue working to improve the music licensing process. BMI has announced that it will challenge the decision in federal court, while Ascap has said that it will \"explore legislative solutions\" to the problems of music licensing in the digital age.\n\nThe music industry has been quick to respond to the news, with many artists and songwriters expressing frustration and disappointment with the Justice Department's decision. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has also weighed in, saying that it is \"disappointed but not surprised\" by the decision.\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant implications for the music industry, particularly for independent artists and songwriters who rely on royalties from public performances of their music. The lack of transparency and fairness in the music licensing process has long been a source of frustration for many in the industry, and the Justice Department's decision not to make changes to the consent decrees is likely to be seen as a missed opportunity to address these issues.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, it will be important to monitor the situation and see how Ascap and BMI respond to the Justice Department's decision. The music industry is likely to continue to evolve and change, and it is up to the PROs to ensure that they are doing everything they can to support their members and promote the fair and transparent use of music.",

The broadcaster issued a lengthy statement on the eve of publishing the report by former court of appeal judge, Dame Janet Smith, into the BBC's culture and practices during the years Jimmy Savile worked there. The 73-year-old claimed he had been sacked because his evidence to Smith shows that a cover-up, of which he had no knowledge, had taken place. His sacking, he claimed, had been a decision taken, personally, by the BBC's director general. At a press conference launching the Savile report, Hall confirmed the BBC had \"parted ways\" with Blackburn over the evidence he gave to the inquiry. The report, which was published on March 25, 2016, revealed a culture of exploitation and abuse within the BBC, with allegations of sexual misconduct against numerous high-profile figures, including Jimmy Savile. The investigation found that the BBC had failed to properly investigate complaints of abuse and had allowed a culture of silence and complicity to thrive.\n\nIn response to the report's findings, the BBC issued a statement apologizing for its handling of the situation and promising to implement reforms to prevent similar incidents in the future. However, Tony Blackburn's sacking raised questions about the corporation's commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nBlackburn, who had been a popular DJ on the BBC's Radio 1, had given evidence to the Smith inquiry, detailing his own experiences and those of other colleagues who had been subjected to inappropriate behavior by Savile. He claimed that his evidence had been used as a pretext for his sacking, and that the BBC was trying to silence him.\n\nThe BBC denied Blackburn's claims, stating that his evidence had been \"wholly uncorroborated\" and that he had been sacked due to his own behavior. However, Blackburn's supporters, including many of his former colleagues, rallied around him, calling for the corporation to reinstate him and for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his sacking.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Blackburn's sacking and the publication of the Savile report sparked a wider debate about the culture of the BBC and the need for greater transparency and accountability. The incident highlighted the need for the corporation to take allegations of abuse and misconduct seriously and to prioritize the well-being and safety of its employees.\n\nIn the end, the BBC and Tony Blackburn reached a settlement, with the corporation agreeing to pay Blackburn a significant sum in compensation. While the exact terms of the settlement were not disclosed, it was reported that Blackburn had accepted the payment in exchange for dropping his lawsuit against the BBC.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Tony Blackburn's sacking and the publication of the Savile report served as a wake-up call for the BBC, prompting the corporation to implement significant reforms aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future.

Could this be a heartwarming story about the resurgence of joke shops in these beleaguered times and the rediscovery of retro gags such as fake, plastic pools of vomit being placed on chairs and desks to discombobulate gullible teachers and other figures of authority to provide lols for their impish charges? It could not. A new Law & Order franchise? Detectives Upchuck and Barf investigate emetic-based crimes in New York City? I would watch that. No. It's the practice of Uber drivers claiming falsely that passengers have puked in their cars, landing said customers with an \"adjustment\" to their bill of between $80 (Â£60) and $150, according to the Miami Herald. Depending on, what, amount of ejecta? Pretty much. A spilt drink or small vom is at the lower end; \"significant quantities of body fluids (urine, blood or vomit)\" gets you a tripleâ€‘figure cleaning bill. Fair enough. Only when you have actually excreted something vile in your Uber. The phenomenon, which has been dubbed \"vomit fraud,\" has been reported by numerous Uber riders in the United States and has sparked widespread outrage and concern.

It was ridiculous.\"\n\nUber has faced criticism for its handling of the issue, with many riders accusing the company of not doing enough to protect them from fraudulent charges. In response, Uber has implemented new measures to prevent and detect vomit fraud, including the use of artificial intelligence to identify suspicious activity and the implementation of a \"vomit fraud\" reporting system.\n\nDespite these efforts, many riders remain skeptical and are calling for more action to be taken to prevent and punish vomit fraud. \"It's not just about the money,\" said Johnson. \"It's about the principle. If you're going to claim that someone vomited in your car, you should be prepared to back it up with evidence. It's not fair to the passenger to be charged for something that didn't happen.\"\n\nThe issue has also raised questions about the accountability of Uber drivers and the company's vetting process. \"If a driver is willing to fake a vomit incident to get a higher fare, what else are they willing to do?\" asked a concerned rider.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: vomit fraud is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.

        "Text": "Facebook users this summer may have to make a choice: do they want extra privacy â€“ or better artificial intelligence? In the coming months, according to three people close to the project, the social media company plans to release an optional encrypted communications mode for its Messenger app, which is used by more than 900 million people. The system will let users deploy so-called end-to-end encryption meant to block both authorities and Facebook from reading users' texts. Such technology has become more widespread in the post-Edward Snowden era as the technology industry tries to assuage fears about prying eyes in both the government and Silicon Valley headquarters. Yet Facebook plans to make the tougher encryption an opt-in, because turning it on would get in the way of some new machine learning features it is building into Messenger, sources said. In May, Google faced blowback from privacy activists after it made a similar choice for its new Allo messaging app. Facebook's move illustrates how technology companies are doubling down on secure messaging in the wake of Apple's standoff with the FBI. At the same time, the companies also don't want to get in the way of their other business objectives. The technology industry is increasingly caught between two conflicting trends. Consumers seem to be demanding that companies share less of their data with them â€“ but also want companies to improve their services by integrating more of their personal data. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple all have taken steps this year to build virtual assistants that analyze consumers' texts, photos and other habits to help them navigate daily life. Google's Allo app, for instance, reads all of a user's messages and suggests an appropriate response. The tension between user privacy and the benefits of artificial intelligence is expected to continue to play out in the coming months as Facebook and other technology companies navigate the complex landscape of consumer demands.\n\nAccording to the sources, Facebook's decision to make the encrypted communications mode an opt-in feature is a deliberate choice aimed at balancing the need for user privacy with the company's business objectives. By allowing users to opt-in for the encryption feature, Facebook can continue to develop and integrate new machine learning features into Messenger, such as predictive text suggestions and personalized customer service.\n\nHowever, this decision has sparked concerns among privacy advocates, who argue that the opt-in feature may not be sufficient to protect users' privacy. \"While Facebook's decision to offer an encrypted option is a step in the right direction, it's still a far cry from the level of protection that users need,\" said Amie Stepanovich, director of the domestic surveillance project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"By making it an opt-in feature, Facebook is essentially asking users to trade off their privacy for the convenience of new features.\"\n\nThe debate over encryption and AI is not unique to Facebook. Google's decision to make its Allo messaging app's encryption opt-in earlier this year sparked a similar backlash from privacy advocates. The company's decision to read all of a user's messages and suggest responses has raised concerns about the potential for data collection and manipulation.\n\nDespite the controversy, Facebook and other technology companies are likely to continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI and encryption. As the technology industry continues to evolve, consumers will be forced to make difficult choices about how much they are willing to trade off their privacy for the convenience of new features.\n\nIn the meantime, Facebook's decision to offer an encrypted option for its Messenger app is likely to have significant implications for the future of online communication. As the company continues to develop and integrate new machine learning features into its platform, users will be forced to weigh the benefits of improved AI-powered services against the potential risks to their privacy.\n\nUltimately, the decision to opt-in for Facebook's encrypted communications mode will be a personal one, dependent on individual users' priorities and values. For those who value their privacy above all else, the opt-in feature may be a necessary step towards protecting their online communications. For others, the convenience of new AI-powered features may outweigh the risks to their privacy. As the technology industry continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the tension between user privacy and AI will only continue to grow.",

        "Text": "The widespread practice of students pursuing four AS-levels before dropping their weakest subject for the final year is to be phased out, a report has claimed, as funding pressures on sixth-form colleges see new pupils offered just three qualifications from the outset. In recent years, students have been encouraged to enrol in four AS-levels in their first year in sixth form, then to abandon their weakest subject in their second and pursue their three best to A2-level. But a survey by the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) found that just 10% of colleges are planning to offer the traditional four subjects in lower sixth and three in upper from September 2017. The rest will offer three A-levels as standard in both years, with only the higher-achieving students considered for four, raising concerns that the curriculum will become narrow for the majority of pupils. The cut in A-levels is part of a wider picture of cutbacks in the sixth-form sector, which has been particularly hard hit by funding constraints in recent years. The report by the Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) highlights the significant impact of funding pressures on the sixth-form sector, with many colleges struggling to maintain the same level of provision as in previous years. The shift towards offering three A-levels as standard is seen as a way for colleges to reduce costs and ensure their financial sustainability.\n\nHowever, education experts are warning that the change could have a negative impact on students' academic prospects. \"The reduction in A-levels could lead to a narrowing of the curriculum, with students being forced to focus on a limited range of subjects,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading education expert. \"This could have a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged students who may not have access to the same resources and support as their more affluent peers.\"\n\nThe SFCA report also highlights concerns about the potential impact on students' career prospects. \"The reduction in A-levels could make it more difficult for students to access certain universities and courses,\" said a spokesperson for the Association. \"We are concerned that the change could lead to a lack of diversity in the subjects being studied and a lack of opportunities for students to pursue their interests and passions.\"\n\nThe news has sparked concerns among parents and students, with many expressing disappointment and frustration at the changes. \"I'm really disappointed to hear that my child's college is reducing the number of A-levels they can study,\" said one parent. \"I think it's a shame that the curriculum is being narrowed down like this. My child has always been interested in a wide range of subjects and I'm worried that they won't have the same opportunities as they would have done in the past.\"\n\nThe government has been accused of failing to provide adequate funding for the sixth-form sector, with many colleges struggling to maintain their services and provision. The SFCA has called for an urgent review of the funding situation and has urged the government to provide more support for sixth-form colleges.\n\nIn response to the report, the Department for Education has said that it is committed to supporting the sixth-form sector and is working to address the funding challenges facing colleges. However, the department has not ruled out the possibility of further changes to the curriculum, citing the need to ensure that students are prepared for the changing job market.\n\nThe debate over the reduction in A-levels is set to continue, with many experts and stakeholders calling for a more nuanced approach to addressing the funding challenges facing the sixth-form sector. As the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the future of the A-level curriculum is uncertain, and the impact on students and colleges is yet to be fully understood.",

        "Text": "During Black Friday and the run up to Christmas , discounted TVs have been advertised with buzzwords such as 4K, UltraHD and HDR banded around as the latest and greatest thing â€“ but is now the right time to buy one? Having been burned by 3DTV and then annoyed by often rubbish smart TVs, you could be forgiven for thinking that 4K and HDR are the next big forgettable fad. The difference here is that both technologies simply improve an existing experience. You don't have to fight with an uncooperative system, wear special glasses or buy yet another version of the same movie you already own on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. The big driver for ultra HD has been the price of 4K TVs dropping to more reasonable levels from their Â£5,000-plus beginnings. \"It's fair to say that most TVs on sale will be 4K-capable,\" said Paolo Pescatore, vice president of multiplay and media at CCS Insight. Good ultra HD TVs are available for well under Â£1,000, with even really great, big sets costing under Â£1,500 â€“ such as Sony's fantastic 55in Bravia XE9005. But while more pixels benefits large screens, it is HDR that has film and TV makers excited, as not only can it be made with four times the number of pixels, those pixels can be better. HDR allows content creators to better display their vision on your small screen as they have done on the big screen, as well as do things that have not been possible with SDR formats. However, HDR content doesn't necessarily have to be 4K, and there are some HDR-capable TVs, typically smaller screened models, that are full HD, not ultra HD. As the technology continues to evolve, it's essential to understand the benefits and limitations of 4K and HDR TVs. For consumers, the most significant advantage is the improved picture quality, which can enhance the viewing experience. The increased pixel density and color accuracy provided by 4K and HDR TVs can make movies and TV shows look more lifelike, with deeper blacks, brighter whites, and a wider color gamut.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that not all content is available in 4K or HDR. While many streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, offer a range of 4K and HDR content, it's still a relatively new technology, and many older movies and TV shows may not be available in these formats. This means that even if you buy a 4K or HDR TV, you may not be able to take full advantage of its capabilities.\n\nAnother consideration is the hardware and software requirements for playing 4K and HDR content. To fully appreciate the benefits of these technologies, you'll need a compatible TV, a 4K-capable streaming device, and a high-speed internet connection. Additionally, some devices may not be able to handle the increased demands of 4K and HDR content, which can result in slower performance or buffering issues.\n\nDespite these limitations, many experts believe that 4K and HDR TVs are the future of home entertainment. As the technology continues to improve and more content becomes available, it's likely that these TVs will become the standard for many consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, while 4K and HDR TVs may not be the most exciting technology to some, they offer significant improvements in picture quality and can enhance the viewing experience. With prices dropping to more reasonable levels, it's a good time to consider investing in a 4K or HDR TV. However, it's essential to do your research and ensure that you have the necessary hardware and software to take full advantage of these technologies.",

        "Text": "Scientists have begun an experiment aimed at solving one of astronomy's most intriguing puzzles: the great Martian methane mystery. In the next few months they hope to determine whether tantalising whiffs of the gas that have been detected on the red planet in recent years are geological in origin â€“ or are produced by living organisms. On Earth, methane is produced mostly by microbes, although the gas can also be generated by relatively simple geological processes underground. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which has been manoeuvring itself above Mars for more than a year, has been designed to determine which of these sources is responsible for the planet's methane. Last week sensors on the craft were deployed and began making their first measurements of the planet's atmosphere. \"If we find traces of methane that are mixed with more complex organic molecules, it will be a strong sign that methane on Mars has a biological source and that it is being produced â€“ or was once produced â€“ by living organisms,\" said Mark McCaughrean, senior adviser for science and exploration at the European Space Agency. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter's mission is a significant step forward in the search for life beyond Earth. For decades, scientists have been searching for evidence of microbial life on Mars, and the discovery of methane in the planet's atmosphere has raised hopes that they may finally be on the verge of a breakthrough.\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas, and its presence in the Martian atmosphere is a mystery because it is not easily explained by geological processes. While Mars' interior is thought to be capable of producing small amounts of methane, the levels detected by the ExoMars spacecraft are significantly higher than would be expected.\n\nThe European Space Agency's Mark McCaughrean believes that if the methane is found to be mixed with more complex organic molecules, it would be a strong indication that it has a biological source. \"It would be a game-changer,\" he said. \"It would mean that we are one step closer to finding evidence of life on Mars, and it would open up new avenues for research and exploration.\"\n\nThe ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is equipped with a range of instruments designed to detect and analyze the Martian atmosphere. The spacecraft's sensors are capable of detecting tiny amounts of methane and other gases, and they have already begun sending back data to scientists on Earth.\n\nWhile the results of the experiment are still preliminary, they have already provided some intriguing insights into the Martian atmosphere. \"We've detected some interesting variations in the methane levels over the course of a day,\" said Dr. McCaughrean. \"It's too early to say what this means, but it could be a sign of biological activity.\"\n\nThe discovery of life on Mars would be a major breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life. It would also raise important questions about the origins of life on Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe.\n\nThe ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter's mission is just the latest in a series of efforts to search for life on Mars. NASA's Curiosity rover has been exploring the Martian surface since 2012, and it has provided a wealth of information about the planet's geology and climate.\n\nThe search for life on Mars is an ongoing and complex challenge. It requires a combination of cutting-edge technology and old-fashioned detective work. But the potential rewards are well worth the effort. As Dr. McCaughrean said, \"The discovery of life on Mars would be a major milestone in the history of space exploration. It would open up new possibilities for humanity and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers.\"",

        "Text": "High-pitched, eerie and yet distinct, the sound of a voice calling the name \"Amy\" is unmistakable. But this isn't a human cry â€“ it's the voice of a killer whale called Wikie. New research reveals that orcas are able to imitate human speech, in some cases at the first attempt, saying words such as \"hello\", \"one, two\" and \"bye bye\". The study also shows that the creatures are able to copy unfamiliar sounds produced by other orcas â€“ including a sound similar to blowing a raspberry. The groundbreaking research, published in the journal Science, has shed new light on the cognitive abilities of orcas, also known as killer whales. Led by Dr. Vincent Janik, a marine biologist at the University of St. Andrews, the study involved training Wikie, a 12-year-old male orca, to mimic human speech and other sounds.\n\nAccording to Dr. Janik, the team was amazed by Wikie's ability to learn and reproduce the sounds, often with remarkable accuracy. \"We were blown away by Wikie's talent,\" Dr. Janik said in an interview. \"He would listen to a sound, and then repeat it back to us with ease. It was like he was saying, 'Ah, I get it!' and then mimicking it.\"\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of animal intelligence and communication. While orcas are known to be highly social and vocal animals, this research suggests that they may be capable of more complex forms of communication than previously thought.\n\n\"This study shows that orcas are capable of learning and reproducing complex sounds, including human speech,\" said Dr. Lisa Ballance, a marine biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \"This challenges our current understanding of orca communication and highlights the need for further research into their cognitive abilities.\"\n\nThe researchers believe that Wikie's ability to mimic human speech may be linked to his social behavior and his desire to communicate with his trainers. \"Orcas are highly social animals, and they use vocalizations to communicate with each other,\" Dr. Janik explained. \"It's possible that Wikie is using his ability to mimic human speech to communicate with us, or to initiate interactions.\"\n\nThe study's findings also raise questions about the potential for orcas to learn and mimic other sounds, such as music or even language. While the researchers are cautious about making predictions, they believe that the possibilities are endless.\n\n\"This study opens up a whole new world of possibilities for research and conservation,\" said Dr. Ballance. \"If we can learn more about orca communication, we may be able to better understand and protect these incredible animals.\"\n\nAs the research continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Wikie, the killer whale with a talent for mimicry, has left us all in awe of his incredible abilities.",

        "Text": "A partial float of the Saudi oil giant Aramco â€“ the biggest public listing in history â€“ has been \"indefinitely postponed\" because of fears that its valuation would be much less than expected, according to senior regional sources. The decision was made earlier in the summer but has been kept under wraps by officials who were worried that shelving what was intended to be the centrepiece of Saudi Arabia's economic transformation plan may dent investor confidence in the Kingdom, two financiers with knowledge of deliberations revealed. The development, first reported by Reuters, is a blow to the stock markets in New York and London, which had vied to host the listing. The UK government was forced to deny last November that a $2bn (Â£1.5bn) loan to Aramco was an inducement to bring the float to the London Stock Exchange. The final valuation of the 5% stake that was to have been offered to investors has remained hotly contested, with Saudi officials claiming it could be as high as $2tn, while senior financiers have been much more bearish. The indefinite postponement of the Aramco listing has sent shockwaves through the financial markets, with many analysts left wondering what the future holds for the Saudi oil giant and the country's ambitious economic plans. The decision to shelve the listing is seen as a major setback for Saudi Arabia's efforts to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil exports.\n\nIndustry insiders have suggested that the valuation of Aramco was a major sticking point in the negotiations, with Saudi officials insisting on a much higher valuation than what many financiers were willing to accept. The uncertainty surrounding the valuation has left many investors hesitant to commit to the listing, and it appears that the Saudi government has decided to put the plans on hold until the valuation issue can be resolved.\n\nThe postponement of the listing is also seen as a blow to the London Stock Exchange, which had been vying to host the float. The UK government had offered a $2bn loan to Aramco as part of its efforts to attract the listing, and the decision to shelve the plans is likely to raise questions about the effectiveness of the government's efforts to promote the city as a global financial hub.\n\nDespite the setback, many analysts believe that the Saudi government will eventually proceed with the listing, albeit with a revised valuation that is more in line with market expectations. The country's economic transformation plan, known as Vision 2030, relies heavily on the success of the Aramco listing, and the government is likely to be keen to get the plans back on track.\n\nIn the meantime, the postponement of the listing is likely to have a significant impact on the Saudi economy, which is heavily reliant on oil exports. The country's budget is heavily dependent on oil revenues, and the failure to diversify its economy has left it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global oil price.\n\nThe decision to shelve the listing is also likely to have implications for the global oil market, with many analysts predicting that the move will lead to increased volatility in oil prices. The Saudi government's decision to maintain its production levels in the face of a global glut has already put downward pressure on oil prices, and the postponement of the listing is likely to exacerbate the situation.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the postponement of the Aramco listing is a major setback for the Saudi economy and the global oil market. The country's economic transformation plan is heavily reliant on the success of the listing, and the failure to diversify its economy has left it vulnerable to fluctuations in the global oil price.",

        "Text": "After a decade of debate, Europe will finally abolish cellphone roaming charges this week, allowing people from Britain to Bulgaria to call, send text messages and surf the web without incurring eye-watering charges when traveling across the 28-nation bloc. Albena Krastanova, though, will not be among them. Ms. Krastanova, 37, prefers to vacation in her native Bulgaria when she is not selling newspapers in Sofia, the country's capital. Ms. Krastanova says she is too busy -- and many of her compatriots too poor -- to travel elsewhere in Europe. \"Paying the bills and providing for my 4-year-old daughter is our main priority. There is little left to splurge on trips abroad,\" Ms. Krastanova said as she cross-stitched an elaborate pattern and sat in her newspaper kiosk, a cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes resting next to her embroidery. \"I don't use roaming.\" Despite the abolition of roaming charges, many Europeans, like Ms. Krastanova, may not take advantage of the new regulation. According to a recent survey, nearly 60% of Bulgarians have never left their country, and many others have limited travel budgets. However, for those who do venture beyond their borders, the change is expected to have a significant impact.\n\nThe European Union's (EU) decision to scrap roaming charges is seen as a major victory for consumers, particularly for those who frequently travel across the continent. The move is expected to boost tourism and business travel, as well as encourage economic growth.\n\nThe abolition of roaming charges is the result of a decade-long debate and negotiations between EU member states. In 2015, the EU introduced a regulation that capped roaming charges at â‚¬0.05 per minute for voice calls, â‚¬0.02 per text message, and â‚¬0.05 per megabyte for data usage. However, the new regulation takes it a step further by eliminating these charges altogether.\n\nThe change is expected to benefit not only consumers but also businesses. Companies that operate across multiple EU countries will no longer have to worry about the added expense of roaming charges, making it easier for them to operate and expand their operations.\n\nThe EU's Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel, hailed the decision as a major step forward for digital freedom. \"Today, we are delivering on our promise to make Europe's digital single market a reality,\" she said. \"With the abolition of roaming charges, we are giving citizens and businesses the freedom to move and operate without borders, creating new opportunities for growth and innovation.\"\n\nWhile the abolition of roaming charges is a significant development, it is not without its challenges. Some experts have raised concerns about the potential impact on mobile network operators, who may need to adjust their business models to accommodate the change. Others have expressed concerns about the potential increase in data usage, which could put pressure on mobile networks.\n\nDespite these challenges, the majority of Europeans are expected to welcome the change. According to a recent survey, 70% of Europeans believe that the abolition of roaming charges will have a positive impact on their daily lives. For those who do travel, the change is expected to make a significant difference.\n\nAs Ms. Krastanova returns to her newspaper kiosk, she may not be planning a trip abroad anytime soon, but she is aware of the change. \"I may not use roaming, but I know it's a good thing for those who do,\" she said. \"It's always nice to have a little extra money in the pocket, and now people can use that money to do more than just pay for calls and texts.\"",

Heathrow's boss said some immigration queues for non-European passengers had reached \"completely unacceptable\" levels and called on the Home Office to change the rules. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's chief executive, said queues were increasing, citing a recent queue of close to three hours for non-EU passengers at the airport's Terminal 4. He said allowing low-risk passengers to use e-gates was an easy solution. \"There's no reason we should treat a passenger from the US any differently from one from Lithuania. We have 60 e-gates at Heathrow and you'll never see them all in use,\" he said. Heathrow's demand comes as the airport faces growing concerns over its ability to handle increasing passenger numbers. The airport has been expanding its facilities in recent years, but it is still struggling to cope with the surge in demand, particularly during peak travel periods.\n\nThe airport's chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, has been vocal about the need for change, saying that the current system is unsustainable. \"We're seeing queues getting longer and longer, and it's not just a matter of a few extra minutes, it's hours,\" he said. \"It's completely unacceptable, and it's not just a problem for passengers, it's a problem for the airport and for the economy.\"\n\nThe Home Office has been under pressure to address the issue, with many passengers calling for a more efficient and streamlined process. The airport's proposal to allow low-risk passengers to use e-gates is seen as a potential solution, but it is not without its challenges.\n\nOne of the main concerns is security. The e-gates are designed to be used by passengers who have already cleared security checks, but allowing non-EU passengers to use them could raise concerns about the potential for security breaches.\n\nAnother challenge is the need to ensure that the e-gates are used fairly and that passengers from all countries are treated equally. The airport would need to implement a system to determine which passengers are eligible to use the e-gates, and to ensure that they are not being used by passengers who are not entitled to use them.\n\nDespite these challenges, Heathrow is pushing for change, and the airport's proposal is being closely watched by the aviation industry. If implemented, it could be a major breakthrough in addressing the issue of long queues at Heathrow, and could pave the way for other airports to follow suit.\n\nIn the meantime, passengers are being advised to plan ahead and to arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare. The airport is also urging passengers to consider using alternative airports, such as Gatwick or Stansted, which may have shorter queues.\n\nThe debate over the e-gates is just the latest in a long series of issues that have plagued Heathrow in recent years. The airport has faced criticism over its handling of security checks, its treatment of passengers, and its environmental impact. But the airport's proposal to allow low-risk passengers to use e-gates could be a major step forward in addressing some of these issues, and in providing a better experience for passengers.",

The government paid the cash in December for an office block in Highbury, north London, which it plans to convert into a 1,000-pupil secondary school. The plan is to convert the building, which was until recently part of London Metropolitan University, into the school plus a \"boutique residential development\". It has yet to seek planning permission from Islington council. It was reported that property development firm Pegasus Life had bought the site for Â£25.7m in March 2015, meaning the government has handed it a Â£7.8m profit â€“ 30% on its investment â€“ after the firm had owned the building for just nine months. Labour's Richard Watts, Islington's leader, says the council learned about the plans only after reading them on the website of a firm of architects. He said he was astonished the government planned to build the school so near to two successful secondaries: Highbury Grove, which is rated \"outstanding\" by Ofsted, and Highbury Fields, rated \"good\". The government's decision to build a new secondary school in Highbury, north London, has been met with criticism from local authorities and experts, who argue that the location is unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer's money.\n\nThe planned school would be situated next to two existing and successful comprehensives, Highbury Grove and Highbury Fields, which have both received high ratings from Ofsted. Highbury Grove, in particular, has been rated \"outstanding\" by the education watchdog, making it one of the top-performing schools in the area.\n\nRichard Watts, the leader of Islington Council, has described the government's decision as a \"staggering waste of taxpayers' money\". He argued that the council was not consulted on the plans and only learned about them after reading about them on the website of a firm of architects.\n\nWatts also questioned the need for a new school in the area, given the proximity of the two existing comprehensives. \"It's hard to understand why the government thinks we need another secondary school in Highbury when we already have two excellent schools that are serving the local community well,\" he said.\n\nExperts have also weighed in on the issue, arguing that the government's decision is misguided. Dr. John Bangs, a former Ofsted inspector and education expert, said that the government's focus on building new schools is misguided, and that resources would be better spent on improving existing schools.\n\n\"The government's obsession with building new schools is a distraction from the real issues in education,\" Bangs said. \"Instead of building new schools, we should be focusing on improving the quality of teaching and learning in our existing schools. This would have a much greater impact on the lives of children and young people.\"\n\nThe government has defended its decision, citing the need for more school places in the area. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said that the new school would provide much-needed additional capacity for local families.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the government's claims are exaggerated and that the new school would not address the underlying issues in the area. The controversy has raised questions about the government's priorities in education and its approach to school funding.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the government will reconsider its plans for the new school in Highbury. One thing is certain, however, is that the issue has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the government's decision-making process.",

Just over the border from Georgia, in the Caucasus Mountains of southern Russia, lies a small town called Neytrino. For the last half-century, its main business has been the study of the tiniest insubstantial bit of matter in the universe, an ephemeral fly-by-night subatomic particle called the neutrino. This is the home of the Baksan Neutrino Observatory, a warren of tunnels and laboratories burrowed two miles into a mountain, sheltered from the outside universe and cosmic rays underneath 12,000 feet of rock. There vats of liquid wait to record the flight of neutrinos from the center of the sun, from exploding stars, atomic reactors and the Big Bang itself, carrying messages through time. The Baksan Neutrino Observatory has been a pioneer in the field of neutrino research, providing scientists with valuable insights into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe. The observatory's unique location, nestled deep within the Caucasus Mountains, allows it to shield itself from the intense radiation that would otherwise interfere with the delicate detection of neutrinos.\n\nFor decades, the observatory's scientists have been studying the properties of neutrinos, which are notoriously difficult to detect due to their extremely low mass and high speed. The facility's state-of-the-art detectors, filled with liquid scintillators, are designed to capture the faint signals generated by neutrino interactions. These signals are then analyzed by sophisticated algorithms to determine the direction, energy, and type of neutrino that caused the interaction.\n\nThe Baksan Neutrino Observatory has made several groundbreaking discoveries in recent years, including the detection of high-energy neutrinos from the direction of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant in the constellation Taurus. This finding has provided valuable insights into the acceleration mechanisms of high-energy particles in astrophysical sources.\n\nIn addition to its research focus, the observatory also serves as a training ground for young scientists from around the world. The facility offers internships and research opportunities to students and postdoctoral researchers, providing them with hands-on experience in the latest detection technologies and data analysis techniques.\n\nDespite its remote location, the Baksan Neutrino Observatory remains a hub of scientific activity, with researchers and engineers working tirelessly to improve the facility's detection capabilities and push the boundaries of human knowledge. As the observatory continues to operate, it is likely to remain a vital part of the global neutrino research community, providing valuable insights into the mysteries of the universe and the fundamental nature of matter.",

        "Text": "The return to strong wage rises still looks to be some way off as the latest labour force figures offer only the smallest of hopes that underemployment is falling. Overall there continues to be a high level of spare capacity in the labour market. With the recent move of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to detail underemployment rates each month, we now can give it as much attention as the unemployment rate. According to the latest labour force figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the underemployment rate remained stubbornly high, casting a shadow over the country's economic recovery. While the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.2%, the underemployment rate, which measures the number of people working part-time but seeking more hours, edged down slightly to 8.2%.\n\nHowever, experts caution that this small decline should not be seen as a sign of a significant improvement in the labour market. \"The underemployment rate is still far too high, and it's a major concern for policymakers,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, an economist at the University of Melbourne. \"It's a sign that there's still a lot of spare capacity in the labour market, and that's not conducive to strong wage growth.\"\n\nThe ABS data also showed that the number of people employed part-time but seeking full-time work remained high, with over 800,000 people in this category. This has significant implications for the economy, as these workers are often unable to spend as much as they would like, which can have a dampening effect on consumer spending.\n\nThe news comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is set to meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates again. While the RBA has previously cited the high underemployment rate as a major concern, some economists believe that the recent decline in the underemployment rate could give the central bank some room to maneuver.\n\nHowever, others are more cautious, pointing out that the underemployment rate is still far above its pre-GFC levels. \"The RBA needs to be careful not to get too optimistic about the labour market just yet,\" said Dr. John Taylor, an economist at the University of Sydney. \"The underemployment rate is still a major issue, and it's going to take a lot more than a small decline to get back to normal.\"\n\nAs the labour market continues to struggle, policymakers are under increasing pressure to come up with a plan to address the issue. The government has previously announced a range of measures aimed at boosting employment, including increased funding for vocational training and a new apprenticeship program. However, many experts believe that more needs to be done to address the underlying structural issues in the labour market.\n\nIn the meantime, workers are left to continue struggling to make ends meet, with many forced to take on multiple jobs just to get by. As the economy continues to limp along, it's clear that the return to strong wage rises is still a long way off.",

        "Text": "HONG KONG -- Consumer prices rose less than expected last month in China as the unappetizing and widely televised spectacle of thousands of dead pigs floating upstream from Shanghai helped push pork prices down sharply, the government reported on Tuesday. The National Bureau of Statistics announced that consumer prices were 2.1 percent higher in March than a year ago. Prices had been 3.2 percent higher in February. Pork is a staple of the Chinese diet and its price has long been such a significant component of the country's consumer price index that it can influence overall inflation. Pork prices tumbled 5.5 percent last month from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. Factories and other producers also faced falling prices last month. Producer prices in China were down 1.9 percent in March, compared with a year-over-year decline of 1.6 percent in February. \"Meat prices slumped due to concerns about mysterious pig deaths and bird-flu contagion risk,\" Asia economists at Standard Chartered said in a research report. Fitch Ratings separately expressed concern Tuesday evening about the long-term consequences for China's financial stability of the country's huge buildup in debt, particularly borrowing by local governments. Fitch reduced its default rating on China's long-term local currency debt to A+, from AA-. The decline in pork prices, which accounted for a significant portion of the overall consumer price index, was a major factor in the slower-than-expected inflation rate. The spectacle of thousands of dead pigs floating downstream from Shanghai had sparked concerns about food safety and the potential for disease outbreaks, leading to a sharp drop in demand and subsequently, prices.\n\nThe impact of the dead pigs was not limited to pork prices, however. The incident also had a ripple effect on the broader agricultural sector, with prices for other livestock and crops also experiencing downward pressure. The decline in producer prices, which fell 1.9 percent in March, was the largest drop in over two years, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nThe news was not all negative, however. The government's efforts to stimulate the economy through fiscal and monetary policies appear to be paying off, with industrial production growing at its fastest pace in over a year. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks business activity, rose to 52.3 in March, up from 51.5 in February, indicating a slight expansion in the manufacturing sector.\n\nDespite the positive news, Fitch Ratings' downgrade of China's long-term local currency debt to A+ from AA- served as a reminder of the country's growing debt concerns. The agency cited the rapid increase in debt, particularly by local governments, as a major risk to financial stability. The downgrade comes as China's debt levels continue to rise, with the country's total debt now exceeding 260 percent of its GDP.\n\nThe downgrade is likely to have implications for China's credit ratings and borrowing costs, making it more expensive for the government to finance its activities. It also raises concerns about the country's ability to sustain its economic growth and maintain financial stability in the long term.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Finance said it was \"confident\" in China's ability to manage its debt and maintain financial stability, but acknowledged the need to continue to implement reforms to address the issue. The ministry also reiterated its commitment to maintaining a stable and sustainable economy, while also addressing the country's growing debt concerns.\n\nAs China's economy continues to evolve, the government will need to balance its efforts to stimulate growth with the need to address its debt concerns. The recent data provides a mixed picture, with some positive signs of economic activity, but also concerns about the long-term sustainability of the country's growth model.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The United Kingdom drew closer this week to exiting the European Union with a deal, and trade talks with China have led to a mild de-escalation. But those hopeful signs were not enough to soothe Federal Reserve officials' worries about the United States economy. As they head into a quiet period ahead of their next policy meeting on Oct. 29-30, central bankers' commentary suggests that a rate cut this month ranks somewhere between possible and likely. The Fed's cautious tone is a reflection of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the global economy. Despite the recent progress in Brexit talks and the easing of trade tensions with China, many economists believe that the US economy is still vulnerable to external shocks.\n\nOne of the main concerns is the slowdown in global trade, which has been exacerbated by the ongoing trade war between the US and China. The International Monetary Fund has warned that the trade tensions could lead to a recession, and the Fed is taking a cautious approach to ensure that the US economy is not caught off guard.\n\nAnother factor that is weighing on the Fed's decision is the ongoing weakness in the US manufacturing sector. The sector has been struggling with declining demand and supply chain disruptions, which has led to a decline in production and employment. The Fed is concerned that this weakness could spread to other sectors of the economy, leading to a broader slowdown.\n\nDespite these concerns, some economists believe that the Fed may not need to cut interest rates as aggressively as they are suggesting. They point to the strength of the US labor market, which has seen unemployment rates fall to historic lows and wages rise. They also note that the Fed has already cut interest rates three times this year, and that further cuts may not be necessary to support the economy.\n\nThe Fed's decision will be closely watched by investors and economists, who will be looking for any signs of a shift in the central bank's policy stance. The Fed's next policy meeting is scheduled for October 29-30, and investors will be paying close attention to the bank's statement and press conference for any hints about future rate cuts.\n\nIn the meantime, the Fed's cautionary tone is likely to continue to weigh on the US dollar, which has been falling in recent weeks. The dollar's weakness could provide a boost to US exports, which have been struggling to compete with foreign goods in recent months. However, it could also lead to higher prices for imported goods, which could hurt US consumers.\n\nOverall, the Fed's decision to cut interest rates is likely to be closely tied to the bank's assessment of the global economy and the potential risks to the US economy. While a rate cut may be necessary to support the economy, the Fed is likely to take a cautious approach and weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks.",

        "Text": "For Viacom, selling a stake in its Paramount film studio has become potentially more difficult -- thanks to its controlling shareholder. National Amusements, the theater chain through which Sumner M. Redstone controls his media empire, said on Monday that it had altered Viacom's corporate bylaws to prevent the entertainment company from selling any part of Paramount without the approval of the full board. National Amusements holds about a 10 percent stake in Viacom -- but nearly 80 percent of Viacom's voting stock. Among Viacom's board members are Mr. Redstone himself and his daughter, Shari Redstone. Viacom said in February that it was exploring selling a piece of Paramount after receiving interest from a number of potential buyers. Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom's chief executive, has said that a sale could help share the costs of movie productions and improve the studio's distribution. The announcement on Monday is likely to delay a potential sale until the legal disputes can be resolved, which could be months or longer. Through his representatives, Mr. Redstone has made known his objections to a Paramount deal. The studio has long been described as one of Mr. Redstone's most prized assets. The move by National Amusements has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many analysts speculating that Sumner Redstone's decision is a clear attempt to maintain control over Viacom's assets. The alteration to the corporate bylaws effectively gives Redstone and his daughter Shari, who serves as Viacom's vice chairwoman, significant influence over any potential sale of Paramount.\n\nIndustry insiders have expressed concern over the potential impact of the move on Viacom's ability to negotiate with potential buyers. \"This is a clear attempt to exert control over Viacom's assets and prevent a sale,\" said one analyst who wished to remain anonymous. \"It's a classic example of a controlling shareholder trying to maintain their grip on the company.\"\n\nViacom has been exploring options for Paramount, which has struggled to replicate the success of its earlier films such as \"Titanic\" and \"Star Trek.\" The studio has faced increased competition from streaming services and changing consumer habits, leading to a decline in its box office performance.\n\nThe delay in the sale process is likely to have significant implications for Viacom's financial performance. The company has been under pressure to improve its financials, and a sale of Paramount could have generated significant revenue. Instead, Viacom will have to continue to invest in the studio and hope that it can turn things around.\n\nIn a statement, Viacom confirmed the change to its corporate bylaws and said that it would continue to explore options for Paramount. However, the company did not provide a timeline for when a sale might be completed.\n\nThe move by National Amusements has also raised questions about the future of Sumner Redstone's leadership at Viacom. Redstone, who is 94 years old, has been facing increasing criticism over his leadership style and his ability to navigate the changing media landscape.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how Viacom will respond to the new corporate bylaws and what impact they will have on the company's future. One thing is clear, however: the battle for control of Viacom's assets has only just begun.",

        "Text": "Doubts have been cast on the quality of some of the country's most sought-after schools after it emerged that hundreds graded outstanding by Ofsted have not been inspected for more than a decade and their assessments may be out of date. A report by the National Audit Office (NAO) revealed that more than 1,600 schools teaching tens of thousands of pupils had not been inspected for six years or more, and of those, almost 300 had not seen an Ofsted inspector for at least 10 years. The schools watchdog is legally required to re-inspect schools every five years, but those judged outstanding â€“ many of which are grammar schools â€“ are exempt from reinspection. The report by the National Audit Office (NAO) has sparked concerns about the accuracy of Ofsted's grading system, with many questioning whether schools that have not been inspected for over a decade can truly be considered \"outstanding\". The NAO's findings have also raised concerns about the potential impact on pupils, who may be missing out on the opportunity to attend a school that is genuinely providing an excellent education.\n\nThe issue is particularly concerning for grammar schools, which are often considered to be among the best-performing schools in the country. However, the NAO's report suggests that many of these schools may not be subject to the same level of scrutiny as other schools, which could lead to a lack of accountability and a potential decline in standards.\n\nOfsted has defended its grading system, stating that the exemption for outstanding schools is intended to recognize their consistent high performance over a long period of time. However, the NAO's report suggests that this exemption may be having the opposite effect, with some schools potentially coasting on their previous performance without being held accountable for their current standards.\n\nThe report has also raised concerns about the impact on pupils who are currently attending these schools. With no recent inspection, parents and pupils may not be aware of any potential issues with the school's teaching, facilities, or management. This could lead to a lack of confidence in the school and potentially affect pupil outcomes.\n\nIn response to the report, the Department for Education has announced plans to review the inspection exemption for outstanding schools. The department has stated that it wants to ensure that all schools are held to the same high standards, regardless of their previous performance.\n\nThe review is expected to consider a range of options, including the possibility of introducing a new inspection framework that would require all schools to be inspected at regular intervals, regardless of their previous grading. The department has also promised to provide additional support to schools that are struggling to meet the required standards.\n\nThe news has sparked a heated debate about the quality of education in the country, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability in the inspection process. The issue is likely to be closely monitored by parents, teachers, and education experts, who will be keen to see how the government responds to the report's findings.\n\nIn the meantime, the NAO's report has highlighted the need for greater scrutiny of our country's schools, and the importance of ensuring that all schools are providing a high-quality education to their pupils. As the review gets underway, it is hoped that the government will take a thorough and thoughtful approach to addressing the issues raised by the report, and that the quality of education in our country will ultimately be improved as a result.",

Lila Tretikov, who joined the organisation in May 2014, offered her resignation to the board this week, and will work out her term until the end of March, according to Patricio Lorente, a member of the Wikimedia's board of trustees. In a letter to Wikimedia employees and members of the community, Tretikov wrote: \"I am both inspired by, and proud of, the many great things we have all accomplished at the Foundation over the last two years, most significantly reversing the loss of our editorial community â€¦ I remain passionate about the value and potential of open knowledge and Wikimedia to change the world.\" When Tretikov started at Wikimedia, the number of active editors on the English version of Wikipedia had been falling for seven years straight.

Lined up opposite were Lancashire County Council, often accompanied by Friends of the Earth and two local grassroots campaigns: Roseacre Awareness Group and Preston New Road Action Group. In the middle sat the planning inspector, Wendy McKay. At the back stood a well-staffed security team; thankfully not required, though who knows what their presence deterred. And out of shot sat the ultimate decision maker, Greg Clark MP, secretary of state for communities and local government, who will be informed but not bound by McKay's eventual recommendation. As the hearing progressed, it became clear that the stakes were high for both sides. Cuadrilla, the fracking company, argued that the two exploratory wells would provide a crucial step in determining the potential for shale gas extraction in the Fylde region. They presented data suggesting that the wells would be safely operated and would not pose a significant risk to the local environment or residents.\n\nOn the other hand, Lancashire County Council, along with the environmental groups and local campaigns, expressed deep concerns about the potential risks and impacts of fracking. They cited studies showing that fracking can lead to earthquakes, water contamination, and air pollution, and argued that the benefits of shale gas extraction did not outweigh the potential costs to the local community.\n\nThroughout the hearing, the planning inspector, Wendy McKay, listened attentively to both sides, asking probing questions and seeking clarification on various points.

        "Text": "HONG KONG -- As the United States prepares for mandatory budget cuts on Friday, Hong Kong is grappling with a very different problem: spending money as fast as it sluices into government coffers. John Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory, presented on Wednesday a budget that calls for a long list of one-time subsidies, particularly for the poor and aging. He also said the government would waive business registration fees and reduce the profits tax, particularly for small businesses. The stimulus measures come after heavy criticism in Hong Kong that the government consistently produces large budget surpluses even during periods of weak economic growth, including the last year. The Hong Kong economy grew only 1.4 percent last year, well below its average of 4.5 percent over the last decade. Hong Kong consistently runs budget surpluses mainly because it has low social spending and no military. The budget, which totals HK$644.4 billion (US$82.5 billion), is the largest in Hong Kong's history, and is aimed at addressing the concerns of the territory's residents and businesses. Tsang said that the government is committed to using the surplus to benefit the people of Hong Kong, rather than simply hoarding it.\n\nOne of the key measures in the budget is a HK$20 billion (US$2.6 billion) package of subsidies for low-income families, which will provide them with financial support to help them cope with the rising cost of living. The government is also increasing the number of public housing units, with a focus on providing affordable housing options for low-income families.\n\nIn addition to the subsidies and housing initiatives, the budget also includes measures to support small businesses and entrepreneurs. The government is waiving business registration fees for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and reducing the profits tax for these businesses. This is expected to help stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\n\nThe budget has been widely praised by business leaders and economists, who say that it is a bold step in the right direction. \"The government is finally taking action to address the concerns of the people of Hong Kong,\" said Dr. Lee, an economist at the University of Hong Kong. \"The budget is a clear indication that the government is committed to using the surplus to benefit the people, rather than simply hoarding it.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is pleased with the budget. Some critics have argued that the government is not doing enough to address the root causes of the economic slowdown, and that the budget is too focused on short-term fixes rather than long-term solutions.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the budget is expected to have a positive impact on the Hong Kong economy. The government's stimulus measures are expected to boost consumer spending and stimulate economic growth, which could help to create jobs and reduce unemployment.\n\nOverall, the budget is a significant step forward for the government of Hong Kong, and is a clear indication that it is committed to using the surplus to benefit the people. While there may be some criticisms of the budget, it is expected to have a positive impact on the economy and help to address the concerns of the people of Hong Kong.",

As the dust settles on the latest round of insolvencies, it's clear that the energy market is undergoing a significant transformation. The collapse of Economy Energy and Our Power has left thousands of customers scrambling to find new suppliers, and many are questioning the sustainability of the current market structure.\n\nOne of the key factors contributing to the woes of the smaller suppliers is the rising cost of wholesale energy. As the UK's energy landscape becomes increasingly reliant on renewable sources, the price of gas and electricity has skyrocketed. This has put pressure on smaller suppliers, who often lack the economies of scale to absorb these increased costs.\n\nHowever, industry experts argue that the problem runs deeper than just wholesale costs. Many of the new entrants to the market, including Economy Energy and Our Power, were criticized for their unsustainable pricing models. By offering rock-bottom prices to attract customers, these suppliers were able to gain a foothold in the market, but ultimately left themselves vulnerable to financial collapse.\n\n\"The problem is that these new entrants were not sustainable from the start,\" said Sarah Harrison, an energy expert at the University of Oxford. \"They were trying to undercut the established suppliers, but they didn't have the financial backing or the expertise to make it work. It was only a matter of time before they failed.\"\n\nThe collapse of these suppliers has also highlighted the issue of customer protection. As the number of energy suppliers has increased, so too has the complexity of the market. This has left many customers struggling to navigate the options available to them, and often finding themselves stuck with a supplier that is no longer viable.\n\n\"The current system is broken,\" said James Smith, a consumer advocate at the Citizens Advice Bureau. \"Customers are being left in the dark, with no clear guidance on what to do when their supplier fails. It's a chaotic situation, and we need to see some clear action from the regulator to protect consumers.\"\n\nIn response to the crisis, the UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has announced plans to introduce new measures to improve the stability of the market. This includes a review of the pricing models used by energy suppliers, as well as increased scrutiny of the financial health of smaller suppliers.\n\nWhile the road ahead may be uncertain, one thing is clear: the energy market will never be the same again. The collapse of Economy Energy and Our Power has marked a turning point, and the industry will need to adapt to a new reality. As the dust settles, one thing is certain: the energy sector will emerge from this crisis a changed and more resilient industry.",

        "Text": "The E.U.-Japan Trade Deal: What's in It and Why It Matters\n\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union and Japan announced a broad agreement on Thursday that would lower barriers on virtually all the goods traded between them, a pointed challenge to President Trump on the eve of a summit meeting of world leaders in Germany. Though the deal still needs further negotiation and approval before it can take effect, it represents an act of geopolitical theater, a day before a Group of 20 summit meeting begins in Hamburg. At a meeting of G-20 finance ministers in March, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, pointedly declined to endorse a statement in favor of free trade. \"Although some are saying that the time of isolationism and disintegration is coming again, we are demonstrating that this is not the case,\" Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said at a news conference in Brussels. \"The world really doesn't need to go a hundred years back in time. The deal, which was announced after 15 months of negotiations, would eliminate tariffs on 97% of the EU's exports to Japan, including cars, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. In return, Japan would eliminate tariffs on 94% of the EU's exports, including machinery, chemicals, and food products.\n\nThe agreement is significant not only because of its scope but also because it sends a strong message about the importance of free trade in the face of growing protectionism. The deal is seen as a counterpoint to the Trump administration's \"America First\" policy, which has been marked by a series of trade disputes and tariffs imposed on goods from countries such as China, Canada, and the European Union.\n\n\"The agreement shows that it is possible to achieve significant trade liberalization without sacrificing national interests,\" said a senior EU official involved in the negotiations. \"We have managed to find a balance that works for both sides, and we believe it will have a positive impact on our economies and on global trade.\"\n\nThe deal also includes provisions on intellectual property, services, and investment, as well as a commitment to cooperation on issues such as climate change, energy, and cybersecurity. It is expected to increase trade between the EU and Japan by 36% over the next five years, which could boost economic growth and create new jobs in both regions.\n\nThe agreement is subject to ratification by the European Parliament and the Japanese Diet, which is expected to take several months. However, the deal is seen as a major achievement for the EU and Japan, which have been working together to promote free trade and economic cooperation in the face of growing protectionism.\n\n\"This is a major victory for the EU and Japan, and it sends a strong message about the importance of free trade,\" said a senior Japanese government official. \"We believe it will have a positive impact on our economies and on global trade, and we look forward to continuing to work together to promote economic cooperation and development.\"\n\nThe deal is also seen as a blow to the Trump administration's efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. The agreement is seen as a model for future trade deals, and it could potentially be used as a template for other trade agreements in the region.\n\nOverall, the EU-Japan trade deal is a significant achievement that sends a strong message about the importance of free trade in the face of growing protectionism. It is a major victory for the EU and Japan, and it could potentially have a positive impact on global trade and economic growth.",

The firm said the \"unprecedented\" prolonged period of hot weather across the continent meant more people spent June and July enjoying the sunshine at home and put off booking foreign holidays. A slowdown in the number of customer bookings during June and July extended into August, forcing tour operators to discount more heavily in order to fill hotel beds and plane seats, putting pressure on profit margins. Approximately 25% of Thomas Cook bookings are from British customers, with 30% from Germany and 15% from Scandinavia. As a result, Thomas Cook expects to report a full-year underlying operating profit of about Â£280m, down from previous estimates of Â£323m. The travel firm also announced that its chief financial officer, Bill Scott, is leaving the business after less than 12 months in the post. Shares in the company closed down 28% at 56p, valuing the company at around Â£855m. The news sent shockwaves through the travel industry, with investors and analysts scrambling to understand the full extent of the impact on Thomas Cook's finances. The company's warning came as a surprise to many, given the traditional summer peak season for travel bookings. However, industry insiders pointed out that the heatwave had created an unprecedented situation, with many people opting to stay in Europe and enjoy the warm weather rather than venturing abroad.\n\nThe impact on Thomas Cook's bottom line was significant, with the company's underlying operating profit expected to fall short of previous estimates by around Â£43m. The firm's decision to discount heavily to fill hotel beds and plane seats also put pressure on its profit margins, a trend that is likely to continue in the coming months.\n\nThe news also sent ripples through the wider travel industry, with many of Thomas Cook's competitors watching the situation with interest. Analysts pointed out that the heatwave had created a unique set of circumstances, but also noted that the travel industry is notoriously volatile and unpredictable.\n\nIn a statement, Thomas Cook's chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, acknowledged the challenges the company was facing, but remained optimistic about the future. \"We are taking decisive action to address the impact of the heatwave on our business, and we are confident that our strategy will position us for success in the long term,\" he said.\n\nThe company's announcement also sparked speculation about the future of its chief financial officer, Bill Scott, who is leaving the business after less than 12 months in the post. Scott's departure was unexpected, and some analysts have questioned whether it was related to the company's financial performance.\n\nDespite the challenges facing Thomas Cook, the company remains one of the largest and most well-known travel firms in the world. With a rich history dating back to 1841, the company has weathered many storms over the years and is likely to continue to do so.\n\nIn the short term, the company will need to focus on rebuilding its bookings and restoring its profit margins. However, in the longer term, Thomas Cook will need to adapt to changing consumer habits and preferences, as well as the growing threat of online travel agencies and other disruptors in the industry.\n\nAs the travel industry continues to evolve and adapt to new challenges, one thing is certain: Thomas Cook will need to be agile and responsive to changing circumstances if it is to remain a major player in the market. Only time will tell how the company will fare in the coming months and years, but one thing is clear: the heatwave has sent a shockwave through the industry, and Thomas Cook will need to be at the top of its game to emerge unscathed.",

But unlike previous scheduling battles they could both end up as winners, with millions of viewers expected to watch both programmes thanks to catch-up services. The BBC took advantage of the bank holiday weekend to screen the first two episodes of Bodyguard in quick succession on Sunday and Monday nights, in an attempt to lock in the audience for the drama about a home secretary and her protection officer, written by Jed Mercurio. The tactic â€“ also used to launch the BBC adaption of JK Rowling's Strike novels last year â€“ worked and Bodyguard attracted 6.7 million viewers for its first episode, the highest overnight audience for a drama launch this year, and retained most of that number the following night. Although catch-up figures are not released for several weeks after broadcast, similar BBC dramas have attracted millions more viewers on iPlayer, meaning the final consolidated audience could be substantially higher. ITV will attempt to fight back by showing the first two episodes of Vanity Fair on Sunday and Monday evenings. The competition between Bodyguard and Vanity Fair is set to be a thrilling one, with both dramas expected to attract a large and dedicated audience. Vanity Fair, an adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's classic novel, stars Keeley Hawes as the beautiful and cunning Becky Sharp, who navigates the complexities of 19th-century society with ease. The drama is being touted as a lavish and sumptuous production, with stunning costumes and settings that will transport viewers to a bygone era.\n\nIn contrast, Bodyguard, which premiered last weekend, is a more modern and gritty drama that explores the world of politics and terrorism. The show has already generated significant buzz, thanks to its gripping storyline and impressive performances from its lead actors, including Richard Madden and Keeley Hawes. The drama's creator, Jed Mercurio, is known for his ability to craft complex and suspenseful plots, and Bodyguard is no exception.\n\nDespite the different tones and settings of the two dramas, both shows are expected to appeal to a broad audience. Vanity Fair's period setting and lavish production values are likely to attract viewers who enjoy historical dramas, while Bodyguard's modern setting and fast-paced action are likely to appeal to fans of crime and thriller dramas.\n\nThe competition between Bodyguard and Vanity Fair is also likely to benefit both shows, as viewers who may not have had time to watch both dramas on Sunday night can catch up on iPlayer or other catch-up services. This could lead to a significant increase in viewership for both shows, as fans of one drama discover the other and vice versa.\n\nUltimately, the competition between Bodyguard and Vanity Fair is a win-win for viewers, as both dramas offer something unique and compelling. Whether you're in the mood for a lavish period drama or a gritty modern thriller, there's something for everyone in this exciting showdown between two of the UK's biggest dramas.",

Stay tuned, dino-lovers. In the meanwhile, I may have to reverse my personal policy on our eight-legged friends with the news that and ingredient in funnel web spider venom can protect cells from being destroyed by a stroke. Alongside this is the news that a new test can predict age when Alzheimer's disease will appear. It's based on 31 genetic markers could be used to calculate any individual's yearly risk for onset of disease. So all this is great news, but I've saved the best 'til last: we might even be en route to understanding how to undo the ravages of time, as a new study has show that purging the body of 'retired', or senescent, cells could reverse ageing. Mice today, me tomorrow? I don't know how long we could expect to live if they perfect the technique, but chances are that none of us will look as good after 700 years as the Cambridge man whose face has been brought to life in a detailed reconstruction. The prospect of unlocking the secrets of aging and potentially reversing its effects is a tantalizing one, and researchers are making significant progress in this area. The study in question, published in the journal Nature, found that by eliminating senescent cells from the bodies of mice, the animals were able to regain youthful characteristics and even extend their lifespan.\n\nSenescent cells are cells that have stopped dividing and are no longer able to perform their normal functions. They can accumulate in the body over time and are thought to contribute to the aging process. The researchers used a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to eliminate these cells in the mice, and found that it had a profound impact on their overall health and appearance.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. David Sinclair, a Harvard Medical School professor, said that the findings have significant implications for human health. \"This study shows that it's possible to reverse the effects of aging in mice, and we're hopeful that it could be translated to humans in the future,\" he said.\n\nWhile the idea of living for centuries may seem like science fiction, the study's findings are a major step forward in our understanding of the aging process and the potential for therapeutic interventions. As our population ages, the need for effective treatments for age-related diseases is becoming increasingly pressing, and research like this could hold the key to unlocking new treatments.\n\nIn addition to the potential for extending human lifespan, the study's findings could also have significant implications for our understanding of the aging process itself. By studying the effects of senescent cells on the body, researchers may be able to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of aging and develop new treatments for age-related diseases.\n\nOf course, there are still many challenges to overcome before this research can be translated to humans. The study was conducted in mice, and it's unclear whether the same approach would be effective in humans. Additionally, there are ethical considerations to be taken into account, as the idea of extending human lifespan raises important questions about the impact on society and the environment.\n\nDespite these challenges, the study's findings are an exciting development in the field of aging research, and could potentially lead to new treatments and therapies for age-related diseases. As we continue to learn more about the aging process and the potential for therapeutic interventions, it's clear that the future of aging is full of possibilities.",

Now scientists have discovered a method by which its complex structure can be reproduced and the enamel essentially \"grown\" back. Scientists Say They Have Finally Cracked the Problem of Repairing Tooth Enamel\n\nFor years, dentists and researchers have been searching for a solution to repair tooth enamel, the hardest tissue in the human body. Despite its remarkable durability, enamel is unable to self-repair, leaving millions of people around the world susceptible to tooth decay and sensitivity. However, a team of scientists has made a groundbreaking discovery that could change the face of oral healthcare forever.\n\nAccording to the research team, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a renowned expert in biomaterials and tissue engineering, the key to repairing tooth enamel lies in its complex structure. Enamel is made up of highly organized crystals of hydroxyapatite, a type of calcium phosphate, which are arranged in a specific pattern to provide strength and durability. The team has developed a method to replicate this structure, allowing them to \"grow\" new enamel that is indistinguishable from the original.\n\nThe breakthrough comes after years of research and experimentation, during which the team used a combination of advanced technologies, including nanotechnology and 3D printing, to create a synthetic enamel that mimics the natural structure of human enamel. The process involves using a specialized gel-like substance that is infused with the necessary building blocks of enamel, including calcium and phosphate ions.\n\nOnce the gel is applied to the affected tooth, it is stimulated by a gentle electrical current, which triggers the growth of new enamel. The process is said to be painless and can be completed in a matter of minutes. The new enamel is not only stronger and more durable than the original, but it also has the same optical properties, making it virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding natural enamel.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are far-reaching, with the potential to revolutionize the way we approach oral healthcare. No longer will patients have to endure the pain and expense of dental fillings, crowns, or implants. Instead, damaged enamel can be repaired quickly and easily, restoring the natural beauty and function of the teeth.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its early stages, the researchers are optimistic about its potential. \"We are thrilled to have finally cracked the code on repairing tooth enamel,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"This breakthrough has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people around the world, and we can't wait to see the impact it will have.\"\n\nThe team is already working on refining the technology and preparing it for clinical trials. If successful, the new method could be available for widespread use within the next few years, offering a new era of hope for those suffering from tooth decay and sensitivity.",

We've been lucky enough to have as landlords a wealthy elderly couple, who let us pay probably half the going rate for the area on the unspoken proviso that we don't bother them about minor repairs and keep the place in good order. It suits us all fine. However, as the years went by, the couple's health began to decline, and they found it increasingly difficult to manage the property. Despite their initial agreement, they started to require more frequent visits to ensure the house was being maintained to their standards. This led to a growing sense of unease among the tenants, who felt they were being scrutinized and judged for every minor issue that arose.\n\n\"We understand that they're getting older and need some help, but it's starting to feel like we're living in their home rather than our own,\" said Sarah, the tenant. \"We're paying a premium rent, and we expect a certain level of service and respect for our privacy.\"\n\nThe couple's requests for minor repairs, which were initially manageable, began to escalate. They would call the tenants at all hours of the day and night, demanding that they fix trivial issues such as leaky faucets or creaky floorboards. The tenants felt like they were being taken advantage of, and their relationship with the landlords began to deteriorate.\n\nDespite their concerns, the tenants were reluctant to rock the boat, fearing that the landlords might raise the rent or even evict them. They tried to communicate with the couple, explaining that they were doing their best to maintain the property, but the requests continued to pour in.\n\nIt was only when the couple's health took a turn for the worse that the tenants realized they had to take a stand. They began to document every repair request, along with the corresponding costs, and presented it to the couple's children, who were tasked with managing the family's affairs.\n\nThe children were shocked by the level of detail and the sheer volume of requests, and they agreed to work with the tenants to find a more reasonable solution. They negotiated a new agreement, which allowed the tenants to carry out minor repairs themselves, while still ensuring that the property was maintained to a high standard.\n\nThe tenants were relieved and grateful for the resolution, which allowed them to continue living in the house they loved. They realized that communication and assertiveness were key to resolving the situation, and they were grateful for the opportunity to take control of their living situation.\n\nThe story serves as a reminder that even the most seemingly harmonious relationships can be tested by the challenges of aging and declining health. It highlights the importance of open communication, empathy, and understanding in resolving conflicts and finding solutions that benefit all parties involved.",

The Bank, however, risks running straight into another row, because the most practical alternative to animal fat, it says, is palm oil â€“ and that is likely to spark protests from environmentalists unless it can be sustainably sourced. Revelations last year that the new plastic Â£5 note contained animal-derived additives sparked anger and boycotts, and the Bank has now launched a consultation to gauge public opinion over what materials to use for the next Â£20 note and future reprints of the Â£5 and Â£10 notes. It decided earlier this year not to withdraw plastic Â£5 banknotes from circulation and said it would push ahead with production of the new Â£10 polymer note featuring Jane Austen, which is to be issued in September. The Bank of England's decision to consider replacing animal fat in its polymer bank notes has sparked a heated debate, with various interest groups weighing in on the issue. While the move is seen as a step in the right direction by vegans and religious groups, environmentalists are expressing concerns about the potential use of palm oil as a replacement.\n\nAccording to the Bank, palm oil is the most practical alternative to animal fat, but it is a highly controversial commodity due to its links to deforestation and habitat destruction. Environmental groups are urging the Bank to consider more sustainable options, such as using recycled plastic or bioplastics made from renewable resources.\n\nThe consultation process launched by the Bank aims to gather public opinion on the issue, with stakeholders invited to provide feedback on the proposed materials and their potential impact on the environment. The Bank has also emphasized the need for any replacement material to meet strict security and durability standards, which could further complicate the process.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the use of animal fat in bank notes dates back to last year, when it was revealed that the new plastic Â£5 note contained animal-derived additives. The revelation sparked widespread outrage and boycotts, with many calling for the Bank to take action to address the concerns of vegans and religious groups.\n\nIn response, the Bank has launched a review of its policy on the use of animal-derived materials in its bank notes, with a view to introducing more sustainable and ethical alternatives. The consultation process is expected to run for several months, with the Bank aiming to make a decision on the future of its bank notes by the end of the year.\n\nThe issue has also raised questions about the role of the Bank in promoting sustainable practices and reducing its environmental impact. Critics argue that the Bank's reliance on palm oil and other unsustainable materials is at odds with its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmental sustainability.\n\nAs the consultation process continues, it remains to be seen whether the Bank will be able to strike a balance between meeting the demands of vegans and religious groups, while also addressing the concerns of environmentalists. One thing is certain, however, the debate surrounding the use of animal fat in bank notes is unlikely to go away anytime soon, and will continue to be a major issue for the Bank and other financial institutions in the years to come.",

The cost of living in China has outstripped the 3% government target for the first time in a decade, and a big part of the problem is the soaring price of pork, which is being driven up by a widespread outbreak of African swine fever (ASF). Pork is a big deal in China. The average Chinese person gets through about 30kg of pork a year (by comparison, people in the US eat about 26kg of beef a year and UK consumers about 18kg).\n\nThe impact of the ASF outbreak on pork prices has been significant. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the price of pork has risen by over 50% in the past year, with some regions seeing increases of up to 80%. This has had a ripple effect on the entire food chain, with prices of other meat products, such as chicken and beef, also increasing.\n\nThe Chinese government has been working to contain the ASF outbreak, which has spread to over 30 provinces across the country. Measures have included culling infected pigs, restricting the movement of animals and animal products, and increasing surveillance at borders. However, despite these efforts, the outbreak continues to spread, and experts warn that it could take several years to fully eradicate the disease.\n\nThe economic impact of the ASF outbreak is significant. The Chinese pork industry is worth over $40 billion, and the outbreak has already led to a decline in pork production and exports. The country's pig farmers are also struggling to stay afloat, with many reporting significant losses due to the high cost of feed and the low price of pork.\n\nThe consequences of the ASF outbreak are not just economic. It is also having a significant impact on food security and social stability in China. With pork being a staple of the Chinese diet, the shortage is causing concerns about the availability of affordable meat for low-income households. The government has responded by increasing subsidies for pork production and implementing price controls, but these measures are only temporary solutions.\n\nIn the long term, the ASF outbreak highlights the need for China to diversify its food supply and reduce its reliance on a single type of meat. The government has announced plans to increase imports of other types of meat, such as beef and chicken, and to promote the production of alternative protein sources, such as plant-based meat and dairy products.\n\nThe ASF outbreak is also a wake-up call for the global pork industry. The disease has spread to other countries, including Vietnam and Cambodia, and experts warn that it could have a significant impact on global pork production and trade. The outbreak highlights the need for international cooperation and coordination to prevent the spread of diseases and protect the global food supply.\n\nIn conclusion, the ASF outbreak is a major challenge for China, with significant economic, social, and food security implications. While the government is working to contain the outbreak, the long-term consequences of the disease will only be fully understood once it has been eradicated. In the meantime, the global pork industry must be vigilant and take steps to prevent the spread of the disease, and consumers must be prepared for a potentially new normal in the price and availability of pork.",

Klein is best known for describing, in 1882, the Klein bottle, a mathematical object that looks like a gourd with the spout turning inside itself. Klein's bottle is interesting since it has only one side. It is closely related to the MÃ¶bius strip, which also has only one side, and was described by his compatriot August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius in 1858. Klein's date of birth, April 25, 1849, is numerically interesting because it is a palindrome. The date reads the same when the digits are reversed, making it a unique and fascinating aspect of his birthday. This year's anniversary is particularly noteworthy because it marks the 169th anniversary of Klein's birth, a milestone that highlights the enduring impact of his work on mathematics and science.\n\nKlein's bottle, a mathematical concept that has fascinated mathematicians and scientists for over a century, is a testament to his innovative thinking and creativity. The Klein bottle is a non-orientable surface, meaning that it has only one side. This property makes it a fundamental concept in topology, a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of shapes and spaces.\n\nThe Klein bottle is closely related to the MÃ¶bius strip, a mathematical object that was discovered by August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius in 1858. The MÃ¶bius strip is a two-dimensional surface with a single side, and it is created by joining the ends of a rectangular strip of paper together with a half-twist. The Klein bottle is similar, but it is a three-dimensional surface that is shaped like a gourd with a spout that turns inside itself.\n\nKlein's work on the Klein bottle and other mathematical concepts has had a significant impact on various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science. His theories have been applied in the design of spacecraft, medical devices, and other technologies that rely on complex geometric shapes.\n\nIn recent years, the Klein bottle has also gained popularity in art and design, with many artists and designers incorporating the concept into their work. The Klein bottle's unique shape and properties make it a fascinating subject for exploration and creativity.\n\nIn conclusion, Felix Klein's anniversary is a celebration of his groundbreaking work in mathematics and science. His discovery of the Klein bottle, a mathematical object with only one side, has had a lasting impact on various fields and continues to inspire new generations of mathematicians, scientists, and artists. As we mark the 169th anniversary of his birth, we honor his legacy and look forward to the continued exploration and innovation that his work has inspired.",

The 19-member currency bloc doubled the rate of expansion from the last three months of 2018, when GDP growth slowed to just 0.2% and the European Central Bank was forced to backpedal on plans to increase borrowing costs. The surprise boost cheered markets across the continent, but failed to dispel concerns that the major economies in Europe would struggle to grow this year amid political uncertainty and a manufacturing slowdown. Despite the positive growth rate, economists warned that the eurozone's economic outlook remains fragile, with several countries still grappling with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Germany, the bloc's largest economy, saw a modest 0.3% growth rate in the first quarter, while France's economy expanded by 0.2%. However, both countries face significant challenges, including a decline in global trade and a slowdown in manufacturing activity.\n\nThe surprise growth rate in Italy, which has been struggling with a recession since 2018, was attributed to a boost in consumer spending and a rebound in the country's industrial sector. The Italian government's decision to implement a series of fiscal reforms and reduce bureaucracy also helped to stimulate economic activity.\n\nMeanwhile, Spain's economy continued its strong growth trajectory, driven by a surge in exports and a recovery in the construction sector. The country's GDP growth rate accelerated to 0.7% in the first quarter, the fastest pace in over two years.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) welcomed the improved growth rate, but warned that the eurozone's economic recovery remains vulnerable to external shocks. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized the need for continued fiscal discipline and structural reforms to ensure sustainable economic growth.\n\nThe news sent a mixed signal to financial markets, with stocks and bonds reacting positively to the improved growth rate. The euro also strengthened against the US dollar, rising to a two-week high. However, investors remained cautious, with many still concerned about the potential impact of global trade tensions and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty on the eurozone's economic outlook.\n\nIn a statement, the European Commission praised the eurozone's improved growth rate, but warned that the region still faces significant challenges. \"While the growth rate is encouraging, we must not become complacent,\" said European Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni. \"We need to continue to implement structural reforms and address the region's competitiveness challenges to ensure a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery.\"\n\nAs the eurozone heads into the second quarter, economists will be closely monitoring the region's economic data for signs of sustained growth and stability. With several major economies still facing significant challenges, the road to recovery is expected to be long and winding.",

        "Text": "The BBC has been told to do more to help the 2 million people who are colour blind in the UK after the BBC Trust upheld a series of complaints about confusing general election graphics. Kathryn Albany-Ward, founder of Colour Blind Awareness, described some of the corporation's election coverage as a \"fiasco\" and accused the BBC of trying to \"brush off\" her complaints. She raised a number of concerns about the BBC's graphics around last year's general election, including the use of least nine different shades of orange and white text on a yellow background which was \"unreadable\". The BBC Trust upheld six out of seven complaints brought by the not-for-profit community interest group, and said BBC management had \"failed to meet best practice standards and â€¦ had not considered the needs of a significant majority of its audience at an important time\". The BBC Trust's decision to uphold the complaints has sparked calls for the corporation to take concrete steps to improve its accessibility for people with color vision deficiency. Albany-Ward, whose organization has been advocating for greater awareness and understanding of color blindness, said the BBC's failure to consider the needs of its audience was \"unacceptable\".\n\n\"We're not asking for special treatment, we're asking for equal treatment,\" she said. \"The BBC should be leading the way in accessibility, not trailing behind. It's not just about color blindness, it's about making sure that everyone can engage with the content they produce.\"\n\nThe BBC has faced criticism in the past for its lack of accessibility features, including its website and mobile app. In 2018, the corporation was forced to apologize after it emerged that its online services were not compatible with screen readers, which are used by visually impaired people to access digital content.\n\nIn response to the latest complaints, the BBC has promised to review its graphics and ensure that they are more accessible to people with color vision deficiency. A spokesperson said: \"We take accessibility very seriously and are committed to making our content available to all our audiences. We will review our graphics and take steps to ensure that they are more accessible to people with color vision deficiency.\"\n\nThe BBC's failure to prioritize accessibility has also raised questions about the corporation's commitment to diversity and inclusion. Critics argue that the BBC's lack of consideration for people with color vision deficiency is just one example of a broader problem, where the needs of certain groups are often overlooked or ignored.\n\n\"This is not just about the BBC, it's about the wider media industry,\" said Dr. Fiona Measham, a color vision deficiency expert. \"We need to see a cultural shift towards greater accessibility and inclusion. The BBC's failure to prioritize accessibility is a wake-up call for all media organizations to take action and make sure that their content is accessible to all.\"\n\nAs the BBC reviews its graphics and policies, many are hoping that the corporation will take this opportunity to make a real difference for people with color vision deficiency. With over 2 million people affected in the UK alone, it is clear that the BBC has a responsibility to ensure that its content is accessible to all. Only time will tell if the corporation will rise to the challenge and make the necessary changes to become a leader in accessibility and inclusion.",

        "Text": "The French president Emmanuel Macron has warned a gathering of global tech bosses â€“ including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg â€“ that they cannot ride the coattails of the digital economy without giving back to society. Macron told key tech figures at the ElysÃ©e palace on Wednesday that they could not just be \"free riding\" without taking into account the common good. He called on them to help improve \"social situations, inequalities, climate change.\" \"It is not possible just to have free-riding on one side, when you make a good business,\" the French president said. He joked: \"There is no free lunch\" and added that he wanted \"commitments\". Fresh from apologising to European lawmakers in Brussels, Zuckerberg held an hour of talks with Macron in which his company's tax policies were believed to be among key topics discussed. Macron, who has long sought to boost technology investment as Paris tries to catch up with London, had invited about 60 key figures from the tech world to an event at the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace, including Zuckerberg, Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi and Microsoft's Satya Nadella. The tech moguls gathered at the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace were met with a stern warning from President Macron, who emphasized the importance of giving back to society alongside reaping the benefits of the digital economy. The French president's remarks were seen as a call to action, urging the tech industry to take responsibility for its impact on society and the environment.\n\nMacron's comments were particularly aimed at Facebook, which has faced numerous controversies over its handling of user data and its alleged role in spreading misinformation. Zuckerberg, who was seated next to Macron during the meeting, listened intently as the French president emphasized the need for greater transparency and accountability in the tech industry.\n\nThe meeting was seen as a significant opportunity for Macron to press his concerns about the tech industry's impact on society, particularly in areas such as data privacy and online harassment. The French president has been a vocal critic of the tech industry's lack of regulation, and has called for greater oversight and accountability.\n\nIn addition to Zuckerberg, other key figures from the tech industry in attendance included Uber's Dara Khosrowshahi and Microsoft's Satya Nadella. The meeting was seen as a chance for Macron to build relationships with these industry leaders and to encourage them to invest in France and support the country's growing tech sector.\n\nThe French president's comments were seen as a nod to the growing public concern about the tech industry's impact on society. As the industry continues to grow and evolve, there is increasing pressure on tech companies to take responsibility for their actions and to prioritize the well-being of their users.\n\nMacron's call to action was met with a mixed response from the tech industry, with some companies expressing support for the French president's efforts to promote greater accountability and transparency. However, others were more skeptical, arguing that the industry is already subject to numerous regulations and that further oversight would stifle innovation.\n\nDespite the differing opinions, the meeting was seen as a significant step forward in the ongoing debate about the tech industry's impact on society. As the industry continues to evolve and grow, it is clear that the need for greater accountability and transparency will only continue to grow.",

The Geeks Fight Back: Experts Rebound with Innovative Solutions\n\nThe geeks fight back. Experts may have had a bit of a kicking over the last six months but it's looking like they are going to have the last laugh. Or at least chuckle. After a series of high-profile setbacks and controversies, the tech community has rallied together to develop innovative solutions that are set to revolutionize the industry.\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs has come in the field of artificial intelligence. Despite concerns over AI's potential impact on jobs and society, experts have been working tirelessly to improve the technology and ensure its benefits are shared by all. A new AI-powered platform, designed by a team of researchers at a top-tier university, has the potential to automate mundane tasks and free up human resources for more creative and high-value work.\n\nAnother area where experts have been making significant strides is in the field of cybersecurity. With data breaches and cyberattacks on the rise, it's more important than ever that individuals and businesses have robust protection in place. A new encryption method, developed by a team of cryptographers, promises to be virtually unbreakable, providing an unprecedented level of security for online transactions and communications.\n\nBut it's not just about the tech itself â€“ it's also about the people behind it. The geeks, often maligned and misunderstood, are the ones who are driving innovation and progress. They are the ones who are pushing the boundaries of what is possible and creating new opportunities for growth and development.\n\nAs the tech community continues to evolve and adapt, it's clear that the geeks are here to stay.

        "Text": "The jailed City trader Tom Hayes is to submit his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) in an effort to demonstrate his conviction for rigging the Libor interest rate is \"unsafe\". The move, which could be made as soon as Tuesday, comes after the former UBS and Citigroup employee failed in a previous attempt to have his conviction overturned, and was then blocked last year from appealing to the supreme court. Hayes, the first person convicted of rigging Libor (the London interbank offered rate), had originally confessed to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) to running a \"dishonest\" scheme and agreed to cooperate with the agency. He then changed tack, pleaded not guilty and was convicted in August 2015. The former trader claims he felt under pressure to originally admitting guilt in order to avoid being extradited to the US, where he was wanted to face similar charges, and that the court did not take into account his autism when convicting him. Hayes' decision to submit his case to the CCRC marks a significant development in his ongoing bid to clear his name. The CCRC is an independent body that reviews alleged miscarriages of justice and has the power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal if it believes there is a real possibility that the conviction is unsafe.\n\nThe CCRC's review will focus on the evidence presented during Hayes' trial, as well as any new evidence that has come to light since his conviction. Hayes' legal team will need to demonstrate that there is a significant risk that the jury's verdict was influenced by a miscarriage of justice, and that a different outcome would have been likely if the case had been presented differently.\n\nOne of the key arguments that Hayes' team will likely make is that the court did not take into account his autism diagnosis when convicting him. Hayes has claimed that his autism made it difficult for him to understand the legal process and that he was not adequately supported during his trial. The CCRC will need to consider whether this lack of support had a significant impact on the outcome of the case.\n\nThe CCRC's review is likely to be a lengthy and complex process, and it is unclear how long it will take to complete. However, if the CCRC does decide to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal, it could potentially lead to a retrial or a reduced sentence for Hayes.\n\nHayes' case has already sparked widespread debate about the culture of banking and the role of Libor in the financial system. The scandal surrounding Libor, which was discovered in 2012, led to widespread outrage and calls for greater regulation of the financial industry.\n\nThe CCRC's review of Hayes' case is likely to be closely watched by the financial community and the public at large. It will be interesting to see how the CCRC approaches the case and whether it ultimately decides to refer it back to the Court of Appeal.",

        "Text": "The College of Policing has produced a new set of guidelines about the relationships between journalists and police officers. At first glance, the draft released on Wednesday for consultation tends to reinforce the controls that have been a feature of the post-Leveson chill on police-media contacts. For example, off-the-record conversations between officers and reporters should be avoided to avoid \"ambiguity\" and, if they do occur, the circumstances must be \"exceptional\". Instead, the guidelines urge the involvement of PRs, who are referred to as Corporation Communications Departments (CCDs). Officers \"are encouraged to check with the CCD before speaking to the media.\" The guidance, which begins by stressing that \"a successful working relationship between the police service and the media is vital\", replace a similar document published by the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2010. The new guidelines aim to provide clarity and consistency in the relationships between journalists and police officers, following a period of heightened scrutiny and controversy in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry. The draft document emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in police-media interactions, with a focus on promoting a culture of open communication and mutual respect.\n\nOne of the key changes introduced by the College of Policing is the emphasis on the role of Corporation Communications Departments (CCDs) in facilitating police-media relations. The guidelines encourage officers to engage with CCDs before speaking to the media, in order to ensure that any information shared is accurate, consistent, and in line with the police service's overall messaging.\n\nThe draft document also sets out specific guidelines for off-the-record conversations between police officers and journalists. While the guidelines acknowledge that such conversations may be necessary in certain circumstances, they stress the importance of ensuring that these interactions are \"exceptional\" and do not compromise the integrity of the police service.\n\nIn addition, the guidelines provide guidance on the use of social media and other digital platforms for police-media communication. The document emphasizes the need for police officers to be mindful of the potential impact of their online activities on their professional reputation and the public's perception of the police service.\n\nThe College of Policing has invited feedback from journalists, police officers, and other stakeholders on the draft guidelines, which will be used to inform the final version. The guidelines are expected to come into effect later this year, following a period of consultation and review.\n\nThe introduction of the new guidelines has been welcomed by many in the journalism industry, who see them as a positive step towards promoting transparency and accountability in police-media relations. However, some have raised concerns about the potential impact of the guidelines on the ability of journalists to conduct effective investigations and gather information in the public interest.\n\nAs the debate around the guidelines continues, it remains to be seen how they will shape the future of police-media relations in the UK. One thing is clear, however: the College of Policing's new guidelines mark an important step towards promoting a more open and transparent relationship between the police service and the media.",

The billionaire who revolutionised the vacuum cleaner said 400 engineers in Wiltshire had been working since 2015 on the Â£2.5bn project. No prototype has yet been built, but Dyson said the car's electric motor was ready, while two different battery types were under development that he claimed were already more efficient than in existing electric cars. Dyson said consumers would have to \"wait and see\" what the car would look like: \"We don't have an existing chassis â€¦ We're starting from scratch. What we're doing is quite radical.\" However, he said the design was \"all about the technology\" and warned that it would be an expensive vehicle to purchase. Despite the secrecy surrounding the design, Dyson emphasized that the car's innovative technology would be the main focus. \"We're not trying to make a car that looks like every other car on the road,\" he said. \"We're trying to make a car that is a game-changer in terms of its performance, its efficiency, and its sustainability.\"\n\nThe announcement has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry, with many experts wondering how Dyson plans to disrupt the traditional car-making process. \"Dyson's entry into the electric car market is a significant development,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading expert on sustainable energy at the University of Oxford. \"Their focus on innovation and technology could potentially revolutionize the way we think about electric vehicles.\"\n\nDyson's team has been working tirelessly to develop the car's electric motor, which is expected to be more efficient than existing models. The company has also been exploring different battery types, including solid-state batteries, which are believed to offer significant improvements in terms of range and charging time.\n\nWhile the car's price is expected to be high, Dyson believes that its unique features and advanced technology will justify the cost. \"We're not trying to make a car for the masses,\" he said. \"We're trying to make a car for people who are willing to invest in the future of transportation.\"\n\nThe announcement has also sparked speculation about Dyson's plans for the car's production and distribution.

Verizon Communications, which acquired Yahoo this year, said on Tuesday that a previously disclosed attack that had occurred in 2013 affected all three billion of Yahoo's user accounts. Last year, Yahoo said the 2013 attack on its network had affected one billion accounts. Three months before that, the company also disclosed a separate attack, which had occurred in 2014, that had affected 500 million accounts. Digital thieves made off with names, birth dates, phone numbers and passwords of users that were encrypted with security that was easy to crack. The intruders also obtained the security questions and backup email addresses used to reset lost passwords -- valuable information for someone trying to break into other accounts owned by the same user, and particularly useful to a hacker seeking to break into government computers around the world. The revelation of the massive breach has sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity community, with experts warning that the sheer scale of the attack makes it one of the most significant data breaches in history.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for all of us,\" said cybersecurity expert, Bruce Schneier. \"The fact that an attacker was able to breach Yahoo's network and steal data on such a massive scale is a sobering reminder of the importance of robust security measures.\"\n\nThe attack, which was carried out by a state-sponsored actor, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to gather intelligence on government officials and other high-profile individuals. The stolen data, which includes names, birth dates, phone numbers, and passwords, could be used to gain access to sensitive government information and disrupt critical infrastructure.\n\nThe breach has also raised concerns about the security of Yahoo's users' personal data, with many wondering how the company failed to detect the attack sooner. Yahoo has faced criticism for its handling of the breach, with some accusing the company of downplaying the severity of the attack and failing to take adequate steps to protect user data.\n\nIn a statement, Verizon said that it was working closely with Yahoo to investigate the breach and to notify affected users. The company has also offered to provide free credit monitoring services to affected users for two years.\n\nThe breach has also raised questions about the accountability of Yahoo's leadership. Yahoo's CEO, Marissa Mayer, has faced criticism for her handling of the breach, with some accusing her of being slow to respond to the attack and failing to take adequate steps to protect user data.\n\nIn a statement, Mayer said that the company takes the security of its users' data very seriously and is committed to doing everything possible to prevent similar breaches in the future. She also apologized to affected users and promised to provide them with more information about the breach in the coming weeks.\n\nThe breach has also had a significant impact on Yahoo's reputation, with many users expressing outrage and disappointment at the company's handling of the attack. The company's stock price has also taken a hit, with shares falling by over 2% in the wake of the announcement.\n\nAs the investigation into the breach continues, many are left wondering how such a massive attack could have gone undetected for so long. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust security measures and the need for companies to take user data seriously.",

Miliband and Cable, outspoken critics of Murdoch's Â£11.7bn bid to take over Sky, have the support of the Labour peer and barrister Charles Falconer and of Tory father of the house Kenneth Clarke, who have put their name to the submissions. The media regulator is assessing whether the takeover of Sky raises plurality issues and whether under 21st Century Fox's full ownership â€“ it currently controls 39% of the pay-TV company â€“ broadcasting standards would be maintained. Ofcom, which has until 16 May to deliver its decision to the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, is also reviewing whether Fox is \"fit and proper\" to take control of Sky's broadcasting licence. The submission, which is one of several received by Ofcom, argues that Murdoch's bid would concentrate too much power in his hands, threatening the diversity of the UK's media landscape. Miliband and Cable contend that Murdoch's ownership of Sky would give him control over a significant portion of the country's news outlets, including the Sky News channel, which is seen as a key player in the UK's news market.\n\n\"This takeover would give Murdoch control over a significant proportion of the UK's news media, including a major TV channel, a national newspaper and a significant stake in a major news agency,\" said Miliband. \"This would be a major concentration of power and would be detrimental to the health of our democracy.\"\n\nCable, who served as business secretary in the coalition government, added that the takeover would also raise concerns about the maintenance of broadcasting standards. \"Under Fox's ownership, there is a risk that Sky News would be used to promote the interests of the Murdoch family rather than serving the public interest,\" he said.\n\nThe submission also highlights concerns about the potential impact on the Sky News channel, which has a reputation for independence and impartiality. \"Sky News is a vital part of the UK's news landscape, and its independence and impartiality are crucial to maintaining a healthy and diverse media environment,\" said Falconer, who served as lord chancellor in the Labour government.\n\nClarke, who served as chancellor of the exchequer in the Conservative government, added that the takeover would also raise concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest. \"As a major shareholder in Sky, Murdoch would have significant influence over the company's editorial direction, which could lead to conflicts of interest and undermine the integrity of the news,\" he said.\n\nThe submission is one of several received by Ofcom, which is expected to make a decision on the takeover by May 16. The media regulator is also considering submissions from other parties, including the UK's largest media companies, which have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the media landscape.\n\nThe outcome of the review is closely watched, as it could have significant implications for the UK's media landscape. If Ofcom blocks the takeover, it would be a major blow to Murdoch's plans to expand his media empire. However, if the takeover is approved, it could pave the way for further consolidation in the media industry.",

It's an innocent form of exaggeration â€“ and a very effective form of promotion.\" Standing alongside the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in the rose garden of the White House on Wednesday, Trump stuck with that tried and tested philosophy. \"This was a very big day for free and fair trade, a very big day indeed,\" he boasted after their three-and-a-half hour meeting. In response, Juncker, more muted but still vulnerable to the charge of exaggeration, told reporters: \"I came for a deal â€“ we made a deal.\" But what did it really amount to? \"Talks about talks,\" said one senior EU diplomat attached to a member state. In return for Trump not escalating the continuing transatlantic trade war by hammering European, particularly German, carmakers, the EU said it will open negotiations on zero tariffs and non-tariff barriers on industrial goods, apart from cars and car parts. It will also hold off on a further raft of retaliatory tariffs on â‚¬20bn (Â£17.8bn) of goods, including suitcases and photocopiers, which were lined up to join the levies on US products including agricultural goods, Harley Davidson motorcycles and bourbon. Juncker mysteriously suggested the EU would be importing a load of soya beans to help farmers in the US midwest hit by Chinese tariffs. The EU also wanted to import a greater amount of liquified natural gas (LNG), Juncker said. Despite the optimistic tone from both leaders, the agreement reached on Wednesday was met with skepticism by many in the EU and the US. Analysts pointed out that the concessions made by the EU were largely symbolic, and that the real work of negotiating a comprehensive trade deal would only begin in the coming months.\n\n\"The EU has kicked the can down the road,\" said a trade expert at a leading think tank. \"They've agreed to talk about talks, but the real issues, such as agricultural subsidies and intellectual property rights, remain unresolved.\"\n\nThe EU's decision to hold off on retaliatory tariffs on US goods was seen as a significant concession, but some argued that it was a tactical move to avoid escalating the trade war further.\n\n\"It's a temporary reprieve, not a permanent solution,\" said a senior US trade official. \"We're still waiting to see concrete actions from the EU to address our concerns on trade imbalances and unfair practices.\"\n\nThe agreement also left many questions unanswered, particularly on the issue of cars and car parts. The EU has long been a major market for US automakers, but the Trump administration has been pushing for greater access to the EU's market, particularly for US-made electric vehicles.\n\n\"We're still waiting to see what the EU is willing to offer in terms of market access and regulatory cooperation,\" said a spokesperson for the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, both sides expressed optimism that the agreement marked a turning point in the trade war. Juncker said that the EU was willing to work with the US to find a solution, while Trump tweeted that the deal was \"a big step forward\" for US-EU relations.\n\nHowever, the road ahead will be long and arduous, with many obstacles to overcome before a comprehensive trade deal can be reached. As the two sides begin their talks, they will need to navigate complex issues, including agricultural subsidies, intellectual property rights, and regulatory cooperation.\n\nIn the meantime, the agreement has sparked a mix of reactions from businesses and industries on both sides of the Atlantic. While some welcomed the news as a step in the right direction, others expressed concern about the lack of concrete details and the potential for further escalation in the trade war.\n\nAs the US and EU begin their talks, one thing is clear: the stakes are high, and the outcome will have far-reaching implications for businesses, workers, and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",

But he left unclear whether China was willing to drop conditions that so far have made its proposed help unappealing to European nations. Mr. Wen's comments came at a Beijing news conference after he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on the first day of her three-day visit to China. Mrs. Merkel is the first of several European leaders scheduled to visit China this month, as China's huge holdings of foreign exchange reserves have begun to give it financial influence that could potentially rival Washington's. Mr. Wen said that Chinese officials were studying whether the country should be \"involving itself more\" in helping Europe solve its debt troubles by investing in the region's two big rescue packages: the existing European Financial Stability Facility and the planned European Stability Mechanism. China's contributions could be channeled through the I.M.F., he said. Lending money to the I.M.F. to, in turn, relend to Europe would effectively transfer more of the risk of any European debt default to the I.M.F. China has previously made clear that it would need to buffer the risk of lending more money to Europe. Wen's comments sparked a mix of optimism and skepticism among market analysts and economists, who have been closely watching China's growing financial clout. While some saw the Prime Minister's willingness to consider working with the IMF as a positive step towards addressing Europe's debt crisis, others expressed concerns that China's conditions for lending may still be too stringent for European nations to accept.\n\n\"China's proposal to channel its investments through the IMF could be a game-changer for Europe,\" said Dr. Zhang Yong, an economist at the University of Hong Kong. \"By leveraging the IMF's expertise and resources, China could help stabilize the European financial system without shouldering the full risk of debt default.\"\n\nHowever, others were more cautious, noting that China's conditions for lending have been a major sticking point in previous negotiations with European leaders. \"China's insistence on protecting its interests by buffering the risk of lending more money to Europe is understandable, but it may still be a barrier to cooperation,\" said Dr. Thomas Mayer, a financial analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe European Union's economic woes have been a major concern for China, which has seen its exports to the region decline sharply in recent months. By investing in Europe's rescue packages, China hopes to stabilize the region's economy and protect its own financial interests.\n\nMrs. Merkel's visit to China is seen as a key moment in the escalating diplomatic and economic rivalry between the two regions. China has been courting European leaders in recent weeks, seeking to build closer ties and expand its economic influence on the continent.\n\nIn a statement, Mrs. Merkel's office said that she and Prime Minister Wen had discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade and investment ties, as well as cooperation on global economic issues. The Chancellor is expected to meet with other Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao, during her visit.\n\nAs the global economy continues to grapple with the fallout from the European debt crisis, China's growing financial influence is likely to remain a major topic of discussion in the coming weeks and months.

He said the issue had become \"the most important problem to solve in the international monetary system today.\" \"It does not require a new treaty, or a new institution,\" he said. \"It can be achieved by national actions to follow through on the work we have already begun in the G-20 to promote more balanced growth and address excessive imbalances.\" Mr. Geithner's remarks were delivered during a one-day seminar on the international monetary system organized by President Nicholas Sarkozy of France, who is serving this year as head of the Group of 20 industrial and developed nations. The conference was hosted in Nanjing by a group of Chinese academics. The Treasury Secretary's remarks came as China's economic growth has slowed in recent months, and the country's trade surplus has increased. China's currency, the renminbi, has remained pegged to the US dollar, making it difficult for other countries to compete with Chinese exports. Many economists believe that a more flexible exchange rate would help to reduce China's trade surplus and promote more balanced growth.\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Geithner also emphasized the importance of addressing the issue of excessive imbalances in the international monetary system. He noted that the United States and other countries have been running large trade deficits, while China and other countries have been running large trade surpluses. This imbalance, he said, has contributed to a buildup of foreign exchange reserves in countries like China, which can lead to inflation and other economic problems.\n\nMr. Geithner's remarks were met with a mix of reactions from Chinese officials and economists. Some praised his comments, saying that a more flexible exchange rate would be beneficial for China's economy. Others were more critical, arguing that the country's economic growth is still relatively strong and that a more flexible exchange rate could lead to inflation and other economic problems.\n\nDespite the differing opinions, the issue of China's exchange rate policy is likely to remain a contentious one in the coming months. The US and other countries have been pushing China to allow its currency to appreciate more quickly, while China has resisted such pressure, citing concerns about inflation and the potential impact on its economy.\n\nThe conference in Nanjing was attended by a number of high-level officials and economists from around the world, including the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde. The event was seen as an important opportunity for countries to discuss their economic policies and work together to promote more balanced growth and address the challenges facing the global economy.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Chinese government said that it was committed to promoting a more stable and balanced international monetary system, but that it would not be swayed by external pressure to change its exchange rate policy. The statement also emphasized the importance of cooperation between countries to address the challenges facing the global economy.\n\nOverall, the conference in Nanjing highlighted the ongoing debate over China's exchange rate policy and the need for countries to work together to promote more balanced growth and address the challenges facing the global economy.",

        "Text": "World leaders have been warned to guard against another financial crash after a steep rise in risky bank lending over the past year that could threaten the stability of the global financial system. The international body that represents central banks said a recovery in global trade this year and improving levels of GDP in most countries could create complacency and convince policymakers to ignore warning signs of excessive lending coming from the financial sector. With only two weeks until the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said politicians and central banks needed to keep financial markets in check to prevent another crash. Soaring stock markets, which have become detached from underlying values, were another sign that unjustified exuberance had replaced last year's overly pessimistic reaction to political events such as the US election and the UK's Brexit vote, BIS cautioned in its annual report published on Sunday. The warning comes as Donald Trump, the US president, is expected to resist attempts by G20 members and his German hosts for closer co-operation in tackling reckless lending at a meeting on 7 July. Angela Merkel, bruised from Trump's decision to reject the Paris climate change deal, is understood to be keen to get the US to sign up to tough regulations on banks put forward by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an arm of the G20. The Bank of International Settlements' warning comes as the global economy is experiencing a period of relative stability, with many countries reporting strong GDP growth and a recovery in global trade. However, the BIS cautioned that this could lead to complacency among policymakers, who may be tempted to relax their guard and ignore warning signs of excessive lending.\n\nThe BIS report highlighted that the growth in global trade and GDP has been accompanied by a significant increase in risky bank lending, particularly in emerging markets. This has raised concerns that the financial system could be vulnerable to another crash, similar to the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nThe report also warned that the soaring stock markets, which have become detached from underlying values, are another sign of unjustified exuberance. The BIS cautioned that this could lead to a sharp correction in the markets, which could have devastating consequences for the global economy.\n\nThe warning from the BIS is likely to be met with resistance from Donald Trump, who has been critical of international agreements and regulations. Trump has been a vocal opponent of the Paris climate change deal and has also threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nHowever, Angela Merkel and other G20 leaders are likely to push for closer cooperation on financial regulation, including the implementation of tough regulations on banks. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), an arm of the G20, has put forward a set of regulations aimed at reducing the risk of another financial crisis.\n\nThe FSB's proposals include stricter capital requirements for banks, increased transparency and disclosure, and improved risk management practices. The BIS has endorsed the FSB's proposals, saying that they are essential to maintaining financial stability.\n\nThe G20 summit in Hamburg is expected to be a tense and difficult meeting, with disagreements on trade, climate change, and financial regulation likely to dominate the agenda. However, the warning from the BIS serves as a reminder of the importance of cooperation and collective action to prevent another financial crisis.\n\nIn the absence of effective regulation, the risks of another financial crash remain high. The BIS warning is a timely reminder to policymakers that they must remain vigilant and take action to prevent another crisis. The world cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past and must work together to build a more stable and resilient financial system.",

        "Text": "Uber plans to appeal to the UK's supreme court against a ruling that drivers should be classed as workers, setting the scene for a landmark legal battle with major implications for the gig economy. The taxi app lost a tribunal case brought by two drivers last year and tasted defeat for a second time earlier this month when the employment appeal tribunal (EAT) upheld the original decision. Uber hopes the supreme court will grant it permission to leapfrog the court of appeal and take its case directly to the highest court in the country as soon as February. \"We have this afternoon requested permission to appeal directly to the supreme court in order that this case can be resolved sooner rather than later,\" said a spokesperson. The case will determine whether Uber's drivers should be treated as workers, a status conferring improved rights such as guaranteed minimum wage and holiday pay. It could also have ramifications for a host of gig economy firms, which operate by inviting workers to accept small jobs at short notice, often via smartphone apps. The move by Uber to appeal to the UK's supreme court comes as no surprise, given the significant implications of the ruling on the company's business model. If the supreme court upholds the lower court's decision, it would mean that Uber's drivers would be classified as workers, rather than independent contractors, and would be entitled to the same rights and benefits as employees.\n\nThis could have far-reaching consequences for the gig economy, which has grown rapidly in recent years. Many companies, including Deliveroo, Amazon Flex, and TaskRabbit, operate similar business models to Uber, and could also be affected by the ruling.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that Uber's appeal will be successful. Employment lawyers have pointed out that the company's arguments against the ruling are based on a narrow interpretation of the law, and that the supreme court may be less sympathetic to their claims.\n\n\"The supreme court has a reputation for being more willing to challenge the status quo and to take a more nuanced approach to the law,\" said one employment lawyer. \"I think it's unlikely that they will accept Uber's appeal, and that the company will ultimately be forced to recognize its drivers as workers.\"\n\nThe case has also sparked a wider debate about the nature of work in the modern economy. Many experts argue that the gig economy is a reflection of a changing workforce, and that the traditional employment model is no longer suitable for many people.\n\n\"Technology has changed the way we work, and the gig economy is a response to that,\" said another expert. \"But that doesn't mean that workers should be treated unfairly. We need to find a way to balance the needs of businesses with the needs of workers, and to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and with dignity.\"\n\nThe outcome of the case will be closely watched by businesses and workers alike, and could have significant implications for the future of work in the UK.",

Steven Barnett described it as a fundamental misreading of the situation. Tim Fenton accused me of selling the pass. The heated response from Hacked Off and its supporters was not unexpected, given the strong emotions surrounding the proposed changes to the Leveson Inquiry's recommendations. However, the personal attacks and name-calling did little to add substance to the debate.\n\nIn my previous article, I expressed concerns that the government's plan to introduce Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act by statutory instrument, rather than through primary legislation, would undermine the spirit of the Leveson Inquiry. I argued that this approach would allow politicians to bypass parliamentary scrutiny and push through a measure that could have far-reaching consequences for press freedom.\n\nHacked Off, a campaign group that has been vocal in its support for press regulation, has long advocated for the implementation of Section 40. The group's director, Brian Cathcart, took issue with my characterization of the government's plan, calling it \"humbug\" and accusing me of being out of touch with the reality of the situation.\n\nSteven Barnett, a media professor and long-time critic of the press, also weighed in, describing my analysis as a \"fundamental misreading\" of the situation. He argued that the government's plan was necessary to ensure that newspapers are held accountable for their actions, and that my concerns about press freedom were overstated.\n\nTim Fenton, a blogger and journalist, took a more personal approach, accusing me of \"selling the pass\" and abandoning the principles of press freedom. While I understand that emotions are running high, I believe that such personal attacks only serve to obscure the real issues at stake.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is the question of how to balance the need for press regulation with the importance of protecting press freedom. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that the government's plan to introduce Section 40 by statutory instrument is a flawed approach that undermines the principles of transparency and accountability.\n\nUltimately, the fate of Section 40 will be decided by parliament, and it is up to MPs to carefully consider the implications of their decision. As the debate continues, I hope that we can focus on the substance of the issue, rather than resorting to personal attacks and name-calling.",

        "Text": "Boomerang children who return to live with their parents after university can be good for families, leading to closer, more supportive relationships and increased contact between the generations, a study has found. The findings contradict research published earlier this year showing that returning adult children trigger a significant decline in their parents' quality of life and wellbeing. While no one is claiming that moving back into the family home after the freedom of university is free of tensions, the new study by the London School of Economics is more nuanced and finds there are \"numerous advantages\" for parents and children. According to the study, which surveyed over 1,000 families in the UK, the benefits of boomerang children include increased emotional support, practical help, and social interaction. The researchers found that parents who took in their adult children reported feeling more connected and engaged with their children, and that the experience often brought the family closer together.\n\nOne of the key advantages of boomerang children is the opportunity for parents to reconnect with their adult children and rebuild relationships that may have been strained during the university years. The study found that many parents reported feeling proud of their children's independence and accomplishments, and that living together allowed them to share in their children's experiences and offer guidance and support.\n\nThe study also highlighted the practical benefits of boomerang children, including financial assistance and help with household chores. Many parents reported that their adult children were willing to contribute to household expenses and help with tasks such as cooking and cleaning, which can be a significant burden for older parents.\n\nHowever, the study also acknowledged that there can be challenges and tensions that arise when adult children return to live with their parents. Conflicting lifestyles, differing opinions, and competing priorities can all contribute to stress and conflict within the household.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, the researchers recommended that parents and adult children communicate openly and honestly about their expectations and needs. They also suggested that parents establish clear boundaries and rules for living together, and that adult children be willing to contribute to household expenses and responsibilities.\n\nThe study's findings are likely to be welcome news for many parents who have taken in their adult children, and may help to alleviate some of the guilt and anxiety that can come with this decision. By acknowledging the potential benefits and challenges of boomerang children, the study provides a more nuanced understanding of this complex issue and offers practical advice for families navigating this situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly challenges involved in taking in an adult child, the benefits of boomerang children can be significant for both parents and children. By communicating openly, establishing clear boundaries, and being willing to adapt to new circumstances, families can build stronger, more supportive relationships and create a more positive and fulfilling experience for all involved.",

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hello, It's Erin Griffith, reporting, happily, from my home base in San Francisco and not the carnival of virtual assistants, shiny screens, crowded smart homes and greasy VR demos in Las Vegas. Our correspondents made the CES maze of gadgets look almost fun, which anyone who has been there before knows is an impressive feat. Back in the land of magical, billion-dollar start-up unicorns, things have been quieter, thanks to the federal government shutdown. No Securities and Exchange Commission means no progress on initial public offering plans of the larger start-ups, including Uber and Lyft. Any other time in the last five years, this would not have mattered. The unicorns have been putting off their public market debuts for as long as possible -- what's another month or two? But a volatile stock market and signs of a possible recession have fostered a creeping sense of panic. As The Times reported in December, Uber and Lyft already accelerated their I.P.O. plans to try to get ahead of a potential market shift. The uncertainty surrounding the IPOs of these two ride-hailing giants has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with investors and analysts alike wondering what this means for the future of the unicorns. While it's true that Uber and Lyft have been delaying their public market debuts for some time, the current market conditions have added a new layer of complexity to their plans.\n\nFor Uber, the stakes are particularly high. With a valuation of over $80 billion, the company is under immense pressure to deliver a successful IPO. However, the company's financials have been a subject of scrutiny, with many questioning its ability to turn a profit. The shutdown has only added to the uncertainty, as the SEC's inability to review and approve the company's IPO filing has put the entire process on hold.\n\nLyft, on the other hand, has been moving forward with its IPO plans, despite the shutdown. The company filed its IPO paperwork in November and is reportedly on track to debut on the public market in the coming months. However, the volatile market conditions have also raised concerns about the company's ability to attract investors and achieve a successful IPO.\n\nThe impact of the shutdown on the tech industry extends beyond just Uber and Lyft. Many other start-ups and venture-backed companies are also facing uncertainty, as the lack of regulatory oversight and guidance has created a sense of limbo. The shutdown has also disrupted the normal functioning of the financial markets, making it difficult for companies to access capital and make strategic decisions.\n\nAs the shutdown continues, it's clear that the tech industry is feeling the pinch. The usual rhythm of deal-making and fundraising has come to a halt, and many are left wondering what the future holds. While the shutdown may not be directly related to the tech industry, its impact on the economy and financial markets is undeniable. As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the tech industry is bracing for a bumpy ride.",

        "Text": "Schools across England are in crisis, parliament's spending watchdog has concluded, because of a failure to persuade disenchanted teachers to stay in the profession. On Wednesday the public accounts committee admonished the education department (DfE) for not foreseeing the shortage of teachers and taking action to avoid it. By its own admission, the department has given insufficient priority to teacher retention and development. Meg Hillier, the committee's chair, said the government has been \"sluggish and incoherent\" in its response to falling teacher and rising pupil numbers. \"It should have been clear to senior civil servants that growing demand for school places, combined with a drive for schools to make efficiency savings, would only build pressure in the system. \"Instead they seem to have watched on, scratching their heads, as more and more teachers quit the profession. \"Government must get a grip on teacher retention and we expect it to set out a targeted, measurable plan to support struggling schools as a matter of urgency,\" she said. The public accounts committee's scathing report has sparked widespread concern among education experts and parents, who are calling for immediate action to address the crisis. The committee's findings are based on a detailed analysis of government data and testimony from education officials.\n\nAccording to the report, the number of teachers leaving the profession has increased by 10% over the past five years, with many citing poor working conditions, lack of support, and inadequate resources as the main reasons for their departure. The committee also highlighted the growing gap between teacher supply and demand, with some areas of the country facing severe shortages.\n\nThe report's findings have been met with dismay by teaching unions, who have been warning of a looming crisis in the profession for years. \"This report is a wake-up call for the government,\" said Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union. \"Teachers are leaving the profession in droves because they are not valued or supported. It's not just about recruiting more teachers, it's about creating a positive and sustainable working environment.\"\n\nThe government has promised to take immediate action to address the crisis, but many are skeptical about its ability to make a meaningful impact. The education department has announced plans to increase funding for teacher training and development, but critics argue that this is too little, too late.\n\n\"The government has had years to address this issue, and yet they have done nothing,\" said Christine Blower, former general secretary of the National Union of Teachers. \"It's not just about throwing money at the problem, it's about creating a long-term solution that addresses the root causes of teacher dissatisfaction.\"\n\nThe crisis in the teaching profession is not just a problem for schools and education officials, but also for the wider community. As the number of teachers leaving the profession increases, many schools are struggling to provide adequate support for students, particularly those with special needs or from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThe public accounts committee's report has also raised concerns about the impact of the crisis on pupil outcomes. \"The government's failure to address the teacher shortage is not just a matter of bureaucratic incompetence, it's a matter of social justice,\" said Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee. \"Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are already at a disadvantage, and this crisis will only exacerbate the problem.\"\n\nAs the government grapples with the crisis, many are calling for a radical overhaul of the education system. \"We need to fundamentally rethink the way we approach education,\" said Professor Becky Francis, director of the UCL Institute of Education. \"We need to prioritize teacher well-being, provide adequate resources, and create a system that values and supports all teachers, regardless of their background or experience.\"\n\nThe crisis in the teaching profession is a stark reminder of the need for urgent action to address the systemic issues plaguing our education system. As the government struggles to come to terms with the consequences of its inaction, one thing is clear: the future of our education system depends on it.",

The investigators said they would now turn their inquiry to the maker of a device that monitors the batteries. Japan's Transport Ministry said it had wrapped up its eight-day on-site investigation at GS Yuasa, the maker of the lithium-ion batteries at the center of the inquiry. Officials stressed, however, that the cause of the recent battery malfunctions was still unknown, and that GS Yuasa remained under investigation. GS Yuasa made the batteries that overheated during an All Nippon Airways flight this month in Japan, prompting an emergency landing. That incident came just days after another GS Yuasa battery on a parked Japan Airlines plane caught fire at Boston's Logan Airport. The incidents prompted regulators worldwide to ground all 787s, and Boeing to halt deliveries. The investigation, which was conducted by Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, found that GS Yuasa's manufacturing processes and quality control measures appeared to be in order. However, officials emphasized that the inquiry was still ongoing and that no definitive conclusions had been reached.\n\nThe investigators' focus has now shifted to the device that monitors the batteries, known as the battery management system (BMS). The BMS is designed to detect and prevent overheating, but it appears to have failed in the recent incidents.\n\n\"We are looking into the BMS to see if there were any issues with its design, manufacturing, or maintenance,\" said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. \"We want to determine if the BMS played a role in the battery malfunctions and if so, what measures can be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\"\n\nThe investigation is also examining the battery's electrical wiring and connectors, as well as the aircraft's electrical system as a whole. Officials are working to determine if there were any design or manufacturing flaws that could have contributed to the malfunctions.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are working together to develop a plan to safely return the 787 fleet to service. The plan is expected to include a series of tests and inspections to ensure that the batteries are safe and reliable.\n\nThe grounding of the 787 fleet has had significant economic and logistical impacts on Boeing and its customers. The airline industry has been forced to adjust its schedules and operations, and Boeing has been forced to halt deliveries of the aircraft.\n\nThe incident has also raised concerns about the safety of lithium-ion batteries, which are used in a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles. The investigation is expected to provide valuable insights into the causes of the malfunctions and the measures that can be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it was \"working closely with the FAA and other regulatory authorities to determine the cause of the battery incidents and to develop a plan to safely return the 787 to service.\" The company added that it was \"committed to ensuring the safety and reliability of its products and services.\"\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and it may take several weeks or even months to determine the cause of the battery malfunctions and to develop a plan to safely return the 787 fleet to service. In the meantime, the grounding of the aircraft is expected to continue, and airlines and passengers will have to wait patiently for the results of the investigation.",

        "Text": "The Bank of England restructured its security department and lost multiple senior employees in charge of protecting some of Britain's most critical financial infrastructure shortly before it suffered a major breach, the Observer can reveal. After the central bank admitted that hedge funds had gained early access to its market-moving press conferences via a backup audio feed, multiple former employees contacted the Observer to warn that the Bank was struggling with the departure of key staff responsible for protecting it against external threats. The sources said at least 20 of the Bank's staff tasked with information security had left or been reassigned elsewhere within the bank within the past year, raising questions over the protection of the nation's payment systems and other critical infrastructure vital for the British financial system. The Observer was able to verify 13 of these departures using information from social media and other sources. The revelations come at a sensitive time for the Bank as it prepares for the handover of power in March from Mark Carney, the outgoing governor, to Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Threadneedle Street has also played a central role in efforts to improve the safety and integrity of the financial system since the 2008 banking collapse, including warning the industry to improve its cyber and information security operations. It is responsible for key parts of the nation's critical infrastructure, including the payments systems that carry every bank transfer made in Britain, the wages of millions of people, cheques, and payments between businesses of all sizes. On an average day in 2018, the Bank's real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) settled transactions worth Â£651bn. According to the former employees, the Bank's chief information security officer and two deputies have left in the past year. Multiple former employees described the organisation as beset by budget cuts before Carney's departure, against a backdrop of concerns over cost efficiency. They said there were problems with staffing given the departures and low staff morale. The departures of key staff members have raised concerns about the Bank of England's ability to protect its critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The Bank's real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) is a crucial component of the UK's financial system, handling transactions worth Â£651 billion on an average day in 2018. The system is designed to ensure the smooth transfer of funds between banks and other financial institutions, but the departure of senior staff members has raised questions about its vulnerability to cyber attacks.\n\nOne former employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described the situation as \"alarming\" and said that the Bank's decision to cut costs and restructure its security department had left it exposed to potential threats. \"The Bank is playing with fire by cutting back on its security staff,\" the employee said. \"It's a ticking time bomb waiting to happen.\"\n\nAnother former employee, who had worked in the Bank's security department for several years, said that the departures had created a sense of uncertainty and unease among remaining staff members. \"People are worried about the impact of these departures on the Bank's security,\" the employee said. \"We're talking about the safety of the nation's financial system here. It's a big responsibility, and I'm not sure the Bank is taking it seriously enough.\"\n\nThe Bank of England has faced criticism in the past for its handling of cyber security issues. In 2017, it was forced to issue a warning to banks and other financial institutions after a cyber attack on the SWIFT international banking system. The attack, which was carried out by hackers, compromised the security of the system and allowed them to steal millions of dollars from banks in Ukraine.\n\nThe Bank's handling of the recent breach has also been criticized, with some experts saying that it should have been more transparent about the nature of the attack and the measures it was taking to prevent future breaches. \"The Bank's response to the breach has been slow and inadequate,\" said one cybersecurity expert. \"It's clear that the Bank is struggling to keep up with the pace of cyber threats, and it's only a matter of time before something serious happens.\"\n\nThe Bank of England has declined to comment on the departures of its security staff, but a spokesperson said that it was \"fully committed to protecting the nation's financial system\" and was \"working closely with other agencies to identify and mitigate cyber threats.\"",

        "Text": "A scientific research consortium on Tuesday announced plans to build and launch a privately financed telescope the size of a small washing machine in hopes of finding an Earthlike planet in the Alpha Centauri system, one of our closest cosmic neighbors. Jon Morse, the chief executive of the BoldlyGo Institute, one of two nonprofits leading the consortium, called it \"the holy grail of exoplanet research.\" If there is a \"pale blue dot\" -- a world covered in oceans -- at Alpha Centauri, the telescope would permit scientists to study it in detail, looking for signs of life in the light reflected off the atmosphere. To be built by the end of the decade, the telescope is the type of mission that NASA rarely undertakes, experts noted: tightly focused and cheap, leading to momentous discoveries -- or possibly nothing at all. The two stars of the Alpha Centauri system are both similar to the sun, the closest such stars at 4.37 light-years away. The proposed telescope, with a mirror only about 20 inches across, would be able to make out Earth-size planets orbiting in the stars' so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are warm enough for liquid water to flow at the surface and, hypothetically, for life to thrive. But Proxima Centauri is much smaller and dimmer than our sun, and the planet, even if similar in size to Earth, would not be particularly Earthlike. It orbits much closer to the star, likely with one side perpetually in daylight and the other eternally dark. Because the planet is so close to its star, the proposed telescope would not be able to study it. So far, most exoplanets have been discovered indirectly, deduced by slight perturbations in the light traveling from a star -- by a slight dimming when the exoplanet passes between its star and Earth, or by wobbles in the light's wavelengths caused by the gravitational pull of an unseen exoplanet. If astronomers could photograph a planet directly, they could start to look for specific wavelengths of light that serve as fingerprints of specific molecules. The BoldlyGo Institute and its consortium partners are optimistic that the small, privately financed telescope will be able to detect signs of life in the Alpha Centauri system. According to Dr. Sophia Patel, a leading exoplanet researcher and member of the consortium, \"Direct imaging of exoplanets is a game-changer. It allows us to study the atmospheres and surfaces of planets in unprecedented detail, which could reveal the presence of biological activity.\"\n\nThe telescope's design is specifically tailored to detect the faint light reflected off the surface of an Earthlike planet in the habitable zone of Alpha Centauri. The consortium has developed advanced optics and detection systems to minimize the interference from the bright stars and other celestial objects in the system.\n\nWhile the telescope is not designed to study Proxima Centauri's potentially Earth-sized planet, the consortium is hopeful that it will be able to detect other planets in the system. \"We're not just looking for Earth 2.0,\" said Dr. Morse. \"We're looking for any sign of life, no matter what form it takes. If we can detect a planet with an atmosphere that's similar to Earth's, that's a major breakthrough.\"\n\nThe BoldlyGo Institute has partnered with several universities and research institutions to develop the telescope and conduct the research. The consortium has also received funding from private donors and foundations, including the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, which has pledged $100 million to support the mission.\n\nThe project is expected to take several years to complete, with the telescope launching into space around 2025. Once in orbit, the telescope will begin its search for an Earthlike planet in the Alpha Centauri system. If successful, the mission could pave the way for further research into the habitability of exoplanets and the search for extraterrestrial life.\n\nIn the meantime, the scientific community is eagerly awaiting the results of the mission. \"This is a bold and ambitious project,\" said Dr. John Smith, an astrophysicist at Harvard University. \"If they can detect a planet with an atmosphere that's similar to Earth's, it would be a major breakthrough and could have significant implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.\"",

Facebook announced yet more changes to its news feed algorithm on Wednesday, the secret sauce that determines whose posts show up on your Facebook page, and whose remain unseen. The winners: you and your friends, whose posts will receive more exposure than they have in the recent past. The losers: publishers, who rely increasingly on Facebook to send traffic to their sites. This is not the first time Facebook has tweaked its algorithms, which invariably results in agonized cries and the gnashing of teeth from those negatively affected. In April, after Facebook announced plans to move content posted by friends higher in the feed, traffic to some publishers' sites plummeted by 25%, according to a report in Digiday. Now Facebook is going further with that strategy, based on feedback from readers who say they would rather hear about grandma's recipe for fried pickles or see pictures of their nephew's bar mitzvah than the fallout from Brexit or Donald Trump's latest gaffe. In other words, Facebook is shifting back toward what it was originally designed to do before it stumbled into the news distribution business. Joshua Benton, director of Harvard's Nieman Journalism Lab, sees this as an incremental change, a continuation of policies Facebook has been pursuing for some time. However, Benton notes that the impact of this change will be felt more keenly by publishers who have come to rely heavily on Facebook to drive traffic to their websites. \"Facebook is essentially saying, 'We're going to prioritize the content that our users engage with most, and that's not necessarily the news,'\" he said in an interview. \"For publishers, this could be a major blow, especially those who have invested significant resources in creating content specifically for Facebook.\"\n\nOne such publisher is The New York Times, which has been vocal about its concerns over Facebook's algorithm changes. In a statement, a spokesperson for the newspaper said, \"We understand that Facebook's goal is to prioritize content that resonates with its users, but we also believe that a healthy and informed public requires access to a wide range of news and information.\"\n\nThe change is also likely to have implications for the way news is consumed and shared online. With fewer news stories appearing in users' feeds, publishers may need to adapt their strategies to reach their audiences. This could include increasing their presence on other social media platforms, such as Twitter or LinkedIn, or investing in email newsletters and other direct-to-consumer marketing tactics.\n\nFor Facebook, the move is seen as a way to refocus on its core mission of connecting people with their friends and family. \"We're listening to feedback from our users and making changes to prioritize the content that they find most valuable,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \"We believe that this will lead to a more engaging and relevant experience for our users, and ultimately, a healthier and more sustainable ecosystem for publishers and creators.\"\n\nWhile the impact of this change is still uncertain, one thing is clear: the days of Facebook as a primary news aggregator are numbered. As the social network continues to evolve, publishers and journalists will need to adapt to a new reality, one in which they must work harder to reach their audiences and build their own online presences.",

        "Text": "Twitter stock fell more than 12% in after-hours trading after the company reported revenue of $595m on Tuesday, missing expectations. Twitter was expected to report $607.8m in revenue. Meanwhile, its earnings, which were expected to be 10 cents a share, exceeded expectations at 15 cents a share. The real bright spot in Twitter's first quarter report was its user growth. Twitter's user growth was a major highlight of its first quarter report, with the company adding 3 million new users to its platform, bringing the total number of monthly active users to 330 million. This represents a 2% increase from the previous quarter and a 14% increase from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company attributed its strong user growth to a number of factors, including the popularity of its live streaming feature, which has seen significant growth in recent months. Twitter's live streaming feature allows users to broadcast live video to their followers, and has been particularly popular among sports fans and music enthusiasts.\n\nTwitter's user growth was also driven by its efforts to improve the user experience, including the introduction of a new algorithm that prioritizes tweets from users that users interact with most. The company also rolled out a number of new features, including the ability to share tweets directly to Facebook and the ability to add polls to tweets.\n\nDespite the strong user growth, Twitter's revenue missed expectations due to a decline in advertising revenue. The company's advertising revenue fell 7% from the previous quarter, driven by a decline in the number of ads displayed on the platform. Twitter attributed the decline to a shift in its advertising strategy, which is focused on increasing the quality of its ads rather than the quantity.\n\nTwitter's earnings exceeded expectations, driven by the company's efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency. The company reported a net loss of $62 million, compared to a net loss of $91 million in the same quarter last year. Twitter's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also exceeded expectations, coming in at $143 million.\n\nTwitter's CEO, Jack Dorsey, attributed the company's strong earnings to its focus on improving the user experience and increasing the quality of its ads. \"We're committed to building a platform that is both profitable and sustainable,\" Dorsey said in a statement. \"We're making progress on this front, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead.\"\n\nTwitter's stock fell 12% in after-hours trading, despite the company's strong earnings and user growth. The decline was driven by concerns about the company's revenue growth and its ability to compete with other social media platforms.\n\nIn conclusion, Twitter's first quarter report was a mixed bag, with the company reporting strong user growth and exceeding expectations on earnings, but missing expectations on revenue. The company's focus on improving the user experience and increasing the quality of its ads is paying off, but it still faces challenges in the competitive social media landscape.",

His comments, made during a discussion about President Trump's desired border wall, led to an immediate backlash. \"Hispanics should work harder at assimilation,\" Mr. Brokaw said. \"That's one of the things I've been saying for a long time. They ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all of their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities, and that's going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.\" Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent for \"PBS NewsHour\" and a former New York Times reporter, was also on the panel and responded to Mr. Brokaw's comments. \"You're talking about assimilation. Yamiche Alcindor's voice was laced with a mix of surprise and disappointment as she interrupted Tom Brokaw's statement. \"You're talking about assimilation, but aren't you implying that there's something wrong with being Hispanic?\" she asked, her tone firm but measured.\n\nThe studio fell silent, with the other panelists exchanging uneasy glances. Brokaw, seemingly taken aback by Alcindor's reaction, hesitated before responding. \"No, no, no, I didn't mean it that way,\" he said, his voice rising in defense. \"I just think that in order for our society to function, we need to find a balance between preserving our cultural heritage and integrating into the broader American fabric.\"\n\nHowever, his attempts to clarify his statement only seemed to fuel the backlash. Social media erupted with outrage, with many accusing Brokaw of perpetuating harmful stereotypes and reinforcing outdated notions of assimilation. The hashtag #AssimilationIsNotTheAnswer began trending, with many users sharing their own stories of cultural identity and the importance of preserving their heritage.\n\nThe controversy sparked a wider conversation about the role of media in shaping public discourse on issues of race, ethnicity, and cultural identity. Many critics argued that Brokaw's comments reflected a broader problem within the media, where minority voices are often marginalized or tokenized, and where cultural sensitivity is sacrificed in the name of \"objectivity.\"\n\nIn response to the backlash, NBC released a statement apologizing for Brokaw's comments and affirming the network's commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion. \"We recognize that Tom's comments were insensitive and offensive, and we regret any harm they may have caused,\" the statement read. \"We will continue to strive for greater cultural sensitivity and understanding in our reporting and programming.\"\n\nAs the controversy continued to unfold, many within the media and beyond began to question the value of assimilation as a concept. Some argued that it was a relic of a bygone era, one that had been used to erase the cultural identities of marginalized communities. Others saw it as a necessary step towards social cohesion, but acknowledged that it must be approached with sensitivity and respect for the diverse cultural backgrounds of Americans.\n\nIn the end, Brokaw's apology and NBC's statement were seen as a step in the right direction, but many felt that more needed to be done to address the underlying issues of cultural sensitivity and representation within the media. As the debate raged on, one thing was clear: the conversation about assimilation had only just begun, and it would require a willingness to listen, learn, and adapt from all parties involved.",

        "Text": "During his campaign, Donald J. Trump embraced the cause of fiscal responsibility and accused President Barack Obama of shackling the country with a \"mountain of debt.\" Mr. Obama \"doubled our national debt. Doubled it,\" Mr. Trump claimed in a speech in Virginia Beach. Then on Wednesday, Mr. Trump unveiled the outlines of his much-anticipated tax overhaul, calling for steep tax cuts with only modest offsetting revenue increases. Economists I spoke to this week estimate it would add trillions to the national debt over the next decade. \"We've only done the rough numbers, but this looks like a tax cut of a magnitude of about $5 trillion,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan advocacy organization for fiscal responsibility. \"That is simply unimaginable given our fiscal situation and the size of the deficit, which is already the worst since World War II.\" The sense of incredulity was widely shared. \"Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady must be beside themselves in private,\" said Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, referring to the House speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman. The proposed tax overhaul, which is expected to be a centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda, would reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, and slash individual tax rates across the board. While the plan promises to simplify the tax code and reduce compliance burdens for businesses and individuals, many economists and budget experts are sounding the alarm about the potential impact on the national debt.\n\n\"This is a recipe for disaster,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The tax cuts are so large that they will blow a huge hole in the deficit, and the revenue increases that are proposed are nowhere near enough to offset the cost.\"\n\nThe plan's architects argue that the tax cuts will boost economic growth, which will in turn generate more revenue and help reduce the deficit over time. However, many economists are skeptical of this claim, pointing to the fact that the last time the country saw a similar tax cut, during the George W. Bush administration, the resulting surge in economic growth was short-lived and did not lead to a corresponding increase in revenue.\n\n\"This is a classic example of a supply-side economics experiment gone wrong,\" said Alan Auerbach, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"The evidence is clear that tax cuts do not lead to sustained economic growth, and the only thing they are likely to do is increase the national debt.\"\n\nThe plan's critics are also concerned about the impact on low- and moderate-income households, who may not benefit as much from the tax cuts as higher-income earners. The plan's proposed elimination of the estate tax, for example, is expected to benefit a small group of wealthy individuals, while the reduction in the corporate tax rate could lead to increased profits for large corporations.\n\n\"Instead of helping working families, this plan seems designed to help the wealthy and big corporations,\" said Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. \"It's a classic example of trickle-down economics, and it's a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nAs the debate over the tax plan continues to unfold, many lawmakers and budget experts are urging caution and calling for a more thoughtful and sustainable approach to fiscal policy. With the national debt already at historic levels, the last thing the country needs is a tax plan that could add trillions to the debt and put the economy at risk.\n\n\"This is a moment of truth for our country,\" said Maya MacGuineas. \"We need to think carefully about the long-term consequences of our actions, and we need to make sure that we are putting the country on a sustainable fiscal path. This plan falls far short of that standard.\"",

        "Text": "Telecommunications giant AT&T is selling access to customer data to local law enforcement in secret, new documents released on Monday reveal. The program, called Hemisphere, was previously known only as a \"partnership\" between the company and the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) for the purposes of counter-narcotics operations. It accesses the trove of telephone metadata available to AT&T, who control a large proportion of America's landline and cellphone infrastructure. According to the newly released documents, the Hemisphere program has been in operation since 2007, with AT&T providing law enforcement agencies with access to its customers' phone records, including call logs, text messages, and internet browsing history. The program is said to be highly secretive, with AT&T and the DEA working together to ensure that the existence of the program remains hidden from the public.\n\nThe documents, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), reveal that the program is not limited to the DEA, but is also used by other federal agencies, including the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The documents also show that the program has been used to investigate a wide range of crimes, including drug trafficking, terrorism, and fraud.\n\nCritics of the program have raised concerns about the potential for abuse and the erosion of privacy rights. \"This is a shocking example of how our personal data is being used by law enforcement without our knowledge or consent,\" said EFF attorney Nate Cardozo. \"AT&T's Hemisphere program is a clear violation of our privacy and a threat to our civil liberties.\"\n\nAT&T has defended the program, saying that it is a necessary tool for law enforcement to combat crime and keep the public safe. \"We are proud to work with law enforcement agencies to help them investigate and prosecute crimes,\" said an AT&T spokesperson. \"Our Hemisphere program is designed to provide law enforcement with the information they need to keep our communities safe, while also protecting the privacy and security of our customers' data.\"\n\nHowever, experts say that the program raises serious questions about the balance between national security and individual privacy. \"The Hemisphere program is a classic example of how our privacy is being sacrificed in the name of national security,\" said privacy expert Marc Rotenberg. \"We need to have a much more nuanced conversation about the trade-offs between security and privacy, and how we can ensure that our privacy is protected in the digital age.\"\n\nThe release of the documents comes at a time when concerns about government surveillance and privacy are at an all-time high. The revelations about the Hemisphere program are likely to fuel further debate about the need for greater transparency and oversight in government surveillance programs.\n\nIn the meantime, AT&T's Hemisphere program will continue to operate in secret, with the company and the DEA working together to keep the program hidden from the public. But as the debate over the program continues to grow, it remains to be seen whether the program will be able to withstand the scrutiny of the public and the media.",

Farmers say they have been producing 50% to 100% more crop than usual in recent weeks. A new harvest of produce from Lincolnshire is about to come on the market, adding to stocks already coming from Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Suffolk. Morrisons is to cut cauliflower prices to 75p early next week, after Tesco cut its prices from Â£1 to 79p this week. Asda cut its price to 70p on Thursday, compared with the 95p it was charging in late February. The sudden surge in cauliflower production has left farmers and supermarkets scrambling to keep up with demand. According to industry insiders, the warm weather in the UK has created ideal conditions for cauliflower growth, resulting in a bumper crop.\n\n\"We're thrilled with the yield this season,\" said John Smith, a cauliflower farmer from Lincolnshire. \"The warm weather has been a game-changer for us. We're usually struggling to meet demand, but this year we're expecting to have a surplus.\"\n\nThe glut of cauliflower has led to a price war among supermarkets, with several major chains announcing significant price cuts. As well as Morrisons, Tesco, and Asda, Sainsbury's has also reduced its price to 80p, while Waitrose is offering cauliflower for 85p.\n\nBut while consumers are set to benefit from the price cuts, some farmers are worried about the impact on their livelihoods. \"While it's great that people are getting a good deal on cauliflower, we're concerned that the price cuts will make it difficult for us to make a profit,\" said Smith. \"We're already struggling to make ends meet, and a further reduction in prices could be devastating.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, many experts believe that the cauliflower glut is a temporary phenomenon that will correct itself as the weather cools down. \"The warm weather has been a one-off, and we're expecting a return to more normal conditions in the coming weeks,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading agricultural expert. \"In the meantime, we're just enjoying the benefits of a bountiful harvest.\"\n\nFor now, cauliflower lovers are reaping the rewards of the price war, with many stocking up on the versatile vegetable. \"I love cauliflower â€“ it's so versatile and delicious,\" said Sarah Johnson, a local resident. \"I'm thrilled to see the prices coming down, and I'm planning to buy a few more bunches to freeze for later.\"\n\nAs the cauliflower glut continues to play out, one thing is clear: consumers are the big winners in this price war. With prices at an all-time low, now is the perfect time to get creative with cauliflower recipes and enjoy the benefits of a bountiful harvest.",

        "Text": "The police and crime commissioner of Thames Valley police has claimed that HBOS must have known of the fraudulent activities inside its Reading branch as long ago as February 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employers, were jailed earlier this year for committing the fraud, described by the judge as an \"utterly corrupt scheme\" that left small business owners cheated, defeated and penniless. Anthony Stansfeld told a meeting attended by 150 people on Wednesday that it had still taken the bank â€“ rescued by Lloyds following the 2008 financial crisis â€“ a decade to offer compensation to the 67 companies affected. Sitting alongside TV celebrity Noel Edmonds, who is claiming Â£300m from Lloyds for the damage caused to his company, Stansfeld also told the audience that Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, had rescinded an offer to meet to discuss concerns the commissioner was raising about the banking sector after he had received briefings on the matters. The Cabinet Office had not responded to a request for comment on the claim about Heywood at the time of publication. [See footnote.] Stansfeld said: \"It must have been known quite clearly to the directors of the bank as far back as February 2008 that a massive fraud had taken place [at HBOS Reading].\" Stansfeld's comments came as part of a meeting hosted by the Thames Valley Police Federation, where he shared his concerns about the banking sector and the impact of the HBOS fraud on small business owners. The commissioner's remarks have sparked fresh outrage among those affected by the scandal, who are still waiting for justice and compensation.\n\nThe HBOS Reading fraud, which was uncovered in 2011, involved a group of employees who conspired to defraud small businesses by issuing false loan guarantees and creating fake accounts. The scheme, which was described by the judge as \"utterly corrupt,\" resulted in the loss of millions of pounds for the affected companies.\n\nStansfeld's claim that HBOS must have known about the fraud as early as February 2008 is based on his review of the bank's internal documents and testimony from former employees. He believes that the bank's management was aware of the scheme but failed to take action to stop it or report it to the authorities.\n\nThe commissioner's comments have also raised questions about the role of Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, in the scandal. Stansfeld claimed that Heywood rescinded an offer to meet with him to discuss concerns about the banking sector after he received briefings on the matter. The Cabinet Office has yet to respond to requests for comment on the claim.\n\nThe meeting also heard from TV presenter Noel Edmonds, who is claiming Â£300m in damages from Lloyds for the harm caused to his company, Unique Group, by the HBOS fraud. Edmonds, who was a major shareholder in Unique Group, claimed that the bank's failure to prevent the fraud led to the collapse of his business and financial ruin.\n\nThe HBOS Reading fraud is just one of several high-profile banking scandals that have rocked the financial industry in recent years. The scandal has led to calls for greater regulation and oversight of the banking sector to prevent similar frauds from occurring in the future.\n\nThe affected small business owners, who are still waiting for compensation and justice, are hoping that the commissioner's comments will lead to a renewed investigation into the scandal and a more satisfactory outcome.",

So how handy to have \"home emergency\" or \"key cover\" insurance for that all-important peace of mind. Except that official figures released this week reveal just how many millions of people are overpaying for these policies. The Financial Conduct Authority has for the first time published figures that detail, company by company, the frequency that claims are made, and how much is paid out. For key cover at some of the insurers, the claims rate is equal to less than once in every 100 years. And even if you live as long as Methuselah, and keep paying the premiums, there's a one in five chance they'll reject your claim anyway. According to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) latest report, millions of policyholders are unwittingly overpaying for home emergency and key cover insurance, despite the low likelihood of making a claim. The report highlights the stark contrast between the high premiums charged by some insurers and the extremely low claims rates.\n\nFor instance, one insurer reported a claims rate of less than once in every 100 years for key cover, meaning that the chances of making a claim are extremely low. Another insurer had a claims rate of less than once in every 500 years, making it even more unlikely that a policyholder would need to make a claim.\n\nThe FCA's report also reveals that even if a policyholder does make a claim, there is a significant chance that it will be rejected. According to the data, one in five claims is rejected by insurers, leaving policyholders without the financial protection they thought they had.\n\nExperts are warning that policyholders are being misled by insurers who are taking advantage of their lack of knowledge about the insurance market. \"Insurers are using complex jargon and fine print to confuse policyholders into buying policies that are not worth the cost,\" said a leading insurance expert.\n\nThe FCA is urging policyholders to be more vigilant when purchasing home emergency and key cover insurance. \"Policyholders need to be aware of the claims rates and the likelihood of their claim being rejected,\" said an FCA spokesperson. \"They should also be wary of insurers who are using high-pressure sales tactics to sell policies that are not suitable for their needs.\"\n\nIn response to the report, some insurers have announced plans to review their policies and improve transparency for policyholders. However, many critics argue that more needs to be done to protect policyholders from being overcharged and misled.\n\nAs the winter months approach, policyholders are being advised to take a closer look at their insurance policies and to shop around for better deals. With millions of people overpaying for home emergency and key cover insurance, it's essential that policyholders are aware of their rights and take steps to protect themselves from being taken advantage of.",

It is a school day but the room is empty because this \"awful\" scent, a mix of damp and chemicals, clogs children's throats and clings to the teachers' hair and clothes long after they go home. \"That classroom is shut and unusable because of the smell â€“ and I could really do with that classroom,\" said headteacher Catharine Darnton. Her state school has 900 pupils and, like many other heads across the country, she has struggled to maintain her dilapidated building in the face of the government's austerity cuts. As well as the stink, heating failures and electricity blow-outs have led to partial temporary closures of the school and blocked drains have threatened to leak raw sewage onto the playground. Darnton has been forced to take money intended for the education of students and allocate it to repairs and even capital expenditure. The low point came when, in winter, the building was so cold and dark she had to consider closing the school. \"It was insane,\" she said. Last week, a survey of 3,500 teachers revealed two-fifths of schools have set up buckets to catch drips when it rains and over a quarter do not believe their schools are in a good state of repair. The situation at Gillotts secondary school is not an isolated incident. According to the survey, 40% of teachers reported that their schools have set up buckets to catch drips, highlighting the widespread neglect of school infrastructure. The survey also found that 27% of teachers do not believe their schools are in a good state of repair, with many citing issues such as leaky roofs, broken boilers, and outdated electrical systems.\n\nThe consequences of these issues are far-reaching. Not only do they pose a risk to the health and safety of students and teachers, but they also impact the quality of education being provided. \"The smell in that classroom is not just unpleasant, it's also a health hazard,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading expert in environmental health. \"Exposure to chemicals and damp can exacerbate respiratory conditions and even trigger asthma attacks. It's unacceptable that schools are being forced to operate in such conditions.\"\n\nThe government's austerity cuts have been widely criticized for exacerbating the problem. Since 2010, schools have faced significant reductions in funding, with many forced to divert resources away from education and towards repairs and maintenance. The result is a generation of students being taught in substandard facilities, with many schools struggling to provide even the most basic amenities.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in rural areas like Henley-on-Thames, where schools often have limited budgets and resources. \"We're not just talking about a few broken windows or a leaky roof,\" said local MP, John Smith. \"We're talking about a fundamental failure of government policy. Schools are being forced to choose between educating children and maintaining their buildings. It's a false choice, and it's one that's being made every day across the country.\"\n\nAs the school year draws to a close, parents and teachers are calling for action. \"This is not just a problem for Gillotts school or even for Oxfordshire,\" said Catharine Darnton, the headteacher. \"This is a national issue that requires a national response. We need the government to take responsibility for the state of our schools and to provide the funding necessary to ensure that every child has access to a safe and healthy learning environment.\"\n\nThe government has responded to the survey by pledging to increase funding for schools, but many are skeptical about the impact this will have. \"We've heard promises before,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"What we need is concrete action. We need schools to be properly funded and properly maintained. Anything less is unacceptable.\"",

Carolyn McCall, ITV's chief executive, lauded the \"fantastic\" viewing figures for the tournament and reality show for helping the broadcaster achieve a strong performance in the first half of the year. \"[Our] share of viewing [against competitors] was up 9% in the period, with outstanding contributions from Love Island and the World Cup,\" McCall said. The company said the rate of growth was the biggest in ITV's recent history and the broadcaster's share of viewers was at a 10-year high. ITV's exclusive coverage of England's semi-final against Croatia peaked at 26.6 million viewers, and the average of 24.3 million viewers for the match was bigger than the audiences for the London 2012 Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. ITV said Love Island, which airs on ITV2, has achieved the second-highest audience on a digital channel. ITV has sold the Love Island format to seven countries, with an eighth major market to be announced soon. The broadcaster's strong performance in the first half of the year is expected to continue into the second half, with a packed schedule of programming lined up, including the return of popular shows such as \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\". ITV's digital platform, ITV Hub, also saw a significant increase in usage, with 1.4 million new registrations in the first half of the year, a 23% rise compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe success of ITV's summer programming has also had a positive impact on the company's revenue from advertising. The broadcaster reported a 15% increase in ad revenue in the first half of the year, with the average cost of a 30-second ad spot on ITV increasing by 12% compared to the same period last year.\n\nITV's strong performance has also been driven by its efforts to diversify its revenue streams. The company has been investing heavily in its production arm, ITV Studios, which has seen significant growth in recent years. ITV Studios has produced a number of successful shows, including \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" and \"The X Factor\", which have been sold to broadcasters around the world.\n\nThe company's focus on diversification has also seen it expand into new areas, such as online content and gaming. ITV has launched a number of online platforms, including ITV News and ITV Sport, which have seen significant engagement from viewers. The company has also partnered with gaming companies to produce interactive content, such as quizzes and games, which have been successful in attracting new audiences.\n\nIn addition to its strong performance in the first half of the year, ITV has also announced a number of new initiatives aimed at driving growth and increasing revenue. The company has launched a new marketing campaign, aimed at attracting a younger audience and increasing brand awareness. ITV has also announced plans to invest in new technology, including artificial intelligence and virtual reality, to improve its production capabilities and create new content opportunities.\n\nOverall, ITV's strong performance in the first half of the year is a testament to the company's ability to adapt to changing viewer habits and capitalize on popular trends. With a packed schedule of programming lined up and a focus on diversification and innovation, ITV is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory in the second half of the year.",

Mr. Price, the head of Amazon Studios, was accused of lewdly propositioning Isa Dick Hackett, a producer of one of its most popular shows, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published earlier in the day. In the interview, Ms. Hackett, an executive producer of the Amazon series \"The Man in the High Castle,\" said that Mr. Price had repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances toward her two years ago after a dinner at Comic-Con in San Diego. When reached by The New York Times on Thursday, Ms. Hackett said she was \"talked out\" but said that the details in the article, written by Kim Masters, were accurate. \"I just wanted to get that out,\" Ms. Hackett said in the brief phone interview. According to the Hollywood Reporter article, Ms. Hackett entered a cab on July 10, 2015, with Mr. Price and Michael Paull, then an executive at Amazon and now the chief executive of BamTech, as they were making their way to an after party. Ms. Hackett said that Mr. Price repeatedly propositioned her in the cab, once making use of a vulgar term for male genitalia. At the party, Ms. Hackett said, Mr. Price approached her while she was speaking to other executives and shouted \"Anal sex!\" directly in her ear. The allegations against Roy Price have sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many calling for his immediate resignation. Amazon has announced an investigation into the matter, but it is unclear what actions will be taken as a result.\n\nMs. Hackett's allegations against Mr. Price are not the first of their kind. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of sexual harassment and misconduct in the entertainment industry, with many high-profile figures being accused of inappropriate behavior. The #MeToo movement, which began in October, has brought attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment and assault, and has led to a wave of resignations and apologies from those accused of misconduct.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon said that it takes allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct very seriously and is committed to providing a safe and respectful work environment for all employees. The company has launched an investigation into the matter and will take appropriate action based on the findings.\n\nMr. Price has been a key figure in Amazon's expansion into the entertainment industry, and his suspension is a significant blow to the company's efforts to establish itself as a major player in Hollywood. Under his leadership, Amazon Studios has produced a number of successful shows, including \"The Grand Tour\" and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\"\n\nThe allegations against Mr. Price have also raised questions about the company's culture and whether it has done enough to prevent sexual harassment and misconduct. In recent years, there have been reports of a toxic work environment at Amazon Studios, with some employees complaining of long hours, high stress, and a lack of support for those who have been victims of harassment.\n\nAs the investigation into the matter continues, it is unclear what the future holds for Mr. Price and Amazon Studios. However, one thing is certain: the entertainment industry will be watching closely to see how the company handles the situation and whether it will take meaningful action to address the problem of sexual harassment and misconduct.",

        "Text": "Winner: Falmouth University Project: MAYN Creative, student photography agency MAYN Creative is a photography agency based within Falmouth University. The name \"Mayn\" is a Cornish word which translates as \"mediator\". This is exactly what the agency does: it negotiates professional assignments for a range of clients on behalf of student photographers. Through working with MAYN Creative, photography students can take on real client briefs, increase their portfolio and earn money. The university operates a three tier framework, depending on a student's level of experience. Clients are able to commission talent at one of three levels, depending on their budget and requirements. Students can progress through the levels as they gain more experience and prove themselves professionally. Students are encouraged to be creative with every assignment they undertake and use both client and agency feedback for critical reflection. The university has begun to form collaborative partnerships with inspiring commissioning organisations such as SONY Music and The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) who are looking to work with up-and-coming photographers. Since MAYN Creative began operation in Dec 2016 the university has facilitated 286 professional assignments for 62 unique students. The success of MAYN Creative has not only benefited the students but also the clients who have commissioned the work. The agency's unique approach has allowed clients to tap into fresh talent and innovative perspectives, resulting in high-quality content that meets their specific needs.\n\nOne such client is SONY Music, which has worked with MAYN Creative on several projects. \"We were impressed by the quality of work produced by the students and the ease of working with the agency,\" said a spokesperson for SONY Music. \"The students brought a unique perspective to the projects, and we were able to commission work that met our specific needs and budget.\"\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has also been a client of MAYN Creative, commissioning work from the agency for its conservation efforts. \"We were looking for a way to showcase our conservation work in a more creative and engaging way,\" said a representative from WWF. \"MAYN Creative provided us with high-quality images that not only met our needs but also helped to raise awareness about our cause.\"\n\nThe success of MAYN Creative has also led to the expansion of the university's photography program.

        "Text": "One benefit of discovery is that you get to name the things you discovered. Astronomy is blessed in this regard. There are more stars in the observable universe than grains of sand on Earth, trillions upon trillions -- enough to name a galaxy for every human who ever did or will live and every god or goblin proposed by human imagination. In the last two decades a new wonderland of naming opportunities has emerged with the discovery of planets around other stars, potential cradles of life and far-future adventure. But so far exoplanets, like everything else in the sky, mostly don't have names, just numbers, like HD 156411 b or HAT-P-5b. Are they secret agents? Celestial nomenclature typically is a rigid and exclusive business, closely managed by the International Astronomical Union, the world organization of astronomers. However, a group of astronomers and science communicators are challenging the status quo by launching a campaign to give exoplanets more relatable and meaningful names. The initiative, dubbed \"Exoplanet Names,\" aims to make the discovery of distant worlds more accessible and engaging for the general public.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a lead researcher on the project, \"Naming exoplanets is not just a matter of aesthetics; it's about creating a connection between the scientific community and the public. By giving these planets more human-like names, we can make the concept of exoplanets more tangible and exciting for everyone.\"\n\nThe Exoplanet Names team has developed a set of guidelines for naming exoplanets, which prioritize cultural and linguistic diversity. The names are drawn from a variety of sources, including mythology, literature, and indigenous languages. For example, the exoplanet HD 189733b, which orbits a star in the constellation Vulpecula, has been renamed \"Nyx,\" after the Greek goddess of night.\n\nThe initiative has already gained traction, with over 100 exoplanets having been named through the Exoplanet Names platform. The project has also received support from the International Astronomical Union, which has recognized the importance of making astronomy more accessible and inclusive.\n\nWhile some astronomers have expressed concerns about the potential for naming conflicts and inconsistencies, Dr. Rodriguez believes that the benefits of a more diverse and engaging naming system far outweigh the risks. \"Naming exoplanets is not just about assigning a label; it's about telling a story and inspiring a sense of wonder and curiosity,\" she said.\n\nAs the search for life beyond Earth continues to intensify, the Exoplanet Names campaign is poised to play a significant role in shaping the way we think about and interact with distant worlds. By giving exoplanets more relatable and meaningful names, scientists and science communicators can help to create a sense of shared ownership and excitement around the discovery of new worlds.",

        "Text": "What is Booker? Booker is a grocery wholesaler supplying 125,000 independent convenience stores as well as 468,000 restaurants, pubs and leisure facilities such as cinemas. The group employs 13,000 people, had sales of Â£5bn and made Â£155m in operating profit in the year to March 2016. It is the UK's largest cash-and-carry operator via its 172-store Booker chain and Makro, which has 30 outlets. Booker also controls the Premier, Londis, Family Shopper and Budgens symbol groups which make up about half of the retail clients it supplies. Premier is the largest branded group with 3,358 outlets, while Londis has 1,903, Budgens has 150 and Family Shopper 52. Booker doesn't own these stores â€“ they are all independently run and owned â€“ but it sells them a large proportion of their stock and assists with marketing, IT and a whole range of other services making for a close relationship. The group's Booker Direct service also delivers grocery supplies to most of the major cinema chains, including Odeon and Cineworld, the national prison service and provides the limited array of non-own label food sold in Marks & Spencer. Booker also supplies 450,000 caterers including major chains such as Wagamama, Carluccios and Byron burgers and 700,000 small businesses. Booker opened its first store in Mumbai in 2009 and now has six wholesale outlets in India, where it also runs the Happy Shopper brand. Why does Tesco want to buy Booker? Tesco's proposed acquisition of Booker has sent shockwaves through the UK's retail industry, with many questioning the motivations behind the move. Booker's diverse customer base, spanning from independent convenience stores to major cinema chains, has made it a crucial player in the UK's food supply chain.\n\nFor Tesco, the acquisition of Booker would provide a significant boost to its wholesale business, allowing it to expand its reach and offer a wider range of products to its customers. Booker's extensive network of cash-and-carry stores and its ability to supply a vast array of products would enable Tesco to increase its presence in the wholesale market and potentially challenge the dominance of other major players in the industry.\n\nThe acquisition would also give Tesco access to Booker's extensive customer base, including its 125,000 convenience stores and 468,000 restaurants, pubs, and leisure facilities. This would provide Tesco with a significant opportunity to increase its sales and expand its market share in the UK.\n\nHowever, the acquisition is not without its challenges. Booker's independent customers, who make up the majority of its business, may be concerned about the potential impact on their relationships with the company. Booker's close relationships with its customers, which involve providing a range of services beyond just supply, may be difficult to replicate under new ownership.\n\nAdditionally, the acquisition would likely face scrutiny from regulators, who would need to determine whether the deal would reduce competition in the market. The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would need to assess whether the combined entity would have a significant impact on the market and whether it would be in the best interests of consumers.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tesco's proposed acquisition of Booker has the potential to create significant benefits for both companies. The deal would provide Tesco with a new route to market and increase its presence in the wholesale sector, while Booker would gain access to Tesco's extensive resources and expertise.\n\nAs the deal progresses, it will be interesting to see how the two companies navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Will Tesco's acquisition of Booker be a game-changer for the UK's retail industry, or will it face significant hurdles along the way? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "Campaigners battling one of the world's biggest banks over the \"grossly unfair\" way it treats the pensions paid to some former workers are getting ready for a David and Goliath showdown next month. The practice is called \"clawback\" and it involves cutting an employee's company pension on the grounds that they also receive the state pension. It allows employers to deduct from company pension payments some or all of the basic state pension amount. It is estimated that about 52,000 former employees of HSBC are affected, and an action group has succeeded in demanding the matter be put to a shareholder vote, while protests are planned for outside the AGM venue on 12 April. The practice â€“ which only applies to defined benefit occupational pension schemes â€“ is legal but mostly frowned upon. Often the first time people become aware of it is when they reach state pension age â€“ which may be years after they start receiving their company pension â€“ and discover that their income has been reduced. HSBC is one of the employers that makes a deduction, and some of its ex-staff argue they are losing out on up to Â£2,500 a year. The campaign against HSBC's \"clawback\" practice has gained momentum, with the action group, \"Fair Deal for HSBC Pensioners,\" urging shareholders to reject the bank's remuneration report at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) next month. The group claims that the practice is unfair and has caused significant financial hardship for thousands of former employees.\n\nAccording to the group, HSBC's clawback policy has resulted in a reduction of up to Â£2,500 per year in the company pensions of affected former employees. This, they argue, is a significant blow to those who have already worked hard to earn their pensions and are now facing a reduced income in retirement.\n\nThe action group has been working tirelessly to raise awareness about the issue and to persuade HSBC to reconsider its policy. They have also been in talks with the bank's management to try to find a solution that would benefit all parties involved.\n\nIn a statement, the group's spokesperson said, \"We believe that HSBC's clawback policy is grossly unfair and has caused unnecessary hardship for many of its former employees. We are calling on the bank's shareholders to reject the remuneration report and to demand that the bank takes immediate action to address this issue.\"\n\nThe group has also been working with other organizations, including the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA), to raise awareness about the issue and to push for change.\n\nThe PLSA has expressed its support for the campaign, saying that the practice of clawback is \"unfair and unjust\" and that it is \"high time\" that employers took action to address the issue.\n\nThe AGM is scheduled to take place on April 12, and the action group is planning to hold protests outside the venue to raise awareness about the issue and to urge shareholders to reject the remuneration report.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign continues to gather momentum, with more and more people coming forward to share their stories and to demand change. It remains to be seen whether HSBC will listen to the concerns of its former employees and take action to address the issue, but one thing is clear: the campaign is not going away anytime soon.",

Politicians, academics, businessmen and a smattering of billionaires make up the guest list, while campaigners and activists lobby on the fringes. So what have we learned from their week in the snow? As the snow-capped mountains of Davos provided a picturesque backdrop, the World Economic Forum's annual meeting brought together some of the world's most influential leaders to discuss the pressing issues of the day. From climate change to technological disruption, the agenda was packed with topics that will shape the future of our global economy.\n\nOne of the most significant takeaways from the meeting was the growing sense of urgency around climate change. World leaders, including UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, emphasized the need for immediate and drastic action to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. The forum's own report, \"Global Risks Report 2023,\" warned that the window for effective action is rapidly closing, with devastating consequences for the planet and its inhabitants.\n\nIn response, many of the world's largest corporations announced new commitments to reduce their environmental impact. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft pledged to power their operations with 100% renewable energy, while major oil companies like ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell announced plans to invest in clean energy technologies.\n\nHowever, not everyone was convinced by the promises made in Davos. Activists and campaigners, who had been protesting on the fringes of the meeting, accused the corporate leaders of making empty promises and failing to take meaningful action to address the crisis. \"The rich get richer while the planet burns,\" said Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, in a passionate speech to a crowd of thousands. \"We need systemic change, not just token gestures.\"\n\nDespite the disagreements, the meeting also saw a growing recognition of the need for international cooperation to address global challenges. World leaders from the US, China, and Europe stressed the importance of working together to address issues like trade, security, and migration. The forum's founder, Klaus Schwab, hailed the meeting as a \"historic moment\" in which the world's leaders had come together to \"rewrite the rules\" of the global economy.\n\nIn the world of business, the meeting saw a flurry of deal-making and announcements. The Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group announced a major investment in the European e-commerce company, Zalando, while the US retail giant, Walmart, announced plans to expand its e-commerce operations in India.\n\nAs the snow began to clear from the Davos streets, the attendees packed their bags and headed home, armed with a renewed sense of purpose and a determination to make a difference. The question on everyone's lips was: what will be the lasting impact of this year's World Economic Forum? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain â€“ the world will be watching.",

The agency announced the decision on Friday, saying the nine are still producing bounties of observations for scientists. Most of the extensions were expected. The extensions, which will add up to 15 years to the missions of the nine spacecraft, were approved by NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The spacecraft, which were launched between 1990 and 2003, were initially designed to operate for between 2-5 years, but have far exceeded those expectations.\n\nThe nine spacecraft, which include the Mars Global Surveyor, the Mars Odyssey, the Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn, and the Dawn spacecraft that explored the asteroid belt, have made significant contributions to our understanding of the solar system. They have provided valuable data and images that have helped scientists to better understand the geology, atmospheres, and magnetic fields of the planets and moons they have studied.\n\n\"This is a testament to the ingenuity and hard work of the teams that built and operate these spacecraft,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. \"These missions have been incredibly successful, and we are excited to continue to learn from them.\"\n\nThe extensions will allow the spacecraft to continue making observations and gathering data, which will help scientists to answer new questions and explore new areas of the solar system. For example, the Mars Odyssey, which has been orbiting Mars since 2001, will continue to study the planet's geology and search for signs of water and life.\n\nThe extensions are also a cost-effective way for NASA to continue to explore the solar system. The agency estimates that the extensions will cost around $200 million over the next 15 years, which is a fraction of the cost of launching a new mission.\n\nThe decision to extend the missions of the nine spacecraft is also a nod to the importance of long-term exploration and the value of continuity in space research. By continuing to operate these spacecraft, NASA can build on the knowledge and data they have already collected, and make new discoveries that will help us better understand the solar system.\n\nThe extensions will also provide opportunities for new scientific discoveries and exploration. For example, the Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around Saturn, will continue to study the planet's rings and moons, and may even discover new moons and ring systems.\n\nThe extensions are a testament to the success of NASA's robotic exploration program, which has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the solar system. By continuing to operate these spacecraft, NASA can continue to make new discoveries and push the boundaries of what we know about the universe.",

Lee, many could not help noticing the product illuminating the faces twisted into sneers of hate: Tiki torches. Those innocuous bamboo beacons, produced by Tiki Brand, a 60-year-old company, and known primarily for their presence at family barbecues, poolside cabanas, lush resort grounds and Pacific-island themed restaurants, were now lighting the way for racists. Tiki, which is owned by the Wisconsin-based Lamplight Farms, denounced the white nationalists in a Facebook post on Aug. 12. \"We do not support their message or the use of our products in this way,\" it said. \"Our products are designed to enhance backyard gatherings and to help family and friends connect with each other at home in their yard.\" Mark Werner, vice president of marketing at Lamplight Farms, issued an addendum to the statement that read: \"The feedback that we have received from the public regarding our earlier statement has been very positive. We will continue to reinforce that Tiki Brand products are to be enjoyed by friends and family outdoors in a loving environment.\" Andrew D. Gilman, who has consulted with companies like Johnson & Johnson, General Motors and Pepsi during crises, described Tiki as essentially \"minding its own business\" when it found itself caught up in the Charlottesville demonstrations. \"You hope that people are rational enough not to blame the innocent with the association that others are taking for it,\" Mr. Gilman said. As the controversy surrounding Tiki Brand's involvement in the Charlottesville protests continues to unfold, experts are weighing in on the implications of the situation. \"This is a classic case of brand hijacking,\" said marketing strategist, Michael Solomon. \"The white nationalists are using Tiki Brand's products to promote their hateful message, and in doing so, they are associating the brand with their ideology.\"\n\nSolomon noted that brand hijacking can have severe consequences for a company's reputation and bottom line. \"When a brand is associated with a controversial or harmful message, it can damage their brand equity and lead to a loss of customer loyalty and trust,\" he explained.\n\nTiki Brand's situation is particularly challenging because of its long history of producing products for family gatherings and outdoor events. \"The company has built its reputation on creating products that bring people together, not tear them apart,\" said Solomon. \"Now, they are faced with the difficult task of distancing themselves from the white nationalists and reasserting their brand values.\"\n\nIn addition to the reputational damage, Tiki Brand may also face legal consequences for its association with the white nationalists. \"The company may be held liable for the harm caused by the white nationalists' actions, even if they did not intentionally support their message,\" said civil rights attorney, Rachel Goodman.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Tiki Brand is taking steps to address the situation. The company has released a series of statements condemning the white nationalists and reaffirming its commitment to promoting love and unity. \"We are committed to being a force for good in the world and to using our products to bring people together, not tear them apart,\" said Mark Werner, vice president of marketing at Lamplight Farms.\n\nAs the dust settles on the Charlottesville protests, Tiki Brand is left to navigate the complex and sensitive issue of brand hijacking.

Over the past couple months, rather oddly, the market had moved towards pricing in an interest rate rise for later this year. While the employment news has been good, little else suggests the economy is in need of slowing. Yet, whereas at the start of December last year the market was suggesting little more than a 50:50 chance of a rate rise by October, now the market is fully in pricing in a rise to 1.75% by November, and another rise to 2% by the middle of next year:\nAs I have noted in the past, the financial markets have been much more eager to see a rate rise coming than the Reserve Bank has been to indicate such a rise is actually about to occur. And the latest inflation figures do little to suggest a rise is coming. In the December quarter, the ABS estimates that prices across the nation rose by 0.6%, and annually just 1.9% â€“ making it the fourth calendar year in a row for inflation to grow by an amount below the lower bound of the RBA's inflation target of 2% to 3%. Despite the market's expectations, the Reserve Bank is likely to remain cautious in its monetary policy decisions, given the subdued inflationary pressures. The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that the country's inflation rate has been stuck in a low-growth phase, with prices rising by just 1.9% over the past year.\n\nThe RBA has been keeping a close eye on inflation, as it is a key indicator of the economy's overall health. The central bank has been using its monetary policy tools to stimulate the economy, including cutting interest rates to historic lows. However, with inflation remaining below target, the RBA may be hesitant to raise interest rates, as this could have a negative impact on economic growth.\n\nInstead, the RBA may choose to focus on other indicators, such as employment and GDP growth, to gauge the economy's performance. The latest employment figures have been strong, with the unemployment rate falling to 5.1%. This suggests that the economy is still growing, and the RBA may not feel the need to intervene with interest rates.\n\nThe market's expectations of a rate rise may also be influenced by other factors, such as global economic trends and the performance of the Australian dollar. The dollar has been under pressure in recent months, falling to its lowest level against the US dollar in over two years. This could be contributing to the market's expectations of a rate rise, as a weaker dollar can make exports more competitive and boost economic growth.\n\nHowever, the RBA is likely to take a more measured approach, considering the risks and uncertainties associated with raising interest rates. The central bank has been cautious in its monetary policy decisions in recent years, and it is likely to continue to prioritize stability and growth over inflation concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the latest inflation figures suggest that the RBA is unlikely to raise interest rates in the near future. The market's expectations of a rate rise may be influenced by other factors, but the RBA is likely to remain cautious and focus on other indicators of the economy's performance. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor inflation and other economic indicators, and make adjustments to monetary policy as necessary to promote economic growth and stability.",

The number of people in work fell by 56,000 during the three months to October to stand at just over 32 million â€“ the steepest drop since mid-2015. It also followed a smaller fall of 14,000 in the three months to September. A \"Brexodus\" appears to be getting under way as net migration fell by 106,000 to 230,000 in the 12 months to June. In part this is because of the fall in the pound which lowers take-home earnings. The flow of migrants into the UK, who grease the wheels of the labour market, is now at its lowest level since records began. By that I mean they make the UK economy more flexible and able to respond more quickly to changes in demand. The decline in net migration is expected to have significant implications for the UK's labor market and economy. According to Professor Blanchflower, the reduction in migrant workers will lead to a shortage of skilled labor, particularly in industries such as healthcare and technology.\n\n\"This is a major concern for the UK's economic prospects,\" said Professor Blanchflower. \"Migrant workers have been a vital component of the UK's labor market, filling skills gaps and providing a flexible workforce. Without them, businesses will struggle to find the talent they need to operate efficiently.\"\n\nThe impact of the \"Brexodus\" is already being felt in certain industries. For example, the National Health Service (NHS) is facing a shortage of doctors and nurses, which is putting pressure on hospital services. Similarly, the technology sector is struggling to find enough skilled workers to meet demand.\n\nThe decline in migrant workers is also expected to have a knock-on effect on the wider economy. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK's productivity growth has been slowing in recent years, and the reduction in migrant workers is likely to exacerbate this trend.\n\n\"Migrant workers have been a key driver of productivity growth in the UK,\" said Professor Blanchflower. \"Their skills and expertise have helped to drive innovation and entrepreneurship, which is essential for the UK's economic competitiveness.\"\n\nIn response to the decline in migrant workers, the government has announced plans to increase funding for vocational training programs and to encourage more British citizens to take up apprenticeships. However, Professor Blanchflower believes that these measures will not be enough to mitigate the impact of the \"Brexodus\".\n\n\"The government needs to take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the shortage of skilled labor,\" said Professor Blanchflower. \"This includes increasing funding for education and training programs, as well as providing more opportunities for migrant workers to settle in the UK long-term.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in migrant workers is a major concern for the UK's labor market and economy. The reduction in skilled labor is likely to have significant implications for industries such as healthcare and technology, and will also exacerbate the trend of slowing productivity growth. To mitigate the impact of the \"Brexodus\", the government needs to take a more comprehensive approach to addressing the shortage of skilled labor.",

That's why the owners of Lora DiCarlo, a start-up based in Oregon, were gobsmacked in October when they were told that their hands-free personal massager, the Ose, would win an Innovation Award in the robotics and drones category -- only to learn weeks later that the decision had been reversed. In an open letter that spurred an outcry when it was published on the first day of the conference in January, the company's founder and chief executive, Lora Haddock, accused the show of sexism and stifling innovation. In initially rescinding the award, the organization that sponsors the show, the Consumer Technology Association, had cited a clause in the awards' terms and conditions that disqualified products deemed \"immoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA's image.\" The controversy surrounding the Ose's award sparked a heated debate about the boundaries of innovation and the role of consumer electronics in society. Critics argued that the show's decision to rescind the award was a clear example of sexism, as the Ose was specifically designed for women and gender-nonconforming individuals, and the show's reluctance to recognize its innovation was a reflection of the industry's lack of understanding and acceptance of diverse sexualities.\n\nThe Consumer Technology Association (CTA) initially stood by its decision, citing the terms and conditions of the award, which stated that the product must be \"family-friendly\" and \"not indecent.\" However, as the backlash grew, the organization was forced to reconsider its stance. After an internal review, the CTA announced that it would reinstate the Ose's award, citing the product's innovative design and functionality.\n\nThe decision was met with widespread relief and celebration from the LGBTQ+ community and women's rights advocates, who saw the reinstatement as a victory for inclusivity and diversity. \"This is a huge step forward for the tech industry,\" said Haddock, the founder and CEO of Lora DiCarlo. \"It shows that innovation knows no bounds, and that products designed for women and gender-nonconforming individuals are just as deserving of recognition as any other.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Ose's award has also sparked a wider conversation about the role of sex and sexuality in the tech industry. Many have argued that the industry's reluctance to address issues of sexuality and gender is a reflection of its lack of diversity and inclusion. \"The tech industry has a long way to go when it comes to understanding and accepting diverse sexualities,\" said Dr. Lisa Diamond, a leading expert on sexuality and gender. \"The Ose's award is a small step in the right direction, but we need to continue to push for greater inclusivity and representation in the industry.\"\n\nAs the tech industry continues to evolve and grow, it is clear that the Ose's award is just the beginning of a larger conversation about the role of sex and sexuality in innovation. The controversy has sparked a renewed focus on diversity and inclusion, and it is likely that we will see more products and innovations designed specifically for women and gender-nonconforming individuals in the years to come.",

        "Text": "University marketers are in the spotlight more than ever before. Increasingly, their organisations rely on them to drive higher numbers of student applications â€“ especially to MBAs and business-oriented courses â€“ as well as attracting research funding, joint venture investment and corporate partnerships. A key element in achieving that is a strong brand identity. Yet it can be hard to explain to colleagues in senior management and finance why they should invest in this rather than another ad campaign or event. They produce demonstrable return, while the commercial benefits of a strong brand are far more difficult to articulate. But as funds become ever scarcer and competition increases, good marketing will become more critical. Here are five ideas to help universities build their brand. Check out the numbers Brand identity is a nebulous concept, but there are quantifiable success stories. In the past two years we have been working closely with Imperial College Business School, helping position it as the academic institution that means intelligent business. By leveraging its reputation as a hub for innovative thinking and entrepreneurial spirit, Imperial College Business School has seen a significant increase in applications to its MBA program. In fact, the school has reported a 25% rise in applications since the rebranding effort began, with a notable increase in students from top-tier companies such as Google, Amazon, and McKinsey.\n\nSo, what made this rebranding effort so successful? According to our research, it was a combination of factors. Firstly, the school's marketing team worked closely with faculty members to develop a unique value proposition that resonated with potential students. This involved highlighting Imperial College Business School's strengths in areas such as data science, fintech, and sustainability, and showcasing the school's faculty expertise in these fields.\n\nSecondly, the team created a range of engaging marketing materials, including videos, social media campaigns, and targeted email marketing. These materials were designed to speak directly to the target audience, showcasing the school's research opportunities, industry connections, and alumni success stories.\n\nThirdly, the school invested in a series of events and webinars that brought together industry leaders, academics, and students. These events provided a platform for networking, idea-sharing, and thought leadership, helping to establish Imperial College Business School as a hub for business innovation.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Not only has the school seen a significant increase in applications, but it has also reported a 30% increase in research funding and a 25% increase in corporate partnerships. These partnerships have led to a range of collaborative projects, including a fintech incubator and a sustainability research center.\n\nSo, what can other universities learn from Imperial College Business School's success? Firstly, it's essential to develop a clear and compelling value proposition that sets your institution apart from others. This involves understanding your target audience and highlighting your unique strengths and differentiators.\n\nSecondly, invest in high-quality marketing materials that showcase your institution's research, faculty expertise, and industry connections. This can include videos, social media campaigns, and targeted email marketing.\n\nThirdly, create opportunities for networking and idea-sharing through events and webinars. This can help establish your institution as a hub for business innovation and thought leadership.\n\nFinally, track and measure the success of your marketing efforts, using data to inform your strategy and make adjustments as needed. By following these best practices, universities can build a strong brand identity that drives student applications, research funding, and corporate partnerships.",

        "Text": "An escalation of protectionist measures could spark a fresh downturn just as the global economy is picking itself up after the last one, the international body that represents the world's central banks has warned. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said there were already signs that \"the ratcheting up of rhetoric\" was weighing on investment. It comes as Donald Trump steps up hostility with some of the US's key trading partners and allies, raising fears of a full-blown trade war. The BIS, often referred to as the \"central bank of central banks,\" cautioned that the increasing tensions between the US and its trading partners could have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In its latest quarterly report, the organization noted that the escalation of protectionist measures could lead to a decline in international trade, reduced investment, and a slowdown in economic growth.\n\nThe warning comes as the global economy is still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, which was triggered in part by a surge in protectionist policies. The BIS emphasized that the current situation is different, as the global economy is now more interconnected and interdependent than ever before.\n\n\"The world is more integrated today than it was during the Great Depression, and the consequences of a trade war would be felt far beyond the countries directly involved,\" said Claudio Borio, the BIS's chief economist. \"We urge policymakers to exercise caution and consider the potential long-term consequences of their actions.\"\n\nThe BIS's warning is not limited to the US, as other major economies such as the European Union, China, and Japan are also taking steps to protect their own industries. The organization cautioned that a full-blown trade war could lead to a decline in global trade, which could have devastating consequences for many countries.\n\nIn addition to the economic risks, the BIS also highlighted the potential social and political implications of a trade war. \"A trade war would not only harm economic growth, but also exacerbate social and political tensions,\" said Borio. \"It would be a major setback for global cooperation and stability.\"\n\nThe BIS's warning has been echoed by other international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The IMF has warned that a trade war could lead to a global recession, while the WTO has cautioned that a trade war would be a \"lose-lose\" situation for all parties involved.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, many economists and policymakers are urging caution and calling for a diplomatic solution to the trade tensions. The BIS's warning serves as a reminder of the potential risks and consequences of a trade war, and the importance of finding a peaceful resolution to the current tensions.",

        "Text": "A big week in parliament for the Jacob Rees-Mogg committee (formerly known as the Treasury select committee), which will again be grilling one of its favourite targets: economic forecasters. First up on Tuesday comes Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which last Thursday said that Brexit really means British workers facing the longest pay squeeze in 70 years. The following day will see Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, whose organisation also had a run-out last week, when it predicted the UK economy would slow next year and inflation would rise. None of which is likely to have gone down terribly well with Rees-Mogg, the flag-bearer of the Tories' Eurosceptic wing, who has shot to fame this year by baiting Bank of England governor Mark Carney as a Remainer. To say that the Rees-Mogg demeanour tends towards the traditional is to recklessly underplay the situation, although even his critics concede his entertainment value. The old Etonian former fund manager was once accused of going to bed in double-breasted pyjamas and, at the 1997 general election, stood as the Tory candidate for the solidly Labour seat of Central Fife. He attracted ridicule â€“ by canvassing with his nanny. A philosophical take on the trials of Topps Tiles \"Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.\" As the committee prepares to grill the economic forecasters, many are wondering what Rees-Mogg's motives are behind this latest inquiry. Some speculate that he is trying to discredit the forecasts in order to justify the government's handling of the economy, while others believe that he is genuinely concerned about the impact of Brexit on British workers.\n\nRegardless of his motivations, it is clear that the committee's inquiry will be a closely watched event. The Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Office for Budget Responsibility are two of the most respected economic think tanks in the country, and their predictions carry significant weight.\n\nJohnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is expected to face tough questioning from Rees-Mogg and his committee members. The institute's latest report warned that Brexit could lead to a prolonged period of economic stagnation, with British workers facing the longest pay squeeze in 70 years.\n\nChote, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, is also expected to be grilled by the committee. His organization's latest forecast predicted that the UK economy would slow next year and inflation would rise, which could have significant implications for the government's budget.\n\nRees-Mogg has a reputation for being a formidable interrogator, and many are expecting a lively debate on Tuesday and Wednesday. Despite his reputation, however, some economists believe that the committee's inquiry is a necessary step in holding the government accountable for its economic policies.\n\n\"It's important that the government is held to account for its economic decisions,\" said Dr. Emma Hardy, an economist at the University of Cambridge. \"The committee's inquiry is an opportunity for the government to be questioned about its policies and for the public to be informed about the potential impact of Brexit on the economy.\"\n\nAs the committee prepares to grill the economic forecasters, one thing is clear: the stakes are high and the debate is likely to be intense. With Rees-Mogg at the helm, it's sure to be a lively and entertaining affair, but ultimately, the goal is to provide clarity and insight into the complex and uncertain world of economics.",

        "Text": "What Britain needs is another museum. No, really. Amid all the hand-wringing about whether Britain's economic destiny lies in or out of the European Union, there is a clear need for a place to visit that can help people discover how money works. A Brexit deal may have been passed and this election will be a distant memory whenever the museum opens its doors, but with financial education at such a low ebb, a centre that facilitates the discussion of modern-day market capitalism (and its alternatives) must be worth the relatively small outlay. It could be called a Money Museum or a Centre for Understanding Economics, but whatever its name, there is a value in such an institution and it's a value that other nations understand. In Paris, the French recently opened the CitÃ© de l'Ã‰conomie, or CitÃ©co. The CitÃ©co, located in the heart of Paris, is a 4,500-square-meter space that offers an immersive experience for visitors of all ages. The museum's interactive exhibits and displays aim to demystify the world of economics, making it accessible to everyone. From the history of money to the global financial crisis, the CitÃ©co covers a wide range of topics in an engaging and entertaining way.\n\nSimilarly, a Money Museum or Centre for Understanding Economics in Britain could serve as a hub for financial education, providing a unique platform for people to learn about the economy and its impact on their daily lives. The museum could feature interactive exhibits, workshops, and lectures that explore topics such as personal finance, entrepreneurship, and economic policy.\n\nIn addition to its educational value, a Money Museum could also serve as a cultural institution, hosting events and exhibitions that showcase the history of money and its role in shaping society. For example, the museum could feature a collection of rare and historic coins, banknotes, and other financial artifacts, providing a fascinating glimpse into the past.\n\nMoreover, a Money Museum could play a significant role in promoting financial literacy, particularly among young people. By providing interactive and engaging experiences, the museum could help students develop a better understanding of personal finance, entrepreneurship, and economic concepts, empowering them to make informed decisions about their financial futures.\n\nThe benefits of a Money Museum or Centre for Understanding Economics extend beyond its educational and cultural value. It could also serve as a symbol of Britain's commitment to financial education and economic literacy, demonstrating its willingness to invest in the future of its citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, a Money Museum or Centre for Understanding Economics is an idea whose time has come. With the increasing complexity of the global economy and the growing importance of financial literacy, such an institution would be a valuable addition to Britain's cultural and educational landscape. By providing a unique platform for financial education and cultural exploration, the museum could play a significant role in promoting economic understanding and literacy, ultimately contributing to the well-being and prosperity of British society.",

        "Text": "Labour is launching a last-ditch bid to stop MPs rubber-stamping the transfer of higher education regulatory powers to the controversial Office for Students. The new universities watchdog was at the centre of a row earlier this year when the rightwing commentator Toby Young stepped down from its board following anger over offensive tweets he had posted. Labour will use a procedural device in the Commons on Monday night to force one final debate and vote on the Office for Students (OfS), which is an important part of the government's market-oriented higher education policy. If the government were to lose the vote, the watchdog would no longer have key powers enabling it regulate universities. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, accused the government of ignoring concerns from students about the cost of living and rising debt because ministers were preoccupied with creating an institution that they could dominate. The opposition party's move comes as a surprise to many, as the government had been expected to easily pass the legislation through Parliament without much resistance. However, Labour's decision to force a debate and vote on the issue has sparked a heated debate among MPs and education experts.\n\nThe Office for Students was established in 2018 as part of the government's plans to increase competition and choice in the higher education sector. The watchdog was given powers to regulate universities, including the ability to impose fines and penalties on institutions that failed to meet certain standards.\n\nHowever, the OfS has faced criticism from many quarters, including students, academics, and rival universities. Critics have argued that the watchdog is too focused on market principles and is not doing enough to protect the interests of students.\n\nLabour's decision to challenge the government's plans has been welcomed by many in the education sector. \"This is a crucial moment for the future of higher education in this country,\" said Professor James Johnson, a leading expert on education policy. \"The Office for Students has been a disaster, and it's time for the government to listen to the concerns of students and academics.\"\n\nThe government, however, has rejected Labour's claims, insisting that the OfS is necessary to ensure that universities are held accountable for their actions. \"The Office for Students is a vital part of our plans to improve the quality of higher education in this country,\" said a spokesperson for the Department for Education. \"We will not be swayed by Labour's attempts to delay or block this important legislation.\"\n\nThe debate and vote on the Office for Students is set to take place on Monday night, and the outcome is far from certain. If Labour is successful in forcing a defeat for the government, it could have significant implications for the future of higher education in the UK.\n\nIn the meantime, students and academics are eagerly waiting to see how the situation will unfold. \"This is a critical moment for our future,\" said Emily Wilson, a student at a UK university. \"We need to make sure that our voices are heard and that our interests are protected.\"\n\nThe fate of the Office for Students hangs in the balance, and the outcome of the vote on Monday night will be closely watched by all those with an interest in higher education. Will the government be able to push through its plans, or will Labour's challenge succeed in blocking the transfer of regulatory powers? Only time will tell.",

Now Washington is catching up. On Wednesday, the nation's agencies that build civilian rockets and nuclear arms sealed an agreement to start working together on planetary defense. The goal is to learn how to better deflect comets and asteroids that might endanger cities and, in the case of very large intruders, the planet as a whole. \"Often, these agencies focus on their own pieces of the puzzle, so anything that brings them together is a good thing,\" said Bruce Betts, director of science and technology at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit group that promotes space exploration. Comets and asteroids are part of the cosmic rubble left over from the birth of the solar system. Comets, made of dirty ice, visit Earth's neighborhood only when knocked loose from their home orbits beyond Pluto. That makes their movement somewhat unpredictable. The agreement, signed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), marks a significant step forward in the United States' efforts to defend against the threat of near-Earth objects (NEOs). According to officials, the collaboration will focus on developing new technologies and strategies to detect and deflect potentially hazardous asteroids and comets.\n\nThe Planetary Society's Betts emphasized that the agreement is a crucial first step in addressing the challenge posed by NEOs. \"By working together, we can pool our resources and expertise to better understand the threat and develop effective solutions,\" he said. \"It's a complex problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach.\"\n\nThe FAA will play a key role in the partnership, providing expertise in rocket technology and navigation. The NNSA and the Department of Energy will contribute their knowledge of nuclear physics and propulsion systems. The collaboration will also involve scientists and engineers from universities and research institutions across the country.\n\nOne of the primary goals of the partnership is to develop a system for detecting and tracking NEOs. Currently, the United States relies on a network of ground-based telescopes and spacecraft to detect and track NEOs, but the system is limited by its reliance on existing technology.\n\n\"We need to develop new technologies and strategies to detect and track NEOs more effectively,\" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, a planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"The agreement is a critical step in achieving that goal.\"\n\nThe partnership will also focus on developing techniques for deflecting NEOs that are on a collision course with Earth. One potential approach is to use nuclear explosions to alter the trajectory of an asteroid or comet. Another option is to use a spacecraft to physically deflect the object.\n\nWhile the threat of NEOs is real, officials emphasize that the chances of a catastrophic impact are low. However, the potential consequences of such an event are so severe that it is essential to take proactive steps to prepare and defend against the threat.\n\nThe agreement is the latest development in the United States' efforts to address the threat of NEOs. In recent years, NASA has launched several missions to detect and track NEOs, including the Near-Earth Object Surveillance System (NEOSS) and the OSIRIS-REx mission, which is currently exploring the asteroid Bennu.\n\nThe collaboration between the FAA, NNSA, and the Department of Energy is expected to lead to significant advancements in the field of planetary defense. As the threat of NEOs continues to evolve, the partnership will play a critical role in ensuring the safety and security of the United States and the world.",

Born without fingers on his left hand, Dawson struggled to perform even the simplest tasks, like tying his shoes or holding a ball. \"God made you special in this way,\" his parents told him. But by age 5, Dawson was demanding tearfully to know why. The Rivermans, of Forest Grove, Ore., could not afford a high-tech prosthetic hand for their son, and in any event they are rarely made for children. Then help arrived in the guise of a stranger with a three-dimensional printer. He made a prosthetic hand for Dawson, in cobalt blue and black, and it did not cost his family a thing. Now the 13-year-old can ride a bike and hold a baseball bat. He hopes to play goalkeeper on his soccer team. The proliferation of 3-D printers has had an unexpected benefit: The devices, it turns out, are perfect for creating cheap prosthetics. Surprising numbers of children need them: One in 1,000 infants is born with missing fingers, and others lose fingers and hands to injury. Each year, about 450 children receive amputations as a result of lawn mower accidents, according to a study in Pedatrics. The Impact of 3D Printing on Prosthetic Technology\n\nThe story of Dawson Riverman, a 13-year-old boy from Forest Grove, Oregon, is a testament to the power of innovation and technology. Born without fingers on his left hand, Dawson struggled to perform everyday tasks, but thanks to a stranger with a 3D printer, he now has a prosthetic hand that has changed his life.\n\nThe proliferation of 3D printing has led to a surge in the creation of affordable prosthetics, providing a lifeline for children born with missing fingers or who have lost them due to injury. According to a study published in Pediatrics, one in 1,000 infants is born with missing fingers, and approximately 450 children receive amputations each year as a result of lawn mower accidents.\n\nTraditionally, prosthetic limbs have been expensive and often out of reach for low-income families. However, 3D printing has democratized access to prosthetic technology, making it possible for individuals like Dawson to receive custom-made prosthetics at little to no cost.\n\nThe benefits of 3D-printed prosthetics extend beyond affordability. These devices can be designed and printed quickly, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration. This enables clinicians and researchers to test and refine prosthetic designs, ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients.\n\nThe impact of 3D printing on prosthetic technology is not limited to children. Adults with missing fingers or hands can also benefit from custom-made prosthetics, which can improve their quality of life and independence.\n\nAs the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative applications of 3D printing in the field of prosthetics. With the potential to revolutionize the way we approach prosthetic care, 3D printing is poised to make a significant difference in the lives of individuals around the world.\n\nIn the meantime, Dawson Riverman is enjoying the freedom and confidence that comes with his new prosthetic hand. He is excited to continue playing soccer and exploring new activities, and his family is grateful for the stranger who brought them together with the power of 3D printing.\n\nThe story of Dawson Riverman serves as a reminder of the transformative power of technology and the importance of innovation in improving the lives of others. As we look to the future, it is clear that 3D printing will play a critical role in shaping the future of prosthetic technology and the lives of those who depend on it.",

The sun's corona seemed to stretch out, as if trying to grasp the stars and planets that were suddenly visible. \"I had expected it was going to look like nighttime,\" said Susana Martinez-Conde, a neuroscientist who studies visual illusions at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, and who watched the eclipse at the Greenville Zoo in South Carolina. As the moon continued its journey across the face of the sun, the crowd at the Greenville Zoo erupted in a collective \"wow.\" The sudden appearance of stars and planets, normally invisible during the day, was a breathtaking sight. Martinez-Conde, who had spent years studying the effects of visual illusions on the human brain, was thrilled to experience the phenomenon firsthand.\n\n\"I've seen simulations and animations, but nothing compares to the real thing,\" she said, her eyes still fixed on the sky. \"The way the stars and planets seem to pop into view, it's like a switch has been flipped.

Scientists and astronomers from around the world had traveled to the affected areas to study the phenomenon, which occurs when the moon passes directly between the Earth and the sun.\n\nAs the eclipse reached its peak, the temperature dropped significantly, and the air was filled with an eerie, otherworldly silence. The only sounds were the occasional cheers and gasps from the crowd, and the distant chirping of birds, which seemed to be the only creatures unaffected by the sudden change in the environment.\n\nFor many, the eclipse was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \"I've been waiting for this my whole life,\" said Emily Wilson, a 35-year-old teacher from Greenville. \"I remember watching the eclipse in 1979 with my grandfather, and I've been counting down the years until the next one.

        "Text": "The world's major oil producers have extended production cuts through to the end of 2018, in a bid to tackle a global glut of crude and keep prices buoyant. Members of Opec, the oil cartel, and other major producers including Russia agreed that the curbs, which started in January and have lifted a barrel of Brent crude from $40 to $50 last year to more than $60 now, will continue for a further nine-months. Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said the extension of the current cuts â€“ which expire at the end of March 2018 â€“ was necessary because \"more work needed to be done\". Following the deal at a meeting in Vienna which ministers hailed as historic and unprecedented, the price of Brent stood at $63.28 a barrel, up 0.27% on the day. Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, said: \"To reach our goals, to rebalance the market, we must continue to act in a coordinated fashion, to act jointly, which would take us further in 2018 [with cuts].\" Despite suggestions ahead of the meeting that the Saudis and Russians were at odds over the extension, Falih said of his Russian counterpart: \"You cannot find light between us. We have been united shoulder to shoulder ... We are completely aligned.\" The agreement comes as the global oil market continues to grapple with an oversupply of crude, which has led to a significant drop in prices over the past few years. The extension of the production cuts is seen as a crucial step in rebalancing the market and stabilizing prices.\n\nThe deal is expected to have a significant impact on the global oil market, with many analysts predicting that prices will continue to rise in the coming months. The price of Brent crude, which has been trading at around $60 a barrel, is expected to reach $70 or even $80 a barrel by the end of the year.\n\nThe extension of the production cuts is also seen as a major victory for Saudi Arabia, which has been pushing for a longer-term agreement to stabilize the market. The kingdom, which is the world's largest oil producer, has been under pressure to increase its production to meet growing demand, but has instead opted to maintain its current level of production.\n\nRussia, which is the world's second-largest oil producer, has also been a key player in the negotiations. The country has been pushing for a longer-term agreement, but has also been keen to ensure that its own production levels are not reduced too significantly.\n\nThe agreement is seen as a major boost for the global economy, which has been heavily reliant on low oil prices to stimulate growth. The extension of the production cuts is expected to have a positive impact on inflation, which has been rising in recent months, and is also expected to boost economic growth.\n\nHowever, the agreement is not without its challenges. The extension of the production cuts is likely to lead to higher prices at the pump, which could have a negative impact on consumers. The deal is also likely to lead to increased tensions between oil-producing countries, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which have been at odds over the production cuts.\n\nDespite these challenges, the agreement is seen as a major step forward in stabilizing the global oil market. The extension of the production cuts is expected to have a positive impact on the global economy, and is likely to be a major factor in shaping the future of the oil industry.\n\nIn a statement, the International Energy Agency (IEA) welcomed the agreement, saying that it would help to rebalance the global oil market and stabilize prices. The IEA also warned that the extension of the production cuts would lead to higher prices at the pump, and urged consumers to be prepared for the impact.\n\nThe agreement is also expected to have a significant impact on the global oil industry, with many companies likely to benefit from the higher prices. The extension of the production cuts is expected to lead to increased investment in the oil sector, which could have a positive impact on the global economy.\n\nOverall, the agreement is seen as a major step forward in stabilizing the global oil market, and is likely to have a significant impact on the global economy. The extension of the production cuts is expected to lead to higher prices at the pump, but is also expected to have a positive impact on the global economy and the oil industry.",

The New York-based firm, whose celebrity fans include David Beckham and Hugh Jackman, has filed documents that reveal a plan to raise $500m on the Nasdaq stock market, and losses that jumped to $195m from $48m a year before. Peloton will be the latest of a string of loss-making tech \"unicorns\" to burst on to the market this year, including the ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber, the scrapbook site Pinterest and the workplace messaging service Slack. The company, founded in 2012 by John Foley, a former executive at the book chain Barnes & Noble, was valued at $4bn last summer after raising $550m from investors led by the private equity firm TCV, which has previously backed Netflix, Spotify and Facebook. Peloton lets spin class fans work out in a gym or at home using a Â£2,000 bike or treadmill fitted with a screen on which subscribers can livestream or download classes. It launched in the UK and Canada last year and has confirmed plans to enter Germany this year. Subscribers in the UK pay Â£39 a month for access to the online classes. The classes are filmed at the company's Manhattan or London studios and spinners can interact with instructors and other Peloton members. The company's decision to go public comes as the fitness industry is experiencing a surge in popularity, driven by the growing trend of health-conscious consumers seeking convenient and engaging ways to stay active. Peloton's unique approach to fitness, which combines high-tech equipment with live and on-demand classes, has resonated with consumers and helped the company to attract a loyal following.\n\nDespite the company's losses, investors are optimistic about Peloton's potential for growth, citing its strong brand recognition, loyal customer base, and expanding global reach. The company's plans to enter new markets, including Germany, are seen as a key driver of growth, and its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences is expected to be a major factor in its success.\n\nHowever, some analysts have raised concerns about the company's high operating costs, which have been driven by its rapid expansion and investments in marketing and technology. Peloton has also faced criticism for its high prices, with some critics arguing that its products are too expensive for many consumers.\n\nDespite these challenges, Peloton's management team is confident in the company's ability to achieve profitability in the near future. In a statement, CEO John Foley said, \"We are excited to take this next step in our journey and to continue to bring our innovative approach to fitness to consumers around the world. We believe that our unique combination of high-quality content, engaging classes, and user-friendly technology will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company.\"\n\nThe company's IPO is expected to be one of the most highly anticipated in the tech industry this year, and is likely to attract significant attention from investors and the media. As Peloton prepares to go public, it will be closely watched to see whether it can achieve the same level of success as other high-profile tech companies that have recently gone public, including Lyft and Uber.",

        "Text": "You know how it is: Every Black Friday, you are bombarded with lousy shopping deals that do not offer as much of a discount on an item as you think. But there is a bright spot: If you are shopping for a television, it really is the best time to buy one. To stoke sales, electronics manufacturers typically slash prices of popular TV sets during Black Friday to the lowest all year. This week, you will be able to buy high-quality televisions for $500 to $1,500 after discounts of 15 percent to 30 percent. That's a deal considering that typically, many TVs in the $500 range are just O.K. and high-end sets cost upward of $2,000. But as always, there will be duds to watch out for. Many TV brands take this opportunity to sell sets with exaggerated features that have subpar picture quality. But amidst the sea of discounted TVs, there are some genuine bargains to be found. To help you navigate the chaos, we've scoured the market to identify the best Black Friday TV deals that offer a combination of quality, features, and value.\n\nOne of the top contenders is the 55-inch TCL 5-Series, which typically retails for $1,000 but will be available for $800 on Black Friday.

While it may not have all the bells and whistles of its more expensive counterparts, this 1080p TV still offers a crisp picture and decent sound quality.\n\nHowever, not all TVs are created equal. As mentioned earlier, some manufacturers may take advantage of Black Friday to sell subpar sets with exaggerated features. To avoid getting stuck with a dud, be sure to do your research and read reviews from reputable sources before making a purchase.\n\nAdditionally, keep an eye out for any additional perks that may come with your TV purchase, such as free shipping, extended warranties, or bundled deals on accessories.

        "Text": "A man who was paralysed from below the neck after crashing his bike into a truck can once again drink a cup of coffee and eat mashed potato with a fork, after a world-first procedure to allow him to control his hand with the power of thought. Bill Kochevar, 53, has had electrical implants in the motor cortex of his brain and sensors inserted in his forearm, which allow the muscles of his arm and hand to be stimulated in response to signals from his brain, decoded by computer. After eight years, he is able to drink and feed himself without assistance. \"I think about what I want to do and the system does it for me,\" Kochevar told the Guardian. \"It's not a lot of thinking about it. When I want to do something, my brain does what it does.\" The breakthrough procedure, developed by researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, has given Kochevar a new lease on life. The implantable system, known as the BrainGate2, has allowed him to regain control over his hand and arm, enabling him to perform daily tasks that were previously impossible.\n\nKochevar, a former engineer, was involved in a serious bike accident in 2007 that left him with a spinal cord injury, rendering him unable to move his arms or legs below the neck. Despite his disability, he remained determined to regain his independence and was eager to participate in the clinical trial for the BrainGate2 system.\n\nThe procedure, which was performed in 2012, involved the implantation of a small sensor array in Kochevar's brain, which detected electrical signals generated by his brain activity. These signals were then decoded by a computer and transmitted to a small electrical stimulator implanted in his forearm, which stimulated the muscles to move.\n\nAt first, Kochevar was able to control his hand to a limited extent, but with time and practice, he was able to refine his skills and perform more complex tasks. Today, he is able to drink a cup of coffee, eat mashed potatoes with a fork, and even play simple video games.\n\nThe success of the BrainGate2 system has far-reaching implications for people with paralysis and other motor disorders. \"This is a major breakthrough in the field of neuroprosthetics,\" said Dr. Ali Rezai, the director of the Center for Neurological Restoration at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, who led the research team. \"We are excited about the potential for this technology to improve the lives of people with paralysis and other motor disorders.\"\n\nKochevar's story has inspired hope and optimism for those affected by paralysis. \"I'm just grateful to be able to do things on my own again,\" he said. \"It's amazing to think about what the future might hold. I'm excited to see what other possibilities this technology might bring.\"\n\nThe BrainGate2 system is still in the experimental stage, but researchers are hopeful that it will eventually become a viable treatment option for people with paralysis. The next step is to refine the technology and make it more accessible to a wider range of people. With continued advancements in the field of neuroprosthetics, the possibilities for people with paralysis are endless.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The vast majority of videos removed from YouTube toward the end of last year for violating the site's content guidelines had first been detected by machines instead of humans, the Google-owned company said on Monday. YouTube said it took down 8.28 million videos during the fourth quarter of 2017, and about 80 percent of those videos had initially been flagged by artificially intelligent computer systems. The new data highlighted the significant role machines -- not just users, government agencies and other organizations -- are taking in policing the service as it faces increased scrutiny over the spread of conspiracy videos, fake news and violent content from extremist organizations. Those videos are sometimes promoted by YouTube's recommendation system and unknowingly financed by advertisers, whose ads are placed next to them through an automated system. The company's reliance on machine learning algorithms to identify and remove violating content has been a subject of debate among experts and users alike. While machines can process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, some have raised concerns that they may not be able to fully understand the nuances of human language and context, potentially leading to over- or under-removal of content.\n\nYouTube's reliance on machines to detect violating content has also raised questions about the role of human moderators in the content review process. The company has faced criticism in the past for its handling of controversial content, including videos that promote hate speech, violence, and extremism. In response to these concerns, YouTube has been working to increase the number of human moderators on its platform, with the goal of ensuring that content is reviewed and removed in a more timely and effective manner.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the spread of conspiracy theories, fake news, and violent content, YouTube has made significant strides in recent months to improve its content moderation policies and procedures. The company has introduced new guidelines for identifying and removing hate speech and extremist content, and has also expanded its efforts to promote authoritative sources of information and counter misinformation.\n\nIn addition to its content moderation efforts, YouTube has also been working to address the issue of ad placement on its platform. The company has faced criticism in the past for allowing ads to appear next to controversial or extremist content, and has taken steps to improve its ad review process and ensure that ads are only placed next to content that meets its community guidelines.\n\nYouTube's efforts to improve its content moderation and ad placement policies have been met with a mixed response from critics and experts. While some have praised the company's efforts to address the spread of conspiracy theories and fake news, others have expressed concerns that the company's reliance on machines may not be sufficient to fully address the complex issues posed by online content.\n\nAs the debate around YouTube's content moderation policies continues, the company remains committed to ensuring that its platform is a safe and trustworthy place for users to share and discover content. With its ongoing efforts to improve its content moderation and ad placement policies, YouTube is working to strike a balance between protecting its users and promoting free speech and expression online.",

Mr. Trichet made the comments a day after the central bank announced its continued support for struggling banks and entered the market to buy the bonds of debt-ridden countries. \"Since the start of the recovery, which in Europe was the third quarter of last year, the economy is going a little better quarter after quarter,\" Mr. Trichet said in Paris. A continued recovery hinges on the ability of countries to consolidate their budgets and to a restructuring of the real economy, he said. \"The euro is a credible currency,\" he added. \"The euro is a currency that is considered just as credible for the next 10 years as for the last 12 years.\" \"I don't say we should be complacent  things are still very difficult,\" he added. Mr. Trichet studiously avoided singling out specific countries to blame for the sovereign debt crisis, which emerged because of creeping indebtedness. However, Mr. Trichet did acknowledge that the crisis was a global phenomenon, and that the European Central Bank was working closely with other major central banks to address the issue. \"We are in close contact with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Japan to ensure a coordinated response to the crisis,\" he said.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the euro zone, Mr. Trichet remained optimistic about the region's ability to recover. \"The euro zone has a strong foundation, and we are confident that it will emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient,\" he said.\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Trichet also emphasized the importance of fiscal discipline and structural reforms in addressing the debt crisis. \"Countries must prioritize fiscal responsibility and implement structural reforms to boost competitiveness and growth,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trichet's comments came as the European Central Bank announced its latest measures to support the struggling banks and debt-ridden countries. The bank announced that it would continue to buy bonds of debt-ridden countries, and also offered to provide emergency loans to struggling banks.\n\nThe announcement was seen as a move to calm the markets and to reassure investors that the European Central Bank was committed to supporting the euro zone. The bank's actions were widely seen as a positive step, and the euro zone's financial markets responded positively to the news.\n\nIn the days ahead, the European Central Bank will continue to monitor the situation closely and will take further action if necessary to support the euro zone. Meanwhile, the international community will continue to watch the developments closely, hoping that the crisis will be resolved soon and that the euro zone will return to a path of sustainable growth and stability.",

        "Text": "The grocery industry watchdog is hoping to win new powers to oversee Amazon and Boots after receiving numerous complaints about their treatment of suppliers. Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator (GCA), already oversees 10 retailers including the big four supermarkets â€“ Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons â€“ and has the power to issue multi-million pound fines if suppliers are treated poorly. The competition watchdog is currently assessing a group of up to four additional retailers that could come under Tacon's remit from August, if it finds their grocery sales amount to Â£1bn or more. Amazon's shift into groceries, after buying Wholefoods Market and teaming up with Morrisons for its Amazon Fresh food home deliveries, is thought to have potentially put it within the GCA's sights, while Boots's sale of sandwiches and drinks as well as shampoo, toothpaste and suncream, may also put the health and beauty chain in the frame. Tacon said she was particularly keen to include those retailers that were treating suppliers poorly while competing directly with the 10 companies she currently oversees. Tacon's efforts to expand her remit come as the grocery industry faces growing concerns over the treatment of suppliers, with many small and medium-sized businesses struggling to compete with the dominance of the big four supermarkets.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Federation of Small Businesses, 62% of small businesses in the UK's food and drink industry reported experiencing difficulties in getting paid on time by larger retailers, while 45% reported being forced to accept unfair payment terms.\n\nThe GCA has received numerous complaints from suppliers about Amazon and Boots, including allegations of delayed payments, unfair contract terms, and a lack of transparency in business dealings.\n\nTacon has been vocal about her concerns over the impact of big retailers on the grocery supply chain, saying that she wants to ensure that all retailers, regardless of their size or business model, are held to the same standards.\n\n\"We need to make sure that all retailers, including those that are new to the market, are treating their suppliers fairly and transparently,\" Tacon said in an interview. \"We can't have a situation where some retailers are getting away with poor treatment of suppliers while others are held to a higher standard.\"\n\nThe GCA's expansion would also allow Tacon to oversee the growing number of online grocery retailers, including Ocado and online-only brands like HelloFresh and Mindful Chef.\n\nThe move has been welcomed by industry experts, who say that it would help to level the playing field for small and medium-sized businesses and promote a more sustainable and fair grocery supply chain.\n\n\"This is a major step forward for the grocery industry,\" said Andrew Griffiths, CEO of the Federation of Small Businesses. \"The GCA has been doing a great job of holding the big four supermarkets to account, and we're confident that they will be just as effective in overseeing Amazon and Boots.\"\n\nThe competition watchdog is expected to make a decision on which retailers will be included in the GCA's remit in the coming months.",

It will be the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft. As 2019 dawns on the East Coast of the United States, New Horizons will pass within about 2,200 miles of Ultima Thule, speeding at 31,500 m.p.h. \"It's on course, it's healthy, it's conducting observations as we speak and it's going to arrive on time,\" said S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for the mission, during a news conference on Monday afternoon. How do I watch the flyby? NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is set to make history on New Year's Day as it becomes the first spacecraft to fly by Ultima Thule, a mysterious and ancient object located in the distant Kuiper Belt. The flyby marks a significant milestone in the mission, which has been ongoing since 2006.\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft was launched on January 19, 2006, and has been traveling through space for over 13 years. After its historic flyby of Pluto in 2015, the spacecraft continued on its journey, entering the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies and other small celestial objects beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\nUltima Thule, also known as 2014 MU69, is a small, icy world that is believed to be a remnant from the early days of the solar system. It is thought to be a contact binary, meaning it is composed of two separate objects that are stuck together. The object is about 22 miles (35 kilometers) in diameter and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes it as close as 30 astronomical units (AU) from the sun and as far as 45 AU from the sun.\n\nDuring the flyby, the New Horizons spacecraft will gather data on Ultima Thule's composition, geology, and atmosphere. The spacecraft will use its seven instruments to collect information on the object's surface, including its color, texture, and temperature. The data will be transmitted back to Earth, where scientists will analyze it to learn more about Ultima Thule and its place in the solar system.\n\nThe flyby is expected to provide scientists with valuable insights into the early days of the solar system. Ultima Thule is believed to be one of the oldest and most pristine objects in the Kuiper Belt, making it a unique target for study. The data collected during the flyby will help scientists understand how the solar system formed and evolved over time.\n\nNASA officials are thrilled with the success of the mission so far. \"We're on track to make history on New Year's Day,\" said Dr. Stern. \"The spacecraft is performing flawlessly, and we're excited to see what we can learn from this flyby.\"\n\nFor those interested in following the flyby, NASA will be providing live coverage of the event on its website and social media channels. The spacecraft will pass within about 2,200 miles (3,540 kilometers) of Ultima Thule, and the flyby will be broadcast live from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nIn conclusion, NASA's New Horizons mission is set to make a historic flyby of Ultima Thule on New Year's Day, marking a significant milestone in the mission. The flyby is expected to provide scientists with valuable insights into the early days of the solar system and will be a major achievement for the New Horizons team.",

        "Text": "Cursive Seemed to Go the Way of Quills and Parchment. Now It's Coming Back. While cursive has been relegated to nearly extinct tasks like writing thank-you cards and signing checks, rumors of its death may be exaggerated. The Common Core standards seemed to spell the end of the writing style in 2010 when they dropped requirements that the skill be taught in public elementary schools, but about two dozen states have reintroduced the practice since then. Last year, elementary schools in Illinois were required to offer at least one class on cursive. Last month, a law went into effect in Ohio providing funding for materials to help students learn cursive by fifth grade. And beginning this fall, second graders in Texas will learn cursive, and will be required to know how to write it legibly by third grade. Even as keyboards and screens have supplanted pencil and paper in schools, lawmakers and defenders of cursive have lobbied to re-establish this old-school writing pedagogy across the country, igniting a debate about American values and identity and exposing intergenerational fault lines. When Anne Trubek, the author of \"The History and Uncertain Future of Handwriting,\" started studying the resurgence of cursive about a decade ago, reasons for teaching it focused on developing a civilized, well-mannered population. \"People were upset about the idea that you might not seem educated if you didn't know cursive,\" she said. But in recent years, the reasoning for cursive became associated with \"convention, tradition, conservatism,\" she said, and tied to discussions about school uniforms and the Pledge of Allegiance. As the debate surrounding cursive's revival rages on, educators and researchers are weighing in on the benefits and drawbacks of this traditional writing style. Some argue that cursive is essential for developing fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and even cognitive abilities. A study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that students who learned cursive showed improved performance in reading and writing skills compared to those who did not.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of digital literacy argue that cursive is a relic of the past, and that students should focus on developing their typing and keyboard skills instead. \"In today's digital age, cursive is a luxury we can no longer afford,\" said Dr. Rachel Ginsberg, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"We need to be teaching our students how to efficiently communicate in the digital realm, not how to write in a style that's becoming increasingly obsolete.\"\n\nDespite these differing opinions, many educators and policymakers believe that cursive has a unique value that cannot be replicated by digital means. \"Cursive is a way for students to express themselves creatively and personally,\" said Karen Quinn, a teacher at a public elementary school in Illinois. \"It's a way for them to connect with the past and with the world around them in a way that's not possible with a keyboard or screen.\"\n\nAs the debate continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether cursive will ultimately become a staple of American education once again. However, one thing is clear: the resurgence of cursive is a reflection of a broader desire to reconnect with the past and to preserve traditional values in an increasingly digital world.",

In remarks ahead of a third round of talks beginning on Saturday in Ottawa, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said negotiators were \"moving at warp speed, but we don't know whether we're going to get to a conclusion, that's the problem.\" \"We're running very quickly -- somewhere,\" Mr. Lighthizer said in a rare question-and-answer session at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. The Trump administration has carved out a narrow path to victory on Nafta, pledging to hammer out substantial changes in a matter of months to a sweeping pact governing most of the North American economy. In the coming round, negotiators are hoping to forge progress as they discuss specific proposals to address some areas of disagreement for the first time. According to Lighthizer, the negotiators have made significant progress in certain areas, but the path to a comprehensive agreement remains uncertain. He emphasized that the Trump administration's goal is to achieve a deal that benefits all three countries, but the process is complex and requires careful consideration of various interests.\n\nDespite the challenges, Lighthizer expressed optimism about the prospects for a successful outcome. He noted that the negotiators have made significant progress in areas such as intellectual property, labor, and environmental issues, and that the talks have been marked by a constructive and collaborative atmosphere.\n\nThe upcoming round of talks in Ottawa is expected to be a critical moment in the negotiations, as the negotiators seek to make significant progress on outstanding issues. The Trump administration has made it clear that it is willing to walk away from the talks if a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached, but Lighthizer stressed that the goal is to achieve a deal that benefits all three countries.\n\nThe Nafta renegotiation has been a contentious issue, with both the US and Canada expressing concerns about the impact of the agreement on their respective economies. The US has been pushing for significant changes to the pact, including the elimination of the dispute resolution mechanism and the introduction of stricter labor and environmental standards.\n\nMexico, on the other hand, has been seeking to maintain the core elements of the agreement, including the dispute resolution mechanism, which it sees as essential for protecting its interests. The Mexican government has also been pushing for greater access to the US market for its agricultural products.\n\nThe stakes are high, as the Nafta renegotiation has significant implications for the economies of all three countries. The agreement has been in place since 1994 and has played a crucial role in promoting trade and economic integration in North America.\n\nA successful outcome to the negotiations would be a major achievement for the Trump administration, which has made it a priority to renegotiate the agreement and make it more favorable to US interests. However, the process has been complicated by the complex web of interests and concerns involved, and the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nAs the negotiators head into the next round of talks, they will be under intense pressure to make progress on outstanding issues. The fate of the Nafta renegotiation hangs in the balance, and the outcome will have significant implications for the economies of all three countries.",

Persuading international travelers to visit the United States never used to be difficult. But things have gotten a little more complicated. According to the Commerce Department's National Travel and Tourism Office, the number of international visitors in the first half of 2017 fell 4 percent from a year earlier. Those in the travel industry point to factors like a global market that gives tourists more possible destinations, the strength of the dollar and tightening visa restrictions. To combat this decline, the New York City tourism organization has shifted its focus to highlight the unique experiences and attractions that the city has to offer. \"We've been emphasizing the spirit of New York, which is something that we think is missing in Washington,\" said a spokesman for the organization. \"We're trying to appeal to the international traveler's sense of adventure and curiosity.\"\n\nOne of the ways the organization is doing this is by highlighting the city's diverse neighborhoods and cultural attractions. \"New York is a city of neighborhoods, each with its own unique character and charm,\" said the spokesman. \"From Chinatown to Little Italy, from Harlem to Williamsburg, there's a neighborhood for every kind of traveler.\"\n\nThe organization is also emphasizing the city's world-class museums and cultural institutions. \"New York is home to some of the world's greatest museums, including the Met, the MoMA, and the Guggenheim,\" said the spokesman. \"And with the city's vibrant arts and cultural scene, there's always something new and exciting to discover.\"\n\nIn addition to these attractions, the organization is also highlighting the city's iconic landmarks and natural beauty. \"From the Statue of Liberty to Central Park, New York is a city that is full of iconic landmarks and natural beauty,\" said the spokesman. \"And with the city's many parks and green spaces, there are plenty of opportunities to get outdoors and enjoy the fresh air.\"\n\nThe organization is also working to attract more international visitors by partnering with travel companies and airlines to offer special packages and promotions. \"We're working with our partners to offer special deals and packages that make it easier for international visitors to come to New York,\" said the spokesman. \"We're also promoting the city's many affordable accommodations and dining options, so that visitors can enjoy the city without breaking the bank.\"\n\nOverall, the New York City tourism organization is confident that its new marketing strategy will help to attract more international visitors to the city. \"We're excited to showcase all that New York has to offer, and we're confident that our new marketing strategy will help us to attract more visitors from around the world,\" said the spokesman.",

Ofwat criticised the utility alongside three other companies for \"shortcomings in the data handling\" that mean customers and the watchdog \"cannot be sure the information presented is complete and accurate\". Aileen Armstrong, Ofwat's senior director of finance and governance, said: \"As customers, we want to be able to trust what we get from our water company, be that the water out of the tap or what they tell us. The criticism comes as a significant setback for Thames Water, which has been under scrutiny in recent months over its handling of customer complaints and its environmental impact. The company has faced numerous allegations of poor customer service, including long delays in resolving issues and inadequate communication with customers.\n\nOfwat's findings are based on a review of the data handling practices of four major water companies, including Thames Water, Severn Trent, Southern Water, and South West Water. The regulator found that all four companies had shortcomings in their data handling, which meant that customers and the regulator could not be confident that the information presented was complete and accurate.\n\nArmstrong emphasized that the regulator's findings were not intended to criticize the companies for trying to improve their data handling practices, but rather to highlight the importance of transparency and accuracy in the information provided to customers. \"We recognize that water companies are working hard to improve their data handling, but we also need to ensure that customers can trust the information they receive,\" she said.\n\nThe regulator's criticism is likely to have significant implications for Thames Water, which has already faced several high-profile controversies in recent years. The company has been accused of prioritizing profits over customer service, and has faced criticism for its handling of environmental issues, including the impact of its operations on local wildlife.\n\nIn response to the regulator's findings, Thames Water has pledged to improve its data handling practices and to provide more accurate and transparent information to customers. The company has also announced plans to invest in new technology and staff training to improve its customer service.\n\nHowever, the regulator's criticism is likely to be met with skepticism by many customers, who have long complained about the company's poor service and lack of transparency. The criticism is also likely to put pressure on the company's management to take more decisive action to address the issues raised by Ofwat.\n\nAs the debate continues, customers are left wondering what this means for them. Will they see improvements in their service and transparency from Thames Water? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "The rooms are tiny, the rent is about Â£1,100 a month, tenants have to share kitchens â€“ and the view is over one of London's bleakest skylines. But the creators of what they claim is the world's largest \"co-living\" scheme, opening next week, believe it is the 21st-century alternative to that traditional rite of passage for twentysomethings arriving in the capital â€“ flatting. The Collective, a new 550-bed tower in Old Oak billed as \"a new way to live in London\", is the corporate answer to the dilemma facing new workers in the capital hunting for a flat and someone to share the costs. It claims to give tenants â€“ the first move in on Monday â€“ a hassle-free, collective life similar to a student hall of residence, but for people starting out on their career. Its sleek modernity is a far cry from the Young Ones, but it's also a long way from the New York shared living of Friends. The majority of rooms are just 10 sq metres and relatively expensive compared to the traditional flatshare in London's inner suburbs. Residents will typically pay Â£1,083 a month for what the Collective dubs a \"Twodio\". The Collective's innovative approach to co-living is designed to provide a sense of community and shared experience for its residents, who will have access to a range of communal spaces, including a rooftop garden, gym, and cinema room. The building's interior design is sleek and modern, with a focus on natural light and airy spaces.\n\nBut while The Collective's concept may appeal to some, others have raised concerns about the high cost of living in the building. With rent prices significantly higher than those of traditional flatshares in London's inner suburbs, some have questioned whether the scheme is truly accessible to the average young professional.\n\n\"The prices are just outrageous,\" said Sarah Johnson, a 25-year-old marketing professional who is currently searching for a flat in London. \"I've seen smaller one-bedroom flats in Zone 2 for less than Â£1,000 a month. The idea of paying over Â£1,100 a month for a tiny room with shared facilities is just not viable for me.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, The Collective's developers are confident that their scheme will be a success. They point to the growing demand for co-living spaces in London, as well as the increasing popularity of shared living arrangements among young professionals.\n\n\"We believe that The Collective is the perfect solution for young professionals who want to live in London but struggle to find affordable and convenient accommodation,\" said James McLoughlin, CEO of The Collective. \"Our building offers a unique combination of community, convenience, and flexibility, which we believe will be a major draw for many people.\"\n\nThe Collective is not the only co-living scheme to launch in London in recent years. Other companies, such as The Ministry and The Hatch, have also entered the market, offering similar concepts to The Collective.\n\nHowever, The Collective's sheer scale and central location set it apart from its competitors. The building's 550 beds make it the largest co-living scheme in the world, and its location in Old Oak, just a short tube ride from central London, makes it an attractive option for young professionals who want to be close to the action.\n\nAs the first residents move in next week, The Collective is hoping to create a sense of community and shared experience among its residents. The building's communal spaces are designed to encourage socializing and networking, with events and activities planned throughout the year.\n\nWhether or not The Collective's innovative approach to co-living will be a success remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the company's bold experiment is sure to shake up the traditional flatshare market in London.",

        "Text": "A UK-registered mining company, which is now part of Glencore, is facing claims in a London court that it hired security forces to mistreat environmental activists protesting about a copper mine in Peru. Two demonstrators died and others were left with serious injuries following the confrontations which lasted for several days during May 2012 on a remote hillside in the Andes, the court has been told. The two-week trial of the mining company, Xstrata, being held at the Rolls Building in central London, where commercial cases are heard, will be determined under Peruvian law. It is taking evidence from leading legal experts. Two of the protesters, Sergio Huamani and Alberto Huallpa, went to London to attend the hearing, which is being translated into Spanish and English. Lawyers for Xstrata argue that the claims have been brought too late and should be barred under a statute of limitations which imposes a two-year time limit. But Phillippa Kaufmann QC, for the claimants, maintained the cases were not out of time. The copper mine in Peru was at the time owned by Xstrata Tintaya, a firm later renamed CompanÃ­a Minera Antapaccay. Xstrata was alleged to have paid the equivalent of Â£700,000 for the services of about 1,300 Peruvian national police and provided them with weapons such as rubber bullets and teargas, as well as food and accommodation. It is alleged that the company encouraged the security forces to mistreat the eco-protesters, who had gathered near the Tintaya copper mine near the town of Espinar. The trial, which began on Monday, has been told that the confrontations between the security forces and the protesters were brutal and violent, with reports of police using excessive force, including beating and kicking the activists. The court has heard that the protesters were peaceful and unarmed, and that they were simply trying to stop the mine from being expanded.\n\nOne of the claimants, Sergio Huamani, told the court that he was beaten and kicked by the police, and that he was left with serious injuries, including a broken arm and a deep gash on his head. \"I was just trying to protect my land and my community,\" he said. \"I never thought that the police would treat us so brutally.\"\n\nThe court has also heard that the company's actions were not limited to the use of excessive force. It is alleged that Xstrata also used propaganda and misinformation to discredit the protesters and to justify the use of force against them.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several weeks, and the outcome will determine whether Xstrata is liable for the deaths and injuries of the protesters. The company denies any wrongdoing, and claims that it was simply following the law and regulations in Peru.\n\nThe case has attracted widespread attention in Peru and internationally, with many people calling for greater accountability from companies like Xstrata. The trial is seen as a test case for the use of corporate liability in cases of human rights abuses, and could have significant implications for the mining industry as a whole.\n\nIn a statement, Xstrata said that it \"strongly denies\" any wrongdoing and that it is committed to upholding human rights and respecting the environment. The company also said that it is cooperating fully with the investigation and that it is confident that the truth will come out in court.\n\nThe trial is being closely watched by human rights groups and environmental activists, who are hoping for a verdict that will hold Xstrata accountable for its actions. The case is a reminder of the importance of corporate accountability and the need for companies to respect the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of their nationality or social status.\n\nAs the trial continues, it is clear that the stakes are high and the outcome will have significant implications for the future of corporate accountability. The case is a powerful reminder of the need for companies to prioritize human rights and the environment, and to respect the rights and dignity of all people.",

        "Text": "The pitch comes in the form of before and after photos posted to Facebook or Instagram by a woman you know. The focus is on her eyes, specifically her eyelashes, which at first appear ordinary and untouched -- a stark contrast from a picture taken weeks later, when they look long and thick. Mascara magnifies the effect in another snapshot. Reach out, the captions enthuse, if you want in! Such pictures have increasingly populated social media this year from women selling an eyelash enhancing serum from Rodan & Fields, a skin care company that distributes most of its products through independent \"consultants.\" One might expect the average woman to be skeptical about the idea of applying a little-known liquid to her eyelids every night in hopes of longer lashes a month later, especially without a prescription. It is the kind of thing that, if seen on a television infomercial, might be skipped without a second thought. But fueled by social media testimonials and a robust direct selling force, the serum, Lash Boost, briefly sold out this summer and the company said that sales of the product -- which costs up to $150 -- should top $175 million in its first year. The popularity illustrates the modern dynamics of direct sales companies, which were once mostly associated with door-to-door Avon visits and social gatherings. In the social media era, selfies are the new Tupperware party, influencing the types of products the companies can persuade people to buy. The rise of social media has revolutionized the way direct sales companies operate, allowing them to reach a wider audience and create a sense of community among customers and consultants. Rodan & Fields, founded in 2002 by Dr. Katie Rodan and Dr. Kathy Fields, has been at the forefront of this shift. The company's use of social media platforms to showcase products and share success stories has proven to be a highly effective strategy.\n\nIn addition to the before-and-after photos, Rodan & Fields consultants often share their own personal experiences with Lash Boost, highlighting the product's effectiveness and ease of use. This social proof has been a major factor in the product's success, with many customers reporting significant improvements in the length and thickness of their eyelashes after using the serum.\n\nThe company's reliance on social media has also allowed it to bypass traditional retail channels and connect directly with customers. This has enabled Rodan & Fields to maintain a high level of control over the sales process, ensuring that products are sold through authorized consultants and not through third-party retailers.\n\nHowever, the rise of social media has also raised concerns about the authenticity of the testimonials and the potential for false advertising. Critics have argued that the before-and-after photos may be staged or manipulated to exaggerate the product's effectiveness, and that the company's use of social media influencers may be seen as a form of subtle marketing.\n\nDespite these concerns, Rodan & Fields has taken steps to ensure the integrity of its marketing efforts. The company has implemented strict guidelines for consultants to follow when sharing product information and testimonials on social media, and has also established a clear policy for addressing customer complaints and concerns.\n\nAs the direct sales industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how companies like Rodan & Fields adapt to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements. While social media has clearly been a game-changer for the company, it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue to drive sales and growth in the years to come. One thing is certain, however: the rise of social media has opened up new opportunities for direct sales companies to connect with customers and promote their products in innovative and effective ways.",

        "Text": "The \"unprecedented changes\" to this year's GCSE exams in English and maths means results cannot be compared with those of previous years, headteachers have warned as hundreds of thousands of pupils wait to receive their results on Thursday morning. The changes are the biggest overhaul of the examination system in England since GCSEs were introduced to replace O-levels nearly 30 years ago. The results will be the first of the revised GCSEs sat by pupils in England, the culmination of a shake-up launched by the former education secretary Michael Gove. The new courses have a greater emphasis on final exam marks, with little or no coursework counting towards final grades, and a new grading scheme running from 9 at the top to 1 as the lowest rank. The sheer extent of the changes means that year-on-year comparisons are \"unjust and unreliable\" according to Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. \"School leaders have worked hard to help students and their families to understand the change from A-G to 9-1 grades,\" said Whiteman, who was concerned that schools may be unfairly penalised in the Department for Education's performance tables. The new grading system has also introduced a number of changes to the way students are assessed, with a greater emphasis on final exams and less on coursework. This has raised concerns among some teachers and parents that the new system may not accurately reflect a student's abilities.\n\n\"It's a big change, and it's going to take some time for everyone to get used to it,\" said Sarah Taylor, a teacher at a comprehensive school in London. \"I'm worried that some students may struggle with the new format, especially those who are used to doing coursework and projects.\"\n\nThe changes to the GCSEs are part of a broader shake-up of the education system in England, which aims to improve the quality of education and make it more relevant to the needs of students. The government has also introduced new A-levels and AS-levels, as well as changes to the way schools are inspected and held accountable.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the new system, many schools and teachers are optimistic about the changes and the opportunities they bring. \"The new GCSEs are a chance for us to rethink the way we teach and assess our students,\" said John Smith, the headteacher of a secondary school in the north of England. \"We're excited to see how our students will perform under the new system, and we're confident that they will rise to the challenge.\"\n\nThe results of the new GCSEs will be released on Thursday morning, and will be closely watched by schools, teachers, and students across the country. While there are concerns about the changes, many are hopeful that the new system will bring about positive changes and improvements to the education system in England.",

Throughout the process, I have felt pushed for time, friends pressured me into putting in an offer, and I have kept going with the conveyancing even though it has thrown up a number of issues over the title and building regulations approval. I'm also in the middle of a bout of quite severe depression. This is making it very difficult to trust my judgment when I keep feeling that I really don't want this house. I have spent time sitting outside the house trying to imagine living there and sort out my feelings for it. As I sat outside the house, the weight of my emotions and the uncertainty of my decision began to bear down on me. The once-exciting prospect of owning my own home had turned into a source of anxiety and dread. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was making a huge mistake, that this house wasn't the right one for me.\n\nDespite the initial excitement of putting in an offer, the process had become overwhelming. The conveyancing issues and the pressure from friends had taken a toll on my mental health, and I was struggling to cope. The thought of moving into a new home, especially one that was still plagued by title and building regulations issues, filled me with dread.\n\nAs I sat there, I couldn't help but think about my mother and the role she had played in my life. She had been my caregiver, my confidante, and my best friend. Her dementia had taken a toll on both of us, and I was still reeling from the loss of our daily routine and the sense of security she had provided.\n\nI knew I wasn't alone in my struggles. Many people face similar challenges when buying a home, and I was grateful for the support of friends and family who had offered words of encouragement and guidance. But as I sat outside the house, I couldn't help but feel like I was making a huge mistake.\n\nI took a deep breath and tried to clear my head. I thought about all the reasons why I had wanted to buy this house in the first place â€“ the location, the size, the potential for renovation. But as I sat there, I realized that my motivations had changed. I wasn't buying a house because I wanted to; I was buying a house because I felt like I had to.\n\nAs the sun began to set, I knew I had to make a decision. I couldn't keep sitting outside the house, stuck in limbo. I took out my phone and dialed the real estate agent, my heart racing with anxiety.\n\n\"I think I need to pull out of the deal,\" I said, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nThe agent's response was understanding, but firm. \"Let's talk about the issues with the title and building regulations,\" she said. \"We can work through this together.\"\n\nI nodded, even though she couldn't see me. I knew I had to trust my instincts, even if it meant giving up on the house. I took a deep breath and made the decision to walk away.\n\nAs I stood up and walked back to my car, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I knew it wasn't an easy decision, but I also knew it was the right one. I would find another house, one that was the right fit for me and my needs. And I would do it on my own terms, without the pressure and stress of the past few months.\n\nFor now, I just needed to take care of myself and focus on my mental health. I knew that with time and support, I would find a new home that would bring me joy and happiness, not anxiety and dread.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is not sounding like an institution that is ready to raise its benchmark interest rate in June. Fed officials at their most recent policy-making meeting in January worried that economic growth remained fragile, and that raising rates prematurely could undermine recent gains, according to an official account released Wednesday. The account also described greater concerns than the Fed had disclosed previously about the sluggish pace of inflation and the decline of inflation expectations among investors. \"You can almost hear a little hesitation in the committee,\" said Zach Pandl, senior interest rate strategist at the investment firm Columbia Management. \"They sound confident on the economy but nervous on pulling the trigger on rate hikes.\" The economy is growing strongly, and the statement the Fed issued after the January meeting was its most upbeat since the end of the recession in 2009. That optimism has since been reinforced by the government's latest jobs report, released this month, which estimated that strong employment gains at the end of 2014 continued at a healthy pace in January. The Fed has gained enough confidence in the strength of the recovery that officials spent much of the January meeting discussing various aspects of raising the Fed's benchmark interest rate, which they have held near zero since December 2008. However, despite the robust economic growth and strong employment numbers, the Fed's officials are still cautious about raising interest rates. The account of the January meeting revealed that the committee is concerned about the potential impact of rate hikes on the economy, particularly on the housing market and the stock market.\n\n\"The Fed is worried that if they raise rates too quickly, it could slow down the economy and have a negative impact on the housing market,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"They're also concerned about the impact on the stock market, as higher interest rates can make stocks less attractive to investors.\"\n\nThe Fed's concerns about inflation are also a key factor in their decision-making process. The account of the January meeting noted that inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target, and that inflation expectations among investors have declined. This suggests that the Fed may not feel pressure to raise rates in order to combat inflation.\n\n\"The Fed is not seeing the kind of inflation pressures that would normally lead them to raise rates,\" said Zandi. \"They're more focused on the overall health of the economy and the labor market.\"\n\nThe Fed's decision to delay raising interest rates is also seen as a reflection of its commitment to supporting the economic recovery. The central bank has been implementing quantitative easing policies since 2008, and has kept interest rates near zero in order to stimulate the economy.\n\n\"The Fed is not ready to pull the plug on the economy just yet,\" said Pandl. \"They're still trying to support the recovery and make sure that the economy is strong enough to withstand any potential shocks.\"\n\nIn the meantime, investors are likely to continue to focus on the Fed's next move, and the impact it could have on the economy and financial markets. The Fed's next policy-making meeting is scheduled for June, and many economists expect the central bank to delay raising interest rates until then.\n\n\"The Fed is going to take its time and make sure that the economy is strong enough to withstand any potential rate hikes,\" said Zandi. \"They're not going to rush into anything, and that's a good thing for the economy.\"",

        "Text": "PARIS -- French labor unions and business leaders struck a deal on Friday to overhaul swaths of France's notoriously rigid labor market, moving to tame some of the most confounding rules in the 3,200-page labor code as the country tries to increase its competitiveness and curb unemployment. The changes would include giving employers more flexibility to reduce working hours in times of economic distress without incurring union strikes. High levels of compensation that courts can award to laid-off workers would be trimmed. The agreement, reached after months of intense negotiations, is seen as a major step forward in France's efforts to revamp its labor market, which has long been criticized for being overly restrictive and hindering business growth. The changes are expected to take effect in the coming months, pending approval from the French government and parliament.\n\nUnder the new rules, employers will be able to reduce working hours without facing the threat of union strikes, which have often brought the country to a standstill in the past. This flexibility is expected to help companies adapt to economic downturns and reduce their costs, making them more competitive in the global market.\n\nThe agreement also includes measures to curb the high levels of compensation that courts can award to laid-off workers. Currently, workers who are made redundant can receive up to two years' salary in severance pay, a provision that has been criticized for being too generous and discouraging companies from hiring new staff.\n\nThe changes are expected to have a significant impact on France's unemployment rate, which has remained stubbornly high at around 9% despite years of economic growth. The country's labor minister, Muriel PÃ©nicaud, hailed the agreement as a \"major victory\" for the government's efforts to boost competitiveness and create jobs.\n\nThe deal has been welcomed by business leaders, who have long complained about the complexity and rigidity of France's labor code. \"This agreement is a major step forward for French businesses,\" said Pierre Gattaz, president of the Movement of French Enterprises (MEDEF). \"It will give us the flexibility we need to adapt to changing market conditions and create jobs.\"\n\nHowever, labor unions have expressed concerns that the changes will erode workers' rights and lead to a decline in living standards. \"We are not opposed to reform, but we must ensure that it does not come at the expense of workers' rights and social protections,\" said Philippe Martinez, general secretary of the CGT union.\n\nThe agreement is also seen as a key step towards France's goal of reducing its unemployment rate to 7% by 2025. The country's president, Emmanuel Macron, has made job creation a central plank of his economic policy, and the labor market overhaul is seen as a crucial part of his strategy.\n\nIn a statement, Macron praised the agreement, saying it would \"make France a more attractive country for businesses and investors\" and \"help us to create a more dynamic and competitive economy.\" The government is expected to present the changes to parliament in the coming weeks, with a view to implementing them in the summer.",

It's the Latest in Conservation Tech. Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of conservation technology, using a most unlikely source: leeches. Researchers have found that by analyzing the DNA of leeches' last blood meals, they can gain valuable insights into the biodiversity of a forest ecosystem. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the way conservationists monitor and manage forest ecosystems.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, focused on the Haemadipsa zeylanica, a species of leech found in Thailand. The researchers collected leeches from various forest sites and analyzed the DNA of the blood they had consumed. By comparing the DNA profiles, they were able to identify the species of animals that the leeches had fed on, including birds, mammals, and reptiles.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for conservation,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead author of the study. \"Leeches are incredibly efficient at collecting blood samples from a wide range of animals, and by analyzing those samples, we can get a snapshot of the biodiversity of a forest ecosystem.\"\n\nThe benefits of this approach are numerous. For one, it allows conservationists to monitor biodiversity in areas that are difficult or impossible to access. Leeches can be found in remote, hard-to-reach areas, and their blood meals can provide valuable information about the animals that live there.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that leeches can detect changes in the ecosystem that might not be immediately apparent through traditional monitoring methods. For example, if a species is declining in population, leeches may still be feeding on its blood, providing an early warning sign for conservationists.\n\nThe technology has already been used to monitor the health of a forest in Thailand, and the researchers are now working to apply it to other ecosystems around the world. The potential applications are vast, from monitoring the impact of climate change to tracking the spread of invasive species.\n\n\"This is an exciting development in the field of conservation technology,\" said Dr. John Smith, a conservation biologist at the University of California. \"The ability to use leeches to monitor biodiversity has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach conservation.\"\n\nAs the world continues to face environmental challenges, innovative technologies like this one are crucial to the success of conservation efforts. By leveraging the unique abilities of leeches, scientists can gain a better understanding of the natural world and work to protect it for future generations.",

Flint was one of several banking chief executives who pulled out of an investment conference in Riyadh last week, along with Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. However, Samir Assaf, the head of HSBC's global banking and markets, attended the event. Flint said: \"My decision [to pull out] was not an easy decision but I felt it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.\" He defended the bank's decision to send Assaf to the conference, saying it had a responsibility to its 4,000 employees and many customers in Saudi Arabia, where HSBC is the biggest foreign bank through its 40% holding in Saudi British Bank. Despite the controversy surrounding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia remains a crucial player in the global economy, and its importance to energy markets is unlikely to be significantly impacted by the incident. \"Saudi Arabia is a critical partner for the global energy system, and we need to continue to work with them to ensure stability and security,\" said Flint.\n\nHowever, the incident has raised concerns about the country's human rights record and its treatment of dissidents. Human rights groups have long criticized Saudi Arabia's strict laws and harsh punishments, including beheadings and amputations. The murder of Khashoggi, a vocal critic of the Saudi government, has sparked widespread outrage and calls for accountability.\n\nDespite these concerns, many experts believe that the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the West are too strong to be significantly disrupted by the incident. \"The economic relationship between Saudi Arabia and the West is a long-standing one, and it's not going to be easily undone by a single event,\" said Dr. James Dorsey, a Middle East expert at the University of Singapore.\n\nHowever, the incident has also raised questions about the role of Western companies in Saudi Arabia and their responsibility to uphold human rights. \"Companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, regardless of where they operate,\" said Amnesty International's Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo. \"The fact that a Saudi Arabian government official was involved in the murder of a journalist is a stark reminder of the need for companies to take a stand against human rights abuses.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, several companies have faced criticism for their ties to Saudi Arabia. Last week, the Saudi Arabian government announced plans to sell a 5% stake in the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, in an initial public offering (IPO). However, several major investors, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have announced that they will not be participating in the IPO due to concerns about the company's human rights record.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the role of Western governments in Saudi Arabia and their ability to influence the country's human rights record. \"The US and European governments have a responsibility to use their leverage to promote human rights and democracy in Saudi Arabia,\" said Human Rights Watch's Middle East Director, Sarah Leah Whitson. \"The fact that they have been slow to act is a major concern.\"\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the aftermath of Jamal Khashoggi's murder, the economic implications of the incident remain unclear. However, one thing is certain: the incident has raised important questions about the role of Western companies and governments in Saudi Arabia and their responsibility to uphold human rights.",

        "Text": "Almost 70,000 students have signed petitions demanding compensation from their universities in the run-up to planned strike action by lecturers, starting this Thursday, which threatens to bring disruption to campuses for weeks. The University and College Union (UCU), whose members voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action, had hoped university heads would return to the negotiating table but they now say that strike action is inevitable. Students, caught in what is becoming an increasingly acrimonious dispute, are demanding their voices be heard. As the strike action looms, students across the country are taking matters into their own hands, signing petitions and calling for their universities to take responsibility for the potential disruption. The UCU has been in talks with university management for months, but the two sides have been unable to reach a agreement on issues such as pension reform, pay, and job security.\n\nThe students' demands are not just about supporting their lecturers, but also about ensuring that their own education is not compromised. Many students are worried about the impact that the strike will have on their studies, with some fearing that they will fall behind in their courses or even be forced to take time off.\n\n\"I'm really frustrated that the university isn't taking our concerns seriously,\" said Emily Wilson, a student at the University of Manchester. \"We're the ones who are going to be affected the most by this strike, and yet we're not being listened to. I think it's time that our voices are heard.\"\n\nThe UCU has been vocal in its support for the students, with general secretary Jo Grady saying that the union is \"proud\" of the students' actions. \"The students are standing up for their rights and for the rights of their lecturers,\" she said. \"We hope that the university management will listen to their concerns and come back to the negotiating table.\"\n\nDespite the growing tensions, some university officials have remained defiant, insisting that the strike action is unnecessary and that the UCU is being unreasonable. \"We have made significant offers to the UCU, but they have refused to engage with us,\" said a spokesperson for the University of Manchester. \"We will continue to do everything we can to minimize the disruption caused by the strike, but we cannot be held hostage by the UCU's demands.\"\n\nAs the strike action approaches, students are bracing themselves for the worst. Many have stockpiled materials and are making contingency plans for their studies, while others are considering taking a break from their courses. The UCU has promised to provide support to students during the strike, but it remains to be seen how effective this will be.\n\nIn the meantime, students are calling on their universities to take responsibility for the potential disruption and to work with the UCU to find a resolution. As one student put it, \"We're not just fighting for our lecturers, we're fighting for our education. We deserve better than to be caught in the middle of a dispute that we didn't start.\"",

There have been gruesome abuses: Staff members at New Orleans's old Charity Hospital were indicted in the 1970s for running prostitution rings on the wards. But amidst the chaos and controversy, there are also stories of heroism and compassion. Take the case of Dr. Leoncio Madrigal, a dedicated physician who worked tirelessly at San Francisco General Hospital for over three decades. Despite facing numerous challenges, including budget cuts and staff shortages, Madrigal remained committed to providing top-notch care to his patients.\n\nOne patient who benefited from Madrigal's dedication was a young woman named Maria. Diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer, Maria was given a grim prognosis by her doctors. But Madrigal refused to give up on her. He worked closely with her to develop a customized treatment plan, and even went above and beyond to secure funding for her care.\n\nThanks to Madrigal's unwavering support, Maria was able to undergo successful treatment and is now cancer-free. Her story is just one example of the countless lives that have been touched by the selfless work of healthcare professionals like Madrigal.\n\nDespite the challenges they face, public hospitals continue to play a vital role in the healthcare system. They provide a safety net for the most vulnerable members of society, including the uninsured and underinsured. And while they may not always receive the recognition they deserve, the dedicated staff who work in these hospitals are the true heroes of the medical world.\n\nIn recent years, there have been efforts to improve the working conditions and morale of public hospital staff. This includes initiatives to reduce staff shortages, increase funding, and provide better training and resources. While there is still much work to be done, these efforts are helping to create a more positive and supportive work environment.\n\nAs the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, the importance of public hospitals will only continue to grow. They will remain a vital part of the safety net, providing essential care to those who need it most. And as long as dedicated professionals like Dr. Madrigal continue to work in these hospitals, there is hope that the drama will be replaced by a sense of purpose and fulfillment.",

Transport for London has instead given the ride-hailing firm only a two-month extension to its licence, which is due to expire on Wednesday night. It is the second time in two years that TfL has rejected Uber's application for a full operating licence. Uber's Future in London Hangs in Balance as TfL Grants Two-Month Extension\n\nIn a surprise move, Transport for London (TfL) has rejected Uber's application to renew its private hire operating licence in the city, instead granting the ride-hailing firm a two-month extension to its current licence, which was due to expire on Wednesday night. This is the second time in two years that TfL has rejected Uber's application for a full operating licence.\n\nThe decision is a significant blow to Uber, which has been operating in London since 2012 and has become a dominant player in the city's ride-hailing market. The company has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with TfL over its licensing requirements, with the regulator citing concerns over Uber's ability to ensure public safety and protect passengers.\n\nIn a statement, TfL said that it had made the decision after \"serious concerns\" were raised over Uber's approach to reporting serious criminal offenses, including sexual assaults and violent incidents. The regulator also expressed concerns over the company's data security and its ability to prevent unauthorised drivers from accessing the app.\n\nUber has been given until September 28 to address these concerns and demonstrate that it is able to meet the necessary standards to operate a licensed taxi service in London. If the company is unable to do so, its licence will be revoked and it will be forced to cease operating in the city.\n\nThe decision has sparked outrage among Uber's users and drivers, who have taken to social media to express their disappointment and frustration. Many have called on TfL to reconsider its decision, arguing that the company has made significant improvements to its operations and has a strong track record of ensuring public safety.\n\nHowever, TfL has maintained that it will not compromise on its licensing standards, and that it is committed to ensuring that all private hire operators in the city meet the necessary requirements to protect passengers.\n\nThe rejection of Uber's licence application is a significant setback for the company, which has been facing increased competition from other ride-hailing firms such as Lyft and Bolt. The company has also been facing regulatory challenges in other cities around the world, including New York and Paris.\n\nIn a statement, Uber said that it was \"incredibly disappointed\" by TfL's decision and that it would be appealing the decision. The company also pledged to continue operating in London and to work with TfL to address its concerns.\n\nAs the dispute between Uber and TfL continues, the future of the ride-hailing firm in London hangs in the balance. With its licence due to expire in just two months, Uber will need to act quickly to address TfL's concerns and demonstrate that it is able to meet the necessary standards to operate in the city.",

        "Text": "DUNEDIN, New Zealand -- Only a keen-eyed observer can spot the rare yellow-eyed penguin in the impenetrable forest hills that hug New Zealand's South Island beaches. Native to this region, the birds mostly lurk under a canopy of thick shrubs, trees and branches, dashing for hiding places as soon as a human approaches. Incredibly shy, the yellow-eyed penguin is truly odd. Measuring about 65 centimeters, or just over two feet tall, with striking yellow eyes and a yellow band across its head, it is the rarest species of penguin, nesting in the forest and returning to it. It is also severely endangered. Despite various measures deployed in recent years to protect this penguin's flocks, the outlook remains bleak. On average, only 18 of 100 penguin chicks survive their first year at sea. A decade ago, the population was estimated at 6,000. Today conservationists reckon that only 2,000 yellow-eyed penguins are alive. The yellow-eyed penguin first got into trouble when large parts of its natural habitat were destroyed in the previous century. Farmers bulldozed and torched the forests where the penguin lived to make way for cattle and sheep. The Te Rere Reserve was founded in 1989, when Mr. Sutherland succeeded in persuading farmers not to destroy the forest on the southern tip of the South Island. Eventually, reforestation efforts allowed about 120 yellow-eyed penguins to nest in the scrub. Despite the establishment of the Te Rere Reserve, the yellow-eyed penguin's struggles continue. Habitat destruction and fragmentation remain significant threats to the species' survival. The penguins' reliance on the forest for breeding and nesting means that any disruption to their habitat can have devastating consequences.\n\nIn recent years, conservation efforts have focused on restoring and expanding the penguins' habitat. The Department of Conservation (DoC) has worked with local landowners and farmers to create corridors of native vegetation, connecting isolated patches of forest and providing a safer route for the penguins to move between breeding and foraging areas.\n\nHowever, the challenges facing the yellow-eyed penguin are not limited to habitat destruction. Climate change is also having a profound impact on the species. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns are affecting the availability of food, making it harder for the penguins to survive. Warmer waters are also altering the distribution of their prey, forcing the penguins to travel further to find food, which can be energetically costly.\n\nTo address these challenges, conservationists are working to develop more effective conservation strategies. The DoC is leading efforts to monitor the penguins' population and habitat, using data to inform conservation decisions and track the effectiveness of different management approaches.\n\nIn addition to habitat restoration and monitoring, conservationists are also working to address the penguins' vulnerability to predators. The introduction of invasive species, such as stoats and cats, has had a significant impact on yellow-eyed penguin populations, with many chicks and eggs being predated upon. Conservationists are working to eradicate these predators from the penguins' habitat, using techniques such as trapping and poisoning.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the yellow-eyed penguin, there is hope for the species' recovery. The establishment of the Te Rere Reserve and subsequent conservation efforts have shown that it is possible to protect and restore the penguins' habitat. With continued conservation efforts and a focus on addressing the penguins' vulnerability to climate change and predators, there is a chance that the yellow-eyed penguin can recover and thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, the yellow-eyed penguin is a rare and endangered species that requires urgent conservation action. Habitat destruction, climate change, and predation are all significant threats to the penguins' survival, but with continued conservation efforts and a focus on addressing these challenges, there is hope for the species' recovery.",

European countries are pulling back on spending with a speed that the Obama administration believes could derail the global recovery. China signaled this week that it would not let its currency rise in value anytime soon, raising the prospect of a showdown with Congress. Germany and France have turned skittish about an American-led push to raise capital and liquidity requirements for large banks. Meanwhile, the United States and Britain favor a tax on the giant banks, but do not support a further-reaching proposal by the European Union to tax financial transactions. Canada, Japan and Australia oppose any form of bank tax. The disagreements threaten to hurt the effectiveness of the Group of 20, the expanded club of nations that Mr. Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, have used to coordinate the response to the financial crisis. \"The G-20 has shown impressive solidarity in the crisis phase, but as an uneven recovery begins, maintaining cohesion is becoming more difficult,\" said Stewart M. Patrick, director of the Program on International Institutions and Global Governance at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"The 'fellowship of the lifeboat' will be harder to maintain as the acute crisis passes.\" The extent of the administration's concerns was revealed Friday in a letter Mr. Obama sent to his G-20 counterparts and in subsequent statements by administration officials. The letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, expressed the administration's concerns about the growing divisions among the G-20 nations and the potential consequences for the global economy. In it, Mr. Obama emphasized the need for continued cooperation and coordination among the member nations to ensure a strong and sustainable recovery.\n\n\"We recognize that the global economy is facing significant challenges, and that the recovery is still fragile,\" the letter said. \"We believe that the G-20 has played a critical role in coordinating our responses to the crisis, and that our collective efforts have helped to stabilize the financial system and promote economic growth.\"\n\nHowever, the letter also acknowledged that the administration is concerned about the growing disagreements among the G-20 nations on key issues, such as bank regulation and capital requirements. \"We understand that there are differing views on these issues, and we are willing to listen to and consider the perspectives of all member nations,\" the letter said. \"But we believe that it is essential that we find common ground and work together to address these challenges.\"\n\nAdministration officials said that the letter was intended to be a call to action, urging the G-20 nations to put aside their differences and work together to promote a strong and sustainable recovery. They emphasized that the administration is committed to finding a solution that works for all member nations, and that it is willing to engage in constructive dialogue and negotiation to achieve that goal.\n\nThe administration's concerns about the growing divisions among the G-20 nations were echoed by other officials and experts, who warned that the disagreements could have serious consequences for the global economy. \"The G-20 has been a critical forum for international cooperation, but the growing divisions among the member nations could undermine its effectiveness,\" said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"If the G-20 is unable to find common ground and work together, it could lead to a more fragmented and unstable global economy.\"\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, administration officials expressed optimism that the G-20 nations can find a way to overcome their differences and work together to promote a strong and sustainable recovery. \"We believe that the G-20 has the potential to be a powerful force for good in the world, and we are committed to working with our international partners to achieve our shared goals,\" said a senior administration official. \"We recognize that there are challenges ahead, but we are confident that we can overcome them and achieve a brighter future for all nations.\"",

A year or two later, it backtracks and decides it wants spin your data into gold after all â€“ and if users don't like it, they can delete their accounts. And so it is with today's news about WhatsApp, the messaging service acquired by the world's most unavoidable social network in February 2014. In a blogpost, WhatsApp announced it would begin sharing names and phone numbers with its parent company, to allow its more than 1 billion users \"to communicate with businesses that matter to you too\" â€“ like notifications from airlines, delivery services or your bank, for example. Facebook will also use that data to make friend suggestions and combine that data with the reams of information it has already collected so that it can tailor ads even more specifically to your interests. However, this latest move has raised concerns among privacy advocates and users alike. WhatsApp's decision to share user data with Facebook has sparked a heated debate about the extent to which companies should be allowed to collect and use personal information.\n\n\"WhatsApp's decision to share user data with Facebook is a clear violation of users' privacy,\" said Dr. Rachel Stevens, a leading expert on digital privacy. \"Users have a right to expect that their personal information will be kept confidential, and WhatsApp's actions undermine that trust.\"\n\nThe move has also sparked concerns about the potential for data breaches and misuse. With over 1 billion users, WhatsApp's database is a treasure trove of valuable information for hackers and cybercriminals. If compromised, this data could be used to steal identities, compromise financial information, or even facilitate other forms of cybercrime.\n\nFacebook, however, has sought to reassure users that their data will be protected. In a statement, the company said, \"We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users' data. We have robust measures in place to ensure that user data is kept confidential and secure.\"\n\nDespite these assurances, many users remain skeptical. In the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches and scandals, it's hard to shake the feeling that companies like Facebook are more interested in exploiting user data for profit than in protecting it.\n\nFor its part, WhatsApp has given users the option to opt-out of data sharing, but this has raised concerns about the potential for users to be inadvertently opted-in. The company has also promised to provide users with more control over their data in the future, but it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to alleviate concerns.\n\nAs the debate continues to rage, one thing is clear: the privacy landscape is changing rapidly, and users need to be more vigilant than ever when it comes to protecting their personal information. With companies like Facebook and WhatsApp pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable, it's up to users to demand better and hold these companies accountable for their actions.",

The jets were grounded after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people, triggering investigations into the accidents across the world and engulfing Boeing in one of the biggest crises in its history. In its first quarterly earnings report since the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines disasters, Boeing announced it had abandoned its 2019 financial outlook and halted share buy-backs in mid-March as it deals with the crisis. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer, said: \"We have great sorrow for the families affected. This weighs heavily on us.\" He said the company's first priority was to get the 737 Max back in the air and that the company was working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators to end the aircraft grounding. Boeing's financial woes are expected to continue in the coming quarters as the company faces a significant decline in revenue and profits. The grounding of the 737 Max has resulted in a halt to all deliveries of the aircraft, which has had a ripple effect on the company's supply chain and manufacturing operations.\n\nIn a conference call with investors, Muilenburg acknowledged that the crisis has had a significant impact on the company's financial performance. \"We're facing a significant headwind due to the 737 Max grounding,\" he said. \"We're working hard to get the aircraft back in the air as soon as possible, but in the meantime, we're facing significant costs and revenue declines.\"\n\nBoeing's decision to abandon its 2019 financial outlook and halt share buy-backs is a clear indication of the severity of the crisis. The company's stock price has taken a hit, falling by over 10% in the past week alone. Investors are growing increasingly concerned about the company's ability to recover from the crisis and maintain its position as one of the world's leading aircraft manufacturers.\n\nDespite the challenges, Boeing remains committed to getting the 737 Max back in the air. The company has been working closely with the FAA and other regulators to address the safety concerns that led to the grounding of the aircraft. Muilenburg said that the company is making \"good progress\" on the safety fixes and is on track to submit its proposed solution to the FAA by the end of the month.\n\nHowever, even when the 737 Max is cleared to return to service, Boeing will still face significant challenges in rebuilding trust with customers and the public. The company's reputation has taken a significant hit in the wake of the two fatal crashes, and it will take time and effort to regain the confidence of its customers and the flying public.\n\nIn the meantime, Boeing is focused on supporting the families of the victims of the crashes and working to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. Muilenburg said that the company is committed to transparency and accountability, and is working closely with investigators and regulators to identify the causes of the crashes and implement measures to prevent similar accidents in the future.\n\nAs the company navigates this challenging period, Boeing's leadership is under intense scrutiny. Muilenburg has faced criticism for the company's handling of the crisis, and there are growing calls for his resignation. However, the company's board of directors has stood by Muilenburg, citing his commitment to safety and his leadership during the crisis.\n\nIn the end, Boeing's ability to recover from this crisis will depend on its ability to regain the trust of its customers and the public. The company's leadership will need to demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability, and work to rebuild confidence in the 737 Max and the company's overall safety record. Only then can Boeing begin to move forward and regain its position as one of the world's leading aircraft manufacturers.",

David Mzee, 28, and Gert-Jan Oskam, 35, had electrical pulses beamed into their spines to stimulate their leg muscles as they practised walking in a supportive harness on a treadmill. Doctors believe the timing of the pulses â€“ to coincide with natural movement signals that were still being sent from the patients' brains â€“ was crucial. It appeared to encourage nerves that bypassed the injuries to form new connections and improve the men's muscle control. In many spinal cord injuries a small portion of nerves remain intact but the signals they carry are too feeble to move limbs or support a person's body weight. The groundbreaking treatment, developed by a team of researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), has sparked new hope for individuals living with spinal cord injuries. The innovative approach combines electrical stimulation with physical therapy to enhance motor function and improve mobility.\n\nAccording to Dr. Susan Harkema, the lead researcher on the project, the timing of the electrical pulses was a critical factor in the success of the treatment. \"We believe that by synchronizing the electrical stimulation with the natural movement signals from the brain, we were able to 'trick' the nervous system into thinking that the legs were moving naturally,\" she explained. \"This allowed the nerves to form new connections and improve muscle control, ultimately enabling the patients to stand and walk.\"\n\nDavid Mzee, who was paralyzed from the waist down after a motorcycle accident in 2015, was the first patient to undergo the treatment. \"I was skeptical at first, but after just a few sessions, I started to feel my legs moving,\" he said. \"It was an incredible feeling, like my body was waking up from a long sleep.\"\n\nGert-Jan Oskam, who suffered a spinal cord injury in a diving accident in 2014, also experienced remarkable improvements. \"I was told I would never walk again, but with this treatment, I'm now able to stand and take a few steps with the help of crutches,\" he said. \"It's given me a new lease on life.\"\n\nThe researchers are now working to refine the treatment and expand its use to more patients. \"We're excited about the potential of this treatment to improve the lives of individuals with spinal cord injuries,\" said Dr. Harkema. \"Our goal is to make this treatment widely available and to help people regain their independence and mobility.\"\n\nThe study's findings have been published in the journal Nature Medicine and have generated significant interest in the medical community. While more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the treatment, the results are promising and offer new hope for individuals living with spinal cord injuries.",

        "Text": "Here comes more bad news from the car industry. In what is shaping up to be the worst year since the financial crisis for the automotive sector, Nissan and Aston Martin have become the latest manufacturers to hit the skids. At the luxury marque favoured by James Bond, sales forecasts for 2019 have been ripped up thanks to a \"challenging external environment\" and problems facing the wider economy. The firm hinted at job cuts as a consequence, as it burns down shareholder value faster than 007 goes through its cars. At Nissan, reports suggest that more than 10,000 job cuts worldwide are being readied, raising concerns for workers at its Sunderland plant. It is not the first time job losses have been mooted here, which would prove incredibly painful. The Japanese carmaker has unique issues connected to the removal of its chairman, Carlos Ghosn, but the scale of the potential job losses speak to broader challenges in the automotive sector facing both companies. In Britain the spectre of no-deal Brexit hangs like an exhaust cloud over the industry. After three decades driving up sales for the entire industry, demand in China is falling. The global economy is slowing and the trade war between Washington and Beijing rattles on. Donald Trump could weigh in with US tariffs on EU cars, possibly from as early as the autumn, making matters much worse for carmakers and the economies they operate in. As the automotive industry struggles to stay afloat, analysts are warning of a perfect storm of challenges that threaten to engulf the sector. The removal of Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's former chairman, has left a power vacuum that has yet to be filled, causing uncertainty and disruption to the company's operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Aston Martin's struggles are not just limited to the luxury market. The brand's reliance on the Chinese market, which has been a significant driver of sales in recent years, has left it exposed to the country's slowing economy. The brand's decision to enter the SUV market with the DBX has also been met with lukewarm reception, leaving some to wonder if it's too little, too late.\n\nThe specter of no-deal Brexit looms large over the industry, with many manufacturers warning of the devastating impact it could have on supply chains and production. The threat of tariffs on EU cars from the US, should Donald Trump follow through on his threat, would only add to the uncertainty and chaos.\n\nIndustry insiders are sounding the alarm, warning that the sector is on the brink of a major crisis. \"This is a perfect storm of challenges that the industry has never seen before,\" said one analyst. \"The combination of slowing demand in China, the global economic slowdown, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and tariffs is a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nAs the industry struggles to come to terms with the scale of the challenge, workers at Nissan's Sunderland plant are bracing themselves for the worst. The plant, which employs thousands of people, has been a major contributor to the UK's automotive industry for decades. Any job losses would be a devastating blow to the local community.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the impact of the crisis, industry leaders are calling for governments to take action to support the sector. \"We need governments to step in and provide support to the industry,\" said another analyst. \"This is not just a problem for carmakers, it's a problem for the entire economy. We need to work together to find a solution.\"\n\nAs the automotive industry navigates this perfect storm of challenges, one thing is clear: the road ahead will be fraught with uncertainty and danger. The question is, will the sector be able to adapt and survive, or will it succumb to the perfect storm of challenges that threatens to engulf it? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "We live in an increasingly polarised society. With each emerging debate â€“ immigration, tax law, sexual misconduct, gun control â€“ it seems we are plunged ever deeper in a cycle of outrage, distrust and recrimination. Indeed, often the mere possibility that someone is a member of the \"other side\" is enough to garner vitriol and slander, regardless of their intentions. This behavior, known as \"moral tribalism\", is hardly surprising when considered through the lens of social science. Indeed, research conducted in the last few years has shed new light on just how deeply such tribal tendencies may be ingrained in the human mind. In one study, for instance, researchers at Northeastern University in Boston recruited a group of volunteers and, on the basis of responses they had given to some questions, informed them they were either habitual \"overestimators\" or \"underestimators\". The volunteers were then asked to participate in a series of tasks, including a game where they had to make decisions about how to allocate a limited amount of money between themselves and a group of anonymous others. The results were striking: the \"overestimators\" consistently chose to allocate more money to themselves, while the \"underestimators\" chose to allocate more to the anonymous group.\n\nThis study, published in the journal Science, suggests that our moral judgments are often influenced by our own self-interest, rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of others. This is a disturbing finding, as it implies that our moral outrage may be more about protecting our own group identity than about promoting justice or fairness.\n\nBut what does this mean for our increasingly polarized society? If our moral judgments are influenced by our own self-interest, it's no wonder that we're more likely to lash out at those who disagree with us. It's no wonder that we're more likely to assume the worst about someone just because they hold a different opinion.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching. It suggests that our moral outrage may be a form of tribalism, where we're more concerned with defending our own group's interests than with promoting the greater good. It suggests that we need to be more mindful of our own biases and motivations, and to seek out diverse perspectives and opinions.\n\nIn an era of increasing polarization, this research is a timely reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding. It's a reminder that our moral judgments should be guided by a genuine concern for the well-being of others, rather than by a desire to protect our own group identity.\n\nAs we navigate the complex and often divisive issues of our time, it's essential that we approach these debates with a critical and open-minded perspective. We need to be willing to listen to opposing viewpoints, to consider alternative perspectives, and to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue.\n\nBy doing so, we can work towards a more compassionate and inclusive society, where our moral judgments are guided by a genuine concern for the well-being of all people, rather than by a desire to defend our own group's interests.",

        "Text": "LOS ANGELES -- Brad Grey, who rose from blue-collar roots in New York to the pinnacle of Hollywood, where he was the chairman of Paramount Pictures for a dozen years and played a pivotal role in the creation of seminal television hits like \"The Sopranos,\" died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 59. A spokeswoman for the Grey family said the cause was cancer. Mr. Grey's death shocked the movie capital, where most people were awaiting word of his next professional chapter. It was only in February that he resigned under pressure as Paramount's chief as part of a broader housecleaning at Viacom, the studio's struggling corporate parent. In recent years, Paramount had declined badly under his management, a result of poor movie choices and severe underinvestment by Viacom. His sometimes contentious four-decade run in show business ended on a down note, but Mr. Grey -- carefully composed and quiet one minute, terrifyingly intimidating the next -- may be remembered for helping to change how the gears of Hollywood grind: In the 1990s, he worked to forge a new layer of star supervision and career development through the Brillstein-Grey talent management company. Thanks largely to Bernie Brillstein, a larger-than-life industry figure who died in 2008, talent managers were an emergent force in the movie and television business when Mr. Grey came on the scene in the early 1980s. Mr. Brillstein took Mr. Grey under his wing in 1984 -- Mr. Grey had a couple of his own management clients, including two comedians who were relatively unknown at the time, Garry Shandling and Bob Saget -- and they began to blend the art of management with television and film production. Under Brillstein's guidance, Grey's talent management company, which he co-founded with the legendary manager, quickly gained a reputation for its innovative approach to artist development. The company's roster soon included some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Jerry Seinfeld, Robin Williams, and Eddie Murphy.\n\nGrey's success in talent management led to a natural transition into television production. In the early 1990s, he and Brillstein formed a production company, which produced several successful TV shows, including \"The Larry Sanders Show\" and \"The Sopranos.\" The latter, in particular, was a groundbreaking series that redefined the boundaries of television drama and earned widespread critical acclaim.\n\nGrey's involvement in \"The Sopranos\" was significant, as he played a key role in developing the show's concept and securing its production deal with HBO. His keen eye for talent and his ability to identify emerging trends in popular culture helped to shape the show's unique blend of drama, comedy, and social commentary.\n\nThroughout his career, Grey was known for his intense focus and his ability to build strong relationships with his clients and colleagues. He was a demanding boss, but he was also fiercely loyal and protective of those who worked with him. His reputation as a shrewd and effective deal-maker earned him the respect of his peers, and he was widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the entertainment industry.\n\nDespite his many successes, Grey's tenure at Paramount was marked by controversy and criticism. The studio's declining fortunes under his leadership led to widespread speculation about his future, and his eventual resignation in February was seen as a major shake-up in the industry.\n\nGrey's death has sent shockwaves through the entertainment community, with tributes pouring in from colleagues and friends. His legacy as a pioneer in the field of talent management and television production is secure, and his impact on the industry will be felt for years to come.\n\nIn a statement, HBO CEO Richard Plepler praised Grey's contributions to the network, saying, \"Brad was a true visionary and a master of his craft. He had a unique ability to identify and nurture talent, and his influence on the industry will be felt for generations to come.\"\n\nGrey is survived by his wife, Kathy Greif, and their two children. His family has asked that donations be made to the American Cancer Society in lieu of flowers.",

Speaking at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and bank governors in Shanghai on Friday, Carney turned on City economists who say the world's major central banks have done all they can to prevent the global economy from slipping back into recession. He said: \"Several commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is 'out of ammunition'. Carney argued that this notion is \"fundamentally flawed\" and that central banks still have a range of tools at their disposal to support the economy. He pointed out that the Bank of England, for example, has already taken unprecedented measures to stimulate growth, including cutting interest rates to a record low and implementing quantitative easing programs.\n\nThe Bank of England governor also emphasized the importance of fiscal policy, urging governments to play a more active role in boosting economic growth. \"Monetary policy is not a substitute for fiscal policy,\" Carney said. \"Governments have a critical role to play in supporting the economy, and we need to see more action from them.\"\n\nCarney's comments come as the global economy continues to face significant headwinds, including slowing growth in key regions such as China and the eurozone. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the global economy is at risk of slipping back into recession, and many economists believe that central banks are running out of options to stimulate growth.\n\nHowever, Carney is not alone in his views. Other central bankers, including the European Central Bank's (ECB) Mario Draghi, have also emphasized the importance of monetary policy in supporting the economy. The ECB has implemented a series of unconventional measures, including negative interest rates and quantitative easing, to stimulate growth in the eurozone.\n\nDespite the differing views, many economists agree that the global economy is facing significant challenges. \"The global economy is facing a perfect storm of headwinds, including trade tensions, slowing growth in key regions, and a lack of fiscal policy support,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, an economist at the London School of Economics. \"Central banks need to continue to play a role in supporting the economy, but they cannot do it alone. Governments need to take action to boost growth and create jobs.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Carney's comments have sparked a heated debate among economists and policymakers about the role of central banks in stimulating economic growth. While some argue that central banks have done all they can to support the economy, others believe that they still have a critical role to play in supporting growth and stability. As the global economy continues to face significant challenges, the debate is likely to continue, with Carney's comments serving as a reminder of the importance of central banks in supporting economic growth.",

The team of researchers behind the discovery say the finding not only confirms that the felines were prowling around the Andes towards the end of the last ice age, but reveals that they were infested with roundworm long before humans and their animals turned up. The remarkable discovery was made by a team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Chile, who were excavating a site in the Atacama Desert, a region known for its arid and inhospitable conditions. The team was led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a paleontologist with a specialization in ancient DNA.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rodriguez, the team had been searching for fossils of extinct species in the region for several years, but they had never expected to find something as remarkable as the 17,000-year-old puma poo. \"We were digging through a layer of sediment when we stumbled upon a strange, gnarled object that looked like a root of ginger,\" Dr. Rodriguez explained. \"At first, we thought it was just a piece of rock or a fossilized plant, but as we cleaned it up, we realized it was actually a piece of puma feces.\"\n\nThe team used advanced DNA sequencing techniques to extract and analyze the DNA from the puma poo, and what they found was astonishing. The DNA contained the genetic material of a roundworm, a type of parasitic worm that is commonly found in the digestive systems of mammals. But what was remarkable was that the DNA was not from a modern roundworm, but rather from an ancient species that had gone extinct thousands of years ago.\n\n\"This finding is significant because it shows that pumas were infested with roundworms long before humans and their animals arrived in the region,\" Dr. Rodriguez said. \"It also suggests that the parasites were able to survive and thrive in the Andes even during the last ice age, when the climate was much colder and drier than it is today.\"\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of parasites and their hosts. \"Parasites are often seen as a nuisance, but they play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of their hosts,\" Dr. Rodriguez explained. \"This finding shows that the relationship between pumas and roundworms is much older than we previously thought, and it highlights the importance of studying ancient DNA to gain a better understanding of the history of life on Earth.\"\n\nThe team's findings were published in the journal Science, and they have sparked widespread interest in the scientific community. The discovery is not only a fascinating insight into the natural history of the Andes, but it also highlights the importance of preserving and protecting the region's unique biodiversity.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- Cisco Systems agreed on Wednesday to pay $8.6 million to settle claims that it sold video surveillance technology that it knew had a significant security flaw to federal, state and local government agencies. Cisco will pay civil damages in connection with software that it sold to various government agencies, including Homeland Security, the Secret Service, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a government complaint unsealed on Wednesday. Eighteen states, including New York and California, and the District of Columbia joined the Justice Department in the claim against Cisco, one of the world's largest sellers of software and equipment to businesses and governments; 15 states and the District of Columbia recovered under the settlement. The case was filed in the Federal District Court for the Western District of New York under the False Claims Act, which addresses fraud and misconduct in federal government contracts. The government said the video surveillance software it bought from Cisco was \"of no value\" because it did not \"meet its primary purpose: enhancing the security of the agencies that purchase it.\" In many cases, the Cisco software actually reduced the protection provided by other security systems, the complaint said. Cisco said in a statement that it was pleased to resolve the dispute. \"There was no allegation or evidence that any unauthorized access to customers' video occurred as a result of the architecture,\" Robyn Blum, a Cisco spokeswoman, said in a statement. The settlement marks one of the largest payouts by a technology company to resolve claims of defective products sold to government agencies. The case highlights the importance of ensuring the security and integrity of technology products used by government agencies, which are responsible for protecting sensitive information and maintaining public trust.\n\nAccording to the government complaint, Cisco's video surveillance software, known as Video Surveillance Manager (VSM), was designed to enhance the security of government agencies by providing real-time video monitoring and analytics. However, the software was found to have a significant security flaw that made it vulnerable to hacking and unauthorized access.\n\nThe government alleged that Cisco knew about the security flaw but failed to disclose it to the agencies, which purchased the software in good faith. The agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Secret Service, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, were left with software that was \"of no value\" and actually reduced the protection provided by other security systems.\n\nThe settlement requires Cisco to pay $8.6 million in civil damages to the 15 states and the District of Columbia that recovered under the agreement. The company will also be required to implement additional security measures to ensure the integrity of its products and to provide regular updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities.\n\nThe case was filed under the False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government against companies that defraud or mislead them. The law provides for triple damages and penalties, which can be significant.\n\nThe settlement is a reminder of the importance of ensuring the security and integrity of technology products used by government agencies. It also highlights the need for companies like Cisco to take responsibility for the products they sell and to ensure that they meet the standards and requirements of government agencies.\n\nIn a statement, Cisco said it was pleased to resolve the dispute and that there was no evidence that any unauthorized access to customers' video occurred as a result of the architecture. The company also said it has taken steps to improve the security of its products and to provide regular updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities.\n\nThe case is a significant victory for the government and the states that joined the lawsuit. It demonstrates the importance of holding companies accountable for the products they sell and ensuring that they meet the standards and requirements of government agencies.\n\nThe settlement is also a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity and the need for companies to prioritize the security and integrity of their products. As technology continues to play a critical role in government agencies and other organizations, it is essential that companies like Cisco take responsibility for the products they sell and ensure that they meet the highest standards of security and integrity.",

Every $100 million invested in research by the National Institutes of Health, according to the R&D consulting firm Battelle, generates almost six patents. At the National Science Foundation $100 million generates more than 10. At the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering -- which finances research in radiology -- it produces almost 25 patents. The eye-catching visual representation of the return on investment in research has sent a powerful message to lawmakers, highlighting the significant economic benefits of government-funded science. The Academy of Radiology Research hopes that this creative approach will help to shift the conversation around the importance of public funding for research, and potentially reverse the declining trend.\n\nAccording to the Academy, the data from Battelle suggests that every dollar invested in research by the National Institutes of Health generates almost six patents, which can lead to the development of new treatments, diagnostic tools, and medical devices.

Sterling continued to slide on the foreign exchanges on Tuesday after tumbling the most in a single day since November on Monday, taking the currency to the lowest level for 28 months. The pound fell 0.5% against the US dollar and the euro on Tuesday, taking it to $1.2153 and â‚¬1.0905 on the money markets. However, there were reports of sterling being offered at parity with the euro at bureaux de change at major airports, with some customers at Heathrow being offered less than one euro per pound. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said sterling was facing \"relentless selling pressure\", adding: \"The reasons behind the slide are well trodden but worth noting again: increased risk of a no-deal Brexit as the new government regime pivots squarely towards making no-deal a reality.\" Sterling has had the worst month since October 2016, losing 4.3% so far in July, with the pound the worst-performing major currency in the world since Johnson entered Downing Street last week. The decline of the pound has significant implications for British consumers, particularly those planning to travel or make international purchases. With the currency at its lowest level in nearly three years, the cost of holidays and goods imported from abroad is set to increase. This could lead to higher prices for everyday items such as food, clothing, and electronics.\n\n\"The pound's weakness is a major concern for anyone planning to travel or make international purchases,\" said Simon Lambert, a personal finance expert at MoneySuperMarket. \"The cost of a holiday in Europe, for example, could increase by 10% or more due to the weaker pound. This could have a significant impact on family budgets and make it more difficult for people to afford a break.\"\n\nThe decline of the pound is also likely to have a significant impact on British businesses that rely on imports. With the cost of goods and services increasing, companies may struggle to maintain their profit margins, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.\n\n\"The pound's weakness is a major challenge for British businesses, particularly those that rely on imports,\" said Emma Jones, a business expert at Enterprise Nation. \"With the cost of goods and services increasing, companies may struggle to maintain their profit margins, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.

The verdict is the first in a series expected after GM admitted to selling cars with faulty ignition switches and recalled a record 30.4m cars and trucks. The two-week lawsuit related to a 2014 crash in which Dionne Spain and Lawrence Barthelemy of New Orleans said they were driving in Spain's 2007 Saturn Sky when, they argued, a faulty switch slipped out of position and caused it to crash. The two plaintiffs said they suffered back pain and other injuries in the accident. GM lawyer Mike Brock argued that the ignition switch was not to be blamed and that the crash was due to to the wintry weather. The jury's verdict was a significant blow to the plaintiffs, who had sought compensation for their injuries and damages. The accident occurred on January 15, 2014, when Spain and Barthelemy were driving on a wet and icy road in New Orleans. According to their testimony, the car's ignition switch suddenly slipped out of position, causing the engine to stall and the vehicle to lose control, ultimately crashing into a guardrail.\n\nHowever, the defense team presented evidence suggesting that the accident was likely caused by the slippery road conditions and excessive speed, rather than the faulty ignition switch. The jury ultimately agreed, finding that the switch was not the proximate cause of the accident.\n\nThe verdict is the first in a series of lawsuits related to the faulty ignition switches, which were installed in millions of GM vehicles. The company has faced widespread criticism and scrutiny for its handling of the recall, which was announced in 2014 but only affected a small percentage of the affected vehicles at the time.\n\nGM has since recalled a record 30.4 million vehicles worldwide, making it one of the largest recalls in automotive history. The company has also faced numerous lawsuits and investigations, including a Congressional probe into its handling of the recall.\n\nThe verdict is a significant setback for the plaintiffs, who had sought compensation for their injuries and damages. The case was closely watched by legal experts and industry observers, who were eager to see how the jury would rule on the issue.\n\nThe verdict also highlights the challenges that plaintiffs may face in proving causation in cases involving complex technical issues, such as faulty ignition switches. It remains to be seen how other lawsuits related to the recall will be resolved, and whether GM will face further legal and regulatory consequences for its actions.\n\nIn a statement, GM said it was pleased with the verdict and would continue to work with its customers to address any concerns they may have. The company has also implemented new procedures to ensure that its vehicles meet the highest safety standards.\n\nThe case is a reminder of the importance of vehicle safety and the need for manufacturers to prioritize the well-being of their customers. As the automotive industry continues to evolve, it is essential that companies prioritize safety and transparency to build trust with their customers.",

Ministers have been urged to press ahead with proposals to force large firms to report their ethnicity pay gap, after the research showed the extent of the salary disparity for Britain's 1.9 million black, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and other minority workers. After taking account of differences in average qualifications and job types, the analysis by the Resolution Foundation found the gap rose to as much as 17%, or Â£3.90 an hour, for black male graduates' pay. The thinktank called on the government to repeat the legislation requiring companies to publish gender pay gaps â€“ but this time for ethnic minorities. Laws that came into force in April exposed the different treatment of male and female employees, finding that eight in 10 firms paid men more than women. The study, which analyzed data from the Office for National Statistics, also found that the ethnicity pay gap is not limited to a specific industry or sector. The gap was found to exist across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and education.\n\nThe research highlights the need for urgent action to address the issue, as the current voluntary approach to reporting ethnicity pay gaps has not led to significant progress. The thinktank is calling on the government to introduce mandatory reporting, similar to the gender pay gap reporting laws, to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for the government to take action on ethnicity pay gaps,\" said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. \"The voluntary approach has not worked, and we need mandatory reporting to shine a light on the issue and drive change.\"\n\nThe study also found that the ethnicity pay gap is not just a problem for individual employees, but also has broader implications for the economy. The thinktank estimates that closing the ethnicity pay gap could add up to Â£3.2 billion to the UK's GDP.\n\nThe government has been under pressure to introduce mandatory reporting of ethnicity pay gaps, with several major companies already calling for the measure. The Labour Party has also pledged to introduce mandatory reporting if it wins the next general election.\n\nIn response to the study, the government has said that it is \"committed to tackling the ethnicity pay gap\" and is considering a range of measures to address the issue. However, the government has not yet committed to introducing mandatory reporting.\n\nThe study's findings are likely to add to the pressure on the government to take action on the issue. The thinktank's research highlights the need for urgent and decisive action to address the ethnicity pay gap and ensure that all employees, regardless of their ethnicity, are treated fairly and equally.",

Although the actor is well known for her humanitarian work with the UN and successful film career, she now faces the challenges of booking guests over the busy Christmas period, ensuring they make it to the BBC's Broadcasting House studios in time for their slot, and managing the egos of the BBC's journalists. Jolie has said she intends to use her episode on 28 December to invite a series of guests who are pioneers in their fields to discuss solutions to violence against women in conflict zones and the global refugee crisis. She will also \"explore themes of justice, accountability and international leadership, hearing directly from refugees and survivors of conflict themselves\". Angelina Jolie's episode of the Today programme is set to be a unique and thought-provoking broadcast, tackling some of the most pressing issues of our time. As a renowned humanitarian and advocate for women's rights, Jolie's perspective on these topics is sure to bring a fresh and insightful perspective to the show.\n\nAccording to sources close to the production, Jolie has been working closely with the BBC's editorial team to curate a diverse range of guests for her episode. Among those set to appear are several high-profile women who have made significant contributions to the fields of human rights, international law, and conflict resolution.\n\nOne of the guests Jolie has invited is Dr. Denis Mukwege, a Congolese gynecologist who has dedicated his life to helping victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mukwege is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and has worked tirelessly to bring attention to the issue of sexual violence as a weapon of war.\n\nAnother guest set to appear is Nadia Murad, a Yazidi human rights activist who was herself a survivor of ISIS's brutal campaign of sexual slavery. Murad has become a leading voice in the fight against human trafficking and sexual violence, and has been recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize for her work.\n\nJolie's episode will also feature a panel discussion with a group of refugee women who have fled conflict zones and are now living in the UK.

        "Text": "A return to grammar school selection in England would be an economic disaster, leaving young people without the skills the country needs, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, has said. Speaking to a conference of Catholic school leaders in London, Wilshaw said selecting pupils by academic ability and giving a grammar school education to the top 20% â€“ as happened in most parts of England until the 1970s â€“ would be \"economic suicide\". He said: \"What we need â€“ because the economy is now so different from when I started teaching â€“ is for more young people to do better than ever before.\" He pointed out that Britain's main economic rivals did not rely on selective education systems. \"I'm a big supporter of comprehensive education. It can work, one size does not have to fit all â€“ if schools have great leadership it can work,\" Wilshaw said in response to a question at the Catholic Association of Teachers Schools and Colleges annual conference. In October a grammar school in Kent was given approval by the Department for Education to open a \"satellite\" selective school in another town. Wilshaw's comments come as the government is considering plans to introduce new grammar schools, which would allow pupils to be selected based on their academic ability. However, the proposal has been met with widespread criticism from education experts, who argue that it would create a two-tier education system and exacerbate social and economic inequalities.\n\nIn his speech, Wilshaw emphasized the importance of providing a comprehensive education to all pupils, regardless of their academic ability. He argued that a selective system would not only be economically disastrous but would also fail to prepare young people for the challenges of the modern economy.\n\n\"We need to be producing young people who are not just academically able but also have the skills and qualities to succeed in a rapidly changing world,\" Wilshaw said. \"Comprehensive education can provide that, but it requires great leadership and a commitment to providing high-quality education to all pupils.\"\n\nWilshaw's comments have been welcomed by many in the education sector, who argue that a return to grammar school selection would be a step backwards for education in England. However, some have criticized Wilshaw's views, arguing that he is out of touch with the needs of modern schools and the demands of the modern economy.\n\nThe debate over grammar school selection is likely to continue in the coming months, with the government expected to announce its plans for education reform in the near future. In the meantime, Wilshaw's comments serve as a reminder of the importance of providing a comprehensive education to all pupils, regardless of their academic ability.\n\nIn related news, the Catholic Association of Teachers Schools and Colleges has announced that it will be launching a new initiative to promote comprehensive education and challenge the government's plans for grammar school selection. The initiative, which will be launched in the coming weeks, will bring together education experts, teachers, and pupils to discuss the benefits of comprehensive education and the challenges of implementing a selective system.\n\nThe Catholic Association of Teachers Schools and Colleges has a long history of promoting comprehensive education and challenging the government's plans for grammar school selection. The organization has been a vocal critic of the government's plans, arguing that they would create a two-tier education system and exacerbate social and economic inequalities.\n\nIn a statement, the organization said that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the government's plans for grammar school selection and would continue to challenge them through its new initiative. The organization also called on the government to prioritize comprehensive education and provide support to schools that are working to provide high-quality education to all pupils.\n\nThe debate over grammar school selection is likely to continue in the coming months, with the government expected to announce its plans for education reform in the near future.

        "Text": "Want to Buy a Ticket to the Space Station? NASA Says Soon You Can\n\nBecoming a NASA astronaut is far harder than getting into Harvard, but soon, ordinary people -- at least rich ones with tens of millions of dollars to blow on a big vacation -- will be able to buy a rocket ride into orbit. NASA announced on Friday that for the first time it is allowing private citizens to fly, if not to the moon, at least to the International Space Station, the only place where people currently live off the planet. NASA is not transforming into a space travel agency. Private companies will have to pay it about $35,000 a night per passenger to sleep in the station's beds and use its amenities, including air, water, the internet and the toilet. (The companies would charge much more to cover rocket flights to and from space, and to make a profit.) Friday's announcement was one of several new policies designed to allow companies to take advantage of the space station as a place for business, something that NASA has often frowned on in the past. \"This is a huge different way for us to do business,\" William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations, said during a news conference at Nasdaq in New York. The announcement could also help resolve questions about the space station's future. The Trump administration last year created tumult when it proposed ending federal financing of the International Space Station by the end of 2024 and move to commercial alternatives that are far from being built. On Friday, NASA officials said the goal was an eventual transition to orbital outposts fully operated by private companies, but there was no set date. \"We're hoping new capabilities will develop that can one day take over for the space station,\" said Robyn Gatens, the deputy space station director for NASA. The move marks a significant shift in NASA's approach to the International Space Station, which has been in operation since 1998. For years, the agency has been criticized for being too restrictive in its use of the station, limiting access to only government-funded research and experiments.\n\nHowever, with the rise of private space companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, NASA is now looking to open up the station to new users. The agency has already partnered with several private companies, including SpaceX, Boeing, and Sierra Nevada Corporation, to develop commercial cargo and crew services.\n\nThe new policy is expected to generate significant revenue for NASA, with the agency estimating that it will earn tens of millions of dollars per year from private companies using the station. The revenue will be used to support NASA's ongoing operations and to fund new initiatives, such as the development of a lunar gateway.\n\nThe announcement has been welcomed by the private space industry, with many companies expressing interest in using the station for a range of purposes, from conducting scientific research to developing new technologies.\n\n\"We see this as a major opportunity to expand our capabilities and to provide new services to our customers,\" said Gwynne Shotwell, the chief operating officer of SpaceX. \"The International Space Station is a unique and valuable resource, and we're excited to be able to use it to further our goals.\"\n\nThe move is also expected to have significant benefits for the scientific community, which has long struggled to access the station due to limited funding and availability.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for scientists,\" said Dr. Ellen Stofan, the director of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. \"The International Space Station is an incredible resource, and now we'll have the opportunity to use it to conduct a wide range of research and experiments.\"\n\nThe first private passengers are expected to arrive at the station in the next few years, with NASA planning to announce the winners of a commercial spaceflight competition in the near future.\n\nThe competition, which is being held in partnership with the National Space Foundation, will award a contract to a private company to develop a commercial spaceflight capability. The winner will be responsible for transporting private passengers to the station, as well as providing a range of services, including food, shelter, and entertainment.\n\nNASA officials say that the competition is expected to generate significant interest, with many private companies already expressing interest in participating.\n\n\"We're expecting a lot of interest in this competition,\" said Robyn Gatens, the deputy space station director for NASA. \"We're looking for a company that can provide a safe and reliable service to our customers, and we're confident that we'll find the right partner.\"\n\nThe move marks a significant milestone in the development of commercial spaceflight, which has long been seen as a key part of NASA's future plans.\n\n\"This is a major step forward for commercial spaceflight,\" said William H. Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations. \"We're excited to be able to open up the International Space Station to private passengers, and we're confident that this will be a major boost to the industry.\"",

        "Text": "Black students continue to struggle to win undergraduate places at UK universities, despite applying in record numbers and equipped with stronger qualifications than previous years. The figures released by the Ucas university admissions clearing house show that last year black school-leavers failed to be offered places at the rates their qualifications and subject choices would suggest. Despite record numbers of applications and better predicted A-level grades and equivalent qualifications, only 70% of black applicants received offers of places, compared with 78% of white applicants and 73% of students from Asian backgrounds. According to Ucas's predictions, 73% of black applications should have been successful. Prof Les Ebdon, director of the office of fair access to higher education, said while the admissions data \"cannot provide conclusive proof that offer-making is biased, it should certainly prompt universities to investigate their admissions policies and practices if the data suggests that certain groups of students receive unusually low offers\". The stark disparity in offer rates has sparked concerns about systemic bias and inequality in the university admissions process. Critics argue that the figures suggest that black students face significant barriers in accessing higher education, despite their academic abilities.\n\nThe data also highlights the significant gap in offer rates between black students and those from Asian backgrounds. While 73% of black applicants received offers, 83% of Asian applicants were successful in securing a place. This disparity has raised questions about the role of cultural and socioeconomic factors in shaping university admissions.\n\nUniversities have been urged to investigate their admissions policies and practices to identify potential biases and ensure fair access to higher education. Prof Ebdon emphasized that the data is not conclusive proof of bias, but rather a prompt for universities to scrutinize their processes.\n\nThe figures come as universities are under increasing pressure to improve diversity and inclusion. The UK government has set targets for universities to increase the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and many institutions are implementing initiatives to attract a more diverse student body.\n\nHowever, some experts argue that the issue runs deeper, and that systemic racism and unconscious bias are likely to be contributing factors. Dr. Naomi Woddis, a sociologist at the University of London, said, \"These figures are not surprising. We know that black students face significant barriers in education, from primary school to university. It's not just about qualifications; it's about the cultural and social capital that students bring to the table.\"\n\nThe Ucas data has sparked a heated debate about the role of universities in promoting social mobility and reducing inequality. As the UK's universities continue to grapple with the issue, many are calling for more transparency and accountability in the admissions process.\n\nIn response to the figures, several universities have announced plans to review their admissions policies and practices. The University of Manchester has launched an investigation into its admissions process, while the University of Birmingham has pledged to increase its recruitment of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nAs the debate continues, black students and their families are left wondering why, despite their hard work and academic achievements, they continue to face significant barriers in accessing higher education. The figures are a stark reminder of the work that still needs to be done to create a more inclusive and equitable education system.",

        "Text": "Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called for moving the world into a \"full-speed recovery\" at a news conference on Thursday at the opening of the fund's annual spring meetings with its sister institution, the World Bank. Ms. Lagarde, echoing an earlier warning, expressed concern about what she called a \"three-speed\" global economy, with developing nations growing rapidly, the United States healing faster than most other advanced industrial countries, but Europe continuing to suffer from insufficient demand and incomplete government policies. \"It's not the healthiest recovery,\" Ms. Lagarde said. But \"we believe that we have avoided the worst, and the economic world no longer looks quite as dangerous as it did.\" Lagarde's remarks came as the IMF and World Bank are set to release their latest economic forecasts, which are expected to show a moderate improvement in the global economy. The organizations are also expected to issue warnings about the risks of a prolonged period of slow growth and the need for policymakers to implement structural reforms to boost economic activity.\n\nDespite the cautious optimism, Lagarde's \"three-speed\" economy warning highlights the stark disparities in economic performance across the globe. Developing countries, such as China and India, have been driving global growth, with their economies expanding at rates of over 6% and 7% respectively. In contrast, advanced economies, such as those in Europe and Japan, are struggling to achieve sustainable growth, with many still grappling with the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe United States, which has been the driving force behind the global recovery, is expected to continue growing at a moderate pace, driven by consumer spending and a rebound in business investment. However, even in the US, there are concerns about the impact of trade tensions and the ongoing debate over fiscal policy, which could undermine the recovery.\n\nLagarde's comments also underscored the need for policymakers to address the issue of insufficient demand, particularly in Europe, where the ongoing debt crisis has led to a lack of confidence in the region's economic prospects. She called for governments to implement policies that boost aggregate demand, such as fiscal stimulus packages and monetary easing, to help stimulate economic growth.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank spring meetings are expected to attract thousands of policymakers, business leaders, and economists from around the world, who will discuss the latest economic trends and challenges. The meetings are also expected to feature a series of high-level seminars and workshops on topics such as sustainable development, financial inclusion, and the impact of technology on the global economy.\n\nIn a separate development, the World Bank announced that it would be increasing its lending to low-income countries, with a focus on projects that promote sustainable development and reduce poverty. The bank's president, David Malpass, said that the organization would be allocating an additional $1 billion to its lending program, with a focus on projects that support renewable energy, healthcare, and education.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank spring meetings are set to conclude on April 28, with the release of the organizations' latest economic forecasts and policy recommendations. The meetings are expected to provide a critical update on the global economy and the challenges that policymakers face in promoting sustainable growth and reducing poverty.",

        "Text": "BRUSSELS -- European Union finance ministers agreed early Thursday on a plan that would require shareholders and creditors to take significant losses when banks collapse. Instead of putting those losses on states, and taxpayers, the new system specifies the order in which banks' investors and creditors, and then their uninsured depositors, will face losses. \"This is a revolutionary change in the way banks are treated in the European Union,\" Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, told a news conference Thursday morning after seven hours of talks. The agreement, which was reached after seven hours of intense negotiations, is a significant step towards strengthening the financial stability of the European Union. Under the new plan, shareholders and creditors will be required to absorb losses when a bank fails, rather than relying on taxpayers to foot the bill.\n\nThe plan specifies a clear order of priority for losses, starting with shareholders and then moving on to creditors, including bondholders and other investors. Only after these groups have taken losses will uninsured depositors, who have deposits above the guaranteed â‚¬100,000, be affected.\n\nThe new system is designed to reduce the risk of future bailouts and to make the financial sector more resilient. It is also expected to increase the confidence of investors and depositors in the European banking system.\n\nThe agreement was welcomed by many in the financial sector, who had been calling for a more robust approach to bank failures. \"This is a major step forward for financial stability in Europe,\" said Peter Praet, chief economist at the European Central Bank. \"It will help to prevent future crises and to reduce the risk of moral hazard, where banks take on excessive risk because they know they will be bailed out if things go wrong.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was pleased with the agreement. Some critics argued that the plan did not go far enough to address the root causes of the financial crisis, and that it would still leave taxpayers vulnerable to future bailouts.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the agreement is seen as a major achievement for the European Union. It demonstrates the bloc's commitment to financial stability and its willingness to take bold action to address the challenges facing the financial sector.\n\nThe plan will now be sent to the European Parliament for approval, and it is expected to come into effect in the coming months.",

        "Text": "The chancellor was correct to announce a tax increase on the self-employed before dramatically withdrawing from his main budget pledge, an independent inquiry into modern employment practices is likely to conclude. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) who has been appointed by the prime minister to lead the review, told MPs on Wednesday that he supported Philip Hammond's since aborted budget announcement and would look to go further by recommending a levelling of the taxation between different classes of workers. Appearing in front of the Commons work and pensions committee, Taylor said: \"It is likely that two of the strategic shifts we will advocate [in the final report due in June] is that over time we will need to move towards a more consistent way of taxing labour.\" The inquiry, which was launched in January, aims to examine the changing nature of work and the impact it has on individuals, businesses, and the economy. Taylor's comments suggest that the review will not only focus on the tax implications but also explore ways to create a more equitable and sustainable employment landscape.\n\nAccording to sources close to the inquiry, Taylor and his team are considering a range of options to achieve a more consistent taxation of labor. These include introducing a single rate of income tax for all workers, regardless of their employment status, and eliminating the distinction between employed and self-employed individuals for tax purposes.\n\nThe proposal has sparked controversy among some business groups, who argue that it would lead to increased costs and bureaucratic red tape. However, supporters of the idea claim that it would simplify the tax system and reduce the complexity and uncertainty that many workers currently face.\n\nThe review is also expected to address other key issues, including the rise of the gig economy and the impact of automation on employment. Taylor has previously spoken about the need for a \"new social contract\" that recognizes the changing nature of work and provides support for workers who are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe inquiry's findings are expected to be published in June, and it is likely to have significant implications for the government's future policy decisions on employment and taxation. The review is seen as a major opportunity to shape the future of work and ensure that it benefits all workers, not just a privileged few.\n\nIn the meantime, the government is under pressure to address the issue of tax inequality and ensure that all workers are treated fairly. The chancellor's decision to withdraw his budget announcement has sparked widespread criticism, and many are calling for a more robust approach to tackling the issue.\n\nAs the inquiry continues, it is clear that the future of work and taxation is set to be a major battleground in the years to come. With the review's findings expected to have far-reaching implications, it is crucial that all stakeholders engage with the process and work together to create a more equitable and sustainable employment landscape.",

This month Santos announced a write-down of the value of its Gladstone gas export project, GLNG, of US$1.5bn. The value of the project dropped because the price it gets for the exported gas is tied to the price of crude oil, which has dropped. But according to an analysis by the pro-renewables financial activist group Market Forces, that write-down of its assets relied on an optimistic prediction for how the oil price will change, with Santos's projections significantly higher than those of competitors Woodside and Beach Energy, brokers such as Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, as well as analysts at the World Bank. According to Santos's own explanation of how its asset's value is tied to oil prices, if it had used Goldman Sachs' projected oil prices rather than its own optimistic ones, the value of its assets would be US$3.5bn less in 2020. Alternatively, if it followed the World Bank's forecast to 2020, its assets would take more than a US$2bn hit that year. Even its peers in the market, Woodside Petroleum and Beach Energy, projected oil prices to 2021 that would result in Santos's assets taking more than a US$1bn write-down most years. The discrepancies in Santos's oil price projections have raised concerns about the company's financial transparency and the accuracy of its asset valuations. Market Forces, the financial activist group that conducted the analysis, has called for greater scrutiny of Santos's accounting practices.\n\n\"Santos's optimistic oil price projections are not only unrealistic but also misleading to investors,\" said Mark McVeigh, a researcher at Market Forces. \"By using inflated oil price projections, Santos is artificially inflating the value of its assets, which can lead to poor investment decisions and a lack of transparency in its financial reporting.\"\n\nThe analysis has also sparked concerns about the impact of Santos's optimistic projections on the broader energy market. If the company's assets are overvalued due to unrealistic oil price projections, it could lead to a misallocation of resources and investments in the energy sector.\n\n\"This is a clear case of Santos's accounting practices being out of touch with reality,\" said a spokesperson for the Australian Institute of Company Directors. \"As a responsible corporate citizen, Santos has a duty to provide accurate and transparent financial reporting to its investors and stakeholders. The company's optimistic oil price projections are a clear breach of this duty.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, Santos has defended its accounting practices, stating that its oil price projections are based on \"sound economic analysis\" and are \"conservative\" compared to other industry players. The company has also maintained that its asset valuations are in line with industry standards and are subject to rigorous internal and external audits.\n\nHowever, the controversy has raised questions about the company's commitment to transparency and accountability. With the energy sector facing increasing scrutiny over its environmental and social impacts, Santos's optimistic oil price projections have sparked concerns about the company's willingness to engage in responsible and sustainable business practices.\n\nAs the debate continues, investors and stakeholders are left to wonder whether Santos's optimistic oil price projections are a sign of a company out of touch with reality or a clever attempt to manipulate its financial reporting. One thing is certain, however: the controversy has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the energy sector, and the importance of accurate and realistic financial reporting for investors and stakeholders alike.",

        "Text": "Daniel Callahan, a pioneering bioethicist who grappled with issues presented by medical advances like organ transplants, prenatal diagnoses and artificial respirators, died on July 16 at a hospital in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He was 88. His son David said the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A leading liberal Roman Catholic thinker who eventually left the church, Mr. Callahan co-founded the Hastings Center in Hastings-on-Hudson, north of New York City, in 1969. The center calls itself the first research institute in the world devoted to bioethics, a field that examines moral uncertainties in medicine, health care and the life sciences. Before he helped establish that field, Mr. Callahan edited Commonweal, the liberal Catholic magazine, from 1961 to 1968. So provocative were his writings that the historian Rodger Van Allen called him \"perhaps the most influential Catholic layman of the 1960s.\" Throughout his career, Daniel Callahan was known for his thought-provoking and often controversial writings on the intersection of medicine, ethics, and religion. His work at the Hastings Center, which he co-founded with Dr. Willard C. Gaylin, a psychiatrist, aimed to provide a platform for interdisciplinary research and dialogue on the complex moral issues arising from medical advancements.\n\nCallahan's work was marked by a commitment to exploring the moral implications of emerging technologies, often challenging the status quo and sparking heated debates. His critiques of prenatal diagnosis, for instance, raised questions about the ethics of aborting fetuses with genetic defects, while his writings on organ transplantation highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the allocation of scarce resources.\n\nDespite his departure from the Catholic Church, Callahan's Catholic background and training continued to influence his work. His writings often reflected a deep concern for the vulnerable and marginalized, as well as a commitment to social justice and human dignity. This was evident in his advocacy for greater access to healthcare, particularly for underserved populations, and his critiques of the commercialization of medicine.\n\nCallahan's impact on the field of bioethics extends far beyond his own writings and research. He played a key role in shaping the Hastings Center into a leading institution for bioethics research and education, and his work has influenced generations of scholars, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.\n\nIn addition to his academic and professional accomplishments, Callahan was also a devoted family man and friend. His son, David, remembered him as a kind and generous person who was always willing to listen and offer guidance. \"He had a way of making you feel like you were the most important person in the room,\" David said.\n\nAs news of Callahan's passing spread, tributes poured in from across the bioethics community and beyond. Dr. Gaylin, his co-founder at the Hastings Center, described him as \"a towering figure in the field of bioethics, whose intellect, passion, and commitment to social justice inspired countless people.\"\n\nIn the years to come, the legacy of Daniel Callahan will continue to shape the conversation around the ethical implications of medical advances. His work reminds us of the importance of considering the moral dimensions of our actions, and the need for ongoing dialogue and reflection in the pursuit of a more just and compassionate society.",

        "Text": "The FTSE 100 tumbled to a 16-week low as investors reacted to North Korea's latest missile test by dumping shares on the London stock market. Stocks listed in Paris and Frankfurt also fell on Tuesday and the dollar came under pressure, underscoring the flight from equities to safe haven assets, including gold. The index of blue chip companies was down more than 1% before rallying to close at 7,337, down 64 points or 0.9%, following the news that a North Korean ballistic missile had flown over Hokkaido in northern Japan. The German Dax was the worst affected, falling by 1.5%, while the French CAC was down 1%. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"The standoff between the US and North Korea never went away, and as of last night it is back in the forefront of traders' minds. The sudden and drastic decline in the FTSE 100 and other European stock markets was a direct result of the heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea. The missile test, which saw a ballistic missile fly over the Japanese island of Hokkaido, sent shockwaves through the global financial community, causing investors to flock to safe-haven assets such as gold and the dollar.\n\nThe move away from equities was particularly pronounced in Germany, where the Dax index fell by 1.5%, its largest single-day decline in over a year. The French CAC index also suffered, dropping by 1% as investors sought to reduce their exposure to riskier assets.\n\nAccording to David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, the sudden resurgence of tensions between the US and North Korea was the primary catalyst for the market's decline. \"The standoff between the US and North Korea never went away, and as of last night it is back in the forefront of traders' minds,\" he said.\n\nMadden added that the market's reaction was not unexpected, given the significant risks associated with a potential conflict between the two nations. \"The potential for a military conflict between the US and North Korea is a major concern for investors, and it's not surprising that we're seeing a flight to safety as a result,\" he said.\n\nThe dollar, which is often seen as a safe-haven asset, gained ground against major currencies such as the euro and the pound, as investors sought to reduce their exposure to riskier assets. Gold, which is also seen as a safe-haven asset, rose to its highest level in over a month, as investors sought to diversify their portfolios away from equities.\n\nDespite the market's decline, analysts remain cautious about the potential for a prolonged period of volatility. \"While the market's reaction to the latest developments is understandable, it's important to remember that the situation between the US and North Korea is complex and subject to change,\" said Madden.\n\nIn the meantime, investors will be closely watching the situation for any signs of de-escalation or further escalation, and the market's reaction will likely be influenced by any developments that may arise.",

        "Text": "Americans say they feel more optimistic about the economy since President Trump was elected. But they certainly are not acting that way, and that is shaping up to be a challenge for his administration. Consumers pulled back sharply on spending in early 2017, the Commerce Department said on Friday, reducing the economy's quarterly growth to its lowest level in three years. In fact, the 0.7 percent annual growth rate for the period is far below the 2.5 percent pace in President Barack Obama's final three months in office, let alone Mr. Trump's 4 percent target. The caution among consumers was particularly notable on big purchases like automobiles. Other indicators were stronger -- businesses invested at a healthy pace -- but that was not enough to offset the headwinds from feeble retail sales and falling inventories. The softness last quarter also provides crucial ammunition for the Trump administration's arguments that big tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks are necessary for the economy to grow the way it did in the 1980s and 1990s. Tax cuts, regulatory relief, trade renegotiations and an unfettered energy sector are needed \"to overcome the dismal economy inherited by the Trump administration,\" said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. \"Business and consumer sentiment is strong, but both must be released from the regulatory and tax shackles constraining economic growth.\" Despite the Commerce Department's report painting a gloomy picture of the economy, many economists argue that the slowdown is largely a result of temporary factors, such as the usual post-holiday lull and a decline in auto sales. Additionally, some point out that the economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace, and that the job market remains strong.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration is using the data to bolster its argument for major tax reforms and deregulation. In a statement, the White House claimed that the report \"confirms the need for bold action to unleash the full potential of the American economy.\" The administration is pushing for a massive tax cut package, which would reduce corporate and individual tax rates, as well as eliminate certain deductions and loopholes.\n\nSome economists, however, are warning that the proposed tax cuts could have unintended consequences, such as increasing the national debt and widening the income gap. They argue that the administration's focus on tax cuts and deregulation is too narrow and neglects other important factors that drive economic growth, such as investing in education and infrastructure.\n\nThe debate over the economy's trajectory is likely to continue in the coming weeks and months, as the Trump administration works to pass its tax reform package through Congress. Meanwhile, consumers and businesses will be keeping a close eye on the economy's performance, waiting to see if the slowdown is a temporary blip or a sign of more significant challenges ahead.\n\nIn the meantime, the Commerce Department's report has sparked concerns about the impact of the economy's slowdown on certain industries, such as retail and manufacturing. Retailers, in particular, are struggling to adapt to changing consumer habits and the rise of e-commerce, and a prolonged slowdown could exacerbate their difficulties.\n\nManufacturers, on the other hand, are facing challenges related to global trade and the strong dollar, which has made their exports more expensive for foreign buyers. The Commerce Department's report highlights the need for the Trump administration to address these issues and implement policies that support American businesses and workers.\n\nAs the debate over the economy's future continues, one thing is clear: the Trump administration's ability to pass its tax reform package and implement its economic agenda will depend on its ability to convince Americans that its policies will lead to sustained economic growth and prosperity.",

Wesfarmers, which bought the business for Â£340m two years ago, said it was offloading the entire 250-store Homebase chain, which has a workforce of just over 11,000. All 24 of the stores it rebranded to Bunnings will become Homebase again once the deal completes at the end of June. The Australian firm said it expects to make a loss of up to Â£230m on the disposal. The sale of Homebase to Hilco, a renowned restructuring specialist, marks the end of Wesfarmers' ambitious foray into the UK DIY market. The Australian conglomerate had acquired Homebase in 2016 for Â£340 million, with plans to revamp the struggling chain and make it a major player in the UK market. However, the venture has been plagued by difficulties, including a decline in sales and profitability, leading to a significant write-down in the company's value.\n\nThe decision to offload Homebase comes as a major blow to the thousands of employees who work at the chain, with many facing an uncertain future. The 11,000-strong workforce is expected to be significantly reduced, with Hilco likely to implement cost-cutting measures to turn the business around. The rebranding of 24 stores to Bunnings, a popular Australian DIY chain, has also been reversed, with all stores reverting back to the Homebase name once the deal is completed.\n\nIndustry experts have expressed concerns about the impact of the sale on the UK DIY market, with some predicting that the loss of a major player could lead to a consolidation of the market. \"The sale of Homebase is a significant event in the UK DIY market, and it's likely to have a ripple effect on the industry,\" said John Smith, a retail analyst at Kantar Worldpanel. \"While Hilco has a good track record of turning around struggling businesses, it's unclear what their plans are for Homebase, and how they intend to restore the chain to its former glory.\"\n\nWesfarmers' decision to sell Homebase at a significant loss is seen as a major setback for the company, which had been banking on the UK venture to drive growth and expansion. The disposal of Homebase is expected to result in a loss of up to Â£230 million, a significant write-down from the company's initial investment.\n\nHilco, which has a proven track record of turning around struggling businesses, including the acquisition of HMV, is expected to implement a range of cost-cutting measures to restore Homebase to profitability. The company has a reputation for being able to identify and capitalize on undervalued assets, and it's likely to bring its expertise to bear in an effort to revitalize the Homebase brand.\n\nAs the deal is set to complete at the end of June, the future of Homebase remains uncertain. While Hilco has a significant challenge on its hands, the company's expertise and experience in the retail sector make it a strong contender to turn the business around. However, the fate of the thousands of employees who work at Homebase remains uncertain, and it's unclear what the future holds for the UK DIY chain.",

        "Text": "Fruit Flies and Mice to Get New Home on Space Station, at Least Temporarily\n\nA bit of science trivia: Did you know that the heart of a fruit fly beats at about the same pace as yours? That's among the reasons that 400 adult fruit flies and 2,000 eggs are packed to go to the International Space Station, for an experiment on long-term weightlessness and how it might affect the cardiovascular health of astronauts. \"It's not as weird as you might think,\" said Karen Ocorr, a professor at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and a co-investigator on the experiment. Although the structure of a fly heart is very different than that of a human, the cardiovascular system shares many of the same cellular components in addition to the similar heartbeats. By comparison, the hearts of rats and mice beat about 10 times as fast as those of people. Fruit flies, Dr. Ocorr said, are \"actually much closer in some respects to humans than the mouse or rat models are.\" The fruit flies, as well as 40 mice for another experiment, are waiting to travel on a SpaceX mission that was called off Thursday with less than a half-hour left in the countdown because of a nearby lightning strike. The rocket is to lift a Dragon capsule with nearly 6,000 pounds of supplies, equipment and experiments including the fruit flies and mice. The next opportunity is Saturday at 5:07 p.m. If the rocket gets off the ground then -- forecasters expect more unsettled weather -- it would arrive at the space station on Monday, when the space station crew will grab the Dragon capsule and attach it to a docking port. The delayed launch of the SpaceX mission has added an extra layer of excitement and anticipation for the scientific community, as the experiments on board are crucial to understanding the effects of long-term weightlessness on living organisms. The fruit flies, in particular, are being studied to gain insights into the cardiovascular health of astronauts, as their heartbeats and cardiovascular systems share many similarities with those of humans.\n\nAccording to Dr. Ocorr, the fruit flies will be placed in specialized enclosures on the International Space Station, where they will be monitored for changes in their behavior, physiology, and anatomy. The experiment aims to identify any potential risks or challenges that astronauts may face during extended periods of space travel, and to develop strategies for mitigating these effects.\n\nThe inclusion of mice in the experiment is also significant, as they are commonly used as a model organism in scientific research. The mice will be studying the effects of space travel on their immune systems, which could have important implications for the health and well-being of astronauts.\n\nThe SpaceX mission is expected to be a major milestone in the history of space exploration, marking the first time that a commercial spacecraft has carried scientific experiments to the International Space Station. The success of the mission will pave the way for future collaborations between SpaceX and the scientific community, and will help to advance our understanding of the effects of space travel on living organisms.\n\nAs the countdown to the rescheduled launch continues, scientists and space enthusiasts alike are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Dragon capsule at the International Space Station. The successful completion of the experiment will not only provide valuable insights into the effects of long-term weightlessness on living organisms, but will also mark a significant step forward in our understanding of the universe and our place within it.",

        "Text": "The boss of York-based housebuilder Persimmon is under increasing pressure to donate some of his Â£110m bonus to charity, as calculations reveal that his pay deal could be used to provide a council house for every homeless family in Yorkshire. Jeff Fairburn, 53, who joined Persimmon as a trainee when he was 17, will on Sunday receive the first instalment of a Â£110m share bonus which has been criticised by politicians, charities and corporate governance experts as \"obscene\". The company's chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, is understood to have suggested Fairburn donate some of the bonus â€“ which has been largely fuelled by the taxpayer-backed help-to-buy scheme â€“ to charity. Wrigley quit the company earlier this month, blaming himself for not doing more to cap the amount Fairburn could collect. Fairburn, who grew up in York and went to the city's Fulford comprehensive school, has repeatedly declined to comment about whether he intends to donate any of his bonus to charity. A spokesman for Persimmon said: \"That is a private family matter for the individuals.\" The Guardian has calculated, using government figures, that Fairburn's Â£110m bonus could be used to build 1,375 council houses. A donation of Â£4.6m â€“ just 1/25th of Fairburn's bonus â€“ could provide a home for all of the 58 homeless families in York. The revelation has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for Fairburn to use his bonus to address the region's housing crisis. \"It's staggering that one person can receive such a massive payout while thousands of families in Yorkshire are struggling to find a roof over their heads,\" said Sarah Jones, a local resident and activist. \"Jeff Fairburn has a unique opportunity to make a real difference in his community, and we urge him to consider using his bonus to build affordable homes for those in need.\"\n\nThe news has also raised questions about the role of government-backed schemes in perpetuating inequality. The help-to-buy scheme, which provided billions of pounds in subsidies to Persimmon and other housebuilders, was designed to help first-time buyers get on the property ladder. However, critics argue that the scheme has largely benefited developers and investors, rather than the intended recipients.\n\n\"This is a classic example of how government policies can create unintended consequences,\" said Dr. Helen Taylor, a housing expert at the University of York. \"The help-to-buy scheme was meant to increase home ownership, but instead it's been used to line the pockets of executives like Jeff Fairburn. It's time for the government to rethink its approach and prioritize affordable housing for all.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, Fairburn remains tight-lipped about his plans for the bonus. His spokesman has refused to comment on the matter, and the company has declined to provide any further information. However, many are holding out hope that Fairburn will see the error of his ways and use his bonus to make a positive impact in his community.\n\nIn the meantime, local charities and community groups are stepping up to fill the gap. The York Housing Association, a non-profit organization that provides affordable housing and support services to vulnerable families, has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for a new housing project. \"We're not asking for handouts or government funding â€“ we're just asking the community to come together and support our efforts to provide safe and affordable housing for all,\" said Emma Thompson, the organization's director.\n\nAs the debate rages on, one thing is clear: the housing crisis in Yorkshire is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. While Jeff Fairburn's bonus may be a symbol of the problem, it's just the tip of the iceberg. It's time for policymakers, developers, and the community to come together and find a solution that works for everyone.",

The lengthy search, begun after Brian Krzanich was forced out in June for a past affair with a subordinate, illustrates the difficulty of finding a leader with the diverse skills needed to run one of Silicon Valley's most complex companies. Intel, which hosted a conference call Thursday to discuss the financial results of its most recent quarter, said its directors were conducting the search with \"a sense of urgency\" but gave no timetable for a selection. \"I am convinced the board of directors will close on a new C.E.O. in the near future,\" said Robert Swan, Intel's chief financial officer, who is also serving as acting chief executive. Intel, which has 107,000 employees, sells the vast majority of processors that power personal computers as well as larger machines that run the web. It turns silicon wafers into chips in some of the world's most sophisticated factories -- sites that cost $5 billion to $10 billion each -- and employs an army of chemical engineers, physicists, system architects, chip designers and computer programmers. The company, which turned 50 last year, has never drawn a top executive from outside its own ranks. Indeed, Intel was once known for signaling the promotion of an internal candidate to its top job years in advance. That tradition broke down with Paul Otellini's surprise decision to resign in November 2012. Intel's board considered external candidates before settling the following May on Mr. Krzanich, an Intel manufacturing specialist. As Intel's search for a new CEO continues, many are left wondering what qualities the company is looking for in its next leader. According to sources familiar with the matter, Intel's board of directors is seeking a candidate with a deep understanding of the technology industry, as well as experience in leading complex organizations.\n\nOne potential candidate who has been mentioned as a possibility is Pat Gelsinger, a former Intel executive who currently serves as the CEO of VMware. Gelsinger has a strong background in the tech industry, having worked at Intel for 30 years before leaving in 2009 to become the CEO of EMC. He has also been a vocal advocate for the importance of STEM education and has been involved in various philanthropic efforts.\n\nAnother potential candidate is Bob Swan, Intel's current CFO and acting CEO. Swan has been with Intel for over 20 years and has a deep understanding of the company's financials and operations. He has also been a key player in Intel's efforts to diversify its business and expand into new markets.\n\nDespite the company's efforts to find a new CEO, many are still waiting for a clear timeline on when a decision will be made. Intel's board of directors has given no indication of when they expect to announce a new CEO, and many are left wondering if the company will be able to find a suitable candidate in the near future.\n\nIn the meantime, Intel's employees are left to wonder what the future holds for the company. Many are hoping that the company will be able to find a new CEO who will be able to lead the company in the right direction and help it to continue to innovate and grow.\n\nFor Intel, finding the right CEO is crucial. The company is facing increasing competition in the tech industry, and it needs a leader who can help it to stay ahead of the curve. With its long history of innovation and its strong brand, Intel has the potential to be a major player in the tech industry for years to come. But it will need a strong leader to help it to achieve its goals.\n\nIn the end, Intel's search for a new CEO is a critical moment for the company. It is a chance for the company to find a leader who can help it to continue to innovate and grow, and who can help it to stay ahead of the competition. With so much at stake, it is no wonder that many are watching Intel's search for a new CEO with great interest.",

        "Text": "The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has called for a government investigation into the use of high-cost bank loans after a report found local councils stand to waste up to Â£16bn on interest payments over the next 40 years. Figures compiled by the investigative cooperative Research for Action show that local governments that were saddled with complex borrowing schemes in the early 2000s could halve their annual interest payments if those debts were paid off with cash borrowed from the government's Public Works Loan Board (PWLB). The report explains that the top 10 council borrowers of lender option borrower option loans â€“ knows as Lobos â€“ stand to save as much as Â£4bn over the next four decades, while the 240 councils with high-interest lobo loans could collectively save up to Â£16n. McDonnell has called for government action. He said: \"The government has a role to play now in ensuring there is a full, independent and open investigation into the use of these financial instruments and action taken to restore any historic loss to the public purse.\" The Shadow Chancellor's Call for Investigation Sparks Debate Among Councils and Financial Experts\n\nThe report's findings have sparked a heated debate among local councils, financial experts, and government officials, with some arguing that the investigation is long overdue while others claim that the issue is being exaggerated.\n\nA spokesperson for the Local Government Association (LGA) acknowledged that the high-interest loans have been a concern for many councils, but emphasized that the situation is not as dire as the report suggests. \"While we agree that the interest rates on some of these loans are excessive, we believe that the figures are being distorted to make a point,\" the spokesperson said. \"Many councils have managed to negotiate better deals with lenders and are making progress in paying off their debts.\"\n\nHowever, financial experts and opposition parties have come out in support of the Shadow Chancellor's call for an investigation. \"This is a clear case of financial mismanagement by local councils, and the government has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayers' money is being used efficiently,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a financial expert at the University of London. \"The Public Works Loan Board is a much cheaper and more transparent option for councils, and it's astonishing that more of them haven't taken advantage of it.\"\n\nThe report's authors have also defended their findings, pointing out that the figures are based on a comprehensive analysis of council borrowing data and financial statements. \"Our research shows that the use of high-cost loans has been a widespread problem, and it's not just a few rogue councils that have been affected,\" said Sarah Jones, the report's lead author. \"We believe that a full investigation is necessary to get to the bottom of this issue and ensure that councils are held accountable for their financial decisions.\"\n\nThe government has so far refused to comment on the report's findings, but opposition parties are likely to continue to press for an investigation. With local elections just around the corner, the issue is likely to become a key point of contention in the campaign.\n\nIn the meantime, councils are being advised to review their borrowing strategies and consider alternative options for financing their projects. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the use of high-cost bank loans has become a major issue in local government finance, and it's up to the government to take action to ensure that taxpayers' money is being used responsibly.",

        "Text": "The Cancer Drugs Fund, set up by the government to pay for expensive medicines that the NHS would not normally finance, failed to benefit patients and may have resulted in some of them suffering unnecessarily from toxic side-effects, experts say. An analysis in a leading cancer journal has found that the fund paid out Â£1.27bn from 2010 to 2016 â€“ an amount that would have paid for an entire year of mainstream cancer drugs for the NHS. But medicine it paid for was not worth the money, the report concluded. The analysis in the Annals of Oncology journal looked at 29 cancer drugs approved for 47 different types of treatment (known as indications), some of which were approved to treat more than one cancer. They found that only 18 of the 47 treatments prolonged the patient's life, and then only by an average of three months. Many of the drugs were approved by the fund on the basis of clinical trials that aimed only for what is called \"progression-free survival\", where there is no sign in a scan or test that the cancer is growing. But patients often did not live any longer because the cancer would come back suddenly with lethal force. The experts from London, Bristol and New York said that, from the patient's perspective, increased progression-free survival might not be a benefit at all, since it not infrequently came with toxic side-effects. Prof Richard Sullivan, of the institute of cancer policy at King's College London, one of the authors, said the Cancer Drugs Fund had been \"a massive health error\". It was set up in 2010 because of the public outcry whenever the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) turned down a new cancer drug for NHS use on the grounds that it was not cost-effective. The establishment of the fund was one of David Cameron's election pledges. The experts' findings have raised serious concerns about the effectiveness of the Cancer Drugs Fund and its impact on patients. The analysis suggests that the fund's approach to approving new cancer treatments was flawed, prioritizing \"progression-free survival\" over actual patient outcomes.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for the Cancer Drugs Fund and the entire cancer treatment system,\" said Prof Sullivan. \"We need to rethink our approach to cancer treatment and focus on what really matters to patients â€“ extending their lives and improving their quality of life.\"\n\nThe report's authors are calling for a more rigorous approach to evaluating the effectiveness of new cancer treatments, one that takes into account not just progression-free survival but also overall patient outcomes, including quality of life and survival rates.\n\nThe Cancer Drugs Fund was established in response to public pressure and concerns about the NHS's ability to access new and innovative cancer treatments. However, the fund's approach has been criticized for prioritizing expensive treatments over more affordable and effective options.\n\nThe report's findings have also raised questions about the role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) in evaluating new cancer treatments. Nice is responsible for making recommendations on the use of new treatments in the NHS, but its decisions are often influenced by the availability of funding.\n\nThe Cancer Drugs Fund's failure to deliver meaningful benefits to patients has significant implications for the NHS and the cancer treatment system as a whole. The fund's budget has been increasing annually, and its failure to deliver value for money raises concerns about the sustainability of the NHS's cancer treatment program.\n\nThe report's authors are urging policymakers and healthcare professionals to take a closer look at the Cancer Drugs Fund and to consider alternative approaches to cancer treatment.

When they aren't providing information about delays and pile-ups, they offer little reminders to drivers, like \"Allow motorbikes to pass safely\"; \"Leave more space on wet roads\" and \"Fasten seat belts\" (though that last one should be a given really, especially at 70mph on a wet motorway with a motorbike behind you). But I think they are missing a trick. **Highway Wisdom: Motorway Signs Get a Makeover**\n\nThe humble motorway sign, a staple of our daily commutes, is often overlooked as a tool to improve road safety and driver behavior. But what if these signs could do more than just display traffic updates and roadwork notifications? What if they could actually help prevent accidents and reduce congestion?\n\nAs I drove along the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh, I couldn't help but notice the array of signs lining the motorway. While they provide valuable information about road conditions and traffic incidents, I think they're missing an opportunity to educate and engage drivers in a more meaningful way.\n\nOne area where motorway signs could be improved is in providing real-time advice on driving techniques and best practices. For example, signs could display tips on how to handle different road conditions, such as wet or icy roads, or offer guidance on how to navigate complex junctions or roundabouts. This could be especially useful for new or inexperienced drivers, who may not be familiar with the specific road conditions or rules of the road in the UK.\n\nAnother potential benefit of upgraded motorway signs is the ability to provide real-time traffic updates and suggestions for alternative routes. This could help reduce congestion and minimize the impact of accidents or roadworks on traffic flow. By providing drivers with more accurate and timely information, motorway signs could help reduce stress and frustration on the roads, making the daily commute a more pleasant experience.\n\nIn addition to these practical applications, motorway signs could also be used to promote road safety and awareness campaigns. For example, signs could display messages about the importance of wearing seatbelts, the dangers of distracted driving, or the consequences of speeding. By using visual and attention-grabbing messages, motorway signs could help reinforce these important safety messages and encourage drivers to adopt safer habits.\n\nWhile upgrading motorway signs to include more informative and interactive content may seem like a simple idea, it could have a significant impact on road safety and driver behavior. By providing drivers with more accurate and timely information, promoting road safety and awareness campaigns, and offering real-time advice on driving techniques, motorway signs could become a powerful tool in the fight against road accidents and congestion.\n\nSo, the next time you're driving along the M8, take a closer look at the signs. Who knows, you might just learn something new that could help keep you and other drivers safe on the roads.",

Travelling at 9,000mph, the deep hum hurtled past earthquake detection systems unnoticed. The unusual phenomenon was first detected by a network of seismometers in the Indian Ocean, which picked up the low-frequency hum on November 11. Initially, scientists were puzzled by the reading, as it did not match any known seismic activity or natural phenomenon. The hum was so unusual that it even bypassed the sensitive earthquake detection systems, leaving researchers scratching their heads.\n\nAs news of the mystery hum spread, scientists from around the world began to take notice. The French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) quickly mobilized its team of experts to investigate the phenomenon. Led by Dr. Sophie Durand, a seismologist at the CNRS, the team began to analyze the data and try to pinpoint the source of the hum.\n\nAfter weeks of analysis, the team finally made a breakthrough. Using advanced computer simulations and seismic data, they were able to pinpoint the source of the hum to a specific location near the French island of Mayotte, located off the west coast of Madagascar. The team's findings were published in the journal Nature on December 15, sending shockwaves through the scientific community.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's interior and the movement of tectonic plates. According to Dr. Durand, the hum is likely caused by the movement of magma deep beneath the Earth's surface. \"This is a major breakthrough in our understanding of the Earth's internal dynamics,\" she said in an interview. \"The hum is a sign that the Earth's mantle is in motion, and this has significant implications for our understanding of plate tectonics and the movement of the continents.\"\n\nThe discovery has also sparked renewed interest in the study of low-frequency seismic activity, which is often overlooked in favor of more dramatic and attention-grabbing events like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As scientists continue to study the hum, they hope to learn more about the Earth's internal workings and the mysteries that lie beneath our feet.",

Kavanaugh unspooled over nearly nine hours on Thursday -- about the length of a prestige mini-series, binged Netflix-style in one wrenching, riveting sitting. The mini-series contained multitudes. It was a political drama that doubled as a reality show. It was an interrogation of gender, class and power in #MeToo America. It was a duel of clashing narrators. And it had elements of a major sports broadcast, a showdown between rival squads complete with halftime commentary. As much as the proceedings reflected a nation bitterly divided -- \"This is hell,\" Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, declared around hour seven -- it also produced a rare collective civic moment. Every major broadcast and cable network suspended regular programming to carry gavel-to-gavel coverage. As the nation watched, Dr. Ford's testimony painted a vivid picture of a summer evening in 1982, when she alleges Judge Kavanaugh, then a 17-year-old high school student, sexually assaulted her at a gathering in Montgomery County, Maryland. Her words were laced with emotion and conviction, as she recounted the details of the alleged attack, including the sound of Judge Kavanaugh's laughter and the feeling of helplessness as she tried to escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Judge Kavanaugh's testimony was marked by defiance and denial, as he repeatedly denied the allegations and portrayed himself as a victim of political revenge. His testimony was peppered with assertions of his innocence, and he accused Democrats of orchestrating a \"search and destroy\" mission against him.\n\nThe drama unfolding on Capitol Hill was not just a clash of personalities, but also a reflection of the deeply divided nation. The hearing room was filled with protesters, both pro-Kavanaugh and anti-Kavanaugh, who chanted and held signs as the senators deliberated.\n\nDespite the intense emotions and charged atmosphere, the hearing also saw moments of humanity and empathy. Senators from both sides of the aisle, including Senator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), spoke movingly about the importance of believing survivors of sexual assault and the need for a thorough investigation.\n\nAs the hearing drew to a close, it was clear that the drama would continue to unfold in the days and weeks to come. The Senate Judiciary Committee will now review the testimony and decide whether to recommend Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate. Meanwhile, Dr. Ford's allegations will likely be the subject of further investigation and scrutiny.\n\nThe impact of the hearing was not limited to Washington, D.C. It sparked a national conversation about sexual assault, power, and accountability. Social media platforms were flooded with messages of support for Dr. Ford and other survivors of sexual assault, while others criticized the handling of the hearing and the nomination process.\n\nIn the end, the Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was a powerful reminder of the importance of listening to survivors of sexual assault and the need for a more nuanced and compassionate approach to addressing these issues. As the nation continues to grapple with the implications of the hearing, one thing is clear: the conversation has only just begun.",

A club member and journalist reported on the menu shortly afterward in The Christian Science Monitor, and club members have been talking about it ever since. \"At my first dinner, when I was a new member, they told me about it,\" said Jack Horner, a dinosaur paleontologist at Montana State University and an inspiration for the character of the paleontologist in the original \"Jurassic Park\" book. \"And they were talking about having another.\" The story has to begin with the meat itself, originally billed on the menu as Megatherium, an extinct ground sloth, but recalled over the decades as mammoth, perhaps because that was what it was called in the article in The Monitor. What it was finally determined to be will, of course, have to wait until the end of the story. Eating fossil meat may seem hazardous, but animals that died thousands of years ago have been found frozen, and the Yale researchers point to credible reports of paleontologists sampling the ancient flesh of extinct bison and mammoth. Care is called for, however, since the meat may have rotted before the cold preserved it. The reason it was even possible to check what the diners ate is that some leftovers ended up on a shelf in the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. In the years following the 1951 dinner, the story of the fossil meat served at the Explorers Club gathering continued to spread, with many club members sharing tales of the exotic and ancient delicacy. However, the exact origin of the meat remained a mystery, with some claiming it was indeed mammoth and others insisting it was the extinct ground sloth, Megatherium.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1990s, when a team of researchers from Yale University began to investigate the story, that the truth about the fossil meat finally began to unravel. Led by Dr. Daniel Fisher, a paleontologist at Yale, the team set out to identify the species of the meat served at the dinner.\n\nUsing advanced DNA analysis techniques, the researchers were able to extract and sequence the DNA from the remaining leftovers, which had been stored in the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. After months of painstaking work, the team finally made a groundbreaking discovery: the meat served at the Explorers Club dinner was, in fact, a type of bison, specifically the extinct species Bison occidentalis.\n\nThe discovery was met with excitement and surprise within the scientific community, with many experts hailing the finding as a major breakthrough in the field of paleontology. The story of the fossil meat also gained widespread media attention, with articles and documentaries exploring the fascinating tale of how a group of explorers and paleontologists had managed to taste a piece of history.\n\nFor Jack Horner, the dinosaur paleontologist who had been fascinated by the story of the fossil meat since his early days as a club member, the discovery was a thrilling vindication of his long-held suspicions. \"I always knew it was something special,\" he said in an interview. \"Now we have the proof. It's a remarkable story, and I'm thrilled to have been a part of it.\"\n\nThe story of the 1951 Explorers Club dinner may have started as a curious footnote in the annals of culinary history, but it has since become a legendary tale of adventure, discovery, and the power of science to uncover the secrets of the past.",

The notification has left many homeowners wondering what their options are and what the implications of not settling the balance within the given timeframe could be.\n\nFor those who are facing a similar situation, it's essential to understand the importance of discussing their options with the lender. \"Interest-only mortgages were designed to allow homeowners to pay only the interest on their loan each month, with the expectation that they would pay off the capital at a later date,\" explains Sarah Johnson, a mortgage expert at a leading financial advisory firm. \"However, with many homeowners struggling to make ends meet, it's not uncommon for borrowers to find themselves in a situation where they need to restructure their mortgage to make it more manageable.\"\n\nSo, what are the options available to homeowners in this situation? One option is to switch to a repayment mortgage, where the borrower pays off the capital and interest each month. This can be a good option for those who have a stable income and are confident that they can afford to make the increased monthly payments.\n\nAnother option is to extend the mortgage term. This can help reduce the monthly payments, but it's essential to consider the long-term implications of doing so. \"Extending the mortgage term can lead to paying more interest over the life of the loan, so it's crucial to weigh up the pros and cons before making a decision,\" warns Johnson.\n\nHomeowners may also be able to remortgage their property to a new lender, which can provide access to more competitive interest rates and potentially lower monthly payments. However, this option may come with fees and charges, and borrowers should carefully review the terms and conditions before making a decision.\n\nIt's also important for homeowners to consider seeking professional advice from a financial advisor or mortgage broker. They can help assess the borrower's financial situation and provide personalized recommendations for repaying the mortgage.\n\nIn conclusion, homeowners who are facing the challenge of repaying an interest-only mortgage should not panic. By discussing their options with their lender and seeking professional advice, they can find a solution that meets their needs and helps them get back on track with their mortgage repayments.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman said Wednesday that the government had to make \"difficult choices\" to address its gaping deficits and warned that \"postponing them will only make them more difficult.\" The chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that a credible plan for reining in federal deficits could help lower long-term interest rates. \"Although sizable deficits are unavoidable in the near term, maintaining the confidence of the public and financial markets requires that policy makers move decisively to set the federal budget on a trajectory toward sustainable fiscal balance,\" he said. In testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Bernanke said that a moderate recovery had begun, but that it would take \"a significant amount of time\" to restore the 8.5 million jobs lost in the last two years. Of particular concern, he said, was that 44 percent of the unemployed in March had been jobless for at least six months. Inflation, the other side of Mr. Bernanke's mandate as Fed chairman, remains low. Personal consumption spending, the index of inflation the Fed uses the most, has been rising at an annual rate of 1.25 percent. Excluding the more volatile prices of food and energy, core inflation has slowed to an annual rate of 0.5 percent. Mr. Bernanke did not provide new details on the Fed's policy stance that short-term interest rates would remain near zero for \"an extended period.\" He said that time frame was contingent on high unemployment, subdued inflation and stable inflation expectations. Bernanke's remarks came as the government is grappling with a massive budget deficit, which is projected to reach $1.6 trillion this year. The deficit has been fueled by a combination of factors, including the economic stimulus package passed in 2009 and the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThe Fed chairman's warning about the need to address the deficit comes as lawmakers are struggling to reach a deal on a budget plan for the next fiscal year. The White House has proposed a budget that would reduce the deficit by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, but Congressional Republicans have expressed concerns about the plan's reliance on tax increases.\n\nBernanke's comments also highlighted the ongoing challenges facing the US economy. Despite the moderate recovery that has begun, the unemployment rate remains high, and the job market is still struggling to regain its footing. The Fed chairman noted that the 8.5 million jobs lost in the last two years will take a significant amount of time to restore, and that the 44 percent of unemployed individuals who have been jobless for at least six months are a particular concern.\n\nIn addition to the job market, Bernanke also touched on the issue of inflation, which remains low. The Fed chairman noted that personal consumption spending, the index of inflation the Fed uses the most, has been rising at an annual rate of 1.25 percent, and that core inflation has slowed to an annual rate of 0.5 percent. However, Bernanke also emphasized the need for the Fed to remain vigilant and monitor inflation closely, as a sudden increase in prices could have negative consequences for the economy.\n\nThe Fed chairman's testimony came as the central bank is preparing to hold its next policy meeting, at which it is expected to announce its decision on interest rates. While Bernanke did not provide new details on the Fed's policy stance, he did reiterate that short-term interest rates would remain near zero for an extended period, contingent on high unemployment, subdued inflation, and stable inflation expectations.\n\nOverall, Bernanke's comments highlighted the ongoing challenges facing the US economy, including the need to address the budget deficit and the ongoing struggles in the job market. However, the Fed chairman also expressed optimism about the economy's potential for growth, and emphasized the need for policymakers to work together to address these challenges and promote a strong and sustainable recovery.",

The new-look show's critical and commercial success has more than justified the Â£75m spent taking it from the BBC. Mahon, who turns 44 this weekend, joins Channel 4 from the special effects company behind the films Gravity and Guardians of the Galaxy. Her inbox includes pressure from the government for a move out of London, arresting a decline in TV viewing (especially among youth audiences), a volatile ad market and hiring a new chief creative officer to spearhead Channel 4's Â£700m programming budget. Bake Off is a showstopper Before the summer launch of Bake Off, the audience figures for Channel 4's eponymous flagship network this year had been abysmal. Despite the dismal ratings, the acquisition of The Great British Bake Off has been a masterstroke for Channel 4. The show's finale, which aired on October 10, attracted a peak audience of 14.4 million viewers, making it the most-watched program on British television this year. The show's success has also been mirrored in its social media presence, with the hashtag #GBBO trending on Twitter throughout the series.\n\nMahon's arrival comes at a critical time for Channel 4, as the broadcaster looks to revitalize its flagging audience figures. The channel has struggled to connect with younger viewers, with its average audience age hovering around 55. In contrast, The Great British Bake Off has attracted a significant following among the 16-34 age group, with 45% of viewers falling within this demographic.\n\nThe new CEO is well aware of the challenges ahead, but she is confident that the channel can continue to thrive. \"We're not just about ratings, we're about creating content that resonates with audiences and drives cultural conversation,\" Mahon said in an exclusive interview with The Guardian. \"The success of Bake Off is a testament to our ability to take risks and invest in programming that has a broad appeal.\"\n\nMahon's background in the film industry has also given her a unique perspective on the changing media landscape. \"The way people consume content is changing rapidly, and we need to be agile and adaptable to stay ahead of the curve,\" she explained. \"We're investing heavily in digital and online platforms to ensure that our content is accessible to a wider audience.\"\n\nOne of Mahon's first tasks will be to appoint a new chief creative officer to lead the channel's programming efforts. The role is seen as a key appointment, with the successful candidate tasked with developing a new slate of shows that can compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Mahon is optimistic about the future of Channel 4. \"We have a rich history of producing innovative and groundbreaking content, and I'm excited to build on that legacy,\" she said. \"I'm confident that we can continue to thrive and remain a major player in the UK television landscape.\"",

        "Text": "When you learned about genes in high school, chances are it went something like this: Our DNA holds about 20,000 protein-coding genes. To make a protein, a cell makes a copy of the corresponding gene, in the form of a single-stranded molecule called RNA. The cell uses the RNA molecule as a template to make the protein. And then the protein floats off to do its job. That's certainly true. But there's more to the story. Some of our genes don't encode proteins; instead, they create long RNA molecules that don't serve as protein templates. They have different jobs. One of these so-called long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs, for short) is vital to women's health. Women carry two copies of the X chromosome, of course, while men have only one. Yet both sexes produce the same number of proteins from X chromosomes. The cause of that balance is a lncRNA called Xist. In each cell in a woman's body, Xist locks onto one of the two X chromosomes and inactivates it. Then the cell is able to produce proteins only from the X chromosome free of Xist. If that bit of RNA fails, women produce extra proteins. Studies on mice suggest this can lead to cancer. Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the role of Xist in maintaining the balance of X chromosome activity in women's cells. However, the exact mechanisms by which Xist regulates gene expression are still not fully understood.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the complex interactions between Xist and other molecules that play a crucial role in this process. For instance, scientists have discovered that Xist forms a complex with a protein called ATRX, which is essential for the inactivation of the X chromosome. This complex is thought to recruit other proteins to the X chromosome, ultimately leading to its silencing.\n\nFurthermore, researchers have identified several other lncRNAs that work in conjunction with Xist to regulate X chromosome activity. These lncRNAs, known as X-inactive specific transcripts (XISTTs), are expressed from the inactive X chromosome and play a critical role in maintaining its silencing. XISTTs have been shown to interact with Xist and other proteins to ensure that the inactive X chromosome remains silenced, even in the presence of Xist.\n\nThe discovery of XISTTs has significant implications for our understanding of X chromosome inactivation and its role in women's health. For example, mutations in XISTTs have been linked to X-linked diseases, such as Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects girls.\n\nThe study of Xist and XISTTs has also opened up new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies for X-linked diseases. For instance, researchers are exploring the possibility of using Xist or XISTTs as targets for gene therapy, with the goal of restoring the balance of X chromosome activity in affected cells.\n\nIn addition, the discovery of Xist and XISTTs has raised important questions about the evolution of X chromosome inactivation. Why did this mechanism evolve in the first place, and how has it been maintained over millions of years? These questions are the subject of ongoing research, and scientists are using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and computational approaches to shed light on the evolution of X chromosome inactivation.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Xist and XISTTs has significantly advanced our understanding of X chromosome inactivation and its role in women's health. Further research into the mechanisms by which these lncRNAs regulate gene expression will likely uncover new insights into the biology of X chromosome inactivation and its importance in maintaining the health of women.",

Uber was told then it needed to address issues with checks on drivers, insurance and safety, but has failed to satisfy the capital's transport authorities. TfL said on Monday it had identified a \"pattern of failures\" by Uber, including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk. The decision to revoke Uber's licence comes as a major blow to the company, which has been facing increasing scrutiny over its business practices in recent years. The ride-hailing giant has been accused of prioritizing profits over safety, and the latest revelations have sparked widespread outrage among passengers and regulators alike.\n\nAccording to TfL, the majority of the 14,000 trips taken with fake drivers occurred between 2016 and 2019, with the most recent incident reported in 2020. The agency said that while Uber had taken some steps to address the issue, it had failed to implement adequate measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n\"This pattern of failures raises concerns that Uber's systems and processes are not robust enough to protect passengers,\" said a TfL spokesperson. \"We have therefore made the decision not to renew Uber's licence, and the company has 21 days to appeal.\"\n\nUber has faced numerous controversies in the past, including allegations of sexual harassment, data breaches, and disputes with drivers over pay and working conditions.

For the most part, news reports through the decades played along. His romp through the mid-20th century was impossible to ignore, and newspapers of the day, including The Times, followed his exploits, at first reluctantly, then eagerly and, finally, somewhat nonchalantly. As obscenity bans fell and Mr. Hefner's star began to rise, the coverage of his journey was mixed. But no matter the topic, it tended to dwell on a trio of elements: controversy, sex and an abundance of bunny puns. The end of an article in 1957 noted that the magazine had a record circulation in the first quarter of the year, estimated at 880,590. Censors caught on soon enough. The next year, an effort by the post office to keep the magazine out of the \"mails\" failed. Despite the challenges posed by censors, Playboy continued to thrive, and Hefner's persona as the embodiment of the sexual revolution only grew more iconic. The magazine's provocative content and Hefner's charismatic leadership made him a household name, and he became synonymous with the era's cultural and social upheaval.\n\nAs the years went by, Playboy's influence extended beyond the magazine's pages. The brand expanded into television, with the launch of the Playboy After Dark variety show in 1969, and later into film, with the production of several movies and documentaries. Hefner's personal life, including his relationships with multiple women, was also subject to intense scrutiny, with many regarding him as a symbol of the \" Playboy philosophy\" â€“ a lifestyle that celebrated hedonism, free love, and the pursuit of pleasure.\n\nHowever, not everyone was enamored with Hefner's vision. Critics accused him of objectifying women and perpetuating a culture of misogyny. The magazine's treatment of women, particularly in the early years, was often criticized for being exploitative and degrading. Despite these criticisms, Hefner remained unapologetic about his approach, insisting that Playboy was a champion of female empowerment and a platform for women to express themselves.\n\nDespite the controversies, Playboy's impact on popular culture cannot be overstated. The magazine's influence on the music industry, for example, was profound, with many famous musicians, including The Rolling Stones and The Doors, featuring on its covers. The magazine's iconic centerfold, which debuted in 1953, became a staple of American culture, with many regarding it as a symbol of the era's sexual liberation.\n\nHefner's legacy extends beyond the world of entertainment, too. His commitment to free speech and the protection of First Amendment rights was unwavering, and he was a vocal advocate for the rights of artists and writers. In 1963, he testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, arguing that censorship was a threat to artistic expression and individual freedom.\n\nAs the years went by, Playboy's influence began to wane, and the magazine's circulation declined. Hefner's personal life also underwent significant changes, including a series of high-profile marriages and the loss of his beloved Playboy Mansion. However, his impact on American culture remains indelible, and his legacy continues to be debated and discussed to this day.",

But it's time we ditched the 'ull and revelled in the polysyllabic glory of its proper name â€“ Kiiiings-ston upon Hull. For Hull was, and is, glorious. It's had â€“ is having â€“ rough times. When JB Priestley popped by on his English Journey during the Great Depression, he marvelled at its civic culture and prosperity. Fast-forward 80 years and while the former is very much in evidence, it could do with a hefty dose of the latter. The rest of the country has deigned to pop by this year while it is UK City of Culture. Visitors will see its minster, its beautiful (yes, beautiful) streets and excellent art; they will pay their respects to Philip Larkin and Throbbing Gristle; and stand on the banks of the Humber, marvelling at the views. As the UK City of Culture, Hull has been transformed into a vibrant hub of artistic and cultural expression. The city's rich history and heritage are on full display, from the stunning architecture of its medieval minster to the eclectic mix of independent shops and cafes that line its streets. Visitors can explore the city's many museums, including the Ferens Art Gallery, which features an impressive collection of British and international art, and the Wilberforce House Museum, which tells the story of the city's abolitionist heritage.\n\nBut Hull is more than just its history and culture. The city is also a thriving hub of industry and innovation, with a strong presence of digital and creative industries. The city's proximity to the Humber Estuary has made it an important location for trade and commerce, and its ports are among the busiest in the country. The city's universities and research institutions are also world-renowned, with a strong focus on areas such as marine biology, renewable energy, and advanced manufacturing.\n\nDespite its many strengths, Hull has faced significant challenges in recent years. The city's economy has been impacted by the decline of the traditional industries that once drove its growth, and it has struggled to adapt to the changing economic landscape. However, the city's residents and leaders are working hard to build a brighter future, and the city's designation as UK City of Culture is seen as a major step forward in this process.\n\nAs visitors explore the city, they will discover a warm and welcoming community that is passionate about its heritage and its future. From the bustling streets of the old town to the tranquil beauty of the Humber Estuary, Hull is a city that has something for everyone. Whether you're interested in history, culture, industry, or innovation, Hull is a place that will leave a lasting impression. So come and see what all the fuss is about â€“ you won't be disappointed!",

By the time I reached my early 30s, I was a director of a film post-production company, travelling the world and entertaining clients with a Â£2,000 a month expenses account. But my world turned upside down when I got divorced. I didn't have the emotional capacity to deal with something so traumatic. I had a really serious mental breakdown that took me to the edge. I started to hit the bottle. By then I was freelancing and I could hide the increasing addiction. I started to work less and drink more. Eventually it started to take a toll on me. I ran out of money. After a rent hike I was forced to leave my home before I was evicted. One day I was found lying on the floor outside Hammersmith town hall and declared myself homeless. I was put up in a homeless assessment centre but I was still drinking â€“ everyone there was. Six months later, I became jaundiced, and I was admitted to hospital with liver cirrhosis. I was close to dying but I was still sent back to the assessment centre. After being sent back to the assessment centre, I hit rock bottom. I was forced to confront the reality of my situation and the devastating consequences of my addiction. It was a wake-up call, but it took me a while to accept that I needed help.\n\nI spent several months in rehab, where I received treatment for my addiction and began to rebuild my life. It was a difficult and humbling experience, but it was the first step towards recovery.\n\nOnce I was stable enough, I started attending counseling sessions to deal with the emotional trauma of my divorce and my mental health struggles. It was a long and challenging process, but with the support of my therapists and loved ones, I was able to work through my issues and start to heal.\n\nAs I began to rebuild my life, I realized that I had lost everything - my career, my home, my relationships. I had to start from scratch and find a new sense of purpose. It was a daunting task, but I was determined to turn my life around.\n\nI started by getting back into the film industry, but this time I approached it with a new perspective. I realized that I had been living someone else's dream, and that I needed to find a career that brought me joy and fulfillment. I started taking on small projects, working with new people, and learning new skills.\n\nIt's been a long and winding road, but I'm finally starting to feel like myself again. I'm still working on my mental health, but I've learned to manage my anxiety and depression. I've rebuilt my relationships and started to reconnect with loved ones. And, most importantly, I've found a new sense of purpose and meaning in my life.\n\nMy story is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. It's a reminder that addiction and mental health struggles are real, but that recovery is possible. And it's a reminder that no matter what life throws at us, we always have the power to choose how we respond.\n\nIn the end, my journey has taught me that true strength comes from vulnerability, that true courage comes from facing our fears, and that true happiness comes from living in the present moment.",

Ms. Patelsky, the physical education teacher at Everglades Elementary School here, instructed the students to count by fours as they touched their elbows to their knees during a warm-up. They added up dots on pairs of dice before sprinting to round mats imprinted with mathematical symbols. And while in push-up position, they balanced on one arm and used the other (\"Alternate!\" Ms. Patelsky urged. \"That's one of your vocabulary words\") to stack oversize Lego blocks in columns labeled \"ones,\" \"tens\" and \"hundreds.\" \"I don't work for Parks and Recreation,\" said Ms. Patelsky, explaining the unorthodox approach to what has traditionally been one of the few breaks from the academic routine during the school day. The unorthodox approach to physical education, however, is not just a whim. It's part of a broader effort to integrate math and literacy skills into everyday activities, making learning more engaging and relevant to students' lives.\n\nPatelsky's innovative approach has been gaining attention from educators and researchers across the country. Her methods are based on the concept of \"embodied cognition,\" which suggests that the mind and body are closely linked, and that physical movement can actually improve cognitive function.\n\n\"We're not just teaching math and literacy skills in isolation,\" Patelsky explained. \"We're using physical activity to help students develop a deeper understanding of these concepts and to make connections between different subjects.\"\n\nThe results have been impressive. Students in Patelsky's class have shown significant improvements in their math and literacy skills, and they've also reported higher levels of engagement and motivation.\n\n\"It's not just about the math and literacy skills,\" said Patelsky. \"It's about helping students develop a growth mindset and a sense of confidence in their abilities. When students feel more confident and capable, they're more likely to take risks and push themselves to learn more.\"\n\nPatelsky's approach has also been praised by parents and administrators at Everglades Elementary School. \"We're thrilled to see our students engaged in such creative and innovative learning experiences,\" said Principal Karen Brown. \"Ms. Patelsky's program is a great example of how we can use physical activity to support student learning and achievement.\"\n\nAs the school year comes to a close, Patelsky is already planning new and innovative ways to integrate math and literacy skills into her physical education classes. She's excited to see how her students will continue to grow and develop over the summer, and she's confident that her unorthodox approach will continue to yield positive results.\n\n\"I'm not just a physical education teacher,\" Patelsky said with a smile. \"I'm a teacher who believes that every moment is an opportunity to learn and grow, whether we're in the classroom or on the playground.\"",

Nov. 11, known as Singles Day or Double-11, started as an anti-Valentine's Day celebration before the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group converted it into an annual shopping spectacle that generates billions of dollars in sales. This year, Taylor Swift will help kick off the proceedings by performing at a gala in Shanghai. Some 22,000 international merchants are expected to offer discounts and other deals, mostly online, without the overnight lines and doorbuster bargains associated with Black Friday in the United States. But American companies have seemed unsure of how to approach China's $90 billion ad market, believed to be the second-largest in the world. The trade dispute with the United States has led some Chinese consumers to spurn American brands, and tensions over how companies have addressed pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have further complicated the economic back-and-forth. Despite the challenges, American companies are not shying away from the opportunity to tap into China's massive consumer market. Many are opting for a more nuanced approach, focusing on building brand awareness and loyalty rather than relying on deep discounts to drive sales.\n\nOne company that has been successful in navigating the complex landscape is cosmetics giant Estee Lauder. According to a company spokesperson, Estee Lauder has seen significant growth in China over the past year, driven in part by its efforts to engage with Chinese consumers through social media and influencer partnerships.\n\n\"We recognize that the Chinese market is unique and requires a tailored approach,\" said the spokesperson. \"We're focusing on building relationships with our customers and creating experiences that resonate with them. Singles Day is an important event for us, and we're excited to offer exclusive deals and promotions to our Chinese customers.\"\n\nOther American companies, such as fashion retailer Gap and beauty brand L'OrÃ©al, are also participating in the Singles Day festivities. Gap has launched a series of limited-edition collaborations with popular Chinese designers, while L'OrÃ©al is offering a range of discounts and free gifts with purchases.\n\nWhile some American companies may be hesitant to invest in China's ad market, others see the potential for long-term growth and are willing to take a chance. According to a report by research firm eMarketer, the Chinese ad market is expected to reach $130 billion by 2023, making it an attractive opportunity for companies looking to expand their global presence.\n\nFor American companies, the key to success in China's ad market is understanding the local consumer and adapting to their preferences. This includes embracing social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo, which are increasingly important channels for reaching Chinese consumers.\n\n\"China is a complex and rapidly evolving market, and American companies need to be willing to learn and adapt to succeed,\" said Mark Tanner, a Shanghai-based marketing consultant. \"Those that can build strong relationships with Chinese consumers and understand their needs and preferences will be the ones that come out on top.\"\n\nAs Singles Day approaches, American companies are likely to be closely watching the results of their efforts. While the event may not be as big as Black Friday in the United States, it has the potential to be a major driver of sales and brand awareness in China. For companies that can navigate the complexities of the Chinese market, the rewards could be significant.",

That's not the puzzle I'm setting today - although I'll include it at the bottom just in case you fancy your chances. Today's challenge is two simpler puzzles that lead up to that impossibly difficult big kahuna. You may have heard the first one before, so here it is in a brand new guise. Puzzee Rascal always takes two sugars with his tea and cannot lie, while his brother takes none and cannot tell the truth. One day you meet a man who is either Puzzee or his brother. You are allowed to ask one yes-no question to establish his identity. As you ponder the question, you realize that the key to solving this puzzle lies in understanding the properties of Puzzee and his brother's statements. Since Puzzee always takes two sugars with his tea and cannot lie, if you ask him a yes-no question, he will answer truthfully. On the other hand, his brother, who cannot tell the truth, will answer with the opposite of what you would expect.\n\nThe challenge is to craft a single question that will reveal the identity of the man you're speaking with. One possible solution is to ask, \"Does Puzzee take one sugar with his tea?\" If the man answers \"yes,\" then he must be Puzzee, as Puzzee always takes two sugars and would not lie about it. If the man answers \"no,\" then he must be his brother, as his brother would answer with the opposite of what you would expect, and would say that Puzzee takes one sugar.\n\nBut that's not all - we have another puzzle to solve before we can tackle the infamous Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever. This one is a bit more straightforward, but still requires some clever thinking.\n\nImagine you are in a room with three light switches. Each switch corresponds to one of three light bulbs in a room. Each light bulb is either on or off. You can't see the light bulbs from where you are, but you can turn the switches on and off as many times as you want. How can you figure out which switch corresponds to which light bulb?\n\nThink you can solve it? Give it a try before moving on to the next challenge.",

        "Text": "The UK was the only country in the EU to reduce its electricity consumption last year, with power use growing or stable across the rest of the bloc's 28 member states. Britain's appetite for power has been waning for more than a decade as industrial activity declined and businesses and households opted for more energy efficient lighting and appliances. But an analysis of official figures by campaign group Sandbag found the fall between 2016 and 2017 was one of the biggest in several years, marking a striking divergence with the rest of Europe. The UK's power consumption fell nearly 2% from 355 terawatt hours to 348 tWh, while it rose across the EU as a whole by 0.7% from 3,239 to 3,262 tWh. According to the analysis, the largest contributors to the decline in power consumption in the UK were the industrial and commercial sectors, which saw a combined drop of 4.5% in their electricity use. This is largely attributed to the decline of the manufacturing industry, which has been a significant user of power in the past.\n\nIn contrast, the residential sector saw a relatively modest 0.5% decrease in power consumption, which is likely due to the increasing adoption of energy-efficient appliances and lighting in households. The transport sector also saw a slight decrease in power consumption, as more people opted for public transport, cycling, or walking instead of driving.\n\nThe decline in power consumption in the UK is a significant departure from the trend in the rest of the EU, where power consumption has been steadily increasing. The analysis suggests that this is largely due to the growth of the digital economy and the increasing use of data centers and other energy-intensive technologies.\n\nSandbag's analysis also highlights the significant variations in power consumption across different EU countries. While the UK saw a decline, countries such as Germany, France, and Italy saw significant increases in power consumption, driven by growing industrial activity and population growth.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the UK's energy policy and its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The UK government has set a target of reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, and the decline in power consumption could help the country achieve this goal.\n\nHowever, the analysis also warns that the decline in power consumption could have unintended consequences, such as increased reliance on imported energy and reduced energy security. The UK's energy mix is currently dominated by imports, and a decline in power consumption could exacerbate this dependence.\n\nIn response to the findings, energy experts are calling for a more nuanced approach to energy policy, one that takes into account the decline in power consumption and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They argue that the UK should focus on increasing the efficiency of its energy system, rather than simply increasing energy production.\n\nThe debate highlights the complex challenges facing the UK's energy sector, as it seeks to balance the need for energy security with the need to reduce its carbon footprint. As the country continues to navigate this challenge, the findings of Sandbag's analysis will provide valuable insights for policymakers and energy experts alike.",

The move was announced at a companywide meeting on Wednesday. In a memo to the staff, Al Jazeera America's chief executive, Al Anstey, said the \"decision by Al Jazeera America's board is driven by the fact that our business model is simply not sustainable in light of the economic challenges in the U.S. media marketplace.\" \"I know the closure of AJAM will be a massive disappointment for everyone here who has worked tirelessly for our long-term future,\" he continued, using the company acronym. \"The decision that has been made is in no way because AJAM has done anything but a great job. Our commitment to great journalism is unrivaled.\" At the companywide meeting, Al Jazeera America staff members, some in tears, were told that the decision to shutter the network had not been unanimous. Some of the channel's leadership argued that the network provided an important service, and continued to win awards for its coverage. But in the end, the decision was an economic one. The channel, it was felt, had fallen victim to the lack of a business model beyond continuous support from Qatar, the energy-rich country that owns Al Jazeera. Some staffers saw that as a tacit admission that falling oil prices were behind the closure, though a spokeswoman for the company denied that on Wednesday. Beyond its oil wealth, Qatar is one of the world's top exporters of liquefied natural gas, whose price has also tumbled. Mr. Anstey said that once the cable news network shuts down by April 30, Al Jazeera would expand its digital presence in the United States. The expansion \"would bring new global content into America.\" The announcement sent shockwaves through the media industry, with many expressing sadness and disappointment at the loss of a unique voice in American journalism. Al Jazeera America had carved out a niche for itself by providing in-depth coverage of international news and perspectives, often challenging the dominant narrative in mainstream media.\n\nDespite its efforts to build a loyal following, the network struggled to attract a large enough audience to sustain its operations. According to reports, Al Jazeera America had been hemorrhaging money, with some estimates suggesting it had lost tens of millions of dollars annually. The network's reliance on funding from Qatar, which had initially supported its launch, had become unsustainable as the country's economy began to feel the pinch from falling oil prices.\n\nThe decision to shut down the cable news network has left many wondering about the future of Al Jazeera's presence in the United States. While the company has announced plans to expand its digital presence, it remains unclear what this will entail and whether it will be able to replicate the success of its cable news operation.\n\nIndustry insiders are already speculating about the potential impact on the media landscape. \"The loss of Al Jazeera America is a significant blow to the diversity of voices in American media,\" said media analyst, Michael Barthel. \"While there are still many excellent news outlets in the United States, the closure of AJAM will undoubtedly leave a void in terms of international coverage and perspectives.\"\n\nAs the media world grapples with the implications of Al Jazeera America's shutdown, many are left to wonder what could have been done differently. Some have criticized the network's business model, arguing that it was always unsustainable given the competitive nature of the American media market. Others have praised the network's commitment to quality journalism, saying that it will be sorely missed.\n\nFor now, the staff of Al Jazeera America are left to pick up the pieces and figure out what comes next. The closure of the network is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the media industry in the digital age, where traditional business models are increasingly under threat. As the dust settles, one thing is clear: the loss of Al Jazeera America will be felt deeply by those who valued its unique perspective and commitment to quality journalism.",

The prime minister, Theresa May, currently earns Â£150,402 a year. Auditors also found the BBC had missed its target to reduce the proportion of senior managers to 1% of the total workforce by 2015. According to the National Audit Office's report, the BBC's failure to meet its target has resulted in a significant increase in the number of high-earning executives. The report highlights that the corporation's senior management structure has become more complex, with a larger number of executives earning six-figure salaries.\n\nThe NAO's findings have sparked concerns among critics who argue that the BBC's commitment to transparency and accountability has been compromised. They point out that the corporation's governing body, the BBC Trust, has been unable to effectively monitor and control executive pay.\n\n\"The BBC's failure to meet its own targets is a clear indication of a lack of accountability and transparency,\" said a spokesperson for the campaign group, Media Reform Coalition. \"The corporation's senior management needs to take responsibility for this failure and explain why they have not been able to reduce the number of high-earning executives as promised.\"\n\nThe BBC has defended its decision, stating that the increase in high-earning executives is due to the corporation's efforts to strengthen its leadership and improve its services. However, the NAO's report has raised questions about the corporation's priorities and whether it is using its resources effectively.\n\nThe report also highlights that the BBC has missed its target to reduce the proportion of senior managers to 1% of the total workforce by 2015. Instead, the proportion has remained stagnant at around 2.5%. This has resulted in a significant number of managers earning salaries above Â£100,000 per year.\n\nThe BBC's failure to meet its targets has also raised concerns about the corporation's ability to deliver value for money to taxpayers. The corporation receives an annual license fee of Â£145.50 from each household, which is used to fund its services.\n\nThe NAO's report has been welcomed by opposition parties, who have called for greater transparency and accountability in the BBC's governance structure. The Labour Party has pledged to introduce a new regulator to oversee the BBC's finances and ensure that it is using its resources effectively.\n\nThe BBC's failure to meet its targets is a clear indication that the corporation needs to take a closer look at its priorities and make significant changes to its governance structure.

        "Text": "When the governor of the Reserve Bank speaks, the market listens, trying to sift the gold dust out from the dirt for any signs of a movement in interest rates. And from Philip Lowe's speech in Armidale on Tuesday, the market has very clearly sifted out a rate cut next week, as more evidence comes that fiscal and monetary policy are not working in the same direction. The economy, as we all have a fair idea, is not performing as it should. Yes, employment is growing well â€“ which is always a good thing â€“ but overall GDP, productivity and inflation growth are all weak. Wages growth remains equally slow, and given the recent increase in underutilisation, there is no sense of this changing anytime soon. We have a government rather joyfully talking up a budget surplus for this financial year, which by definition is removing growth from the economy. And so, what is left? Monetary policy â€“ and it seems likely to be used again. When Lowe suggested at the end of his speech that \"the board is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, make further progress towards full employment, and achieve the inflation target over time\", everyone in the market said: \"Thanks for the nod and the wink, Philip\". The market's reaction to Lowe's speech was swift and decisive, with the Australian dollar falling sharply against the US dollar and bond yields plummeting in anticipation of a rate cut. The ASX 200 also dropped, with the financial sector leading the decline.\n\nEconomists and analysts were quick to weigh in on the implications of Lowe's comments. \"The writing is on the wall,\" said Dr. Emma Davidson, an economist at the University of Melbourne. \"The Reserve Bank is clearly concerned about the economy's lack of momentum, and a rate cut is the obvious response. It's a sign that they're willing to do whatever it takes to get the economy moving again.\"\n\nBut not everyone agrees that a rate cut is the solution. \"Monetary policy has already been eased to the point of diminishing returns,\" said Dr. David Coleman, a professor of economics at the University of Sydney. \"We need to see fiscal policy take a more active role in stimulating the economy. A budget surplus is not the answer when the economy is struggling.\"\n\nThe debate highlights the ongoing challenge facing the Reserve Bank and the government. With inflation running below target and the economy growing at a sluggish pace, there is pressure to do something to stimulate growth. But with the government committed to a budget surplus, the options are limited.\n\nIn the meantime, the market will continue to watch and wait for the Reserve Bank's decision next week. Will it be a rate cut, or will the bank decide to hold fire? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the economy is in need of a boost, and the Reserve Bank is ready to do its part.",

A dozen cities and regions across the UK are lobbying to provide a new home to Channel 4, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds. However, the chief executive, David Abraham, and the chairman, Charles Gurassa, have ferociously rejected a wholesale move of Channel 4 and its 800 staff, saying it would be catastrophic for its business. The government's 56-page report examined a range of options â€“ including a full, partial and very limited move from London â€“ as well as the impact of making Channel 4 increase its spend on programmes made by TV producers outside the capital. The report found that combining a full move of the broadcaster's headquarters with an Â£88m-a-year boost in spending on shows made outside of London could create economic benefits of Â£580m and 7,490 jobs across the country. The report, which was commissioned by the government, also highlighted the potential benefits of a partial relocation, which could still bring in significant economic benefits and job creation. According to the study, a partial move, where Channel 4 relocates some of its staff and operations to a new location, could create around 2,500 jobs and deliver Â£220m in economic benefits.\n\nThe report's findings have sparked a heated debate among city leaders and business owners, who are eager to capitalize on the potential benefits of hosting Channel 4. Birmingham, which is one of the cities vying for the broadcaster's attention, has already submitted a detailed proposal outlining the benefits of relocating to the city.\n\n\"We believe that Birmingham would be an ideal location for Channel 4,\" said a spokesperson for the city council. \"We have a thriving media sector, a diverse range of creative industries, and a highly skilled workforce. We are confident that we could provide Channel 4 with the perfect environment to grow and thrive.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that a relocation would be beneficial. Some have raised concerns about the potential disruption to Channel 4's operations and the impact on its ability to produce high-quality content.\n\n\"This is a short-sighted proposal that would put Channel 4's future at risk,\" said a spokesperson for the broadcaster. \"We have a successful business model that has been built over decades, and we are not convinced that a relocation would be in the best interests of the company or its employees.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, the government is expected to continue to push for a relocation, citing the potential benefits to the economy and the need to rebalance the country's economic growth.\n\n\"This is a significant opportunity for us to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in regions outside of London,\" said a government spokesperson. \"We believe that a relocation of Channel 4 could be a major boost to the country's creative industries and we will continue to work with the broadcaster to explore the options.\"\n\nThe fate of Channel 4 remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the decision will have significant implications for the country's media sector and its economy.",

        "Text": "Carlos Ghosn's flight from criminal charges in Japan to Lebanon was aided by Lebanese state officials who were instructed by political leaders to smooth his arrival. The former boss of Nissan and Renault landed at Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport in Lebanon on Monday morning and said in a statement that he was escaping a \"rigged\" Japanese justice system. He reportedly hid in a musical instrument box to abscond from his home in Tokyo, which was under 24-hour camera surveillance as part of his bail conditions. In his statement Ghosn said he would \"no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed\". Ghosn had surrendered his passports under the terms of his bail and had been barred from leaving Japan. \"I have not fled justice, I have escaped injustice and political persecution,\" Ghosn said, adding that he could now \"finally communicate freely with the media and look forward to starting next week\". Ghosn, 65, was ousted as chair of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi carmaking alliance after he was arrested in November 2018 on charges that he had underreported his income from Nissan by $80m (Â£60m). Ghosn has said the charges were part of a plot by Nissan executives to oust him. The dramatic escape of Carlos Ghosn has sent shockwaves through the global automotive industry, with many questioning the motives behind the former CEO's flight from Japan to Lebanon. Ghosn's allegations of a \"rigged\" Japanese justice system and political persecution have sparked widespread debate, with some calling for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his departure.\n\nGhosn's supporters, including many in the automotive industry, have rallied behind him, citing concerns over the fairness of the Japanese legal system and the treatment of the former CEO. \"This is a grave injustice,\" said a spokesperson for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. \"Carlos Ghosn is a respected leader who has dedicated his career to the automotive industry. We urge the Japanese authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding his departure.\"\n\nHowever, others have questioned Ghosn's motives, suggesting that he may have fled to avoid facing the charges against him. \"This is a clear attempt to evade justice,\" said a Japanese government spokesperson. \"We will do everything in our power to ensure that Carlos Ghosn returns to Japan to face the charges against him.\"\n\nThe Lebanese government has denied any involvement in Ghosn's escape, but sources close to the investigation have revealed that Lebanese state officials did provide assistance to Ghosn, including helping him to obtain a fake passport and arranging his transportation from Tokyo to Beirut.\n\nThe fallout from Ghosn's escape is likely to be significant, with the automotive industry bracing for the consequences. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance has announced that it will conduct an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Ghosn's departure, and several major shareholders have called for the company's board of directors to resign.\n\nIn the meantime, Ghosn remains in Lebanon, where he has been granted temporary asylum. The former CEO has vowed to cooperate with the Lebanese authorities and has denied any wrongdoing. As the investigation into his escape continues, one thing is clear: the drama surrounding Carlos Ghosn's flight from Japan will have far-reaching consequences for the global automotive industry.",

        "Text": "Mid-century design classics, such as Charles Eames chairs, Eileen Gray tables and Arco lamps are set to rocket in price, following EU regulations which came into force this week that extend the copyright on furniture from 25 years to 70 years after the death of a designer. But shoppers have six months to snap up a replica bargain, as the UK has given retailers a six-month transitionary period to clear their existing stock. Take, for example, the famous Eames walnut and leather armchair with matching ottoman. The officially licensed and copyrighted producer, Vitra, sells them for Â£6,814 in John Lewis. Yet copies made in Chinese factories sell over the internet and in some stores for as little as Â£399. It is these low-cost knock-offs that will now be banned. A change in law which came into force on 28 July 2016 means that retailers will no longer be able to sell cheap replicas of iconic furniture designs and shoppers will instead be forced to pay thousands for original designs â€“ ie those made brand new under licence with the agreement of the late designers' estates. The change in law is expected to have a significant impact on the furniture industry, with many retailers scrambling to clear their existing stock of replica designs before the six-month transitionary period comes to an end. According to industry insiders, the new regulations will not only affect small, independent retailers but also major high-street brands.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for the industry,\" said Sarah Lee, a spokesperson for the British Furniture Association. \"We understand that the intention behind the law is to protect the intellectual property of designers, but it's also going to make it much harder for people to afford iconic furniture designs.\"\n\nThe new regulations are already causing concern among consumers, who are worried about the potential impact on their wallets. \"I love the style of mid-century design, but I can't afford to pay thousands of pounds for an original Eames chair,\" said Emma Taylor, a freelance writer. \"I've been looking for a replica online, but now it seems like that option is being taken away from me.\"\n\nIn an effort to adapt to the new regulations, some retailers are already starting to clear their shelves of replica designs. \"We're having to be very strategic about what we stock going forward,\" said John Smith, a buyer for a major high-street furniture retailer. \"We're focusing on more affordable, mass-produced designs, rather than trying to compete with the high-end, licensed products.\"\n\nHowever, not all retailers are willing to comply with the new regulations. Some small, independent shops are choosing to continue selling replica designs, even if it means risking legal action. \"We understand the law, but we also understand that our customers can't afford to pay thousands of pounds for furniture,\" said David Lee, owner of a small furniture shop in London. \"We're going to continue to sell replica designs, even if it means we have to operate outside the law.\"\n\nThe debate over the new regulations is set to continue, with both sides presenting their arguments to lawmakers. In the meantime, consumers are being left to navigate a complex and ever-changing landscape of furniture design and pricing. As the industry adjusts to the new regulations, one thing is clear: the world of furniture design is about to get a whole lot more expensive.",

        "Text": "Prime Minister Jose Socrates, left, with Finance Minster Fernando Teixeira dos Santos on Tuesday, said that Portugal was making progress in reducing its budget deficit. On Eve of Bond Sale, Portugal Says It Needs No Help From Europe\n\nPrime Minister Jose Socrates of Portugal insisted Tuesday that his country would not follow Greece and Ireland in requiring a bailout, despite record borrowing costs and a forecast from the country's central bank that Portugal would sink back into recession this year. As pressures on several euro zone countries grew, the bloc got a vote of confidence from Asia, when Japan said it would buy a chunk of the bonds being issued to cover the recent bailout of Ireland. In Brussels, meanwhile, European Union officials continued work on contingency plans for a new bailout fund. In Lisbon, Mr. Socrates said that Portugal's cost-cutting efforts had been vindicated, with a 2010 budget deficit that fell below the government's goal of 7.3 percent of gross domestic product. His bullish comments were echoed at a separate news conference in Madrid, where Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister, said that Spain was expected to meet its 2010 budget deficit goal of 9.3 percent \"with leeway.\" Both prime ministers reaffirmed that their countries would meet their deficit goals this year, of 6 percent for Spain and 4.6 percent for Portugal. But further deficit-cutting progress will be tough, especially for Portugal. The Bank of Portugal predicted a 1.3 percent contraction of the country's economy this year because of recent cuts, having previously forecast zero growth. The government of Mr. Socrates is anticipating growth of 0.2 percent this year. Despite the challenging economic outlook, Prime Minister Socrates remained optimistic about Portugal's ability to manage its finances without external assistance. He emphasized that the country's efforts to reduce its budget deficit had been successful, with the 2010 deficit coming in below the government's target.\n\nHowever, the Bank of Portugal's revised forecast for economic contraction this year has raised concerns about the impact of the government's austerity measures on the country's economy. The bank's prediction of a 1.3 percent contraction is a significant downgrade from its previous forecast of zero growth, and it has sparked worries about the potential consequences for employment and economic activity.\n\nThe government's plan to reduce its budget deficit relies heavily on a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. However, the opposition has criticized the measures, arguing that they will disproportionately affect low-income households and small businesses. The government has also faced criticism for its handling of the economy, with some arguing that it has been too slow to implement reforms and has failed to provide adequate support to struggling industries.\n\nDespite these challenges, Prime Minister Socrates remains committed to his government's economic plan. He has emphasized the need for fiscal discipline and has pledged to continue implementing reforms to improve the country's competitiveness and attract foreign investment.\n\nThe Portuguese government's ability to manage its finances without external assistance will be closely watched by investors and analysts in the coming months. If the country is able to successfully reduce its budget deficit and stabilize its economy, it could set a positive example for other euro zone countries facing similar challenges. However, if the government's austerity measures have a disproportionate impact on the economy, it could raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of Portugal's economic recovery.\n\nIn the meantime, the European Union has continued to work on contingency plans for a new bailout fund, which could be used to support countries facing financial difficulties. The fund, which is expected to be operational by the end of the year, will have a total capacity of â‚¬60 billion and will be used to provide financial assistance to euro zone countries facing financial difficulties.\n\nThe development of the new bailout fund is seen as a key step in strengthening the euro zone's financial stability and preventing a repeat of the financial crisis that has affected several countries in the region. The fund will be used to provide financial assistance to countries facing financial difficulties, as well as to support economic recovery and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, while Portugal's economic outlook remains challenging, the country's ability to reduce its budget deficit and stabilize its economy will be closely watched by investors and analysts in the coming months. The government's commitment to fiscal discipline and its efforts to implement reforms to improve the country's competitiveness will be crucial in determining the country's economic future.",

Surprisingly, the ABC managing director didn't mention it in her speech but the ABC is flying high this week. Not only did ABC News deliver two huge scoops â€“ the NT detention scandal and the allegations of sexual abuse against George Pell â€“ but ABC Online reported record figures. June was the first month the ABC News website ranked No 2 overall, pushing smh.com.au into third place with a reach of five million people. While the ABC had its best month, news.com.au, the category leader, recorded its lowest audience this year. Insiders believe the drop in audience for smh.com.au and news.com.au and the rise in ABC audiences can be attributed to an appetite for news about the federal election and Brexit. In fourth place is Daily Mail Australia, followed by Yahoo7, Guardian Australia, the BBC, ninemsn, the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun. Meanwhile the Tele is celebrating \"powering\" into the top 10 for the first time. The ABC's recent success can be attributed to its commitment to in-depth reporting and its ability to adapt to changing consumer habits. The rise of digital media has created a new landscape for news consumption, with audiences seeking out high-quality content that is easily accessible on various platforms.\n\nAccording to ABC Online's editor, \"Our focus on investigative journalism and in-depth reporting has paid off. Our audiences are hungry for stories that matter, and we're proud to be providing them with the kind of coverage that holds those in power accountable.\"\n\nThe ABC's success is also a testament to the hard work and dedication of its journalists, who have been working tirelessly to bring important stories to light. The recent scoops on the NT detention scandal and the allegations against George Pell are just two examples of the kind of reporting that has earned the ABC its reputation as a trusted source of news.\n\nIn contrast, news.com.au's decline in audience can be attributed to its reliance on clickbait headlines and sensationalized content. Insiders suggest that the site's focus on entertainment and celebrity news has alienated its core audience, who are seeking out more serious and in-depth reporting.\n\nThe ABC's success is also a reminder of the importance of public broadcasting in a democratic society. The ABC's commitment to providing high-quality, unbiased reporting is essential to holding those in power accountable and keeping the public informed.\n\nAs the media landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the ABC and its competitors adapt to changing consumer habits and the increasing demand for high-quality content. One thing is certain, however - the ABC's commitment to excellence and its ability to adapt to changing times have cemented its position as a leader in the Australian media landscape.",

        "Text": "At Intel's corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the highly paid engineers and developers directly employed by the computer chip company wear blue identification badges. Janitors, electricians, gardeners, security guards and cafeteria workers employed by various subcontractors wear green badges. It's an important distinction for Nahima Aguiniga, 34, who works as a cashier and dishwasher at a cafe on the Intel campus. Blue badges get free coffee, soda and fruit; green badges have to pay. Free food is just one of the perks Intel's blue badge employees enjoy. Like other Silicon Valley tech firms, the company competes for employees with perks like ping-pong tables, on-site spa services, dry cleaning and gyms with personal trainers. \"The way they treat green badges, it's like we're second-class citizens,\" said Aguiniga. A single mother of two, Aguiniga earns just $13.50 per hour. She can't afford her own apartment in an area that has such a high cost of living that even highly paid tech employees and venture capitalists are balking. For the past 10 weeks, she and her children have been sharing a single room in her ex-mother-in-law's house. As Aguiniga navigates the complexities of her daily routine, she can't help but feel a sense of frustration and disillusionment with the stark contrast between the benefits afforded to blue badge employees and those of green badge workers like herself. While Intel's highly paid engineers and developers enjoy lavish perks, Aguiniga and her colleagues are left to struggle with meager wages and limited benefits.\n\n\"It's not just the free food and coffee, it's the way we're treated like we're invisible,\" Aguiniga said in an interview. \"We're the ones who keep the campus running smoothly, but we're not valued or respected.\"\n\nAguiniga's concerns are not unique to Intel or even Silicon Valley. The tech industry has long been criticized for its treatment of low-wage workers, many of whom are women and people of color. A report by the National Employment Law Project found that in 2019, the median hourly wage for tech industry workers was $41.45, while the median hourly wage for workers in the food service industry, where many low-wage tech workers are employed, was just $9.42.\n\nThe disparity is particularly stark in Santa Clara County, where Intel is headquartered. According to data from the United Way, more than 30% of households in the county earn less than $50,000 per year, and nearly 20% earn less than $25,000 per year. The county's high cost of living, driven in part by the tech industry's astronomical salaries, makes it difficult for low-wage workers to make ends meet.\n\nAguiniga's situation is not unique. Many low-wage workers in the tech industry are forced to rely on government assistance programs, such as food stamps and Medicaid, to get by. Others are forced to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet.\n\nIntel has faced criticism in the past for its treatment of low-wage workers. In 2018, the company was sued by a group of cafeteria workers who alleged that they were subjected to unfair labor practices and were paid below minimum wage. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but it highlighted the ongoing issues faced by low-wage workers in the tech industry.\n\nIn response to Aguiniga's concerns, Intel spokespersons have emphasized the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion, as well as its efforts to improve the working conditions and benefits for all employees, regardless of badge color. However, Aguiniga remains skeptical, pointing to the lack of tangible changes on the ground.\n\n\"I've been working at Intel for five years now, and nothing has changed,\" she said. \"We're still treated like second-class citizens, and it's time for that to change.\"\n\nAs the tech industry continues to grow and evolve, the treatment of low-wage workers like Aguiniga will remain a pressing issue. Until companies like Intel take meaningful steps to address the disparities faced by their lowest-paid employees, the divide between blue badge and green badge workers will continue to widen, with devastating consequences for those on the lower rungs of the corporate ladder.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- The disputed share swap and oil exploration agreement between BP and the Russian state-owned company Rosneft has collapsed, leaving some BP investors questioning the company's future strategy and freeing Rosneft to look for a new partner in Russia. After a Monday midnight deadline passed, BP's proposed deal with Rosneft lapsed as the company failed to reach a last-minute agreement with Rosneft and resolve a dispute with BP's Russian partners in a separate joint venture, TNK-BP. The TNK-BP partners had taken legal action to block the BP-Rosneft deal almost as soon as it was announced in January. BP said Tuesday it would continue to talk to both Rosneft and its partners in TNK-BP about collaborating in the future. But some analysts said salvaging the original deal would be difficult. \"This opportunity is probably not going to happen\" for BP, said Jane Coffey, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. \"It leaves them without a strategy and calls into question the focus of the management.\" The Rosneft deal was supposed to help BP turn a page after the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. It was also the company's first big transaction since Robert W. Dudley took over as chief executive at the end of last year and was part of his strategy to focus on BP's exploration capabilities in faster-growing markets like Russia and India. Under the proposed arrangement with Rosneft, BP would have gained access to the Kara Sea, an arm of the Arctic Ocean that the energy industry considers to be a new frontier in oil exploration. The collapse of the deal marks a significant setback for BP, which had been seeking to strengthen its position in the Russian energy market. The company had been under pressure to revamp its strategy in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, and the Rosneft deal was seen as a key part of that effort.\n\nThe failure to reach an agreement with Rosneft also raises questions about BP's ability to navigate complex international deals. The company has a history of making large-scale acquisitions and partnerships, but the Rosneft deal was seen as a particularly challenging one due to the complexities of the Russian energy market and the involvement of multiple stakeholders.\n\nIndustry analysts say that BP's failure to secure the Rosneft deal will likely have significant implications for the company's future strategy. \"This is a major blow to BP's plans to expand its presence in Russia,\" said Andrew Brodie, an energy analyst at Deutsche Bank. \"Without this deal, BP will have to rethink its approach to the Russian market and consider alternative partnerships or acquisitions.\"\n\nThe collapse of the deal also has implications for Rosneft, which had been seeking to strengthen its position in the global energy market. The company had been looking to partner with a major international player like BP to gain access to new technologies and expertise, and to increase its presence in international markets.\n\nRosneft is now likely to look for alternative partners to help it achieve its goals. The company has already been in talks with several other international energy companies, including ExxonMobil and Total, and is expected to continue to pursue partnerships and acquisitions in the coming months.\n\nIn a statement, Rosneft said that it was \"disappointed\" by the collapse of the deal with BP, but that it would continue to pursue its goals in the Russian energy market. \"We remain committed to our strategy of expanding our presence in the global energy market, and we will continue to explore opportunities to achieve this goal,\" said Igor Sechin, the CEO of Rosneft.\n\nThe collapse of the deal is also likely to have implications for the wider energy industry. The Russian energy market is seen as a key growth area for the industry, and the failure of the BP-Rosneft deal may make it more difficult for other companies to secure partnerships and investments in the region.\n\nIn the short term, the collapse of the deal is likely to have a negative impact on BP's stock price and its overall financial performance. However, the company is expected to continue to focus on its core business and to explore alternative opportunities for growth and expansion.\n\nIn the longer term, the failure of the deal may have significant implications for the global energy industry. The Russian energy market is seen as a key player in the global energy landscape, and the failure of the BP-Rosneft deal may make it more difficult for other companies to secure partnerships and investments in the region.\n\nAs the industry continues to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions, the collapse of the BP-Rosneft deal serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of international energy deals.",

It will be the only total lunar eclipse of the year, and that in itself should be reason enough to stay up late and marvel as the moon gets swallowed by Earth's shadow. You might have heard that this eclipse is also being called a \"Super Blood Wolf Moon.\" But as astronomers know, no number of edgy modifiers could make this display of cosmic clockwork any cooler. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Unlike a total solar eclipse, when the moon moseys between the sun and the Earth, it's our planet that slides between the sun and the moon during a total lunar eclipse. As the moon passes through Earth's shadow, it will take on a reddish hue, earning it the nickname \"Blood Moon.\" This phenomenon occurs because the Earth's atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, more than longer wavelengths, like red and orange. As a result, the moon appears to turn a deep reddish color, often described as a coppery or orange-red hue.\n\nThe \"Wolf Moon\" part of the eclipse's name comes from the traditional Native American name for January's full moon, which was often associated with the howling of wolves in the cold winter months. This naming convention has been adopted by many modern astronomy enthusiasts and enthusiasts of the night sky.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from much of North and South America, as well as parts of Europe and western Africa. However, the timing and visibility of the eclipse will vary depending on one's location. In the United States, the eclipse will begin at around 9:30 pm EST on Sunday and will reach its peak at approximately 12:15 am EST on Monday. The eclipse will end around 2:45 am EST on Monday.\n\nAstronomers are excited about this event because it provides a rare opportunity to study the Earth's atmosphere and its effects on the moon's appearance. The eclipse will also offer a chance for scientists to gather data on the Earth's atmosphere and its interaction with the moon's surface.\n\nFor those who want to witness the eclipse, it's essential to find a dark location with minimal light pollution to maximize the viewing experience. Binoculars or a telescope can enhance the view, but they're not necessary to appreciate the beauty of the Blood Moon. Many astronomy clubs and organizations are hosting viewing parties and events to coincide with the eclipse, providing a fun and educational experience for those interested in the night sky.\n\nIn conclusion, the total lunar eclipse on Sunday night into early Monday morning is an event not to be missed. With its unique combination of celestial mechanics and atmospheric effects, it promises to be a breathtaking display of cosmic wonder. So grab a blanket, find a dark spot, and get ready to marvel at the \"Super Blood Wolf Moon\" in all its glory.",

        "Text": "How to Develop an Appetite for Insects\n\nIt's derived from Greek and Latin: \"entomon,\" meaning \"insect,\" and \"phagus,\" as in \"feeding on.\" Some think it's the future of food. In 2013, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released a report declaring the need to swap traditional protein sources for insects to support a sustainable future. The report helped drive an explosion of efforts all dedicated to making mealworms your next meal. Presenters at a 2018 conference in Georgia, Eating Insects Athens, published papers this month in a special issue of the Annals of the Entomological Society of America. The volume showed how people who study insects scientifically are now spending more time thinking about eating them. When Christopher Columbus returned from the Americas, he and members of his expedition used the insect-eating of the native inhabitants as an example of savagery, and as justification for dehumanizing people he would later enslave, said Julie Lesnik, an anthropologist at Wayne State University and author of \"Edible Insects and Human Evolution.\" While it wasn't the only factor, the colonial era deepened the stigmatization of entomophagy in mainland Europe, and in turn among European settlers in the Americas. Further distaste grew as insects threatened profitable agricultural monocultures supported by slavery and industrialization. Despite the historical stigma surrounding entomophagy, modern times have seen a resurgence of interest in insect-based cuisine. The rise of sustainable and environmentally-friendly food options has contributed to this shift, as insects are considered a more efficient and eco-friendly source of protein compared to traditional livestock.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits, entomophagy also offers a unique culinary experience. Insects can be roasted, sautÃ©ed, or even used as a substitute for traditional protein sources like meat or eggs. The flavor profile of insects is often described as nutty or earthy, with some species having a sweet or smoky taste.\n\nOne of the pioneers in the field of entomophagy is the company Six Foods, which produces a line of insect-based snacks called Chirps. Founded by Sarah Schnitzer, a Harvard University graduate, the company aims to make entomophagy more accessible and appealing to a wider audience.\n\n\"We're not trying to convince people to give up their burgers and steaks, but rather to consider insects as a viable alternative to traditional protein sources,\" said Schnitzer in an interview. \"Our goal is to make entomophagy mainstream and to show that it's not only sustainable but also delicious.\"\n\nSix Foods is not alone in its efforts to popularize entomophagy. A growing number of companies and researchers are working to develop new products and technologies that make insect-based food more convenient and appealing.\n\nIn the United States, for example, companies like Bug AppÃ©tit and Tiny Farms are working to develop large-scale insect farming operations. These companies aim to provide a consistent supply of high-quality insects to food manufacturers and restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers are exploring new ways to process and utilize insects as a food source. A team of scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, has developed a method to extract protein from insects using a process called \"enzymatic hydrolysis.\" This method could potentially make it easier and more cost-effective to produce insect-based protein powder.\n\nAs the popularity of entomophagy continues to grow, it's likely that we'll see more innovative products and technologies emerge. For now, however, it's clear that the future of food is insect-based, and it's up to consumers to decide whether they're ready to take the leap.",

The wrestler, known in court by his legal name, Terry G. Bollea, sobbed as the verdict was announced in late afternoon, according to people in the courtroom. The jury had considered the case for about six hours. Mr. Bollea's team said the verdict represented \"a statement as to the public's disgust with the invasion of privacy disguised as journalism,\" adding: \"The verdict says, 'No more.' \" The damages awarded to Mr. Bollea on Friday were compensatory: $55 million for economic harm and $60 million for emotional distress. Punitive damages will be established separately, which raises the prospect that Gawker will have to submit to a detailed examination of its finances in court so the jury can assess the scale of the damages. Gawker's founder, Nick Denton, said in his own statement that the jury did not hear all the facts. \"We feel very positive about the appeal that we have already begun preparing, as we expect to win this case ultimately,\" he said. The meaning of the verdict will not be clear for some time. But the perception that a Manhattan media company, noted for its wry tone and its insistence that nearly any topic is fair game, was brought low by a celebrity fighting for privacy is most likely to resonate widely across the industry. At issue in the case, in Pinellas County Circuit Court, was a grainy black-and-white tape made in the mid-2000s, which showed Mr. Bollea having sex with the wife of a friend of his at the time, Todd Clem, a radio shock jock who had legally changed his name to Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. Gawker posted a brief excerpt in a 2012 post by Albert J. Daulerio, the site's former editor in chief, that mused on the appeal of celebrity sex tapes. The verdict is likely to send shockwaves throughout the online publishing industry, with many wondering how a celebrity invasion of privacy case could result in such a staggering award. The case has also raised questions about the limits of freedom of the press and the rights of individuals to privacy in the digital age.\n\nGawker's founder, Nick Denton, has already hinted at an appeal, saying that the jury did not hear all the facts. However, legal experts say that the verdict is unlikely to be overturned, given the overwhelming evidence presented in court.\n\n\"This verdict sends a strong message that celebrities will no longer be bullied by online publications that think they can get away with invading their privacy,\" said attorney Kenneth Turkel, who represented Hulk Hogan in the case. \"The jury's decision is a clear indication that the public is tired of seeing their privacy invaded for the sake of clicks and ratings.\"\n\nThe case has also sparked a debate about the role of Gawker in the online media landscape. The company, known for its edgy and provocative content, has long been a thorn in the side of celebrities and public figures. However, some critics argue that the company's willingness to push boundaries has led to a culture of invasion of privacy and exploitation.\n\n\"This verdict is a wake-up call for online publishers,\" said media analyst Michael Wolff. \"Gawker may have thought it was above the law, but this verdict shows that even the most powerful companies can be held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nThe case is also likely to have far-reaching implications for the online publishing industry as a whole. With the rise of social media and online news outlets, the lines between public and private have become increasingly blurred. The verdict may lead to a re-evaluation of the way online publications approach celebrity news and the limits of freedom of the press.\n\nFor now, Hulk Hogan and his team are celebrating a major victory. The wrestler, who was awarded $115 million in damages, said he was \"overwhelmed with emotion\" by the verdict.\n\n\"I just want to thank the jury for standing up for what's right,\" Hogan said in a statement. \"This verdict is a victory not just for me, but for all the people who have been affected by Gawker's invasion of privacy.\"\n\nAs the case moves forward, one thing is clear: the verdict has sent a powerful message about the importance of privacy in the digital age.",

        "Text": "AS employers demand skills and more skills, many people are turning to online certificate programs to acquire a specific expertise that can lead them to a job or a promotion -- or, sometimes, simply to ensure that they hang on to their current position. Although less well known than \"massive open online courses,\" known as MOOCs, online certificates are \"part of the unbundling of education that is happening now,\" said Joel Shapiro, associate dean of academics at Northwestern University's School of Continuing Studies. \"People are talking about MOOCs, but online education certificates are also part of the trend,\" Dr. Shapiro said. In January, Northwestern added an online certificate in accounting to its 70 post-baccalaureate online courses, and it plans to offer more business- and finance-oriented online certificates soon. Whether private or public, institutions offering online certificates typically require a student to take four to six online courses and pass a proctored exam. The course work can often be counted toward a master's degree. Certificate programs do not usually have prerequisites for entry, but enrollees typically have a bachelor's degree. \"The student adds a skill and gets a stamp of academic approval for the effort,\" said Ray Schroeder, director of the Center for Online Learning, Research and Service at the University of Illinois, Springfield. \"It can be compared to course work for renewing a license to practice, but more often it is a bridge to an academic degree.\" Online certificate programs have become increasingly popular among working professionals seeking to enhance their skills and stay competitive in the job market. These programs offer a flexible and affordable way to acquire specialized knowledge and expertise, often without the need to commit to a full degree program.\n\nOne of the key advantages of online certificate programs is their flexibility. Students can complete coursework at their own pace, anytime and anywhere, making it ideal for those with busy schedules. Additionally, many online certificate programs are designed to be completed in a matter of months, rather than years, allowing students to quickly gain new skills and apply them to their careers.\n\nAnother benefit of online certificate programs is their affordability. Tuition fees for online certificate programs are often significantly lower than those for traditional degree programs, making it a more accessible option for many students. Furthermore, many online certificate programs offer financial aid and scholarships, which can help to offset the cost of tuition.\n\nIn terms of job prospects, online certificate programs can be a valuable asset for working professionals. Many employers view online certificates as a sign of a student's commitment to ongoing learning and professional development. In fact, a recent survey by the Society for Human Resource Management found that 92% of employers believe that online courses and certifications are important or very important when evaluating candidates for job openings.\n\nSome of the most in-demand online certificate programs include data science, cybersecurity, and digital marketing. These fields are constantly evolving, and having a specialized skillset can give students a competitive edge in the job market.\n\nDespite their many benefits, online certificate programs are not without their challenges. One of the biggest hurdles is ensuring that the program is accredited and reputable. Students should research the institution offering the program and ensure that it is accredited by a recognized accrediting agency.\n\nAnother challenge is the quality of the online learning experience. Some students may find that online courses lack the interaction and engagement of traditional classroom learning. However, many online certificate programs are designed to mimic the traditional classroom experience, with interactive discussions, live lectures, and virtual office hours.\n\nIn conclusion, online certificate programs offer a flexible and affordable way for working professionals to acquire specialized skills and expertise. With their many benefits, including flexibility, affordability, and job prospects, it's no wonder that online certificate programs are becoming increasingly popular. By choosing a reputable online certificate program, students can gain a valuable asset that can help them stay competitive in the job market and achieve their career goals.",

They pop up on your computer screen with ominous warnings like, \"Your computer has been infected with a virus. Call our toll-free number immediately for help.\" Often they look like alerts from Microsoft, Apple or Symantec. Sometimes the warning comes in a phone call. Most people ignore these entreaties, which are invariably scams. But one in five recipients actually talks to the fake tech-support centers, and 6 percent ultimately pay the operators to \"fix\" the nonexistent problem, according to recent consumer surveys by Microsoft. Law enforcement authorities, working with Microsoft, have now traced many of these boiler rooms to New Delhi, India's capital and a hub of the global call-center industry. On Tuesday and Wednesday, police from two Delhi suburbs raided 16 fake tech-support centers and arrested about three dozen people. Last month, the Delhi authorities arrested 24 people in similar raids on 10 call centers. The raids, which were conducted in collaboration with Microsoft, marked a significant breakthrough in the global fight against tech-support scams. According to officials, the arrested individuals were part of a large-scale operation that had been targeting computer users worldwide, including in the United States, Europe, and Australia.\n\nThe scammers, who were operating under various names such as \"Windows Support\" and \"Microsoft Technical Support,\" would use sophisticated tactics to trick victims into believing their computers were infected with malware. They would then convince the victims to pay for fake services, including virus removal and system updates.\n\nMicrosoft officials praised the efforts of the Delhi police, saying that the raids had dealt a significant blow to the scamming operation. \"We are grateful for the collaboration with the Delhi police and their commitment to protecting consumers from these types of scams,\" said a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nThe Delhi police, in turn, credited Microsoft with providing critical intelligence and support in identifying the scamming operation. \"We are committed to taking action against these types of scams, and we appreciate Microsoft's help in bringing these criminals to justice,\" said a senior police officer.\n\nThe raids also led to the seizure of equipment and documents, which are expected to provide valuable evidence in the ongoing investigation. The arrested individuals are currently facing charges of fraud and other criminal offenses.\n\nThe success of the raids has sent a strong message to tech-support scammers around the world, said experts. \"This operation demonstrates that law enforcement agencies are taking these types of scams seriously and are willing to take action to protect consumers,\" said a cybersecurity expert.\n\nIn the meantime, Microsoft is urging computer users to remain vigilant and not to fall prey to these types of scams. \"We urge consumers to be cautious of unsolicited calls and emails, and to never provide personal or financial information to unknown individuals,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson.\n\nThe company is also working to educate consumers about the tactics used by tech-support scammers and how to avoid falling victim to their schemes. \"We want to empower consumers with the knowledge they need to protect themselves from these types of scams,\" said the spokesperson.\n\nAs the investigation continues, authorities are working to identify and disrupt other similar scamming operations around the world. The success of the Delhi raids is a significant step forward in the fight against tech-support scams, and it is expected to have a lasting impact on the global cybersecurity landscape.",

Although Apple does not explicitly disclose it in its consumer-facing privacy documentation, a small proportion of Siri recordings are passed on to contractors working for the company around the world. They are tasked with grading the responses on a variety of factors, including whether the activation of the voice assistant was deliberate or accidental, whether the query was something Siri could be expected to help with and whether Siri's response was appropriate. Apple says the data \"is used to help Siri and dictation â€¦ understand you better and recognise what you say\". But the company does not explicitly state that that work is undertaken by humans who listen to the pseudonymised recordings. Apple told the Guardian: \"A small portion of Siri requests are analysed to improve Siri and dictation. The contractors, who are employed by Apple's third-party vendors, are not just limited to grading Siri's responses. They are also responsible for identifying and categorizing the recordings into various categories, including those that contain explicit content, personal identifiable information, and sensitive medical information.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the process, the contractors are not provided with any explicit guidance on how to handle the sensitive recordings. Instead, they are left to use their discretion and judgment to determine what constitutes a \"normal\" or \"acceptable\" response from Siri. This has led to concerns that the contractors may not always be adequately trained to handle the sensitive nature of the recordings.\n\nThe revelations have raised serious questions about Apple's commitment to protecting user privacy. While the company claims that the recordings are pseudonymized, meaning that any personally identifiable information has been removed, the fact that human contractors are listening to and analyzing the recordings raises concerns about the potential for privacy breaches.\n\n\"This is a major privacy concern,\" said Dr. Alexandra Wood, a privacy expert at the University of Oxford. \"Even if the recordings are pseudonymized, the fact that humans are listening to and analyzing them raises serious questions about the potential for privacy breaches. It's not just a matter of Siri's responses being analyzed, it's also a matter of the personal and sensitive information that is being shared with these contractors.\"\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns about the potential for Siri recordings to be used for malicious purposes. With the ability to access and analyze the recordings, contractors could potentially use the information to steal personal data, blackmail users, or even engage in illegal activities.\n\nApple has faced criticism in the past for its handling of user data, including a controversy surrounding the company's use of facial recognition technology. The latest revelations have only added to the growing concerns about the company's commitment to user privacy.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Apple has issued a statement saying that the company takes the privacy and security of its users' data seriously. However, the company has yet to provide any further details on how it plans to address the concerns raised by the revelations.\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, it remains to be seen how Apple will respond to the allegations and whether the company will take steps to address the concerns raised by the revelations. One thing is certain, however - the public's trust in the company's commitment to user privacy has been severely damaged.",

        "Text": "To deposit its eggs, the parasitic oak gall wasp pierces a leaf or stem with its ovipositor, a long tubelike organ that would be a stinger if this wasp were the kind that stings. The plant puffs and swells, forming tumor-like growths called galls. These serve as tiny nursery domes, known cutely (for a parasite) as crypts. Within each crypt, a wasp egg develops until it grows large enough to chew a hole into the gall's crispy skin and emerge an adult. Thus goes the life-cycle of Bassettia pallida. Unless the crypt-keeper wasp -- Euderus set, a parasite in its own right -- comes along. The size of a pin, the wasp locates smooth, dome-shaped galls created by the other wasps. The Euderus set wasp, also known as the parasitic wasp, has a unique relationship with the Bassettia pallida wasp. Instead of laying its own eggs inside the gall, the Euderus set wasp lays its eggs inside the eggs of the Bassettia pallida wasp. This is a phenomenon known as hyperparasitism, where one parasite infects another.\n\nOnce the Euderus set wasp's eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the Bassettia pallida wasp's eggs and larvae, ultimately killing them. This has significant implications for the Bassettia pallida wasp's ability to reproduce and survive. The Euderus set wasp's presence can significantly reduce the number of Bassettia pallida wasps that emerge from the galls, making it a crucial factor in shaping the population dynamics of the species.\n\nThe Euderus set wasp's ability to locate the smooth, dome-shaped galls created by the Bassettia pallida wasp is a remarkable example of evolutionary adaptation. The wasp's small size allows it to navigate the intricate structures of the gall, and its keen sense of smell helps it detect the presence of its host's eggs.\n\nThe relationship between the Bassettia pallida wasp and the Euderus set wasp is a classic example of co-evolution, where two species have evolved together over time. The Bassettia pallida wasp's ability to form galls and the Euderus set wasp's ability to locate and parasitize those galls have both evolved in response to each other's presence.\n\nResearchers studying the Bassettia pallida wasp and the Euderus set wasp are gaining valuable insights into the complex dynamics of parasitism and the ways in which species interact with each other. The study of these wasps is not only fascinating from a biological perspective, but it also has important implications for our understanding of ecology and conservation.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bassettia pallida wasp and the Euderus set wasp are two fascinating examples of the complex relationships that exist in the natural world. The intricate dance of parasitism and co-evolution between these two species is a testament to the remarkable diversity and adaptability of life on Earth.",

        "Text": "Giant flightless birds that dwarfed modern ostriches and weighed nearly half a tonne roamed Europe when the first archaic humans arrived from Africa, scientists say. Researchers unearthed the fossilised thigh bone of one of the feathered beasts while excavating a cave on the Crimean peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea. It is the first time such a massive bird has been found in the northern hemisphere. The discovery, published in the journal Science, sheds new light on the ecosystem of early Europe, which was previously thought to be dominated by smaller, more primitive bird species. The giant bird, estimated to be around 2.5 meters tall and weighing approximately 450 kilograms, is believed to have lived during the early Pleistocene era, around 1.8 million years ago.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead researcher on the project, \"This find is significant because it shows that even in the early days of human migration to Europe, the continent was home to an astonishing array of wildlife. The giant bird would have been an apex predator, feeding on small mammals, reptiles, and other birds.\"\n\nThe fossilized thigh bone, which measures over 60 centimeters in length, was found in a layer of sediment dating back to the early Pleistocene era. The team used a combination of geological and radiometric dating methods to confirm the age of the find.\n\nThe discovery of the giant bird has also raised questions about the relationship between early humans and the environment. \"It's likely that early humans would have had a significant impact on the ecosystem, potentially driving the evolution of the giant bird,\" said Dr. John Taylor, a co-author on the study.\n\nThe find also highlights the importance of the Crimean peninsula as a hub for early human migration. \"The Crimean peninsula has yielded many significant archaeological finds in recent years, and this discovery is another example of the region's importance in understanding human history,\" said Dr. Rodriguez.\n\nThe researchers plan to continue excavating the cave and searching for more fossils to learn more about the giant bird and its place in the early European ecosystem.",

        "Text": "It is estimated that today's obesity epidemic costs the global economy about $2tn (Â£1.6tn) or some 3% of GDP. For individuals, deciding what to eat is a jealously guarded privilege, but for economists obesity is not really about people exercising free-market choice. Instead it is a market failure. The causes of the epidemic are complex, spanning the social sciences to biology and technology. Consider, for example, the shift towards urbanisation and car transport. By reducing many people's daily physical activity, these are estimated together to reduce individuals' need for food by 300 calories a day. So how much less food should the car driver eat to compensate? About one biscuit less a day â€“ a trivial change that only goes to illustrate that few of us really understand the energy needs of our bodies. In market terms, making a rational choice at the dining table requires people to know how much energy they need and how much they are getting â€“ yet neither of these is known. As any one who has ever tried to lose weight knows, in these matters talk is cheap and advice is unreliable. This lack of understanding is compounded by the fact that the food industry is designed to maximize profit, not promote public health. Processed foods, which are often high in calories, sugar, and salt, are frequently cheaper and more convenient than whole, nutrient-dense foods. This has led to a proliferation of \"junk food\" that is engineered to be addictive and irresistible.\n\nFurthermore, the rise of online food delivery and meal kit services has made it easier than ever for people to indulge in unhealthy eating habits. A study by the University of Illinois found that people who order food online are more likely to choose high-calorie, high-fat options, and are less likely to consider nutritional information when making their selections.\n\nThe consequences of this market failure are severe. Obesity is linked to a range of serious health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. The economic burden of obesity is also significant, with estimates suggesting that it costs the global economy around $2 trillion annually.\n\nSo, what can be done to address this crisis? One solution is to implement policies that promote healthy eating and physical activity. This could include taxes on sugary drinks and processed foods, as well as incentives for healthy behaviors such as gym memberships and bike lanes.\n\nGovernments and businesses must also work together to create a food environment that supports public health. This could involve promoting whole, nutrient-dense foods through education campaigns and labeling requirements, as well as restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children.\n\nIndividuals also have a role to play in addressing the obesity epidemic. By educating themselves about healthy eating and physical activity, and making conscious choices about their diet and lifestyle, people can take control of their own health and well-being.\n\nUltimately, the solution to the obesity epidemic will require a multifaceted approach that involves government, business, and individual action. By working together, we can create a healthier, more sustainable food system that benefits everyone.",

Parents of pupils at Parkfield community school in Saltley have staged weekly protests over the lessons, which they claim promote gay and transgender lifestyles. Earlier this month, hundreds of mainly Muslim children, aged between four and 11, were withdrawn from the school for the day. The school announced on Thursday that the No Outsiders lessons, which teach tolerance of diverse groups, including those of different races, genders and sexual orientation, would not be taught \"until a resolution has been reached\". Dr. Brian Lightman, the former head of the Association of School and College Leaders, has called for the school to resume the lessons, saying that it is essential for children to learn about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"I understand that parents have concerns, but it's crucial that children are taught about the importance of respect and tolerance towards all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion,\" Dr. Lightman said in an interview. \"These lessons are not about promoting any particular lifestyle, but about creating a safe and inclusive environment for all children to learn and grow.\"\n\nThe No Outsiders program, developed by teacher Andrew Moffat, aims to promote understanding and acceptance of diversity among children as young as four. The lessons, which are taught through stories and discussions, cover topics such as same-sex parents, gender identity, and different family structures.\n\nHowever, some parents at Parkfield Community School have expressed concerns that the lessons are too explicit and are promoting a \"gay agenda\" to their children. The protests, which have been ongoing for several weeks, have resulted in the withdrawal of hundreds of pupils from the school.\n\nThe school's decision to suspend the lessons has been widely criticized by education experts and LGBT+ advocates, who say that it sends a message that certain groups of people are not worthy of respect and inclusion.\n\n\"It's disappointing to see a school caving in to pressure from a small group of parents,\" said Peter Tatchell, a human rights campaigner. \"The No Outsiders program is a vital part of promoting tolerance and understanding in our schools. By suspending the lessons, the school is sending a message that it's okay to discriminate against certain groups of people.\"\n\nThe school's decision has also been criticized by the local council, which has offered to provide additional support to the school to help it address the concerns of parents.\n\n\"We understand that there are concerns among some parents about the No Outsiders program, and we are willing to work with the school to find a solution that meets the needs of all parents and pupils,\" said a spokesperson for Birmingham City Council.\n\nAs the debate continues, the school remains closed to hundreds of pupils who have withdrawn due to the protests. The school's leadership is under pressure to find a solution that addresses the concerns of all parents and ensures that the school remains a welcoming and inclusive environment for all children.\n\nIn the meantime, Dr. Lightman's call for the school to resume the lessons has been echoed by many education experts and LGBT+ advocates, who say that it is essential for children to learn about diversity and inclusion in a safe and supportive environment.",

The National Audit Office (NAO) said the figure would climb if companies collapse and are unable to pay for cleaning up their operations, leaving the government to pick up the tab. The industry has contributed more than Â£300bn in tax revenues to the Treasury since the 1960s. North Sea production peaked in the mid-1980s and the late 1990s, and has been declining ever since. Tax revenue peaked at about 3% of GDP during the 1980s, but slumped as output from the region declined. A combination of low oil prices and decommissioning costs resulted in the industry becoming a net drain on the government purse for the first time in 2016. The report by the National Audit Office highlights the significant financial burden that British taxpayers will face in the coming years as a result of the decommissioning of North Sea oil and gas infrastructure. The watchdog's findings have raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the industry and the potential impact on public finances.\n\nThe Â£24bn bill is comprised of the estimated costs of decommissioning wells, rigs, and pipelines, as well as the potential costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the industry's operations. The NAO warns that this figure could increase significantly if companies collapse or are unable to pay for the decommissioning process, leaving the government to foot the bill.\n\nThe industry's contribution to the Treasury has been significant, with over Â£300bn in tax revenues generated since the 1960s. However, the decline in North Sea production has resulted in a decline in tax revenue, with the industry becoming a net drain on the government purse for the first time in 2016.\n\nThe report highlights the need for the government to develop a comprehensive plan for the decommissioning of North Sea infrastructure, including the development of a decommissioning fund to ensure that companies are able to pay for the costs of decommissioning. The NAO also recommends that the government work with the industry to develop a plan for the long-term management of decommissioned infrastructure, to minimize the risk of environmental damage.\n\nThe news has sparked concerns among environmental groups, who have long been critical of the industry's impact on the environment. \"This report highlights the devastating impact that the oil and gas industry has had on our environment and our public finances,\" said a spokesperson for Friends of the Earth. \"It's time for the government to take action and develop a plan for the sustainable management of our natural resources.\"\n\nThe industry has also come under fire from some quarters, with critics arguing that the Â£24bn bill is a result of the government's failure to regulate the industry effectively. \"The government has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to regulating the oil and gas industry,\" said a spokesperson for Greenpeace. \"This report is a wake-up call for the government to take action and ensure that the industry is held accountable for its actions.\"\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns among investors, who are worried about the potential impact on the industry's long-term viability. \"The decommissioning costs are a significant concern for investors,\" said a spokesperson for a leading oil and gas company. \"We need to see a clear plan from the government and the industry for the long-term management of decommissioned infrastructure, to ensure that the industry remains viable in the long term.\"\n\nThe report by the National Audit Office has sparked a heated debate about the future of the oil and gas industry in the UK, with many calling for a shift towards renewable energy sources. As the industry continues to decline, the government will need to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term management of decommissioned infrastructure, to minimize the risk of environmental damage and ensure that the industry remains viable in the long term.",

The end-of-year close is almost 30% higher than the February low. The surge in mining companies and dollar earners was a key driver of the FTSE 100's performance in 2016, with companies such as Antofagasta, Anglo American, and Glencore benefiting from a rebound in commodity prices. The dollar earners, including companies like Diageo and Reckitt Benckiser, also saw their stock prices rise as the value of the pound fell against the US currency.\n\nAnalysts pointed to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the US presidential election as a key factor in the market's volatility earlier in the year. However, the election of Donald Trump, who has pledged to boost infrastructure spending and cut taxes, has helped to boost investor confidence and drive the market higher.\n\n\"Trump's election has brought a sense of optimism to the market, and his plans for fiscal stimulus have helped to drive up stock prices,\" said Ian Williams, an investment manager at Jupiter Asset Management. \"The mining sector has been particularly strong, driven by a rebound in commodity prices and hopes of increased demand from China.\"\n\nThe end-of-year close marks a significant turnaround for the FTSE 100, which had been trading near its lowest levels in February. The index's 14.4% rise in 2016 is its best annual performance since 2013, and comes despite a tumultuous year for global markets.\n\nLooking ahead to 2017, analysts are predicting a continued rise in the FTSE 100, driven by expectations of further fiscal stimulus from the Trump administration and a rebound in global economic growth. However, they also warn of potential risks, including the impact of Brexit on the UK economy and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the global economy.\n\n\"The FTSE 100's performance in 2016 has been impressive, but we remain cautious about the outlook for 2017,\" said Laura Foll, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. \"While Trump's plans for fiscal stimulus could drive up stock prices, there are also risks that could impact the market, including the impact of Brexit on the UK economy and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the global economy.\"",

        "Text": "Is the American worker finally getting a raise? After years of scant real gains despite steadily falling unemployment and healthy hiring, wages picked up significantly last month, a sign the job market could be tightening enough to force companies to pay more to attract and retain employees. The half a percentage point increase in average hourly earnings in January was the brightest spot in a generally positive Labor Department report on Friday, which showed job creation slowing from the white-hot pace of late 2015 even as the unemployment rate fell to an eight-year low of 4.9 percent. The last six months were the best extended period for employee paychecks since the recovery began six-and-a-half years ago. \"That gain in average hourly earnings is significant,\" said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. Sustained increases are still needed to make up for years of stagnation, she added, \"but it's a move in the right direction, and that's reassuring.\" \"The financial markets are leery,\" said Michael Hanson, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, \"but the labor market still looks like it's continuing to grow.\" President Obama, who expressed frustration that he has not received the credit he feels he deserves for the country's improving economy, said the jobs numbers were further signs of progress. \"After reaching 10 percent in 2009, the unemployment rate has now fallen to 4.9 percent even as more Americans joined the job market last month,\" he told reporters at a White House briefing in Washington. The president's optimism was echoed by many economists, who believe that the labor market is finally showing signs of strength after years of sluggish growth. The increase in average hourly earnings, which was the largest since 2009, suggests that companies are willing to pay more to attract and retain top talent in a tight job market.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the trend will continue. Some economists argue that the increase in wages is still not enough to make up for the years of stagnation, and that it may be a one-time anomaly. \"We need to see sustained increases in wages to really make a dent in the issue of income inequality,\" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"One month's increase is a good start, but we need to see it continue over time.\"\n\nDespite the mixed opinions, the jobs report was widely seen as a positive sign for the economy. The unemployment rate, which fell to 4.9 percent, is now at its lowest level since 2007. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits also fell to a 14-year low, suggesting that the labor market is continuing to tighten.\n\nThe report was also seen as a sign of strength for the U.S. economy, which has been growing steadily for several years. The country's GDP grew at a rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, and many economists believe that it will continue to grow at a moderate pace in the coming years.\n\nThe jobs report was also seen as a positive sign for the presidential election, which is just a few months away. Both the Democratic and Republican candidates have been vying for the support of workers, and the report could be seen as a boost for the Democratic ticket. President Obama, who is nearing the end of his term, has been touting the economy's progress as one of his major achievements, and the report could be seen as a validation of his policies.\n\nIn conclusion, the jobs report was a positive sign for the U.S. economy, with average hourly earnings increasing by half a percentage point and the unemployment rate falling to an eight-year low. While some economists are skeptical about the trend, many believe that it is a sign of strength for the labor market and the economy as a whole. As the presidential election approaches, the report could be seen as a boost for the Democratic ticket, and a validation of President Obama's policies.",

        "Text": "UK inflation unexpectedly fell further last month to the lowest level in more than a year as lower airfares provided some relief for cash-strapped Britons. Triggering a sell-off in the pound to the lowest levels seen this year, the consumer price index dropped from 2.5% in March to 2.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Economists had expected the annual rate of growth in prices to remain unchanged. This decline will be welcomed by consumers under sharp pressure from rising prices since the Brexit vote, when a sudden drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of imported goods. The unexpected drop in inflation is likely to ease concerns about the impact of rising prices on household budgets, which have been under intense pressure since the UK's decision to leave the European Union. The decline in airfares, which fell by 4.3% compared to the same period last year, was the main contributor to the fall in inflation.\n\nHowever, despite the welcome news, economists warn that the UK's inflation rate is still above the Bank of England's 2% target, and the central bank is unlikely to change its monetary policy anytime soon. The Bank of England has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5% since the financial crisis and has been pumping billions of pounds into the economy through quantitative easing.\n\nThe fall in inflation has also sparked concerns about the impact on the pound, which has fallen to its lowest level against the US dollar this year. The pound has been under pressure in recent months due to concerns about the impact of Brexit on the UK's economy, and the decline in inflation has added to the uncertainty.\n\nSterling's decline has also had a knock-on effect on other assets, with the FTSE 100 index of leading UK companies falling by 0.5% in early trading. The decline in the pound has made imports more expensive, which could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses.\n\nDespite the challenges, the UK's economy has shown signs of resilience in recent months, with GDP growth exceeding expectations in the first quarter of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the UK's economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter, beating expectations of 0.1%.\n\nThe UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, welcomed the news, saying that it was a \"positive sign\" for the economy. However, he also warned that the UK's economy still faces significant challenges, including the impact of Brexit and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the UK's future trading relationships with the EU.\n\nThe UK's inflation rate has been a key concern for policymakers in recent years, with the Bank of England's governor, Mark Carney, warning that it could lead to a decline in living standards if left unchecked. The unexpected drop in inflation will be a welcome relief for consumers, who have been struggling with the rising cost of living since the Brexit vote. However, the challenges facing the UK's economy are far from over, and policymakers will need to continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that the economy remains on a stable footing.",

The US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later is also causing some uncertainty. Brent crude is down 2% at $31.15 as Russia said there were no specific plans to co-ordinate action (presumably with Opec) to support the tumbling oil price. Meanwhile Chinese markets fell again following profits at the country's industrial firms fell 4.7% in December, the seventh successive monthly decline. So the FTSE 100 is currently 19.37 points lower at 5892.09, with Germany's Dax and France's Cac also edging down. Mining shares are under pressure after Antofagasta, down 9p at 369p, missed its forecasts for 2015 production and predicted lower than expected output for the current year. It said 2015 copper production fell 10.6% to 630,000 tonnes, below its 635,000 target. For 2016 it expected to produce 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes, well below market expectations. So Anglo American - boosted on Tuesday by sparkling diamond sales - is 10.45p lower at 242.9p, BHP Billiton is down 22.7p at 642.8p and Rio Tinto is 31.5p off at Â£16.57. Banks have been hit by the surprise announcement of extra provisions by Royal Bank of Scotland, down 8.7p at 252.2p. The banking sector's woes were further exacerbated by the news that Barclays, another major UK lender, would be setting aside an additional Â£1.1 billion to cover potential losses on its loan book. The bank's shares fell 5.5p to 174.5p, contributing to the overall decline in the financial sector.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, due later today, is also casting a shadow over the markets. Investors are bracing themselves for the possibility of a rate hike, which could have significant implications for the global economy.\n\nIn other corporate news, Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket chain, announced a 1.5% rise in like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter, beating expectations. The news sent its shares up 2.5p to 173.5p, providing a rare bright spot in an otherwise gloomy day for the markets.\n\nThe declines in the mining and banking sectors have dragged the FTSE 100 index lower, with the index now standing at 5892.09, down 19.37 points from its opening level. The German Dax and French Cac indices are also lower, with the Dax down 0.3% and the Cac down 0.4%.\n\nDespite the negative sentiment, some analysts remain optimistic about the prospects for the global economy. \"While there are certainly challenges ahead, we believe that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong,\" said one analyst. \"The recent declines in oil prices are a welcome development, and we expect to see a pickup in consumer spending and business investment as a result.\"\n\nIn the meantime, investors will be keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, which is due to be announced later today. The decision is expected to have significant implications for the global economy, and could send shockwaves through the markets.",

        "Text": "The stock market has been shaken by turbulence in the last few weeks, something it hasn't experienced in a few years. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plunged more than 10 percent from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, a sell-off that pushed the market into a correction. The S.&P. has since rebounded, regaining much of those losses. That type of volatility is a normal occurrence, but theories abound to explain what caused it. Adam I. Taback, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said the volatility was the result of the economic expansion's being in the seventh or eighth inning of a baseball game. \"We may have extra innings in this cycle,\" he said. \"But people are more cognizant that the equity markets have more risk in them. They're happy that their portfolios are diversified but worried where they are in the economic cycle.\" Some try to take a more historical view. Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, said volatility typically arose for three reasons: a technical correction where stocks pause but continue rising because company fundamentals are sound; a correction that reflects a change in the business cycle; or a systemic correction, like the 1929 stock market crash or 2008 financial crisis. \"The one we experienced last week was the mildest,\" Mr. Ablin said. Experts Weigh in on Causes of Market Volatility\n\nWhile the stock market has stabilized, many investors are still left wondering what triggered the recent turbulence. As the S&P 500-stock index continues to fluctuate, experts are offering their insights on the possible causes.\n\nFor some, the volatility is a natural part of the economic cycle. \"We're in the seventh or eighth inning of a baseball game,\" said Adam I. Taback, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \"We may have extra innings in this cycle.\" Taback believes that investors are becoming more aware of the risks associated with the equity markets, leading to increased caution.\n\nOthers take a more historical view, pointing to the three main reasons for market corrections: technical corrections, business cycle corrections, and systemic corrections. Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, explained that the recent correction was likely a technical correction, where stocks pause but continue rising due to sound company fundamentals.\n\nHowever, Ablin also acknowledged that the current market environment is complex and influenced by various factors. \"The economy is still growing, but at a slower pace,\" he said. \"Interest rates are low, but there are concerns about inflation and the impact of tariffs on global trade.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty, many experts agree that diversification is key to navigating market volatility. \"Investors should focus on their long-term goals and not get caught up in short-term market fluctuations,\" said Taback. \"A well-diversified portfolio can help reduce risk and increase potential returns over time.\"\n\nAs the market continues to evolve, investors would do well to stay informed and adapt to changing conditions. By understanding the causes of market volatility and maintaining a long-term perspective, they can better navigate the ups and downs of the stock market.",

With the annual upfront presentations beginning Monday, the broadcast networks will once again make their pitch to advertisers why they still matter in the era of Netflix and Hulu. There are pressing questions. What will a Fox broadcast network look like without a TV studio after it's sold off to Disney or Comcast? (Hint: Reality and sports). As the broadcast networks prepare to present their fall schedules to advertisers, the industry is facing a perfect storm of challenges. Ratings have been declining for several years, and the rise of streaming services has changed the way people consume television. The traditional 30-second commercial has given way to shorter, more targeted ads, and the networks are struggling to adapt.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is the fate of the Fox broadcast network, which is set to be sold to either Disney or Comcast. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the year, and it's unclear what the future holds for the network's TV studio. Industry insiders say that reality TV and sports programming are likely to be the mainstays of a post-Fox broadcast network, but it's unclear what will happen to the network's scripted programming.\n\nThe networks are also facing pressure to produce more content that appeals to a younger audience. With the rise of streaming services, younger viewers are increasingly turning to online platforms for their entertainment needs. The networks are trying to adapt by creating more shows that appeal to this demographic, but it's unclear whether these efforts will be enough to stem the tide of declining ratings.\n\nDespite these challenges, the networks remain optimistic about their prospects. They point to the success of shows like \"This Is Us\" and \"The Walking Dead,\" which have attracted large audiences and generated significant revenue. They also highlight the importance of live events, such as sports and awards shows, which continue to draw large audiences and generate significant ad revenue.\n\nThe upfront presentations, which begin Monday, will be closely watched by advertisers and industry insiders alike. The networks will be making their pitch to advertisers, touting their ability to reach large audiences and generate significant revenue. But the question on everyone's mind is whether the networks can adapt to the changing media landscape and continue to thrive in the era of streaming services.\n\nIn the end, the success of the broadcast networks will depend on their ability to evolve and adapt to changing viewer habits. They will need to produce high-quality content that appeals to a younger audience, and they will need to find new ways to monetize their programming. If they can do that, they may be able to continue to thrive in the era of streaming services. But if they fail to adapt, they risk becoming relics of the past.",

        "Text": "For a glimpse at the country's divided political reality, look no farther than a pair of television studios on opposite sides of the Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan. From her set inside MSNBC headquarters, Rachel Maddow opened her prime-time coverage of the Trump impeachment hearings by calling the first day's testimony \"a double-barreled problem for the president -- triple-barreled, maybe.\" President Trump, she said, had been \"caught doing something illegal\" at the \"direct expense of the country's national interest.\" One block south, from a Fox News studio, Sean Hannity welcomed viewers by declaring \"a great day for the United States, for the country, for the president -- and a lousy day for the corrupt, do-nothing-for-three-years, radical, extreme, socialist Democrats and their top allies known as the media mob.\" These distinct visions -- delivered simultaneously from skyscrapers roughly 1,000 feet apart -- were beamed at the 9 p.m. hour into millions of American living rooms. It was a striking reflection of today's choose-your-own-news media environment, and a far cry from the era when Americans experienced major events through the same television hearth. Viewers are flocking to opinionated outlets with irreconcilable differences . The proliferation of 24-hour news channels and social media platforms has created a fragmented media landscape, where audiences can curate their own news experiences. This phenomenon has given rise to a new breed of news consumers who seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and biases.\n\nAs a result, the traditional notion of a shared national narrative has given way to a cacophony of competing narratives. The MSNBC and Fox News studios, situated just blocks apart, are a physical manifestation of this phenomenon. While Maddow and her team present a liberal perspective, Hannity and his colleagues offer a conservative viewpoint.\n\nThis dichotomy is not limited to cable news. Online news outlets and social media platforms have created echo chambers, where users are exposed to a narrow range of perspectives and opinions. A study by the Pew Research Center found that in 2018, 43% of Americans got their news from social media, and 63% of those who did so were more likely to encounter news that aligned with their existing views.\n\nThe implications of this fragmented media environment are far-reaching. In an era where facts are increasingly subject to interpretation, the ability to discern truth from fiction has become a significant challenge. A survey by the Knight Foundation found that 72% of Americans believe that the media has a responsibility to present a balanced view of the news, but only 44% think that the media is doing a good job of meeting this responsibility.\n\nThe consequences of this fragmentation are evident in the way that Americans engage with politics. A study by the Pew Research Center found that in 2016, 44% of Trump supporters and 55% of Clinton supporters got their news from sources that were overwhelmingly favorable to their candidate. This echo-chamber effect can lead to a lack of exposure to opposing viewpoints, which can reinforce existing biases and make it more difficult to find common ground.\n\nIn response to these challenges, some media outlets are experimenting with new approaches to presenting the news. The New York Times, for example, has launched a fact-checking initiative, which aims to provide readers with accurate information about the news. Other outlets are exploring the use of algorithms to recommend news stories that are outside of a user's typical viewing habits.\n\nUltimately, the future of journalism will depend on its ability to adapt to the changing media landscape. As the public's reliance on social media and online news sources continues to grow, it is essential that news organizations prioritize accuracy, balance, and transparency. By doing so, they can help to bridge the divide between competing narratives and promote a more informed and engaged citizenry.",

Many important dinosaur discoveries are made by nonexperts in just this casual way. The discovery sparked a flurry of excitement among paleontologists, who quickly arrived on the scene to excavate the site. Led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a renowned paleontologist from the University of Buenos Aires, the team spent several weeks carefully uncovering the fossil remains.\n\nAs they dug deeper, the team was thrilled to find a nearly complete skeleton of a previously unknown species of hadrosaur, a type of duck-billed dinosaur. The fossil, estimated to be around 70 million years old, was remarkably well-preserved, with even the smallest details still intact.\n\n\"It's an incredible find,\" Dr. Rodriguez exclaimed. \"This hadrosaur is unlike any we've seen before.

However, despite the passionate arguments and positions on both sides of the debate, recent analysis suggests that the human race isn't split 50/50 on the issue and that support for forcibly exiting the planet Earth from the Sol system is somewhat overstated. Dr Allison McAllister of the Federation for Furthering Science (FFS) conducted an exhaustive study on all the available data and collection methods and stated that the current approaches tend to heavily favour those who believe Earth would be better off as an independent planet, slowly and aimlessly wandering the cosmos while rapidly freezing solid and becoming hostile to all present life forms (within reason). \"Current polling methods tend to favour online surveys, which are known to bias results to the more passionate and engaged respondents, who typically favour Earth's exit from the solar system\" McAllister explained. \"However, phone polls show a much clearer lead for the Earth remaining in orbit around our current sun\". \"Then there's the fact that for a decision as monumental as this, all life forms on Earth gets a vote, and both phone and internet polls strongly bias the data in favour of the human views\". McAllister admitted that FFS had attempted to conduct polls of several other species, but they had proved less useful. \"What we ended up with was a large database of various moos, squawks, chirps, barks and unsettling squelches. Quite interesting from a zoological perspective no doubt, but it doesn't tell us a great deal about voting intentions\". The referendum on Earth's membership of the solar system, scheduled for this June, came about from a growing sense of dissatisfaction and frustration among certain aspects of society regarding Earth's treatment by other elements of the solar system. \"It's ridiculous that Earth has to contribute so much to this solar system and get so little in return. The FFS study's findings have sparked a heated debate among experts and the general public alike, with some arguing that the results are a clear indication that the Earth's membership in the solar system is not as secure as previously thought. Proponents of Earth's exit from the solar system, on the other hand, claim that the study is flawed and that the results are being manipulated to sway public opinion.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of the FFS study is Dr. Rachel Patel, a renowned astrophysicist who has been a long-time advocate for Earth's independence. \"The study is based on outdated data and methodology,\" she said in an interview. \"It's clear that the FFS is trying to influence the outcome of the referendum by presenting biased results. We need a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to determine the will of the people.\"\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of Earth's continued membership in the solar system are hailing the study as a victory. \"This study confirms what we've been saying all along - that the majority of the public is in favor of staying in the solar system,\" said Dr. John Lee, a leading expert on solar system politics. \"We need to focus on finding solutions to the issues that are driving the dissatisfaction among certain segments of society, rather than rushing to exit the solar system without a clear plan in place.\"\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, the United Nations has announced plans to hold a special session to discuss the findings of the FFS study and the implications for the solar system. The session is expected to be attended by representatives from all eight planets, as well as other celestial bodies and organizations.\n\nIn the meantime, the people of Earth are left to ponder the future of their planet and its place in the solar system. Will they choose to remain in the solar system, or will they opt for independence and the unknown? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "BEYOND \"green-collar\" jobs, like retrofitting a home to conserve energy or helping build a wind farm, an energy-conscious economy will need a new generation of environmentally smart managers, and that's where community colleges are stepping up with new courses and degree programs. The federal government is pouring $500 million into training for green jobs, and the sector devoted to energy efficiency is estimated to grow as much as fourfold in the next decade, to some 1.3 million people, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its March 2010 report was financed by the Energy Department. Green-collar jobs have grabbed the public's attention, and educational institutions are starting programs to train the managers who will oversee the technologies, manufacturing processes and materials that will be used to conserve energy and help safeguard natural resources. Some community colleges already are offering two-year degrees in environmental management and certificates for managers who want to add green qualifications  which means learning more about the environmental aspects of a particular field  to their resumes. These colleges are offering some courses and training on campus as well as online. As the demand for energy-efficient solutions continues to grow, community colleges are rising to the challenge by providing students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this emerging field. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, over 1,000 community colleges across the United States are already offering courses and programs related to sustainability and environmental management.\n\nOne such example is the Community College of Baltimore County, which has launched a two-year associate's degree program in sustainability management. The program covers topics such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable building practices, and is designed to prepare students for careers in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and government.\n\nAnother institution, the Los Angeles City College, has developed a certificate program in environmental management, which focuses on the environmental impacts of business operations and provides students with the skills to develop and implement sustainable practices. The program is designed to be completed in just one year and is open to students of all backgrounds and levels of experience.\n\nIn addition to these degree and certificate programs, community colleges are also offering a range of courses and training sessions on energy efficiency and sustainability. For example, the College of the Redwoods in California offers a course on energy auditing, which teaches students how to conduct energy audits and identify opportunities for energy savings in buildings. Similarly, the North Shore Community College in Massachusetts offers a course on renewable energy systems, which covers the design, installation, and maintenance of solar and wind energy systems.\n\nThe federal government's investment in green job training is expected to have a significant impact on the growth of the energy efficiency sector. According to the Energy Department, the sector is expected to grow by as much as fourfold in the next decade, creating an estimated 1.3 million new jobs. With community colleges at the forefront of providing training and education for these jobs, students can expect to have a wide range of career opportunities in this emerging field.\n\nAs the demand for energy-efficient solutions continues to grow, community colleges are well-positioned to play a critical role in preparing the next generation of environmental managers and sustainability professionals. By providing students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in this field, community colleges are helping to drive innovation and economic growth, while also contributing to a more sustainable future.",

        "Text": "Q: Given all the terrible stories that have come out about Uber, should I erase the app from my phone, even though the CEO has resigned? Let's list the bad things. Uber, which rightly or wrongly feels like patient zero in the plague of horrible tech startups, had a bad rep even before the events that brought down CEO Travis Kalanick last week. Despite the resignation of Travis Kalanick, Uber's troubled past and present may still warrant a reevaluation of the app's presence on your phone. The company's history of controversy has been well-documented, from allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination within the company to its role in the development of self-driving cars.\n\nOne of the most significant issues surrounding Uber has been its treatment of employees. In 2017, former engineer Susan Fowler wrote a blog post detailing her experiences with sexual harassment and discrimination while working at the company. Her story sparked a wider investigation into Uber's workplace culture, which ultimately led to the resignation of several high-ranking executives, including Kalanick.\n\nAdditionally, Uber has faced criticism for its handling of data privacy. In 2016, the company was accused of collecting and storing location data from its users without their knowledge or consent. This has raised concerns about the company's commitment to user privacy and its ability to protect sensitive information.\n\nFurthermore, Uber has been involved in several high-profile disputes with its drivers and passengers. In 2015, the company faced backlash after it was discovered that it had been using a tactic called \"surge pricing\" to charge customers higher fares during peak hours. This move was seen as unfair and exploitative, and it sparked widespread criticism of the company's business practices.\n\nIn light of these controversies, it's understandable that you may be questioning whether you should continue to use Uber. While the resignation of Kalanick may be a positive step towards change, it's unclear whether the company's new leadership will be able to address the underlying issues that have led to its troubled reputation.\n\nUltimately, the decision to erase the Uber app from your phone is a personal one. If you're concerned about the company's treatment of employees, its handling of data privacy, or its business practices, you may want to consider alternative transportation options. However, if you're willing to give the company another chance, you may want to keep an eye on its progress and see if it can make meaningful changes to its culture and practices.\n\nIn the meantime, it's worth noting that there are several alternative ride-hailing apps available, including Lyft, Via, and Juno. These companies may not be perfect, but they have all been praised for their more transparent and customer-friendly business practices. As the ride-hailing industry continues to evolve, it's likely that we'll see more companies emerge that prioritize fairness, transparency, and user safety.",

But several companies that offer lightsaber combat and Jedi training classes for adults and children apparently went too far for Lucasfilm and its new owner, the Walt Disney Company, which has a reputation for zealously guarding intellectual property. Lucasfilm filed a lawsuit this month against New York Jedi and Lightsaber Academy, which teach classes on how to engage in Jedi battles, claiming that the businesses' use of the words \"Jedi\" and \"lightsaber\" along with a logo of the Jedi Order are in violation of intellectual property laws. The lawsuit identifies Michael Brown, also known as Flynn Michael, as the man behind the businesses. It says that he had sought licensing permission from Lucasfilm and, having been denied it, continued to operate despite receiving multiple cease-and-desist letters. Mr. Brown answered emails on Tuesday but said he was too busy and had poor cellular reception, so he could not answer questions about the lawsuit. According to the lawsuit, Lucasfilm claims that New York Jedi and Lightsaber Academy have been using the Jedi Order's logo, which is a registered trademark, without permission. The logo, featuring a stylized image of a Jedi's lightsaber and the words \"Jedi Order\" in a distinctive font, is allegedly being used on the businesses' websites, social media accounts, and promotional materials.\n\nLucasfilm also accuses the companies of using the words \"Jedi\" and \"lightsaber\" in their business names, which are also registered trademarks. The lawsuit argues that this use is likely to cause confusion among consumers, who may believe that the businesses are officially affiliated with Lucasfilm or the Star Wars franchise.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the companies from using the disputed marks, as well as damages and attorney's fees. It also names Michael Brown, the owner of New York Jedi and Lightsaber Academy, as a defendant, alleging that he is responsible for the businesses' actions.\n\nIn a statement, Lucasfilm said that it has always been open to licensing agreements with businesses that want to use Star Wars intellectual property in a responsible and respectful manner. However, the company emphasized that it will not tolerate unauthorized use of its trademarks and intellectual property.\n\n\"We are committed to protecting the integrity of the Star Wars brand and ensuring that our fans have a positive and authentic experience,\" said a Lucasfilm spokesperson. \"We will take all necessary steps to protect our intellectual property and prevent confusion among consumers.\"\n\nThe lawsuit has sparked a heated debate among fans of the Star Wars franchise, with some defending the rights of entrepreneurs to use creative and imaginative concepts, while others argue that Lucasfilm has a right to protect its intellectual property.\n\n\"I think it's ridiculous that Lucasfilm is suing these businesses,\" said Sarah Johnson, a fan of the Star Wars franchise. \"I've taken lightsaber classes with New York Jedi and it was an amazing experience. I don't see how it's harming anyone.\"\n\nOthers, however, believe that Lucasfilm has a responsibility to protect its intellectual property and ensure that it is used in a way that is respectful to the franchise and its fans.\n\n\"I understand that Lucasfilm wants to protect its intellectual property, but I also think that these businesses are taking advantage of the Star Wars brand,\" said John Smith, a fan of the franchise. \"If they want to use the words 'Jedi' and 'lightsaber,' they should get permission from Lucasfilm or come up with their own original concepts.\"\n\nThe outcome of the lawsuit is likely to be closely watched by fans of the Star Wars franchise and entrepreneurs who operate in the pop culture industry.",

Objections have come from campuses all over the country, and with good reason. The ban clearly affects Muslims, including current and prospective students, but its reach (even after clarifications on green-card holders) is far wider. The executive order, which was hastily drafted and implemented without proper consultation or consideration for its consequences, has sparked widespread outrage and concern among academics, students, and faculty members across the United States. The ban's impact on international students, researchers, and scholars has been particularly devastating, as it has created uncertainty and fear about their ability to continue their studies or work in the country.\n\nMany universities and colleges have spoken out against the ban, citing its potential to harm academic freedom, diversity, and the global exchange of ideas. In a statement, the American Council on Education, which represents over 1,800 higher education institutions, called the ban \"un-American\" and \"unfair\" and urged the administration to reconsider its impact on international students.\n\nThe ban has also had a disproportionate impact on students from countries with significant Muslim populations, such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Many of these students have been forced to abandon their studies or leave the country, disrupting their academic and professional trajectories.\n\nIn addition to the human toll, the ban has also raised concerns about the potential damage to the United States' reputation as a beacon of academic freedom and diversity. The country's universities and research institutions have long been a source of pride and a symbol of American ingenuity and innovation, attracting students and scholars from around the world.\n\nThe ban has also had significant economic implications, as it has disrupted the flow of international students and scholars who contribute to the US economy through tuition fees, research grants, and innovation. According to a report by the National Foundation for American Policy, international students contributed $38.6 billion to the US economy in 2016-2017 alone.\n\nAs the debate over the ban continues, many are calling for a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to immigration and national security. In the meantime, universities and colleges across the country are working to support their international students and scholars, providing them with resources and assistance to navigate the complex and ever-changing landscape of immigration policy.\n\nIn the words of Dr. Marybeth Gasman, a professor of higher education at the University of Pennsylvania, \"The ban is not just about immigration; it's about the values we hold dear as a society. We need to remember that our universities are places where people from all over the world come together to learn, share ideas, and make a difference. We cannot let fear and intolerance dictate our policies.\"",

        "Text": "Australian researchers have produced new evidence disputing a popular theory of whale evolution proffered by scientists from Charles Darwin onwards about the development of baleen, the hair-like strands used to filter krill out of the water and down the gullet of the largest mammals on the planet. Using 3D modelling of a prehistoric tooth dug out of the rocks near Torquay on Victoria's southern coastline in 2016 and comparing it to similar modelling of modern predators, a team of scientists based at Museums Victoria found that rather than being shaped as a precursor to filter-feeding, the teeth of ancestral whales were surprisingly sharp. \"Their teeth really optimised in shape for slicing through flesh,\" senior curator of vertebrate paleontology Dr Erich Fitzgerald told Guardian Australia. \"The whale teeth are really much more like the slicing blades of big cat and wild dog teeth.\" The discovery has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, challenging the long-held assumption that baleen evolved from a precursor to filter-feeding. The team's findings suggest that the evolution of baleen was a more complex and unexpected process than previously thought.\n\nAccording to Dr. Fitzgerald, the 3D model of the prehistoric tooth revealed a unique shape that was well-suited for slicing through flesh, rather than filtering small organisms. This finding is significant because it suggests that ancestral whales were likely predators that fed on large prey, rather than filter-feeding on small krill and plankton.\n\nThe researchers also compared the shape of the prehistoric tooth to those of modern predators, such as big cats and wild dogs. They found that the whale teeth were remarkably similar, with a similar shape and structure that was optimized for slicing and tearing flesh.\n\n\"This changes our understanding of the evolution of baleen,\" said Dr. Fitzgerald. \"We thought that baleen evolved as a way for whales to filter small organisms out of the water, but it seems that it may have evolved as a way for whales to catch and eat larger prey.\"\n\nThe team's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of whales and their place in the marine ecosystem. It also raises questions about the diet and behavior of ancient whales, and how they interacted with their environment.\n\nThe discovery is also significant because it highlights the importance of continued research and exploration in the field of paleontology. The team's findings demonstrate that even in well-studied fields, new discoveries can challenge our assumptions and shed new light on the natural world.\n\nThe team's research was published in the journal PLOS ONE and has sparked widespread interest and debate among scientists and the general public. The discovery is a reminder of the power of science to challenge our understanding of the world and to reveal new and exciting insights into the natural world.",

        "Text": "If you're headed to college this fall, you've no doubt planned to pack your laptop, your bedding and your favorite music. But have you figured out your health insurance? The Affordable Care Act is offering more health coverage choices to young adults, including college and graduate students, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of Young Invincibles, a nonprofit group focused on economic issues affecting young Americans. \"There's going to be options out there to compare and contrast and figure out,\" she said. For starters, if you're under 26 and your parents have health insurance that offers coverage for family members, the law allows you to stay on their plan in many cases. The government says more than three million people have already gained coverage as a result of this provision, which took effect in 2010. It applies even if you are financially independent, and whether you are single or married. Costs are going up, though, as some plans now charge an additional premium for family members added to the plan. College students have to consider other twists, too. Suppose your parents' plan requires that you use a local network of doctors, but you're attending school out of state. Martin Rosen, co-founder of Health Advocate Inc., which helps workers navigate their health benefits, said you should review your parents' plan before relying on it for coverage during college. As college students prepare for the upcoming semester, navigating the complexities of health insurance can be a daunting task. With the Affordable Care Act's provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents' plan until age 26, many students are taking advantage of this option. However, Rosen warns that students should carefully review their parents' plan to ensure it covers their needs while attending school out of state.\n\n\"Students need to understand the plan's network of providers and whether their school is within that network,\" Rosen emphasized. \"If not, they may need to consider alternative options.\"\n\nAnother consideration for college students is the availability of student health insurance plans offered by their school. These plans often provide coverage for specific health services, such as mental health care or sports-related injuries, that may not be covered by their parents' plan.\n\nAccording to Mishory, many colleges and universities are now offering more comprehensive health insurance options to their students. \"Some schools are offering plans that are specifically designed for students, with lower premiums and higher deductibles,\" she explained. \"These plans can be a good option for students who are not eligible for their parents' plan or who want more flexibility in their coverage.\"\n\nIn addition to these options, the Affordable Care Act has also expanded access to health insurance marketplaces, where students can compare and purchase plans that meet their individual needs. The marketplaces, also known as exchanges, offer a range of plans with varying levels of coverage and cost.\n\nTo help students navigate these options, many organizations are offering resources and guidance. For example, Young Invincibles, the nonprofit group led by Mishory, provides online tools and educational materials to help young adults understand their health insurance options.\n\nAs the fall semester approaches, college students are advised to carefully consider their health insurance needs and explore the options available to them. By doing so, they can ensure they have access to the healthcare services they need to succeed academically and personally.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The phone calls began late Friday among Uber's new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, and the ride-hailing company's executives, as well as board members and a raft of lawyers. They were facing an emergency. The problem was that Travis Kalanick, Uber's former chief executive and a board member, had appointed two new directors -- Ursula Burns, the former chief executive of Xerox, and John Thain, the former chief of Merrill Lynch -- to the privately held company without informing them. The moves, which pushed the nine-member board to 11 people, gave Mr. Kalanick new potential allies on major decisions at Uber. Mr. Kalanick's actions were \"disappointing,\" Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote on Friday in a letter to employees that was obtained by The New York Times. \"Anyone would tell you that this is highly unusual.\" The trigger for Mr. Kalanick's move -- one made possible by a board vote last year giving him control of three seats -- was a proposal that Mr. Khosrowshahi and the investment bank Goldman Sachs, an Uber shareholder, brought to the board on Thursday. The proposal, which is set to be discussed by directors on Tuesday, includes measures that would shift the power on Uber's board by reducing Mr. Kalanick's voting clout, expanding Mr. Khosrowshahi's powers and imposing a 2019 deadline on the company to go public, according to three people with knowledge of the proposal who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Parts of the proposal were also read to The Times. The proposal, which is seen as a major shake-up of Uber's governance structure, is a direct challenge to Mr. Kalanick's influence over the company. According to the proposal, Mr. Kalanick's voting power would be reduced from 14% to 7%, while Mr. Khosrowshahi's voting power would increase from 6% to 12%. Additionally, the proposal would give the CEO more control over the company's finances and operations.\n\nThe move is seen as a power play by Mr. Khosrowshahi, who has been trying to distance himself from Mr. Kalanick's controversial tenure as CEO. Mr. Kalanick's appointment of the two new directors has been seen as an attempt to undermine Mr. Khosrowshahi's authority and maintain his own influence over the company.\n\nThe proposal is also seen as a way to prepare Uber for an initial public offering (IPO), which the company has been planning for several years. The deadline of 2019 would give the company a sense of urgency to get its affairs in order and make the necessary changes to go public.\n\nThe board vote on Tuesday is expected to be a contentious one, with Mr. Kalanick and his allies likely to oppose the proposal. However, Mr. Khosrowshahi and his supporters are confident that they have the votes to pass the proposal and implement the changes.\n\nThe drama at Uber is just the latest in a series of controversies that have plagued the company in recent years. Mr. Kalanick's tenure as CEO was marked by a series of scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment and a culture of sexism and racism within the company.\n\nMr. Khosrowshahi has been trying to clean up the company's image and restore its reputation. However, the appointment of the two new directors has raised concerns that Mr. Kalanick may still be trying to exert his influence over the company.\n\nThe situation is also causing tension between Uber's board members and its investors. Some investors are reportedly unhappy with the direction the company is taking and are pushing for more changes to be made.\n\nAs the board vote approaches, it remains to be seen how the situation will play out. One thing is certain, however: the drama at Uber is far from over.",

The complaint filed by Anis Uzzaman, a prominent tech investor and CEO of Fenox Venture Capital, alleged that a male rival CEO published a fake online account purporting to be an unnamed woman who was \"sexually taken advantage of\" by Uzzaman. The blogpost, which said Uzzaman pressured the author to go to his hotel room after a business meeting, was written by Brandon Katayama Hill, founder and CEO of a San Francisco branding and marketing agency called Btrax that competes with Fenox, according to the suit. Uzzaman's attorneys said the blogpost was traced to the IP address of Hill's home. Reached for comment on Thursday, Hill denied that he was the author of the post, claiming that other people had access to his wifi and that he did not know who wrote it. The lawsuit comes at a time when women across Silicon Valley have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment following a viral account of misconduct and discrimination at Uber. Over the past month, there has been increasing scrutiny of venture capitalists following a series of stories alleging that powerful male investors have repeatedly harassed women seeking startup funding, who are particularly vulnerable and have few recourses to raise concerns when they are mistreated or assaulted by VCs. Uzzaman's lawyers have alleged that Hill took advantage of the discussion about discrimination in the industry to target a rival. \"To have these false accusations come particularly in this climate when there's this growing awareness of a problem that does exist, it's damaging,\" Katrina Saleen, Uzzaman's attorney, told the Guardian. The lawsuit filed by Uzzaman's legal team seeks damages for defamation, emotional distress, and harm to his reputation. According to the complaint, Hill's actions were a deliberate attempt to destroy Uzzaman's reputation and undermine his business.\n\nThe blogpost, which was published on a popular tech industry website, caused significant damage to Uzzaman's reputation and led to a backlash on social media. Many people in the tech community called for Uzzaman to be held accountable for his alleged actions, and some even called for him to be fired from his position as CEO of Fenox Venture Capital.\n\nHowever, Uzzaman's lawyers claim that the blogpost was a fabrication and that Hill had no evidence to support his allegations. They also argue that Hill's actions were motivated by a desire to harm Uzzaman and Fenox, rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the alleged victim.\n\nThe lawsuit has sparked a heated debate in the tech industry, with many people weighing in on social media and in online forums. Some have defended Uzzaman and accused Hill of making false accusations, while others have called for greater accountability and transparency in the tech industry.\n\nThe case is also being closely watched by women in the tech industry, who have long complained of harassment and discrimination. Many have spoken out about the need for greater protections and support for women who have been subjected to sexual harassment and assault.\n\nUzzaman's lawyers have vowed to pursue the case aggressively and to hold Hill accountable for his actions. \"We will not let Brandon Hill get away with this,\" said Katrina Saleen, Uzzaman's attorney. \"He has caused significant harm to our client and we will do everything in our power to make him pay for it.\"\n\nThe case is just the latest in a series of high-profile scandals to rock the tech industry, which has been plagued by allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. In recent months, several prominent tech executives have been accused of misconduct, and many have been forced to resign or step down from their positions.\n\nThe case is also a reminder of the need for greater accountability and transparency in the tech industry. Many people have called for greater protections and support for women who have been subjected to sexual harassment and assault, and for greater consequences for those who engage in such behavior.\n\nThe outcome of the case will likely have significant implications for the tech industry, and for the way that allegations of sexual misconduct are handled in the future. It is a reminder that the tech industry must take allegations of sexual misconduct seriously, and that those who engage in such behavior will be held accountable.",

My son-in-law keeps a spreadsheet to ensure that all five grandchildren benefit equally over the years. A friend, when they heard of this, commented on all those students who don't have wealthy relatives to help them, and I was struck because I don't think of myself as wealthy, though I suppose I have more than many. I see it as \"comfortably off\". For 20-odd years I was a chemistry teacher in secondary schools, then in the early 1990s there was a policy of replacing older teachers with cheaper younger ones, and I was given early retirement at 53. My teaching and state pensions total Â£24,700 before tax, and I earn Â£5,800 a year gross from a small business I run. As I reflect on my fortunate circumstances, I am reminded of the stark reality that many young people face today. The burden of student debt and rising housing costs has become a daunting challenge for those entering the workforce. It's a worry that weighs heavily on my mind, knowing that my grandchildren are among the fortunate ones who have a safety net to fall back on.\n\nMy friend's comment struck a chord with me because it highlighted the disparity between those who have access to financial support and those who do not.

Many students struggle to make ends meet, juggling multiple part-time jobs and taking on significant debt to fund their education. It's a stressful and uncertain existence, and one that can have long-term consequences for their financial well-being.\n\nAs a society, we need to address this issue and provide more support to those who are struggling. Governments, educational institutions, and individuals all have a role to play in ensuring that everyone has access to the resources they need to succeed. This could involve increasing funding for education, providing more scholarships and bursaries, and promoting financial literacy among young people.\n\nIn the meantime, I will continue to support my grandchildren through university, knowing that it's a privilege to be able to do so.

I retracted nothing.\" The story of the murdered aide, Seth Conrad Rich, who was 27 when he was shot in the back near his Washington home in July, has been seized on by Mr. Hannity and other right-wing pundits as an alternative narrative to the cascade of damaging revelations about the Trump administration's ties to Russian officials who meddled in the presidential election. On Fox News on Tuesday night, Mr. Hannity said that he had been in touch with Mr. Rich's brother and that, \"out of respect for the family's wishes -- for now -- I am not discussing this matter at this time.\" But, he promised his viewers, \"I am not going to stop doing my job.\" He added, \"At the proper time, we shall continue, and talk a lot more.\" Citing unnamed sources, Fox News's website published an article last week suggesting that Mr. Rich's death was in retaliation for his sharing D.N.C. emails with WikiLeaks -- a theory that, if true, would undercut the notion of Russian political interference and, in turn, offer cover for Mr. Trump. No evidence to support that theory has emerged, and the Washington Metropolitan Police Department is still investigating the death of Mr. Rich. The retraction by Fox News has sparked widespread criticism and debate, with many questioning the network's motives and the impact of its reporting on the public discourse. The story has also raised concerns about the blurred lines between news and opinion, as well as the influence of celebrity pundits like Sean Hannity on the network's editorial direction.\n\nCritics have accused Fox News of perpetuating a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, which have investigated the murder of Seth Conrad Rich and found no evidence linking it to the DNC email hacks. The Washington Metropolitan Police Department has also repeatedly stated that the investigation is ongoing and that no motive has been determined.\n\nThe controversy has also highlighted the growing divide between Fox News and its conservative audience, many of whom have been drawn to the network's provocative and often unsubstantiated reporting. Hannity's defiance in the face of the retraction has been met with widespread support from his fans, who have taken to social media to defend his reporting and accuse Fox News of caving to liberal pressure.\n\nHowever, others have criticized Hannity's handling of the story, arguing that his promotion of the conspiracy theory has been irresponsible and damaging to the public discourse. \"Sean Hannity has a history of pushing conspiracy theories and misinformation, and this is just the latest example,\" said Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group. \"It's unacceptable that he continues to promote these baseless claims, even in the face of evidence to the contrary.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the editorial independence of Fox News, with some critics accusing the network of being beholden to its most popular personalities rather than its newsroom. \"Fox News has a long history of prioritizing ratings over accuracy, and this story is just the latest example,\" said a former Fox News employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"The network's obsession with promoting a particular narrative, rather than reporting the facts, has led to a breakdown in trust with its audience and a loss of credibility in the eyes of the public.\"\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, many are left wondering what the future holds for Fox News and its relationship with its audience. Will the network continue to prioritize ratings over accuracy, or will it take steps to restore its credibility and reputation? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "Put your cellphone away. Stop texting. Stop using the camera as a mirror. Stop looking at Instagram. They're the familiar commands of teachers and educators in the age of the smartphone. Most teenagers today have grown up never knowing a world without smartphones, with the Pew Research Center reporting that 95% of all teens currently have access to or own a smartphone, and 45% are online almost constantly. That leaves educators the daunting challenge of teaching those whose attentions are â€“ at least partially â€“ attached to the devices in their pockets. Most schools have put in place policies banning or regulating phone usage during school hours, and teachers now routinely find themselves confiscating devices or writing up students for being on their phones. Educators are now exploring more drastic measures. This school year, more than 1,000 schools nationwide will be using Yondr, a pouch system that allows students to lock away their phones while they're in class. Each morning when students arrive at school, they magnetically lock their devices into their own personal green and gray pouches. They maintain possession of their pouches and devices, but they cannot unlock it until the end of the day, when they tap it on an unlocking magnet station located throughout the school. The innovative approach aims to minimize distractions and promote a more focused learning environment. Yondr, a California-based company, has been working with schools across the United States to implement its pouch system. The company claims that since its inception, schools have seen a significant decrease in disruptions and an increase in student engagement.\n\n\"We're not trying to take away students' phones, we're just trying to create a distraction-free zone,\" said David Bor, the CEO of Yondr. \"Students need to learn how to focus and prioritize their time, and this system helps them do just that.\"\n\nThe pouch system is designed to be flexible and adaptable to each school's unique needs. Schools can customize the unlocking times, allowing students to access their devices during designated breaks or at the end of the day. The system also includes a feature that allows teachers to monitor and track student device usage, providing valuable insights into student behavior and engagement.\n\nWhile some critics argue that the system is overly restrictive and infringes on students' personal freedoms, many educators and administrators believe it is a necessary step in addressing the growing issue of smartphone addiction. \"As educators, our job is to prepare students for the real world, and the real world is not a constant stream of notifications and distractions,\" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, a high school principal who has implemented the Yondr system at her school. \"By teaching students how to manage their devices and focus on their learning, we're giving them the tools they need to succeed in all areas of life.\"\n\nThe impact of the Yondr system is not limited to academic performance. Many students have reported feeling more relaxed and focused in class, and some have even reported improved mental health. \"I used to get really anxious when I couldn't check my phone, but now I feel so much more calm and centered,\" said Emily Chen, a 10th-grade student who has been using the Yondr system for several months.\n\nAs the school year progresses, it will be interesting to see the long-term effects of the Yondr system on student behavior and academic performance. While some may view it as an overreach, many educators believe it is a necessary step in addressing the challenges posed by smartphones in the classroom. One thing is certain, however: the debate over device usage in schools is far from over, and it will be up to educators, administrators, and policymakers to find a balance that benefits both students and society as a whole.",

        "Text": "An association between weed and the dead turns out to have been established long before the 1960s and far beyond a certain ur-band's stomping grounds in San Francisco. Researchers have identified strains of cannabis burned in mortuary rituals as early as 500 B.C., deep in the Pamir mountains in western China, according to a new study published Wednesday. The residue had chemical signatures indicating high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's most psychoactive, or mood-altering, compound. You think the Grateful Dead were the first to wonder \"what in the world ever became of sweet Jane?\" That CBD gummies to assuage the anxious are anything new? That puffs of elevated consciousness started with Rocky Mountain highs? The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, shed new light on the ancient use of cannabis in mortuary rituals, challenging the prevailing notion that the drug's use was limited to specific regions or cultures. The study's authors, led by Dr. Zhang Yong, a cannabis researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, analyzed residue from ceramic vessels and other artifacts discovered in the ancient city of Loulan, located in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang.\n\nThe researchers used advanced techniques, including gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, to analyze the chemical composition of the residue. They found that the cannabis strains used in the mortuary rituals were rich in THC, with some samples containing levels as high as 10%, significantly higher than the average THC content of modern cannabis.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the history and cultural significance of cannabis. \"This study shows that cannabis was not just used for recreational purposes, but was also an integral part of ancient cultures and rituals,\" said Dr. Zhang. \"The fact that it was used in mortuary rituals suggests that it played a role in the afterlife or in the transition from life to death.\"\n\nThe study's findings also raise questions about the spread of cannabis use across ancient civilizations. \"It's possible that cannabis was introduced to other regions through trade and cultural exchange,\" said Dr. Zhang. \"The Pamir mountains are a major trade route, and it's likely that cannabis was carried along with other goods and ideas.\"\n\nThe discovery has also sparked interest among researchers in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, and cultural studies. \"This study opens up new avenues for research into the cultural and symbolic significance of cannabis in ancient societies,\" said Dr. Laura Thompson, an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's a fascinating area of study that can help us better understand the complexities of human culture and society.\"\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the complexities of cannabis use and regulation, the study's findings serve as a reminder of the drug's long and rich history. Whether used for recreational purposes or as part of ancient rituals, cannabis remains a powerful and enduring symbol of human culture and creativity.",

Warmer temperatures have extended growth seasons in some areas -- and brought drought and pests to others. \"We face a grand challenge in terms of feeding the world,\" said Lee Hickey, a plant geneticist at the University of Queensland in Australia. \"If you look at the stats, we're going to have about 10 billion on the planet by 2050 and we're going to need 60 to 80 percent more food to feed everybody. It's an even greater challenge in the face of climate change and diseases that affect our crops that are also rapidly evolving.\" But plant breeding is a slow process. Developing new kinds of crops -- higher yield, more nutritious, drought- and disease-resistant -- can take a decade or more using traditional breeding techniques. So plant breeders are working on quickening the pace. Dr. Hickey's team has been working on \"speed breeding,\" tightly controlling light and temperature to send plant growth into overdrive. To achieve this, Dr. Hickey's team uses specialized greenhouses that can simulate different environments and conditions, allowing them to rapidly cycle through multiple generations of plants in a matter of weeks. This accelerated breeding process can help identify desirable traits and eliminate unwanted ones much faster than traditional methods.\n\nThe team has already made significant progress using this approach. In a recent study, they were able to develop a new variety of wheat that is resistant to a devastating fungal disease that affects crops worldwide. This breakthrough could have a major impact on global food security, as wheat is a staple crop for millions of people.\n\nHowever, speed breeding is not without its challenges. The process requires a deep understanding of the complex interactions between genetics, environment, and climate, as well as sophisticated equipment and expertise. It also requires a significant amount of resources, including funding and personnel.\n\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of speed breeding are significant. If successful, it could help increase crop yields, reduce the environmental impact of farming, and improve food security for millions of people around the world.\n\nOther researchers are also exploring innovative approaches to plant breeding. For example, some scientists are using gene editing technologies like CRISPR to introduce desirable traits into crops. Others are using machine learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that can help improve crop yields and disease resistance.\n\nWhile there is still much work to be done, the progress being made in plant breeding is promising. With the help of innovative techniques like speed breeding, scientists may be able to meet the challenge of feeding a growing global population while also protecting the environment.\n\nIn the meantime, farmers and consumers can take steps to support sustainable agriculture and reduce their environmental impact. This includes choosing locally sourced and organic produce, reducing food waste, and supporting policies that promote sustainable agriculture practices.\n\nUltimately, the key to solving the grand challenge of feeding the world will require a combination of innovative science, sustainable practices, and global cooperation. But with the right approach, it is possible to ensure that everyone has access to nutritious and sustainable food for years to come.",

But sales for the month rose solidly, the government reported Friday, raising hopes that the economy would benefit from more robust spending. The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.3 percent from January, much better than the 0.2 percent decline Wall Street analysts had forecast. When volatile car and gasoline sales were excluded, the gain was even stronger, 0.9 percent. The report, which covered the period from January 31 to February 28, also showed that core retail sales, which exclude volatile categories like autos and gasoline, rose 0.9 percent, surpassing expectations. This suggests that consumers were willing to spend despite the challenging weather conditions and other external factors.\n\nThe news is a welcome development for the retail industry, which has been grappling with declining sales and increased competition from online retailers. Many analysts had predicted a slowdown in retail sales due to the severe winter weather, which affected several regions in the country. However, it appears that consumers were resilient and continued to spend, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nThe 0.3 percent increase in retail sales is modest, but it is still a positive sign for the economy. The report suggests that consumers are feeling more confident about their financial situation, which could lead to increased spending in the coming months. Additionally, the rise in core retail sales, which excludes volatile categories, indicates that consumers are willing to spend on essential items, such as clothing and electronics.\n\nThe data also provides a glimmer of hope for the automotive industry, which has been struggling with declining sales in recent months. While car sales were down 0.4 percent in February, the decline was less severe than expected. This could be attributed to the fact that many consumers opted for safer and more practical vehicles, such as SUVs and trucks, which are less affected by weather conditions.\n\nThe retail sales report is also significant because it comes on the heels of a string of positive economic indicators, including a rise in housing starts and a decline in unemployment claims. The data suggests that the economy is gaining momentum, and consumers are becoming more confident about their financial situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the retail sales report for February is a welcome development for the economy, suggesting that consumers are willing to spend despite challenging weather conditions. The rise in core retail sales and the modest increase in overall sales are positive signs for the retail industry, and the data provides a glimmer of hope for the automotive industry. As the economy continues to recover from the recent downturn, it will be important to monitor consumer spending patterns and other economic indicators to gauge the pace of the recovery.",

Hoping to capitalise on a new political engagement among students who recently mobilised in support of striking university workers, the left wing of the student movement is fighting to lead the 7 million-strong membership, putting forward candidates for a series of executive roles in Wednesday's elections. Martin's main rival for the presidency is Sahaya James, a member of Momentum's national executive and campaigns officer at the student union of the University of the Arts London, where she recently organised an occupation in protest against the university's development plans in Elephant and Castle, which she condemned as gentrification. James has played a key role in the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts, organising a national march in November. She has also been taking part in the wave of student occupations in campuses across the country in support of lecturers and other university staff striking over pension changes. \"It's been absolutely incredible to witness,\" she said. \"The pensions dispute has triggered a lot of students who have started to consider and think about how universities are being run. The elections, which will take place on Wednesday, come as the NUS is facing a period of significant change and upheaval. The organization has been criticized for its perceived lack of representation and accountability, with some students calling for a more radical overhaul of its structure and leadership.\n\nJames, who has been a vocal critic of the NUS's current leadership, is hoping to capitalize on this discontent and lead the organization in a new direction. She has promised to prioritize issues such as free education, rent control, and improved mental health support for students, and has vowed to work closely with students, staff, and trade unions to achieve these goals.\n\nMartin, who has been president of the NUS since 2017, has faced criticism from some quarters for her perceived closeness to the government and her support for policies such as tuition fees. However, she has also been praised for her efforts to promote student engagement and activism, and has worked to build relationships with students and staff across the sector.\n\nThe election is being closely watched by students and academics alike, with many seeing it as a key test of the NUS's ability to adapt to changing student needs and demands. The outcome is far from certain, with several other candidates also vying for the presidency and a number of key issues at stake.\n\nIn a statement, Martin said: \"I am proud of the progress we have made during my time as president, and I am committed to continuing to work tirelessly to represent and support students. I believe that the NUS has a critical role to play in shaping the future of higher education, and I am eager to continue to work with students, staff, and trade unions to achieve our goals.\"\n\nJames, meanwhile, has called for a more radical approach to student politics, saying: \"The NUS needs to be more than just a representative body - it needs to be a force for change. We need to be working with students, staff, and trade unions to challenge the status quo and fight for a better future for all students.\"\n\nThe election is set to take place on Wednesday, with the results expected to be announced later that day. Regardless of the outcome, the contest is likely to have significant implications for the future of student politics and the NUS's role in shaping the higher education sector.",

The report by the National Governors Association (NGA) warns that the lack of parent representation on the boards of schools run by multi-academy trusts (Mats) has created a \"democratic deficit\", made worse by the trusts attempting to improve their financial position by taking over more schools. \"The evolution and promotion of Mats without sufficient thought to governance has produced a [democratic] deficit that requires debate, one that must not be ignored any longer,\" the report states. The government recently announced that more than half of England's state school pupils were being taught in academies, following the explosion in numbers after policy changes by the coalition government in power from 2010-2015. But Sam Henson, NGA's director of policy and one of the report's authors, said there was still scepticism towards academies, driven by media reports of high-profile cases of mismanagement, such as the Wakefield City academies trust collapse last year and the \"zombie schools\" given up by the Mats that previously managed them. Henson said trusts needed to be more transparent to avoid their negative image. The report also highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability within MATs, citing concerns over the lack of information available to parents and the public about the financial and operational decisions made by these trusts.\n\nAccording to the NGA, many MATs are not providing sufficient information about their governance structures, financial performance, and decision-making processes, making it difficult for parents and the wider community to hold them accountable.\n\n\"This lack of transparency is a major concern, as it creates a power imbalance that can lead to a lack of trust and engagement from parents and the community,\" said Henson. \"MATs need to be more open and transparent about their operations and decision-making processes to build trust and demonstrate their commitment to serving the needs of their students and communities.\"\n\nThe report also notes that the lack of parent representation on MAT boards can exacerbate this problem, as parents may not have a voice in the decision-making process and may not be aware of the financial and operational decisions being made by the trust.\n\nTo address these concerns, the NGA is calling for greater transparency and accountability within MATs, including the provision of regular financial reports, detailed information about governance structures, and opportunities for parents and the community to engage in decision-making processes.\n\nThe organization is also urging the government to take a more active role in promoting transparency and accountability within MATs, including providing guidance and support to help trusts improve their governance and transparency practices.\n\nIn response to the report, the Department for Education has said that it is committed to ensuring that academies are transparent and accountable, and that it will work with MATs to improve their governance and transparency practices.\n\nHowever, the NGA is calling for more concrete action from the government to address the democratic deficit and promote transparency and accountability within MATs.\n\n\"The government needs to take a more proactive role in promoting transparency and accountability within MATs, and providing support and guidance to help trusts improve their governance and transparency practices,\" said Henson. \"Only by working together can we ensure that academies are truly accountable to parents and the community, and that they are providing the best possible education for our children.\"",

Facebook recorded a $3bn legal expense \"in connection with the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices\", the company said. The expenses result in a 51% year-over-year decline in net income, to just $2.4bn. Absent this one-time expense, the company noted, Facebook's earnings per share would have beaten analyst expectations, and its operating margin (22%) would have been 20 points higher. \"We estimate that the range of loss in this matter is $3.0bn to $5.0bn,\" the company said. \"The matter remains unresolved, and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome.\" The FTC launched an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices in March 2018 in response to the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The expected fine is a significant blow to Facebook's bottom line, but the company's revenue growth remains strong. Facebook's daily active users (DAUs) increased by 8% year-over-year to 1.73 billion, with the majority of growth coming from Asia and the Americas.\n\nThe company's advertising revenue also saw significant growth, increasing by 18% year-over-year to $14.9 billion. Facebook's advertising business has been a major driver of its revenue growth in recent years, and the company's ability to attract and retain advertisers has been a key factor in its success.\n\nDespite the expected fine, Facebook's stock price remained relatively stable, closing at $199.50 per share on Friday. The company's market value remains over $700 billion, making it one of the largest and most valuable technology companies in the world.\n\nThe FTC's investigation into Facebook's privacy practices has been ongoing for over two years, and the expected fine is a significant development in the case. The investigation was launched in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which it was revealed that the political consulting firm had accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent.\n\nThe scandal led to widespread criticism of Facebook's data privacy practices, and the company has since implemented several changes to its platform to improve user privacy. However, the FTC's investigation has continued, and the expected fine is a sign that the agency is taking the matter seriously.\n\nFacebook has not yet commented on the specifics of the expected fine, but the company has said that it is cooperating fully with the FTC's investigation. The company has also implemented several changes to its platform to improve user privacy, including the creation of a new privacy center and the implementation of stricter data privacy policies.\n\nThe expected fine is a significant setback for Facebook, but the company's revenue growth and strong user base remain a major source of optimism for investors. The company's ability to navigate the FTC's investigation and implement changes to improve user privacy will be closely watched in the coming months.",

        "Text": "Benedict Cumberbatch's deep and booming voice might have made him a hit among women, but a low pitch is more likely to have evolved to intimidate other men, new research suggests. When both heterosexual men and women were played recordings of male voices, the deeper tones were hailed by men as sounding more dominant. While the deeper voices were judged to be more attractive by female listeners, the effect was weaker, the researchers report. \"If you look at what men's traits look like they are designed for, they look much better designed for intimidating other males than for attracting females,\" said David Puts of Pennsylvania State University, who led the study. Published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, the three-part study by an international team of scientists explored the links between voice pitch and mating systems, attractiveness and, for males only, perceived dominance. In the first leg of the research, the scientists turned their attention to primates encompassing Old and New World monkeys, as well as humans and other apes, to explore differences in \"fundamental frequency\" between males and females of each species - the aspect of the voice that is perceived as pitch. After selecting 1721 recordings, they found large differences were more common in polygynous species - where males mate with more than one female - than monogamous ones. That, they say, could be because in polygynous species, competition between males is greater - hence a male with a lower-pitched voice deemed to be intimidating could have the edge in securing a mate. Intriguingly, the researchers found that among the apes humans showed the greatest difference in pitch between the sexes, suggesting our ancestors were not searching for \"the one\" but were polygynous - a situation Puts still believes to be the case. \"Even in societies that only have monogamous marriage, men are more likely to marry again after divorce, are likely to marry a younger wife and more likely than women to reproduce again with their new spouse,\" said Puts. The researchers then turned their attention to human males, analyzing the voices of 150 men to determine how pitch affects perceived dominance and attractiveness. Participants were played recordings of the men's voices and asked to rate the speaker's dominance and attractiveness. The results showed that men with deeper voices were perceived as more dominant, while women found deeper voices to be more attractive, but to a lesser extent.\n\nTo further explore the link between voice pitch and mating systems, the researchers conducted a second study, this time examining the voices of 100 women. They found that women's voices were generally higher in pitch than men's, but that there was no significant difference in perceived dominance or attractiveness between women with higher-pitched voices and those with lower-pitched voices.\n\nThe final part of the study involved a psychological experiment, in which participants were asked to imagine themselves in a social situation and rate how they would feel about interacting with someone with a high-pitched or low-pitched voice. The results showed that men were more likely to feel intimidated by someone with a low-pitched voice, while women were more likely to feel attracted to someone with a deep voice.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of human mating systems and the role of voice pitch in attracting a mate. According to Dr. Puts, the results suggest that men's voices have evolved to serve multiple purposes, including intimidation and attraction.\n\n\"In many species, males compete with each other for mates, and the ability to intimidate rivals can be an important factor in securing a mate,\" Dr. Puts explained. \"Our study suggests that human males may be no exception, and that their deep voices may be a way of signaling dominance and competitiveness to other men.\"\n\nThe study's findings also have implications for our understanding of human communication and social behavior. According to Dr. Puts, the results suggest that voice pitch may be a powerful tool for conveying social status and dominance, and that men may be more likely to use their voices to intimidate or dominate others in social situations.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the complex and multifaceted role of voice pitch in human mating systems and social behavior. While the findings may not be surprising to some, they provide a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of human communication and the ways in which we use our voices to interact with each other.",

        "Text": "Philip Hammond has spent many idle moments thinking about who should succeed Bank of England governor Mark Carney. How, the chancellor asks himself, can he repeat the stunning, rabbit-out-of-a-hat moment when No 11's previous incumbent, George Osborne, said in 2013 that the Canadian central banker who was heading the global post-crash clean-up operation was coming to help Britain's laboured recovery? Carney is due to step down next June and has said the date is fixed in his diary after already extending his stay by a year to steer the Bank through Brexit and out the other side. It is a decision that has consolidated his reputation as one of the few senior policymakers taking measured decisions in the national interest rather than the narrow party interest that dominates parliament. So it's a tall order finding a replacement. Formally, the process is not supposed to begin for a month. Despite the formal timeline, insiders suggest that Hammond has already started informal discussions with potential candidates, weighing the pros and cons of each. The chancellor is said to be keen on finding a successor who can maintain the Bank's independence and stability, while also being able to navigate the complex and often contentious world of British politics.\n\nOne name that has been floated as a potential successor is Andrew Bailey, the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Bailey has a strong background in financial regulation and has worked closely with Carney during his tenure as governor. He is also known for his ability to build consensus and has a reputation for being a pragmatic and effective communicator.\n\nAnother contender is Silvana Tenreyro, the Bank's current deputy governor for monetary policy. Tenreyro has been a key member of Carney's team and has played a crucial role in shaping the Bank's monetary policy decisions. She is widely respected within the financial community for her expertise and has a strong understanding of the Bank's operations.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that either Bailey or Tenreyro is the right fit for the job. Some have suggested that the Bank needs a more radical thinker, someone who can bring a fresh perspective to the role and challenge the status quo. This has led to speculation about other potential candidates, including the likes of Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, and Vicky Pratt, a former Bank of England executive who is now a senior advisor at the investment bank, Goldman Sachs.\n\nRegardless of who ultimately gets the job, it is clear that finding a suitable successor to Carney will be a challenging task. The next governor will have to navigate a complex and rapidly changing financial landscape, while also maintaining the Bank's independence and reputation for integrity. It is a tall order, but one that Hammond and his team are determined to fill.",

If you run a broadcast network these days, it's easy to feel left out. \"All the excitement is about cable and streaming,\" the chairman of NBC Entertainment, Robert Greenblatt, said in an interview. \"We are the forgotten business on some level.\" But despite the perception that broadcast networks are struggling to keep up with the changing media landscape, NBC is pushing back, citing its own streaming revenue as evidence that it's still a major player.\n\n\"We have a significant streaming business, and we're proud of it,\" said Greenblatt, who has been at the helm of NBC Entertainment since 2011. \"We're not just talking about a few million dollars here and there. We're talking about tens of millions of dollars in revenue.\"\n\nAccording to NBC, its streaming services, including its popular app and website, generated over $100 million in revenue in 2022 alone. That's a significant increase from just a few years ago, when the network's streaming revenue was barely in the tens of millions.\n\nSo, what's behind NBC's streaming success? For one, the network has been aggressive in its efforts to attract and retain viewers. It's done this by offering a wide range of content, from live sports to scripted shows, as well as by investing in digital marketing and social media campaigns.\n\n\"We're not just relying on our traditional broadcast business,\" said Greenblatt. \"We're also investing heavily in our digital platforms, and it's paying off. We're seeing a significant increase in engagement and viewership across all of our platforms.\"\n\nNBC's streaming success is also due in part to its partnerships with other companies. For example, the network has partnered with Hulu, a popular streaming service, to offer its content to Hulu subscribers. It's also partnered with Amazon Prime Video to offer its shows to Amazon customers.\n\n\"We're not competing with other companies, we're partnering with them,\" said Greenblatt. \"We believe that by working together, we can create a better experience for our viewers and increase our revenue at the same time.\"\n\nDespite its streaming success, NBC is still focused on its traditional broadcast business. The network is investing heavily in its prime-time lineup, and it's seen significant ratings growth in recent years.\n\n\"We're not abandoning our broadcast business,\" said Greenblatt. \"We're just recognizing that the media landscape is changing, and we need to adapt. We're committed to being a major player in both the broadcast and streaming spaces.\"\n\nIn the end, NBC's streaming revenue is just one part of the network's overall strategy. By diversifying its revenue streams and investing in its digital platforms, the network is positioning itself for long-term success in an ever-changing media landscape.",

        "Text": "Women's organisations welcomed the chancellor's promise this year that \"austerity is coming to an end\". The 2019 spending review is a significant test of what that promise will mean in real terms, particularly for women, who have borne the brunt of austerity policies since 2010. But an end to austerity must mean more than simply an end to budget cuts. As the Chancellor prepares to unveil the 2019 spending review, women's organizations are eagerly awaiting concrete measures to address the disproportionate impact of austerity on women. The past decade has seen a significant erosion of public services and benefits, disproportionately affecting women who have taken on more caring responsibilities and have been more likely to be employed in the public sector.\n\nAccording to a report by the Women's Budget Group, women have been disproportionately affected by austerity policies, with many experiencing a decline in their standard of living. The report highlights that women are more likely to be living in poverty, with 1.4 million women and 1.1 million children living in poverty in 2018, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.\n\nThe Chancellor's promise to end austerity must be followed by concrete actions to address the systemic issues that have led to women's increased vulnerability. This includes investing in public services such as healthcare, education, and social care, which have been severely underfunded during the austerity era.\n\nFurthermore, the review must prioritize measures to address the gender pay gap, which has remained stubbornly high despite government promises to tackle the issue. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the gender pay gap stood at 18.4% in 2019, with women earning an average of Â£3,000 less than men.\n\nWomen's organizations are also calling for increased investment in childcare and early years education, which has been severely impacted by austerity cuts. The closure of Sure Start children's centers and cuts to childcare funding have disproportionately affected low-income families, who rely on these services to access employment and education.\n\nIn addition, the review must address the impact of austerity on women's mental health and wellbeing. The rise of food banks, homelessness, and poverty has taken a significant toll on women's mental health, with many experiencing increased stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nThe 2019 spending review presents an opportunity for the government to make amends for the devastating impact of austerity on women. By investing in public services, addressing the gender pay gap, and prioritizing women's wellbeing, the Chancellor can demonstrate a genuine commitment to ending austerity and promoting gender equality.\n\nAs the Chancellor prepares to unveil the 2019 spending review, women's organizations are holding their breath, hoping that the promises made will translate into real change for women and girls. The time for empty rhetoric is over; it is time for concrete actions to address the systemic issues that have led to women's increased vulnerability.",

To him it offers tantalising clues that may add to the evidence that this was the scene of the war detailed in Homer's epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey. \"Priam, Achilles, Hector: [whether] they lived and died here, we cannot prove that 100%,\" said the affable Aslan, who started working at the site as a student in 1988. \"But if you work inside for 30 years, night and day, winter or summer, surrounded by this landscape, you can feel it. You start to believe.\" The ruins of Troy are half an hour's drive from Ã‡anakkale, a city in north-west Turkey situated on the Dardanelles strait and near the Gallipoli peninsula. The site, on HisarlÄ±k Hill, contains the overlapping remains of 10 cities, Troys I to X, dating from as early as 3,000BC. Much of the excavations over the past two years have focused on an area directly across from Troy VI's southern gate, dated to 1300BC, and the main entry into the ancient citadel from the plains below. As Aslan walks through the excavated area, his eyes scan the terrain, taking in the layers of history that lie beneath his feet. He points out various features, explaining the significance of each to a group of students from a nearby university who have joined him for the day.\n\n\"This is where we've found the earliest evidence of human habitation,\" he says, gesturing to a section of the site where pottery shards and other artifacts are visible. \"We're talking around 3,000BC, which is roughly the same time period as the earliest written records of the city's existence.\"\n\nThe students nod intently, taking notes and snapping photos as Aslan leads them on a tour of the site. They stop at a large stone wall, partially reconstructed, which Aslan explains is a remnant of Troy VI.\n\n\"This was the city's defensive wall,\" he says. \"It's impressive, isn't it? The engineering skills of the ancient Trojans were remarkable. They built this wall to protect themselves from invaders, and it worked â€“ for a while, at least.\"\n\nAslan pauses, surveying the area before continuing. \"Of course, we know what ultimately happened to Troy. The city was sacked, and its people were either killed or taken captive. But the question is, what happened here? Was it really the war between the Greeks and the Trojans that Homer wrote about, or was it something else entirely?\"\n\nThe students look at each other, clearly fascinated by the mystery. Aslan smiles, knowing that he has sparked their imagination.\n\n\"We'll never know for certain, of course,\" he says. \"But as archaeologists, we're driven by the desire to uncover the truth. And even if we don't find definitive proof, the journey itself is worth it. Imagine being able to walk in the footsteps of Achilles and Priam, to see the city that was once the center of the ancient world. It's a privilege, really.\"\n\nAs the tour comes to a close, the students thank Aslan for his insights and begin to make their way back down the hill. Aslan watches them go, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He knows that he has inspired a new generation of archaeologists and historians, and that the legacy of Troy will live on through them.\n\nBack at his office, Aslan sits down at his desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and papers. He takes a deep breath, letting the weight of history settle upon him. He knows that there is still much work to be done, but he is confident that the secrets of Troy will eventually be uncovered.\n\n\"I believe it,\" he says to himself, a small smile playing on his lips. \"I believe it with all my heart.\"",

To date, he has published 156 books that have sold more than 325 million copies worldwide. But Mr. Patterson is after an even bigger audience. He wants to sell books to people who have abandoned reading for television, video games, movies and social media. So how do you sell books to somebody who doesn't normally read? Mr. Patterson's plan: make them shorter, cheaper, more plot-driven and more widely available. To achieve his ambitious goal, Patterson has been experimenting with new formats and platforms. He has launched a series of short, e-book only novels, called \"BookShots,\" which are designed to be quick, easy reads that can be devoured in a single sitting. These bite-sized books are priced at just $1.99, making them an affordable option for readers who may be hesitant to commit to a longer, more expensive novel.\n\nPatterson has also been partnering with popular streaming services and social media platforms to reach a wider audience. He has created a series of interactive novels, where readers can make choices that affect the storyline, similar to a choose-your-own-adventure book. These interactive novels are being released exclusively on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where readers can engage with the story and share their experiences with friends.\n\nIn addition, Patterson has been working with schools and libraries to get his books into the hands of young readers. He has developed a program called \"ReadKiddoRead,\" which provides free books to underprivileged children and encourages them to develop a love of reading. The program has already shown promising results, with many children reporting that they are now avid readers and are devouring books at a rate of one or two per week.\n\nPatterson's efforts to reach a wider audience have not gone unnoticed. His sales have continued to soar, with many of his books reaching the top of the bestseller lists. His innovative approach to publishing has also earned him praise from industry insiders, who are impressed by his willingness to experiment and adapt to changing reader habits.\n\nDespite his success, Patterson remains committed to his goal of making reading accessible to everyone. He believes that reading is a fundamental part of a well-rounded education, and that it has the power to transform lives. As he continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of publishing, it is clear that James Patterson is a force to be reckoned with, and that his passion for reading will continue to inspire and entertain readers for years to come.",

        "Text": "Modern fungicides that are sprayed on fruit and vegetables have come under fresh scrutiny after scientists found they caused similar genetic changes in mouse neurons to those seen in autism and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers exposed dishes of the brain cells to more than 300 different pesticides and fungicides and found that one class of fungicides, the strobilurins, produced patterns of genetic changes often seen in the human conditions. Scientists at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill hoped the experiment might shed light on the kinds of substances in the environment that contribute to cases of autism. To their surprise, they found compounds that produced some genetic hallmarks of autism and neurodegenerative diseases at the same time. The strobilurins have only been approved for use in the past 20 years, more than half a century after the first individual diagnosed with autism was announced in the medical literature. The findings, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, suggest that the widespread use of strobilurin fungicides may be linked to the increasing prevalence of autism and other neurodegenerative diseases. The researchers used a technique called RNA sequencing to analyze the genetic changes in the mouse neurons exposed to the pesticides and fungicides.\n\nThe study found that the strobilurins caused changes to the expression of genes involved in brain development and function, which are similar to those seen in autism and Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, the compounds altered the expression of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, neuronal migration, and axonal guidance, all of which are critical for normal brain function.\n\nDr. Emma Taylor, lead author of the study, said that the findings were \"surprising and concerning\" given the widespread use of strobilurin fungicides in agriculture. \"We know that these compounds are designed to be safe for human consumption, but our study suggests that they may have unintended consequences for brain development and function,\" she said.\n\nThe researchers are now calling for further studies to be conducted to investigate the potential link between strobilurin fungicides and neurodegenerative diseases. They are also urging policymakers to consider the potential risks of these compounds and to take steps to reduce their use in agriculture.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among environmental and health groups, who are calling for greater regulation of the use of pesticides and fungicides in agriculture. \"This study highlights the need for more research into the potential health impacts of these chemicals,\" said Dr. Rachel Carson, a leading environmental scientist. \"We need to take a closer look at the substances we are putting into our environment and ensure that they are safe for human health and the planet.\"\n\nThe use of strobilurin fungicides has been increasing in recent years, with many farmers using them to control fungal diseases in crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans. However, the compounds have been linked to a range of environmental and health concerns, including the decline of bee populations and the development of pesticide-resistant pests.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health and environmental policy. They suggest that the widespread use of strobilurin fungicides may be contributing to the increasing prevalence of autism and other neurodegenerative diseases, and that policymakers need to take action to reduce their use in agriculture.\n\nIn the meantime, consumers can take steps to reduce their exposure to strobilurin fungicides by choosing organic produce and supporting farmers who use sustainable agricultural practices. \"By making informed choices about the food we eat, we can help reduce our exposure to these chemicals and promote a healthier environment,\" said Dr. Taylor.",

        "Text": "According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, wages last year grew at a slower rate than they have in the 18 years the ABS has been measuring them, and real wages did not rise at all. The figures highlight that the lack of demand in the economy, rather than bracket creep, remains the major economic problem in Australia. Right now, wage growth is perhaps the sharpest indicator of the state of the economy. While employment has shown signs of better than expected growth, the story of the economy in the past few years has been one of low demand. Demand is all about people and businesses wanting things: wanting products or services to buy, and wanting people to work for them in order to make or sell those products and services. The sluggish wage growth is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the Australian economy. Despite the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) efforts to stimulate growth through interest rate cuts, the demand-driven economy remains sluggish. The RBA has cut interest rates three times since June 2019, but this has had little impact on wage growth.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the lack of demand is the decline in consumer spending. Australians are being cautious with their finances, and this is reflected in the low levels of consumer confidence. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index has been stuck in a rut, with confidence levels hovering around 100 for several months.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the lack of demand is the decline in business investment. Businesses are being hesitant to invest in new projects or expand their operations, which is having a ripple effect on the economy. The Australian Industry Group's Performance of Manufacturing Index (PMI) has been contracting for several months, indicating a decline in business activity.\n\nThe government has been trying to stimulate growth through infrastructure spending, but this has had limited success. The recent budget announcement focused on infrastructure projects, but these are unlikely to have a significant impact on wage growth in the short term.\n\nThe slow wage growth is also having a broader impact on the economy. It is affecting the ability of households to increase their spending, which is a key driver of economic growth. The slow wage growth is also making it difficult for businesses to increase their prices, which is limiting their ability to invest and expand.\n\nThe RBA is closely monitoring the situation and is expected to keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future. The bank has also been using unconventional monetary policies, such as quantitative easing, to stimulate growth. However, the effectiveness of these policies is uncertain, and the RBA may need to consider other options to stimulate growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the slow wage growth in Australia is a reflection of the broader economic challenges facing the country. The lack of demand is the major economic problem, and it will require a combination of fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate growth. The government and the RBA must work together to find a solution to this problem, as it will have a significant impact on the economy and the lives of Australians.",

The protesters, many of whom were joined by their families, were demonstrating against Honda's plan to close the car plant in 2021, which will cost 3,500 workers their jobs. Union leaders say the Japanese car manufacturer's decision will devastate the community and affect thousands more jobs in the supply chain which rely on the factory. The march, which took place on Saturday, was organized by the Unite the Union, GMB, and Unison trade unions, and was supported by local residents and community leaders. The protesters, many of whom wore red union jackets and carried banners, marched from the town center to the Honda plant, where they held a rally and presented a petition to the company's management.\n\nThe petition, signed by over 10,000 people, urged Honda to reconsider its decision to close the plant and instead invest in the facility to make it more competitive in the market. The unions and protesters argue that the plant, which has been in operation for over 30 years, is still viable and can be saved with the right support.\n\n\"We're not asking for a handout, we're asking for a chance to prove that this plant can be successful,\" said Steve Turner, the assistant general secretary of Unite the Union. \"Honda has a responsibility to the community and to its employees to find a solution that doesn't result in 3,500 people losing their jobs.\"\n\nThe protesters also highlighted the negative impact that the plant's closure would have on the local economy, including the loss of thousands of jobs in the supply chain and the potential decline of the town's high street. They also expressed concerns about the long-term effects on the community, including the potential for increased poverty and social isolation.\n\nHonda, which has been struggling with declining sales and increased competition in the global market, announced its plans to close the plant earlier this year. The company cited the need to \"restructure\" its operations and focus on more profitable markets.\n\nHowever, the unions and protesters argue that the company's decision is driven by a desire to reduce costs and increase profits, rather than a genuine need to restructure. They point to the company's recent announcement of a major investment in its plant in Japan as evidence that it is capable of investing in its facilities and employees.\n\nThe protesters' demands include a commitment from Honda to work with the unions and the community to find a solution that saves the plant and preserves jobs. They also called on the government to provide support to the company and the community to help mitigate the impact of the plant's closure.\n\nThe march and rally were peaceful, with no reports of any incidents or arrests. The protesters remained defiant, however, and vowed to continue fighting to save the plant and their jobs.\n\n\"We're not going away,\" said Turner. \"We're going to keep fighting for our jobs and our community, and we're going to keep putting pressure on Honda to do the right thing.\"",

So he went back to school for a professional science master's degree -- what some are calling a science M.B.A., a degree combining science knowledge with business skills. \"I wanted to expand my career horizon,\" said Mr. Brisker, 26, of Forestville, Md., \"but I needed skills like project management to be able to expand into bioinformatics, where computers are used to process biological information, or environmental areas like plant growth.\" Mr. Brisker, who graduates in May, enrolled at the online University of Maryland University College for the hybrid degree, which is becoming increasingly popular among science graduates who do not want to spend their careers in a laboratory at a time when data analysis and expertise are highly valued in a wide range of businesses. Enrollment in professional science master's degree programs has risen 23 percent since 2010, to nearly 6,000 students in the fall of 2013, according to figures from the Council of Graduate Schools. The increase comes at a time when overall graduate enrollment is increasing in the single digits. Most of the professional science master's degree students enroll in computer and information sciences. The growing demand for professionals with a strong foundation in both science and business has led to the rise of professional science master's degree programs, which combine theoretical knowledge in a scientific field with practical business skills. These programs are designed to prepare students for careers in a wide range of industries, from biotechnology and pharmaceuticals to environmental science and consulting.\n\nAt the University of Maryland University College, the professional science master's degree program is offered online, allowing students to balance their work and personal responsibilities while pursuing their degree. The program is highly interdisciplinary, with courses in business, economics, and policy, in addition to advanced science and technology topics.\n\nAccording to Dr. Susan K. Wilson, associate dean of the Graduate School at the University of Maryland University College, the program is designed to meet the needs of working professionals who want to enhance their skills and advance their careers. \"Our program is unique in that it combines science and business in a way that is relevant to the real world,\" she said. \"Students learn how to apply scientific principles to solve business problems, and how to communicate complex scientific information to non-technical audiences.\"\n\nThe program's curriculum is tailored to the needs of working professionals, with courses offered in a flexible, online format. Students can complete the program in as little as 12 months, or take up to 24 months to finish, depending on their individual circumstances.\n\nDaniel Brisker, who is set to graduate in May, said that the program has been a game-changer for his career. \"I was able to apply the skills I learned in the program to my job at MedImmune, and I was able to take on more responsibilities and advance my career,\" he said. \"I'm excited to see where my new skills will take me in the future.\"\n\nThe growing demand for professionals with a strong foundation in both science and business is not limited to the United States. In Europe, for example, there is a growing trend towards the development of science-based businesses, and professionals with a strong background in both science and business are in high demand.\n\nAccording to Dr. Peter S. Mahler, director of the European Science Foundation's (ESF) Science Policy Unit, the ESF is working to promote the development of science-based businesses in Europe, and is supporting the creation of professional science master's degree programs to meet the needs of these businesses. \"We believe that professionals with a strong foundation in both science and business are essential for the development of science-based businesses in Europe,\" he said. \"We are working to promote the creation of these programs, and to support the development of a new generation of science-based entrepreneurs.\"\n\nAs the demand for professionals with a strong foundation in both science and business continues to grow, it is likely that professional science master's degree programs will become an increasingly important part of the graduate education landscape. With their unique blend of scientific knowledge and business skills, graduates of these programs are well-equipped to succeed in a wide range of industries, and are poised to make a significant impact in the world of science and business.",

During the booking, I notified Etihad, through my travel agent, that I was a wheelchair user, and gave them a detailed description of the type of assistance I required. At the departure gate at Heathrow I found I had not been allocated an aisle chair (a small wheelchair designed to transfer passengers with reduced mobility to their seat). I had a two-hour wait for a connecting flight at Abu Dhabi where there was no sign of my wheelchair. I was assured it would be waiting for me at Tokyo, but once there, I learned that it had been left in Abu Dhabi. Moreover, special assistance was not available to get me off the plane at Tokyo, as requested, so a crew member â€“ who had no clue how to help me into the aisle chair â€“ had to stand in. It took 24 hours for my wheelchair to be restored and I could not rent one since it was Sunday and everything was closed. I was left feeling frustrated and stranded at Tokyo Narita airport, with no assistance to get me to my connecting flight to Sydney. The experience was a far cry from the seamless travel I had expected as a wheelchair user.\n\nAfter the ordeal, I contacted Etihad's customer service team to report the issues and request compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. However, the response was lukewarm, with the representative stating that the airline's policies were clear and that I should have received the assistance I requested.\n\nI was shocked and disappointed by the lack of empathy and understanding from the airline. As a wheelchair user, I rely heavily on the assistance provided by airlines to ensure a smooth and enjoyable journey. Etihad's failure to provide the necessary support was not only frustrating but also raised serious concerns about the airline's commitment to accessibility.\n\nIn response to my complaint, Etihad Airways issued a statement apologizing for the inconvenience and promising to investigate the matter. However, the experience has left me wondering whether the airline is truly committed to providing a seamless travel experience for passengers with reduced mobility.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the need for airlines to improve their assistance services for wheelchair users. With the increasing number of travelers with disabilities, it is essential that airlines prioritize accessibility and provide the necessary support to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable journey.\n\nAs a wheelchair user, I hope that Etihad Airways will take my complaint seriously and take concrete steps to improve their services. I also hope that other airlines will take note of the importance of providing accessible travel options for all passengers, regardless of their abilities.\n\nIn the meantime, I will be sharing my experience with friends, family, and online communities to raise awareness about the importance of accessible travel and to encourage airlines to prioritize the needs of passengers with disabilities.",

Ken Belson, who covers football, discussed the tech he's using. So the N.F.L. season is in full swing. What are your favorite websites or tech tools for tracking stats, scores, games and players? Each morning, I read through a few football websites, like ProFootballTalk, that include good summaries and commentaries of the biggest stories. Since I cover the league nationally, rather than a single team, I'm looking for information about whatever story is resonating around the country. The travails of Antonio Brown are a good example. But there are any number of other leaguewide issues. Twitter, of course, is invaluable, though you can get lost in the feeds. To stay on top of the latest developments, Belson also relies on a range of mobile apps, including the NFL's official app, which provides live scores, stats, and game highlights. He also uses the Fantasy Football app to track player performances and team standings.\n\nIn addition to these tools, Belson has developed a few personal habits to help him stay organized and informed. He sets reminders on his phone to ensure he doesn't miss important deadlines or story developments, and he uses a notes app to jot down ideas and research points as they come to him.\n\nDespite the wealth of information available, Belson believes that there is still no substitute for good old-fashioned reporting. He spends hours on the phone with sources, coaches, and players, gathering insights and anecdotes that help bring his stories to life.\n\n\"I think technology is just a tool, and it's up to us as journalists to use it wisely,\" Belson said. \"At the end of the day, it's still about telling a good story, and that requires a deep understanding of the subject matter and the people involved.\"\n\nAs the N.F.L. season continues to unfold, Belson will be relying on his trusty tech tools and personal habits to stay ahead of the curve. Whether it's tracking player injuries, analyzing team trends, or simply staying up to date on the latest news and rumors, he knows that technology is an essential part of the job.\n\nAnd yet, even as he relies on technology to do his job, Belson is mindful of the importance of human connection and face-to-face reporting. He believes that there is still value in sitting down with a source, looking them in the eye, and asking the tough questions.\n\n\"I think there's a danger in relying too heavily on technology,\" Belson said. \"As journalists, we need to be able to connect with people on a human level, and that requires a level of emotional intelligence and empathy that can be hard to replicate with technology alone.\"\n\nIn the end, Belson's approach to using technology is all about balance. He knows that the right tools can make all the difference in his job, but he also recognizes the importance of staying grounded and connected to the people and stories he covers.",

        "Text": "Hiring at American companies shifted into higher gear in October, helping to lift wages and clearing the path for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. The 271,000 jump in payrolls reported by the Labor Department on Friday was much more robust than expected and suggested that economic growth had enough momentum to allow the central bank to begin its move away from the ultralow, crisis-level interest-rate policy it has been following for seven years. Along with altering the landscape for policy makers in Washington and traders on Wall Street, the strength in the labor market, if it persists, is expected to shift the political debate as the 2016 presidential campaign heats up. \"It was pretty much everything you could ask for in a jobs report,\" said Michelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"Not only was the headline number strong, but there were upward revisions for prior months, the unemployment rate fell and wage growth accelerated.\" A healthy, improving economy tends to favor the incumbent party in the White House, and it could blunt Republican attacks on President Obama's economic record, a mainstay of the Republican candidates' message. After the release of the employment data, economists lined up to predict that a rate increase is now nearly a lock at the Fed's mid-December meeting. The strong jobs report also had implications for the presidential election, with some analysts suggesting that it could benefit the incumbent Democratic party. \"A strong economy is always good news for the party in power,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"It's a reminder that the economy is on the mend, and that's a message that will resonate with voters.\" However, not all economists agreed that the jobs report would necessarily benefit the Democrats. \"While a strong economy is certainly helpful, it's not a guarantee of success,\" said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. \"The economy was strong in 2008, but that didn't stop Barack Obama from losing his re-election bid.\"\n\nDespite the mixed views on the impact of the jobs report on the election, there was broad agreement that it would likely lead to a rate increase at the Fed's December meeting. \"The data is consistent with a rate hike in December, and it's hard to see how the Fed could justify keeping rates low given the strength of the labor market,\" said Meyer. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since the financial crisis, in an effort to stimulate the economy. However, with the economy now growing at a moderate pace, many economists believe that it's time for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy.\n\nThe strong jobs report was also seen as a positive development for the broader economy, with many analysts predicting that it would lead to higher consumer spending and economic growth. \"This report is a clear sign that the economy is gaining traction, and that's good news for consumers and businesses alike,\" said Zandi. \"It's a reminder that the economy is on the mend, and that's a message that will resonate with voters.\" Overall, the strong jobs report was seen as a positive development for the economy, and it's likely to have significant implications for the presidential election and the Fed's monetary policy decisions in the coming months.",

What it did not do was provide a concise explanation of what the group's aims were and, perhaps more crucially, why people should donate money to help its cause. \"There was confusion,\" said Michael Sapienza, chief executive of the alliance. \"It was very unclear to the public exactly what it was we did.\" For Mr. Sapienza, who lost his mother, Chris, to colon cancer in 2009, it was personal. He wanted to help others who had the disease. In response to this challenge, the Colon Cancer Alliance, along with many other nonprofits, has turned to professional fundraising consultants to help them craft compelling stories and messaging that resonate with potential donors. These consultants, often with backgrounds in marketing, public relations, or development, work closely with nonprofit leaders to identify their organization's unique value proposition and create a clear and compelling narrative that drives donations.\n\nThe Colon Cancer Alliance's experience is not unique. Many nonprofits struggle to effectively communicate their mission and impact to potential donors, often relying on vague or generic language that fails to resonate with the public. According to a survey by the Nonprofit Leadership Alliance, 60% of nonprofits report that they are not confident in their ability to articulate their mission and goals to donors.\n\nTo address this challenge, professional fundraising consultants are helping nonprofits to develop a clear and concise message that highlights their organization's unique strengths and achievements. This may involve conducting extensive research on the organization's history, mission, and impact, as well as analyzing data on donor demographics and giving patterns.\n\nFor the Colon Cancer Alliance, this meant working with a consultant to develop a new website that clearly outlines the organization's goals and objectives, as well as highlighting its achievements in the field of colon cancer research and awareness. The new site features a prominent \"About Us\" section, which provides a brief overview of the organization's history and mission, as well as a \"Why Give\" page that outlines the specific ways in which donations can make a difference.\n\nThe results have been impressive. Since launching the new website, the Colon Cancer Alliance has seen a significant increase in online engagement and donations, with many visitors reporting that they were inspired to give because of the organization's clear and compelling message.\n\nThe Colon Cancer Alliance's experience is a testament to the importance of effective storytelling in nonprofit fundraising. By working with professional consultants to develop a clear and compelling narrative, nonprofits can increase their chances of success and make a greater impact in their communities. As Michael Sapienza, CEO of the Colon Cancer Alliance, notes, \"By telling our story in a way that resonates with people, we can inspire them to take action and support our mission.\"",

There are actually four P.S. 1's in New York City: That first school, established in 1806 and later named for Alfred E. Smith (Manhattan); the Courtlandt School (the Bronx); the Bergen (Brooklyn); and the Tottenville (Staten Island). Plus, of course, the P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens, which now houses a contemporary-art museum. There are also three P.S. 2's, three P.S. 3's and four P.S. 4's. The Legacy of New York City's Public School Numbers\n\nAs the article highlights, the Public School (P.S.) system in New York City has a rich history, with multiple schools bearing the same numerical designation. The confusion begins with the four P.S. 1's, each with its own unique story and significance. The original P.S. 1, established in 1806, was later renamed after Alfred E. Smith, the 42nd Governor of New York and a prominent figure in the city's history.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Courtlandt School, also known as P.S. 1, has been serving the local community since 1874. Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, the Bergen School, or P.S. 1, has been educating students since 1869. On Staten Island, the Tottenville School, also P.S. 1, has been a staple of the community since 1895.\n\nThe P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens, however, has taken on a new role. After being decommissioned as a school in 1971, the building was transformed into a contemporary-art museum, which now attracts art enthusiasts from all over the world.\n\nBut the P.S. system doesn't stop at the number 1. There are three P.S. 2's, three P.S. 3's, and four P.S. 4's scattered throughout the five boroughs. Each school has its own unique character, shaped by the community it serves and the history it has accumulated over the years.\n\nDespite the numerical duplication, the Public School system in New York City remains a vital part of the city's education landscape. With over 1,800 schools serving more than 1.1 million students, the system is one of the largest and most diverse in the country.\n\nAs the city continues to evolve and grow, the legacy of its Public School numbers remains a testament to the enduring importance of education and community. Whether it's the historic P.S. 1's or the newer schools that have taken their place, each one plays a vital role in shaping the minds and futures of New York City's children.",

Andrews Smith of Dallas received a phone call in 2015 telling him that his brother-in-law had been in a life-threatening motorcycle accident and was unconscious at a hospital in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Smith and his wife, Patty, rushed to his side. But they quickly learned that family members had no say in his medical treatment because he was unmarried and had no living will outlining his wishes or giving power of attorney to a relative. \"We were pretty much on the sidelines,\" Mr. Smith said. \"It was even hard to find out his condition and what the prognosis was.\" His brother-in-law survived and is now in a rehabilitation program. But the experience was an eye-opener for the Smith family. Although Mr. Smith, now 63, already had a will in place for himself, he insisted that his two daughters, who were in their early 30s, also write wills. A growing number of younger people have written wills in recent years. The Smith family's experience is not an isolated one. According to experts, the trend of younger people writing wills is on the rise. In fact, a recent survey by the National Endowment for Financial Education found that 42% of millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) have written a will, compared to just 28% of Gen Xers (born between 1961 and 1980) and 21% of baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1960).\n\nThere are several reasons why younger people are becoming more proactive about planning for the future. One reason is the growing awareness of the importance of estate planning. With the rise of blended families and non-traditional relationships, the traditional notion of what constitutes a \"family\" has become more complex. This has led to a greater need for individuals to take control of their own estate planning and ensure that their wishes are respected.\n\nAnother reason is the increasing complexity of financial and medical decisions. With advances in medical technology and the rising cost of healthcare, individuals are facing more complex medical decisions than ever before. A living will can provide peace of mind for families and loved ones, knowing that their loved one's wishes are being respected.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of digital assets has also contributed to the growing trend of younger people writing wills. With the majority of people now having digital assets such as social media accounts, email accounts, and online bank accounts, it is becoming increasingly important to plan for what happens to these assets after death.\n\nThe Smith family's experience also highlights the importance of having a power of attorney in place. A power of attorney allows an individual to appoint someone they trust to make decisions on their behalf if they are unable to do so themselves. This can be especially important for younger people who may not have a spouse or children to make decisions for them.\n\nIn conclusion, the Smith family's experience is a stark reminder of the importance of planning for the future. With the trend of younger people writing wills on the rise, it is clear that individuals of all ages are recognizing the importance of taking control of their own estate planning. By having a will, power of attorney, and living will in place, individuals can ensure that their wishes are respected and their loved ones are protected.",

BONNERS FERRY, Idaho -- The only caribou left in the contiguous United States are here in northern Idaho where they number about a dozen and live deep in the forests of the jagged Selkirk Mountains, near the Canadian border. Because they are so rarely seen, the caribou -- America's version of reindeer -- are known as gray ghosts. They may very soon become real ghosts: These animals are among the most endangered species in the lower 48 states. \"Right now, predation is the biggest problem, primarily wolves and cougars,\" said Norm Merz, a wildlife biologist with the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, which has contracted with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to create a plan to revive the population. Not that long ago, hundreds of the animals lived in the United States. Part of the problem is that the Selkirk herd is international. Conservation Efforts Underway to Save Endangered Caribou\n\nDespite the challenges, conservation efforts are underway to protect the Selkirk caribou herd. The Kootenai Tribe, in partnership with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, is working to develop a comprehensive plan to revive the population. The plan aims to address the primary threats facing the herd, including predation by wolves and cougars.\n\nOne of the key strategies is to implement measures to reduce human-caribou conflict. This includes working with local landowners and recreational users to educate them on how to coexist with the caribou. The tribe is also exploring options for habitat restoration and enhancement, which could help to improve the overall health and resilience of the herd.\n\nIn addition, the tribe is working to study the behavior and ecology of the caribou, in order to better understand their needs and habits. This information will be used to inform management decisions and ensure that conservation efforts are effective and targeted.\n\nThe international aspect of the problem is also being addressed. The Kootenai Tribe is working closely with Canadian conservation agencies to ensure that efforts to protect the Selkirk caribou herd are coordinated and effective. This includes sharing information and best practices, as well as collaborating on joint conservation efforts.\n\nWhile the challenges facing the Selkirk caribou herd are significant, conservationists remain optimistic about the prospects for recovery. \"We believe that with the right combination of conservation efforts, we can stabilize and even increase the population of the Selkirk caribou,\" said Merz. \"It's a complex problem, but we're committed to finding a solution.\"\n\nThe fate of the Selkirk caribou herd serves as a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts and the need to protect endangered species. As the gray ghosts of the Selkirk Mountains, these animals are a unique and fascinating part of America's natural heritage. With continued conservation efforts, it is hoped that they will continue to thrive for generations to come.",

In new research, scientists claim to have identified the most common practitioners of the ignoble art. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, analyzed data from over 1,000 individuals across the United States and found that a surprising number of people engage in habitual bullshitting. According to the researchers, the most common offenders are individuals who work in the service industry, particularly those in retail and food service.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Rachel M. Kraus, explained that the researchers used a combination of surveys and behavioral experiments to identify the characteristics of bullshitters. \"We found that people who work in service industries are more likely to engage in bullshitting due to the high level of social interaction and pressure to provide excellent customer service,\" Dr. Kraus said.\n\nThe researchers also found that men are more likely to engage in bullshitting than women, and that people with higher levels of education and income are more likely to be bullshitters. \"It's not that these individuals are inherently more dishonest, but rather that they may feel more comfortable using language that is intentionally misleading or evasive,\" Dr. Kraus added.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked a lively debate among scholars and the general public alike. Some have praised the research for shedding light on a previously underexplored aspect of human behavior, while others have criticized the study for its methodology and conclusions.\n\nHarry Frankfurt, the philosopher who coined the term \"bullshit,\" has also weighed in on the study. In a statement, he praised the researchers for their efforts to quantify and understand the phenomenon of bullshitting, but cautioned against oversimplifying the issue. \"Bullshitting is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a simple formula or set of characteristics,\" Frankfurt said.\n\nDespite the controversy, the study's findings have important implications for our understanding of human behavior and communication. As Dr. Kraus noted, \"Bullshitting is not just a matter of individual character or morality, but also a reflection of broader social and cultural norms.\"\n\nIn the end, the study serves as a reminder that we all have a role to play in reducing the amount of bullshit in our lives. By being more mindful of our language and behavior, we can work towards creating a more honest and transparent society.",

The decision has prompted concern in the UK, since the technology breaks many of the centralised filtering and blocking systems in place to prevent easy access to child abuse images, piracy and terrorist material, as well as optional parental controls. Mozilla's decision to make DoH the default setting for US users has raised concerns among UK officials, who fear that the technology could compromise the country's efforts to block access to harmful online content. The UK's internet service providers (ISPs) and content filtering companies rely on centralized DNS systems to block access to illegal or harmful content, including child abuse images, piracy, and terrorist material.\n\nThe UK's Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has written to Mozilla expressing her concerns about the potential impact of DoH on the country's online safety efforts. In her letter, Patel emphasized the importance of ensuring that the UK's online filtering systems remain effective in preventing access to harmful content. She also urged Mozilla to reconsider its decision and explore alternative solutions that would not compromise the UK's online safety efforts.\n\nMozilla, however, has maintained that its decision to make DoH the default setting for US users is driven by its commitment to improving online privacy and security. The company argues that DoH provides a more secure and private way for users to access the internet, as it encrypts DNS queries and makes it more difficult for hackers and government agencies to intercept and monitor user activity.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding DoH, Mozilla is not planning to make the technology the default setting for UK users. In a statement, the company said that it would continue to work with UK officials and industry partners to address their concerns and ensure that the technology is used in a way that is consistent with UK law and regulations.\n\nThe debate surrounding DoH highlights the ongoing tensions between online privacy and online safety. While some argue that DoH is a necessary step towards improving online privacy and security, others believe that it could compromise the efforts of law enforcement agencies and content filtering companies to prevent access to harmful online content.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether Mozilla's decision to make DoH the default setting for US users will have any impact on the UK's online safety efforts. One thing is certain, however: the controversy surrounding DoH has brought attention to the importance of online privacy and security, and the need for a balanced approach that protects both users and the public interest.",

Robert Strayer, a deputy assistant secretary at the US state department, said on Monday that Huawei \"was not a trusted vendor\" and any use of its technology in 5G networks was a risk, contradicting the British stance. The official said if an \"untrusted vendor\" was used by the UK or another western country, the US would \"have to reassess the ability for us to share information and be interconnected\" â€“ implying that intelligence-sharing arrangements could be at risk. Last week, a tense UK national security council (NSC) meeting narrowly approved in principle allowing Huawei to supply \"non-core\" 5G technology, despite objections from five of the cabinet ministers present and months of US lobbying. The decision was leaked to the Daily Telegraph, prompting an inquiry in which ministers, advisers and officials will be interviewed, and which will probably lead to calls for the leaker to be sacked, regardless of their seniority. The leak has sparked outrage among Conservative lawmakers, who have long been critical of the government's handling of the Huawei issue. \"This is a betrayal of the highest order,\" said Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative MP and chair of the House of Commons' foreign affairs committee. \"The government has been warned repeatedly about the risks of using Huawei technology, and now we see that even the US is concerned. It's time for the government to rethink its stance and prioritize national security.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of the UK's intelligence agencies in the decision-making process. \"The fact that the NSC meeting was leaked suggests that there are divisions within the government and the intelligence community,\" said a senior security source. \"It's clear that some officials are more concerned about the risks of using Huawei technology than others.\"\n\nThe government has so far refused to comment on the leak, but a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said that the decision to allow Huawei to supply \"non-core\" 5G technology was taken after a thorough review of the risks and benefits. \"The UK has a robust and independent regulatory framework in place to ensure the security of its 5G networks,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, the US official's warning has added to the pressure on the government to reconsider its stance. \"The UK's decision to allow Huawei to supply 5G technology is a significant risk to national security,\" said Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas. \"I urge the UK government to rethink its decision and prioritize the safety and security of its citizens.\"\n\nThe controversy is likely to continue in the coming weeks, with the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) expected to publish a report on the risks and benefits of using Huawei technology in 5G networks. The report is expected to be highly critical of Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network, and could lead to further calls for the government to reconsider its stance.\n\nIn the meantime, the US and UK governments are expected to continue to engage in talks about the issue, with the US pushing for a more robust approach to addressing the risks posed by Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network. The controversy has highlighted the complex and often fraught relationship between the US and UK on issues related to national security and intelligence cooperation.",

They argue that the lack of information is making it difficult for businesses to plan for the future and is exacerbating the uncertainty that is holding back the economy.\n\nAs parliament attempts to scrutinize Boris Johnson's Brexit plan, the government's refusal to publish a detailed economic impact assessment is likely to remain a major point of contention. The opposition parties have called for the government to release the information, and many businesses are also demanding greater transparency.\n\nIn the meantime, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit is likely to continue to weigh on the economy. The job market is likely to remain under pressure, and businesses will continue to struggle to plan for the future. It remains to be seen whether the government will eventually publish the information, and what the implications will be for the economy and the country as a whole.",

However, GSK's outgoing chief executive Sir Andrew Witty warned that if the European Medicines Agency (EMA) relocates from London as seems likely and the UK creates its own regulatory body, the company's regulatory burden would double. All new medicines have to be approved by regulators who check their safety and efficacy. \"Just to be blunt you would have to file two different submissions so it is obvious that you have doubled the amount of work,\" said Witty. \"Might the new UK organisation be able to do things differently and more quickly than Europe? Maybe... Those discussions haven't started yet.\" GSK's announcement comes as a relief to the UK's pharmaceutical industry, which has been facing uncertainty since the Brexit vote. The company's investment in its UK factories is expected to create new jobs and boost the local economy. However, Witty's warning about the potential regulatory burden highlights the challenges that the industry may face in the future.\n\nThe EMA, which is responsible for evaluating the safety and efficacy of medicines in the EU, has been based in London since 1995. However, following the Brexit vote, the agency's future in the UK is uncertain. The UK government has indicated that it plans to establish its own regulatory body, which could lead to a duplication of effort and increased costs for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nWitty's comments suggest that GSK is concerned about the potential impact of the EMA's relocation on its business. The company has a significant presence in the UK, with several manufacturing sites and research facilities. Any changes to the regulatory environment could affect its ability to operate efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe UK's pharmaceutical industry is a significant contributor to the country's economy, with many major companies based in the country. The industry employs thousands of people and generates billions of pounds in revenue each year. However, the uncertainty surrounding the EMA's future has led to concerns about the industry's long-term prospects.\n\nGSK's announcement is a welcome boost to the industry, but it also highlights the need for clarity and stability in the regulatory environment. The company's investment in its UK factories is a vote of confidence in the country's pharmaceutical industry, but it also underscores the need for the government to provide a clear and consistent approach to regulation.\n\nIn a statement, GSK said that its investment in the UK was part of its ongoing efforts to improve its manufacturing capabilities and increase its presence in the country. The company said that it was committed to the UK and was looking forward to continuing to work with the government and other stakeholders to ensure the country's pharmaceutical industry remains competitive and successful.\n\nThe UK's pharmaceutical industry is a key player in the country's life sciences sector, which is one of the country's fastest-growing industries.

It's one of the tricks used by banks to encourage us into using expensive overdrafts, and it works. The practice, known as \"available balance\" or \"available funds,\" is a common tactic used by banks to lure customers into dipping into their overdraft facilities, often at a steep cost. By presenting a higher balance than the actual amount in the account, banks create a false sense of security, making it more likely that individuals will spend more than they have, thereby incurring fees and interest charges.\n\nAccording to financial experts, this strategy is particularly effective among younger adults and those who are new to managing their finances. \"Banks are exploiting a psychological vulnerability,\" said Sarah Johnson, a personal finance advisor. \"By making it seem like they have more money than they actually do, people are more likely to take risks and overspend, ultimately leading to financial difficulties.\"\n\nThe consequences of falling into this trap can be severe. Overdraft fees can range from Â£20 to Â£35 per day, and interest rates can be as high as 20% per annum. For those who are already struggling financially, these charges can quickly spiral out of control, leading to a cycle of debt that can take months or even years to recover from.\n\nSo, how can individuals avoid falling prey to this tactic? Experts recommend regularly checking account balances online or through mobile banking apps, rather than relying on cash machine displays. Additionally, setting up text or email alerts to notify you when your balance falls below a certain threshold can help prevent accidental overdrafts.\n\nMoreover, it's essential to understand the terms and conditions of your account, including the overdraft facility and the associated fees. \"Don't assume that just because you have a certain amount of money in your account, you can't go overdrawn,\" said Johnson. \"Read the fine print and understand the risks involved.\"\n\nBy being aware of this tactic and taking steps to protect themselves, individuals can avoid the financial pitfalls of \"available balance\" and maintain a healthy and sustainable relationship with their bank accounts.",

Google, Twitter and the web hosting company GoDaddy appeared to find it this week when they shut down The Daily Stormer, an American Nazi \"publication,\" after it mocked the peace activist Heather Heyer, who was killed Saturday at a white supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Va. But The Daily Stormer had been comfortably operating in the established online matrix since it was founded in 2013. The Daily Caller, the conservative online publication that has the Fox News host Tucker Carlson as a founder, appeared to identify the line, too. This week it took down a truly vile video it produced in January celebrating motorists who had plowed into \"liberal protesters,\" advising its readers to \"study the technique.\" (The Daily Caller said on Thursday that the video was a young videographer's \"clumsy attempt at creating some levity\" at a tense time, but added that any suggestion that the video had a role in causing \"Nazis to be stupid, violent maniacs is patently absurd.\") The Fox News website Fox Nation, which apparently liked the video enough to repost it, also took it down this week, calling it \"inappropriate\" and expressing regret. There were the online platforms like Facebook, Reddit and, as my colleague Kevin Roose reported this week, Discord, which shut themselves off from the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who had been using the sites to spread their hateful message and to organize. As the tech giants and online platforms began to take action, it was clear that the tide was turning. The silence that had once shrouded the online landscape, allowing hate speech and extremism to thrive, was finally being broken. But the question remained: what took so long?\n\nExperts point to the complex and often ambiguous nature of online speech, which has made it difficult for companies to navigate the fine line between free expression and hate speech. \"The problem is that the laws and regulations surrounding online speech are still evolving, and companies are often left to make difficult decisions without clear guidance,\" said Jillian York, the director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nAdditionally, the proliferation of online platforms and the anonymity they provide have created a sense of impunity for those who spread hate speech. \"The internet has given a voice to those who were previously marginalized or excluded from mainstream discourse,\" said Dr. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \"But it has also given a platform to those who seek to harm others, and that's a problem.\"\n\nThe recent events in Charlottesville have sparked a national conversation about the role of technology in facilitating hate speech and extremism. Many are calling for greater accountability from online platforms and a more proactive approach to addressing hate speech. \"It's not enough for companies to simply take down content after it's been reported,\" said Sarah T. Roberts, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies online hate speech. \"They need to be proactive in monitoring and removing hate speech, and they need to be transparent about their efforts.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, it's clear that the line between free expression and hate speech is not always clear-cut. But what is clear is that the tech giants and online platforms have a responsibility to take action against hate speech and extremism, and to do so in a way that respects the rights of all users. The question now is: what's next?",

        "Text": "It's considered an inescapable fact of life: the older you get, the more likely death becomes. But new research suggests that the chances of dying may level off â€“ at least for those who make it to 105 years old. The study found that death rates, which rise exponentially in adulthood, begin to decelerate after 80 years old and appear to eventually plateau, or even decline slightly, after the age of 105. By that point, the chances of passing away in a given year are approximately 50-50. \"It's the equivalent of tossing a coin each year,\" said Prof Jim Vaupel, a specialist in ageing at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Germany and one of the authors. The findings add fuel to an unusually hostile debate between two camps of scientists, who are locked in an escalating dispute about whether humans are approaching their upper limit in terms of lifespan. The latest paper, from Vaupel's team who argue there is no evidence of a looming longevity limit, is based on data tracking the survival trajectories of almost 4,000 Italians older than 105 between 2009 and 2015. The study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, analyzed the mortality rates of centenarians, individuals who have reached the age of 100 or older, and supercentenarians, those who have lived to be 110 or older. The researchers found that while death rates continued to rise exponentially in early adulthood, they began to slow down significantly after the age of 80.\n\n\"This is a major shift in the way we think about mortality,\" said Dr. Vaupel. \"For a long time, we've assumed that death rates would continue to rise exponentially with age, but our research suggests that this may not be the case.\"\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human longevity and the potential for humans to live longer lives. Some scientists argue that the human body has an inherent \"longevity limit,\" beyond which it is not possible for humans to live. However, the new study suggests that this may not be the case, and that humans may be capable of living well beyond 100 years old.\n\nThe debate over human longevity has been ongoing for decades, with some scientists arguing that there is a limit to how long humans can live, while others believe that humans have the potential to live indefinitely. The new study adds fuel to the debate, and suggests that humans may be capable of living longer lives than previously thought.\n\nThe researchers used data from the Italian Longevity Study, which tracked the survival trajectories of almost 4,000 individuals who were 105 years old or older between 2009 and 2015.

However, the new study suggests that this may not be the case, and that humans may be capable of living well beyond 100 years old.\n\nThe study's authors say that their findings could have important implications for healthcare and social policy, particularly as the global population ages. \"If we can understand why some people live to be 105 and beyond, we may be able to develop new strategies for promoting healthy aging and increasing human lifespan,\" said Dr. Vaupel.\n\nThe debate over human longevity is expected to continue, with scientists on both sides of the issue presenting their arguments at conferences and in academic journals. However, the new study's findings are likely to add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that humans may be capable of living longer lives than previously thought.",

In November, food benefits were cut for approximately 48 million Americans by an average of 7 percent, costing the typical recipient about $9 a month, as the emergency expansion of the food stamp program enacted in the depths of the great recession was allowed to expire. Next month, 1.3 million jobless workers are scheduled to stop receiving an unemployment check, after Congress's refusal to prolong the extension of emergency jobless benefits to up to 73 weeks, from 26. Perhaps as many as five million people will lose their benefit over the next year. But while politicians' attention has wandered, poverty remains uncomfortably close to where it was five decades ago. Despite the decline in poverty rates in the 1960s and 1970s, the issue has persisted, with the United States still grappling with stubborn poverty rates. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2019, 12.9% of Americans lived below the poverty line, with some 33.7 million people struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for certain demographic groups. Children under the age of 18 are more likely to live in poverty, with a poverty rate of 18.4%, while the rate for African Americans is a staggering 25.8%. For Hispanic Americans, the poverty rate is 17.4%, and for Native Americans, it's 24.1%.\n\nThe decline in social safety net programs has also had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. The cut to food benefits, for example, has disproportionately affected households with children, seniors, and people with disabilities. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the average monthly benefit for a family of three with children under the age of 6 has decreased by 25% since 2013.\n\nThe expiration of extended unemployment benefits has also had devastating consequences for jobless workers. A study by the National Employment Law Project found that in states where extended benefits were cut, the number of people filing for unemployment benefits increased by an average of 15%. This not only means that more people are struggling to make ends meet but also that local economies are suffering as a result of reduced consumer spending.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are glimmers of hope. Some states, such as California and New York, have taken steps to address poverty by increasing the minimum wage, expanding Medicaid, and implementing programs to support low-income families. Additionally, non-profit organizations and community groups are working to provide essential services, such as food banks and job training programs, to those in need.\n\nAs the United States marks the 50th anniversary of President Johnson's war on poverty, it is clear that much work remains to be done. While the country has made progress in reducing poverty rates, the issue persists, and the decline in social safety net programs has only exacerbated the problem. It is imperative that policymakers prioritize addressing poverty and work to create a more equitable society where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive.",

Research has already shown that the pitch of a person's voice stays basically the same during adulthood and that how we sound as adults may be determined before puberty. A recent study indicated that the pitch of a boy's voice at age 7 can mostly predict what he will sound like as an adult. So when do our voices start emerging? According to scientists, the formation of a person's voice begins in the womb, around the 12th week of gestation. At this stage, the vocal cords, which are two bands of muscle tissue located in the larynx, start to develop. The vocal cords are responsible for producing sound when air passes through them, and their shape, size, and tension determine the pitch and quality of a person's voice.\n\nAs the fetus grows, the vocal cords continue to develop and mature. By the time a baby is born, the vocal cords are fully formed, but they are still quite soft and flexible. This is why newborns have such high-pitched cries - their vocal cords are still adjusting to the outside world and haven't yet developed the same level of stiffness as those of adults.\n\nIn the first few years of life, the vocal cords continue to grow and mature, and the voice begins to take shape. Children's voices are often described as \"squeaky\" or \"high-pitched\" because their vocal cords are still relatively soft and flexible. However, as children enter puberty, significant changes occur in the vocal cords that shape the sound of their voice.\n\nDuring puberty, the vocal cords undergo a process called \"vocal cord thickening,\" where they become thicker and more rigid. This change is triggered by the surge of hormones, particularly testosterone in boys, which causes the vocal cords to lengthen and thicken. As a result, boys' voices often deepen and become more resonant during puberty, while girls' voices may become more mature and less high-pitched.\n\nThe study mentioned earlier, which found that the pitch of a boy's voice at age 7 can mostly predict what he will sound like as an adult, suggests that the voice is largely determined by the time a child reaches adolescence. However, it's worth noting that the voice is a dynamic and constantly evolving instrument, and it can change significantly over time due to various factors such as lifestyle, environment, and health.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of a person's voice is a complex and multifaceted process that begins in the womb and continues throughout childhood and adolescence. While the voice may undergo significant changes during puberty, research suggests that the fundamental characteristics of a person's voice are largely determined by the time they reach adulthood. So the next time you hear a baby cry, take a good listen - it might just give you a glimpse into what their voice will sound like decades later.",

The study, the first large-scale trial to date, looked at the effectiveness of a so-called polypill â€“ a four-in-one therapy containing drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure that was first proposed more than 15 years ago. The researchers found those taking the polypill had a more than 30% lower risk of serious heart problems than those just offered advice. While different formulations have been studied, previous trials have only been conducted in small groups of people and over short periods of time. These studies have primarily looked at the impacts of cholesterol on blood pressure, relying on models to predict the impact on cardiovascular events such as strokes â€“ meaning the full potential of the polypill has remained unclear. The latest study tackled both of these problems. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, and involved over 7,000 participants aged 50 and above. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either the polypill or advice on lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, to reduce their risk of heart disease.\n\nThe results showed that those taking the polypill had a significant reduction in the risk of serious cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and sudden death. The researchers found that the polypill reduced the risk of these events by 30.5%, compared to those who received only advice.\n\nThe study's lead author, Professor Peter Sever, from the University of Oxford, said that the findings were \"encouraging\" and suggested that the polypill could be a \"game-changer\" in the prevention of heart disease. \"For the first time, we have evidence that a single pill can reduce the risk of serious heart problems in people over 50,\" he said.\n\nThe polypill contains four common drugs: atorvastatin, a statin to lower cholesterol; perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to lower blood pressure; aspirin, to prevent blood clots; and bendroflumethiazide, a diuretic to reduce blood pressure.\n\nThe researchers noted that the study's findings were consistent across different age groups and genders, and that the polypill was well-tolerated, with few side effects reported.\n\nThe study's authors believe that the polypill could be a useful addition to existing treatments for heart disease, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to healthcare is limited. \"The polypill has the potential to be a simple, cost-effective way to reduce the burden of heart disease in these countries,\" said Professor Sever.\n\nThe researchers are now planning further studies to explore the use of the polypill in different populations and settings, and to assess its long-term safety and effectiveness.",

        "Text": "Yes, They Pay a Dividend, but Can You Afford Them? WHEN gains in the stock market are hard to come by, dividend-paying stock funds really stand out. In fact, the four best-performing categories of equity funds in 2011 -- portfolios that specialize in utilities, health care, real estate investment trusts and consumer companies involved in food, beverages and other household products -- all dabble in dividend-rich parts of the market. And all of these groups produced average gains of more than 7 percent last year, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose a mere 2 percent, according to the fund tracker Morningstar. The allure of dividend-paying stock funds is undeniable, especially during times of market volatility. These funds offer a unique combination of income and capital appreciation, making them an attractive option for investors seeking steady returns. But, as the article suggests, can you really afford them?\n\nTo answer this question, it's essential to understand the underlying characteristics of dividend-paying stock funds. These funds typically invest in companies that distribute a significant portion of their earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. This approach can provide a relatively stable source of income, as dividend payments are often less volatile than the overall stock market.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of dividend-paying stock funds is their ability to generate income. In a low-yield environment, where interest rates are low and bond yields are scarce, dividend-paying stocks can offer a more attractive alternative. For example, a fund that invests in dividend-paying stocks with a 4% dividend yield can provide a higher return than a bond with a 2% yield.\n\nHowever, dividend-paying stock funds are not without their risks. The primary concern is that the companies in which the fund invests may not be able to maintain their dividend payments. If a company's dividend payout ratio is too high, it may struggle to sustain its dividend payments, which could negatively impact the fund's performance.\n\nAnother risk associated with dividend-paying stock funds is that they may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, the appeal of dividend-paying stocks may decrease, as investors may seek higher yields from bonds or other fixed-income investments. This can lead to a decline in the fund's value.\n\nDespite these risks, dividend-paying stock funds can be an attractive option for investors seeking a steady source of income. To get the most out of these funds, it's essential to do your research and understand the underlying characteristics of the companies in which the fund invests. Look for funds with a strong track record of dividend payments and a low dividend payout ratio.\n\nIn addition, consider investing in a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying stock funds to minimize risk. This can help you spread your investments across different sectors and industries, reducing your exposure to any one particular company or sector.\n\nIn conclusion, while dividend-paying stock funds may not be suitable for every investor, they can be an attractive option for those seeking a steady source of income. By understanding the underlying characteristics of these funds and doing your research, you can make an informed decision about whether they are right for you.",

The documents, revealed by the Guardian for the first time, lay out how ByteDance, the Beijing-headquartered technology company that owns TikTok, is advancing Chinese foreign policy aims abroad through the app. The revelations come amid rising suspicion that discussion of the Hong Kong protests on TikTok is being censored for political reasons: a Washington Post report earlier this month noted that a search on the site for the city-state revealed \"barely a hint of unrest in sight\". The guidelines divide banned material into two categories: some content is marked as a \"violation\", which sees it deleted from the site entirely, and can lead to a user being banned from the service. But lesser infringements are marked as \"visible to self\", which leaves the content up but limits its distribution through TikTok's algorithmically-curated feed. This latter enforcement technique means that it can be unclear to users whether they have posted infringing content, or if their post simply has not been deemed compelling enough to be shared widely by the notoriously unpredictable algorithm. The bulk of the guidelines covering China are contained in a section governing \"hate speech and religion\". In every case, they are placed in a context designed to make the rules seem general purpose, rather than specific exceptions. A ban on criticism of China's socialist system, for instance, comes under a general ban of \"criticism/attack towards policies, social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, monarchy, parliamentary system, separation of powers, socialism system, etc\". Another ban covers \"demonisation or distortion of local or other countries' history such as May 1998 riots of Indonesia, Cambodian genocide, Tiananmen Square incidents\". The documents also reveal a range of other topics that are considered off-limits on TikTok, including any discussion of Taiwan's independence, Xinjiang's human rights situation, and the 1989 Beijing massacre. The guidelines make it clear that moderators are expected to delete any content that mentions these topics, and to take disciplinary action against users who repeatedly post such material.\n\nThe revelations have sparked concerns among human rights groups and democracy advocates, who argue that TikTok's censorship policies are not only violating the rights of its users, but also undermining the platform's commitment to free expression. \"TikTok's moderation guidelines are a clear example of how Chinese technology companies are using their platforms to advance the interests of the Chinese government,\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \"By censoring content that mentions sensitive topics, TikTok is not only violating the rights of its users, but also perpetuating a culture of fear and self-censorship.\"\n\nThe documents also raise questions about the extent to which TikTok's moderation policies are being influenced by the Chinese government. While ByteDance has repeatedly denied that it is subject to government pressure, the company's ties to the Chinese Communist Party are well-documented. The company's founder, Zhang Yiming, has been a vocal supporter of the party, and has spoken publicly about the importance of promoting Chinese values and culture through technology.\n\nThe controversy surrounding TikTok's moderation policies comes at a time when the platform is facing growing scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. In the United States, for example, there are concerns that TikTok is collecting sensitive user data and sharing it with the Chinese government, which could potentially be used for surveillance or other nefarious purposes. The platform has repeatedly denied these allegations, but the controversy has led to calls for greater transparency and accountability from lawmakers and regulators.\n\nIn a statement, a TikTok spokesperson said that the company is committed to promoting free expression and diversity of thought on its platform, and that it works closely with experts and organizations to ensure that its moderation policies are fair and transparent. \"We understand that our platform is used by people all around the world, and we strive to create an environment that is welcoming and inclusive to all,\" the spokesperson said. \"We take the concerns raised by the Guardian seriously, and we will continue to work to improve our moderation policies and ensure that they are aligned with our values of promoting free expression and diversity of thought.\"\n\nDespite these assurances, the controversy surrounding TikTok's moderation policies is likely to continue to escalate in the coming weeks and months. As the platform's popularity continues to grow, so too will the scrutiny and criticism it faces from regulators, lawmakers, and human rights groups. The question is, will TikTok be able to adapt to these changing circumstances, or will its censorship policies continue to raise concerns about the platform's commitment to free expression and democracy? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "Doctors in the US have raised hopes of a treatment for muscular dystrophy, the most common fatal genetic condition in children, after mending mutations that cause the disease in dogs. The landmark study is the first to claim success at treating the muscle wasting disorder in large mammals, though scientists on the team caution that more work lies ahead to ensure the procedure is safe and effective for use in people. If the therapy continues to show promise in future animal studies, researchers believe that a clinical trial involving patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy could be launched within a few years. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations that disrupt the normal function of a gene on the X chromosome. The disease mostly affects boys â€“ about one in 3,500 â€“ because they have only one X chromosome. Since girls have two X chromosomes they tend to have a working backup if one copy of the gene is damaged. As a result girls tend not to be affected, but can be carriers and may pass mutated genes on to their children. The key gene in muscular dystrophy is needed to make dystrophin, a protein which is crucial for strong muscle fibres. If the gene is mutated, the protein cannot be made properly, and muscles throughout the body, including the heart, diaphragm and skeleton steadily weaken and waste away. The researchers, led by Dr. Eric Olson at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, used a gene-editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the mutations in the dogs. The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, involved a team of scientists from the University of Texas, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the study, the researchers used a virus to deliver the CRISPR-Cas9 tool to the dogs' cells, where it targeted and corrected the mutated gene. The dogs, which were genetically engineered to have the same mutations as humans with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, were then monitored for several months to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nThe results showed that the treatment was able to restore normal muscle function in the dogs, allowing them to run and play without the usual signs of muscular dystrophy. The study also found that the treatment was able to reverse the muscle wasting and weakness that typically occurs in dogs with the disease.\n\nWhile the results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that more work is needed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the treatment for use in humans. \"This is an important first step, but we need to do more research to make sure this treatment is safe and effective for people,\" said Dr. Olson. \"We're already planning follow-up studies to test the treatment in more dogs and to explore its potential use in other genetic diseases.\"\n\nThe potential implications of the study are significant, as muscular dystrophy is a devastating disease that affects thousands of children and young adults worldwide. Currently, there is no cure for the disease, and treatment options are limited to managing symptoms and slowing its progression.\n\nIf the treatment is successful in future human trials, it could offer new hope for families affected by muscular dystrophy. \"This study is a game-changer for families affected by muscular dystrophy,\" said Dr. Jane Leech, a pediatric neurologist at Boston Children's Hospital. \"If this treatment becomes available, it could offer a new way to treat the disease and improve the quality of life for affected children.\"\n\nThe researchers are also exploring the potential use of the CRISPR-Cas9 tool to treat other genetic diseases, including sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. While the technology is still in its early stages, the potential for gene editing to revolutionize the treatment of genetic diseases is vast.\n\nIn the meantime, the researchers are continuing to study the treatment in dogs and are planning to start human clinical trials in the near future. The potential for this treatment to make a difference in the lives of families affected by muscular dystrophy is immense, and the researchers are hopeful that their work will lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of this devastating disease.",

LOS ANGELES -- Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, the founders of Quibi, a short-form video app scheduled for an April 6 debut, are trying to create a platform for the smartphone age. To entice subscribers, they have ordered big-budget shows from known quantities like Kevin Hart and Steven Spielberg -- but they have turned to social media stars for the kind of casual, low-commitment programming that could make Quibi a daily habit. Shan Boodram, a 34-year-old sex educator with 506,000 YouTube subscribers and 260,000 Instagram followers, will host \"Sexology With Shan\" five days a week. Another social media influencer who has signed a deal with Quibi, Rachel Hollis, has 1.6 million Instagram followers and will be the host of \"The Rachel Hollis Show,\" a daily show of bite-size bits of motivation for young mothers. Quibi's focus on short-form, mobile-friendly content is a deliberate strategy to cater to the changing viewing habits of younger audiences. According to a report by eMarketer, the average American adult spends around 3 hours and 48 minutes per day on their mobile device, with 70% of that time spent on social media or streaming services. By offering bite-sized shows that can be easily consumed on-the-go, Quibi aims to capitalize on this trend and provide users with a constant stream of fresh content.\n\nThe platform's emphasis on social media influencers like Shan Boodram and Rachel Hollis is also a key part of its strategy. These influencers have built massive followings online by creating content around their areas of expertise, and Quibi is hoping to leverage their existing audiences to drive subscriptions and engagement. By partnering with influencers who have a strong connection with their fans, Quibi can create shows that are both entertaining and informative, and that appeal to a specific demographic.\n\n\"Sexology With Shan\" is one such show, which will focus on providing sex education and relationship advice to its audience. Shan Boodram, a certified sex educator and relationship coach, has built a reputation online for her frank and approachable discussions about sexuality and intimacy. Her show on Quibi will be a five-day-a-week program that covers a range of topics, from sexual health and wellness to relationship tips and advice.\n\nSimilarly, \"The Rachel Hollis Show\" will be a daily program that offers bite-sized bits of motivation and inspiration for young mothers. Rachel Hollis, a bestselling author and motivational speaker, has built a massive following online by sharing her own experiences and insights on topics like motherhood, marriage, and personal growth. Her show on Quibi will feature a mix of interviews with experts, personal anecdotes, and practical advice for young mothers.\n\nQuibi's foray into the world of social media influencers is not without its risks, however. The platform will need to carefully curate its content to ensure that it appeals to a broad audience, rather than simply catering to the existing fans of its influencers. Additionally, Quibi will need to navigate the complex issue of monetization, as it seeks to turn its influencer partnerships into a sustainable business model.\n\nDespite these challenges, Quibi's founders are confident that their platform has the potential to disrupt the traditional television landscape. By offering a unique blend of short-form content and social media influence, Quibi is poised to become a major player in the world of online video. As the platform prepares to launch on April 6, it remains to be seen whether its innovative approach will pay off, and whether Quibi will become the go-to destination for mobile video fans.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- Asil Nadir, the disgraced Turkish-Cypriot businessman whose Levantine panache and deal-making zeal rattled Britain's stodgy corporate establishment in the 1980s, returned here Thursday to face charges that he embezzled PS30 million while running the London-based conglomerate Polly Peck International. A stock-market darling for much of the 1980s, Polly Peck, with its phenomenal growth, symbolized the boom-time swagger of Margaret Thatcher's Britain -- with Mr. Nadir, who rose from being a newspaper delivery boy in northern Cyprus to become one of Britain's richest men in 1990 as well as a large donor to the Conservative Party, as Polly Peck's tabloid-ready personification. But, just as Thatcherism began to fade in the late 1980s, so did Polly Peck's debt-fueled ascent. Asil Nadir's return to London marks a dramatic turn of events in a saga that has spanned decades. The 71-year-old businessman, who has been living in northern Cyprus since fleeing the UK in 1993, is accused of embezzling Â£30 million from Polly Peck International, the conglomerate he founded and led from 1982 to 1990.\n\nThe charges against Nadir are a result of a long-running investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which began in the late 1980s. At the time, Polly Peck's rapid expansion and Nadir's charismatic leadership had made the company a darling of the stock market, with its shares soaring to new heights.\n\nHowever, the company's success was built on a foundation of debt, and by the late 1980s, Polly Peck was struggling to meet its financial obligations. In 1990, Nadir was forced to step down as CEO, and the company eventually went bankrupt in 1991.\n\nThe SFO's investigation into Polly Peck's collapse was initially hampered by Nadir's refusal to cooperate, and he eventually fled the UK in 1993, citing fears for his safety. However, in recent years, the SFO has been working to track down Nadir and bring him to justice.\n\nNadir's return to the UK has sparked a flurry of interest, with many Britons recalling the controversy surrounding Polly Peck's rise and fall. \"Asil Nadir was a symbol of the excesses of the 1980s,\" said John Major, a former UK prime minister who served during Thatcher's tenure. \"His return to the UK is a reminder of the importance of accountability and the need to hold those in power to account.\"\n\nThe case against Nadir is expected to be a complex and lengthy one, with prosecutors likely to present evidence of alleged embezzlement, fraud, and other financial irregularities. Nadir's legal team has already indicated that they will challenge the charges, and the case is likely to dominate headlines in the UK for months to come.\n\nAs Nadir faces justice, many are left wondering what the future holds for the disgraced businessman. Will he be found guilty and sentenced to prison, or will he be able to negotiate a plea deal and avoid a lengthy sentence? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: Asil Nadir's return to the UK marks a significant moment in a saga that has captivated the nation for decades.",

        "Text": "The need for tighter federal regulation was the dominant message sent on Thursday to the panel established by Congress to examine the causes of the financial crisis. Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, agreed on several recommendations for regulatory reform, including regulation of over-the-counter derivatives. In addition, they said, financial institutions should not reach the point where they are deemed \"too big to fail,\" because a government bailout or a market collapse are the only possible outcomes. \"The financial crisis calls into question the fundamental assumptions regarding financial supervision, credit availability and market discipline that have informed our regulatory efforts for decades,\" Ms. Bair told the 10-member bipartisan panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Ms. Bair, who has been outspoken since assuming her job in 2006, said the crisis was \"the culmination of a decades-long process by which our national policies have distorted economic activity\" away from savings and investment in industry and toward consumer consumption, housing and finance. Ms. Schapiro cited lax regulation of asset-backed securities, an excessive reliance on credit rating agencies, executive compensation that encouraged unhealthy risk-taking and a failure to oversee hedge funds and private equity funds. The two regulatory leaders also emphasized the need for greater transparency and accountability in the financial sector, citing the lack of clear information about the complex financial instruments that contributed to the crisis. \"The crisis was exacerbated by the lack of transparency and the lack of accountability in the financial system,\" Ms. Schapiro said. \"We need to ensure that financial institutions are transparent about their activities and that there are consequences for those who engage in reckless behavior.\"\n\nThe panel, which is tasked with investigating the causes of the financial crisis and making recommendations for reform, heard testimony from numerous experts and industry leaders over the past several weeks. The commission's findings are expected to be released in December, and its recommendations are likely to shape the debate over financial reform in the coming months.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory reforms, the panel also heard testimony about the role of the Federal Reserve in the crisis. Some experts have criticized the Fed's decision to provide emergency loans to financial institutions, arguing that it allowed them to take on even more risk and contributed to the crisis. Others have praised the Fed's actions, saying that they helped to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system.\n\nThe commission's chair, Phil Angelides, said that the panel's findings will be based on a thorough examination of the evidence and will not be influenced by political considerations. \"We are committed to conducting a fair and impartial investigation,\" he said. \"Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the causes of the financial crisis and to make recommendations for reform that will help to prevent such a crisis from happening again in the future.\"\n\nThe financial crisis has had far-reaching consequences for the global economy, leading to widespread job losses, home foreclosures, and a significant decline in economic output. The crisis has also led to a major overhaul of the financial regulatory system, with many experts calling for greater oversight and accountability in the sector.\n\nAs the panel continues its investigation, it is likely to focus on several key areas, including the role of subprime lending, the failure of credit rating agencies, and the lack of effective regulation of financial institutions. The commission's findings and recommendations are expected to have a significant impact on the debate over financial reform and will likely shape the direction of regulatory policy in the coming years.",

        "Text": "EVEN though taxpayers have a few extra days this year to file their federal income tax returns, some still won't make the deadline. So with tax day approaching on Monday, it's time to think about filing an extension. The Internal Revenue Service projects that it will receive 13.5 million requests for extensions of time to file this year. According to the IRS, a tax extension is not the same as a tax payment extension. While an extension gives filers more time to submit their tax returns, it does not grant additional time to pay any owed taxes. Filers who owe taxes and do not pay by the original deadline may face penalties and interest on the outstanding amount.\n\nTo request an extension, taxpayers must file Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, with the IRS by the original deadline. The form is available on the IRS website and can be e-filed or mailed in. Filers who are unable to file electronically can also request an extension by phone or by mail.\n\nThe IRS will automatically grant an extension to all eligible taxpayers, giving them an additional six months to file their tax returns. However, during this extended period, filers are still required to pay any owed taxes to avoid penalties and interest.\n\nTaxpayers who need more time to file their taxes can also consider hiring a tax professional or using tax preparation software to help with the filing process. These services can provide guidance and support to ensure that all necessary forms and documentation are completed accurately and on time.\n\nIn addition to the automatic extension, the IRS also offers a variety of online resources and tools to help taxpayers navigate the filing process. The IRS website provides information on tax credits, deductions, and other tax-related topics, as well as a variety of online tools and calculators to help with tax planning and preparation.\n\nOverall, while an extension may provide some relief for taxpayers who are unable to meet the original deadline, it is essential to prioritize tax payment and avoid any potential penalties and interest. By taking the time to file accurately and on time, taxpayers can avoid any unnecessary stress and ensure a smooth and successful tax season.",

        "Text": "Study after study has shown a yawning educational achievement gap between the poorest and wealthiest children in America. But what does this gap costs in terms of lost economic growth and tax revenue? That's what researchers at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth set out to discover in a new study that concluded the United States could ultimately enrich everybody by improving educational performance for the typical student. When it comes to math and science scores, the United States lags most of the other 33 advanced industrialized countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ranking 24th, far behind Korea, Poland and Slovenia. Moving up just a few notches to 19th -- so that the average American score matched the O.E.C.D. average -- would add 1.7 percent to the nation's gross domestic product over the next 35 years, according to estimates by the Washington Center, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning research group focused on narrowing inequality. According to the study, this significant boost to the economy would not only be driven by the improved educational performance but also by the increased earning potential of individuals. The researchers found that if the average American student's math and science scores matched the O.E.C.D. average, the median household income would rise by approximately 3.4% over the same 35-year period.\n\nThis, in turn, would lead to a substantial increase in tax revenue for the government. The study estimates that the additional income would result in an increase of around $1.2 trillion in tax revenue over the next three and a half decades. This would not only benefit the federal government but also state and local governments, which would see a corresponding increase in their tax bases.\n\nThe researchers also explored the potential long-term benefits of closing the educational achievement gap. They found that if the United States were to match the O.E.C.D. average in math and science scores, the country would likely experience a significant reduction in poverty rates. According to the study, the poverty rate would decline by around 2.5 percentage points, which would translate to approximately 2.5 million fewer people living in poverty.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for policymakers and educators. The researchers are urging policymakers to prioritize investments in education, particularly in areas such as teacher training, curriculum development, and access to quality educational resources. They are also calling for a focus on addressing the root causes of the educational achievement gap, such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and limited opportunities for parental education.\n\nThe Washington Center for Equitable Growth is a nonpartisan research organization that has been at the forefront of studying the impact of inequality on the economy. The organization's president, Dr. Heather Boushey, emphasized the importance of addressing the educational achievement gap, saying, \"Improving educational performance is not only a moral imperative but also a critical component of building a more equitable and prosperous society. By closing the gap, we can create a brighter future for all Americans, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.\"\n\nThe study's findings have been met with widespread support from educators, policymakers, and business leaders. As the United States continues to grapple with issues of inequality and economic growth, the research highlights the critical role that education plays in driving prosperity and reducing poverty. By prioritizing investments in education and addressing the root causes of the educational achievement gap, the country can work towards a more equitable and prosperous future for all.",

Among the major brands that used their commercial time for social commentary was Airbnb, which had decided just last week to run an ad. In the ad, the company promoted its view of an open, multicultural world, reflecting its commitment to housing refugees. Coca-Cola revived an ad it ran during the 2014 Super Bowl featuring people singing a multilingual version of \"America the Beautiful.\" It managed to strike a new chord with viewers, given the recent national conversation around immigration and diversity, and it prompted a flood of conversation on Twitter. \"I thought it was great for Coke to air an old ad because today it feels even more relevant than it did in 2014 when they first aired it,\" said Lynn Power, chief executive of J. Walter Thompson New York. The ad, which was first released in 2014, features a diverse group of people from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds singing a multilingual version of the classic American song \"America the Beautiful.\" The commercial was part of Coca-Cola's \"Taste the Feeling\" campaign, which aimed to promote the brand's values of unity, diversity, and inclusivity.\n\nThis year, the ad seemed to strike a particularly resonant chord with viewers, given the current national conversation around immigration and diversity.

It also sparked a significant amount of conversation on social media, with many viewers taking to Twitter to share their thoughts and reactions to the commercial. The ad was widely praised, with many viewers expressing gratitude for the brand's commitment to promoting diversity and inclusivity.\n\nNot everyone was pleased with the ad, however. Some viewers felt that it was overly sentimental or even manipulative, and that it was trying to exploit the emotions of viewers for the sake of selling soda. Others felt that the ad was too focused on promoting a message of unity, and that it ignored the very real divisions and conflicts that exist in the world.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the ad was widely seen as a powerful and effective way for Coca-Cola to promote its brand values and connect with its audience. The ad's message of unity and inclusivity was seen as a powerful antidote to the divisive rhetoric and policies that have dominated the news in recent months, and it was widely praised for its ability to inspire and uplift viewers.\n\nIn the end, the ad was a testament to the power of advertising to shape our perceptions and influence our emotions. It was a reminder that even in the most cynical and commercial of times, there is still room for brands to use their platforms to promote positive values and ideals. And it was a powerful reminder of the importance of unity and inclusivity in our increasingly divided world.",

It has happened in the past, but the odds of another such catastrophe have remained uncertain. Now astronomers have performed the cosmic equivalent of a risk assessment. A new paper calculates how often stars stray into the Oort cloud, a vast, spherical shell of billions of icy objects that is thought to envelop our solar system. Such close encounters can dislodge these loosely orbiting comets, sending them hurtling into the solar system, risking a collision course with the Earth. Within the next million years, the paper predicts, between 19 and 24 stars will come within 3.26 light years of the sun â€“ sufficiently close to deflect comets markedly from their original paths. The researchers used a combination of observations and simulations to estimate the likelihood of stars colliding with the Oort cloud. They analyzed data from the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft, which has been mapping the positions and velocities of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. They also used computer simulations to model the orbits of stars and the Oort cloud over millions of years.\n\nThe study found that the probability of a star colliding with the Oort cloud is relatively low, but not zero. In fact, the researchers estimate that there is a 1 in 100,000 chance that a star will collide with the Oort cloud within the next million years. However, when a star does collide with the Oort cloud, the consequences can be significant.\n\nThe researchers used their simulations to estimate the number of comets that could be dislodged from the Oort cloud and sent hurtling towards the inner solar system. They found that between 19 and 24 comets could be dislodged within the next million years, increasing the risk of a comet impacting the Earth.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, emphasized the importance of continued monitoring of the Oort cloud and the solar system. \"While the risk of a comet impacting the Earth is low, it is not zero,\" she said. \"We need to continue to monitor the Oort cloud and the solar system to better understand the risks and take steps to mitigate them.\"\n\nThe researchers hope that their study will help scientists and policymakers better prepare for the possibility of a comet impact. They are already working on follow-up studies to refine their estimates and better understand the dynamics of the Oort cloud.\n\nIn the meantime, astronomers are keeping a close eye on the skies, searching for any signs of comets that may be heading towards the Earth.

        "Text": "OXFORD, Miss. -- Every seat in the house was sold out for Friday's performance of \"The Laramie Project,\" a play staged by the University of Mississippi theater department about an anti-gay hate crime. Hundreds of miles away, the Ole Miss football team was preparing to take on Auburn. The two groups of students, about as far apart as any cultural groups on a college campus could be, became linked this week after football players and other freshmen disrupted the play with homophobic heckling. University officials are investigating the episode, employing a new bias incident response team developed earlier this year. The university, despite enormous changes, still struggles with the legacy of its integration in 1962 that resulted in two deaths and dozens of injuries.Since then, the university has made inclusion and racial healing a theme, but problems persist. In 2012, a student protest against the re-election of President Obama turned disorderly, with some students chanting racial epithets and two charged with disorderly conduct. Particularly in light of that episode, the uproar over the play brought out a certain defensiveness on campus among some students, but many applauded what they say was a thorough and swift response from the university. The actors themselves were thrust into a national spotlight. Well-wishers from theater communities in Los Angeles and New York reached out to the school in a show of support. As the investigation into the incident continues, students and faculty are left grappling with the implications of the event. The disruption of the play, which tells the story of the brutal murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, in Laramie, Wyoming, has sparked a heated debate about the state of inclusivity on campus.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for our university,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, a professor of theater and director of the play. \"We thought we had made significant progress in terms of creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, but it seems that there is still much work to be done.\"\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the role of student athletes on campus. While the football players involved in the disruption have been identified and are facing disciplinary action, some students are calling for a broader examination of the culture within the athletic department.\n\n\"This is not just about a few bad apples,\" said sophomore Emily Johnson, a member of the university's LGBTQ+ student organization. \"It's about a culture that values winning over everything else, including respect and inclusivity. We need to have a serious conversation about what kind of values we want to promote on this campus.\"\n\nIn response to the incident, university officials have announced a series of initiatives aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion on campus. These include increased training for student leaders and athletes, as well as a renewed focus on creating a welcoming environment for all students.\n\n\"We are committed to making sure that every student feels valued and respected on this campus,\" said Chancellor Dr. James Miller. \"We will not tolerate behavior that is discriminatory or hateful in any way. We will work tirelessly to create an environment that is inclusive and welcoming to all.\"\n\nAs the university moves forward, many are looking to the theater department as a symbol of hope and resilience. Despite the disruption, the actors and crew of \"The Laramie Project\" have spoken out about the importance of telling stories that promote understanding and empathy.\n\n\"We believe that art has the power to bring people together and to challenge our assumptions,\" said actor John Doe. \"We hope that our play has inspired people to think critically about issues of identity and inclusivity, and to work towards creating a more just and compassionate world.\"\n\nIn the end, the incident has brought attention to the ongoing struggle for inclusivity and diversity on campus, and has sparked a renewed commitment to creating a welcoming environment for all students. As the university moves forward, it is clear that the power of art and the importance of empathy will continue to play a critical role in shaping the future of the campus community.",

        "Text": "A university in London has ditched the controversial practice of offering prospective students unconditional places prompting a union call for other institutions to do the same. St Mary's University in Twickenham announced the plan after acknowledging a number of students who had been given unconditional offers did not go on to achieve their expected grades. University lecturers urged other universities to follow St Mary's lead. Unconditional offers, which were given to almost a quarter of students in this year's cohort, allow students to accept an undergraduate place without meeting their A-level or BTec grades predicted by teachers. They are seen as an attempt to fill course places irrespective of academic requirements. The decision by St Mary's University to abandon unconditional offers has sparked a heated debate among education experts and students alike. While some have praised the move, citing concerns over academic integrity and the potential for students to coast through their studies without putting in the necessary effort, others have expressed concerns over the impact on students from disadvantaged backgrounds who may rely on unconditional offers to secure a place at university.\n\nDr. Emma Taylor, a lecturer in education at St Mary's University, said that the decision was made after a thorough review of the university's admissions process. \"We realized that a significant number of students who had been given unconditional offers were not meeting their expected grades, and this was having a negative impact on the overall academic performance of our students,\" she explained.\n\nThe university's decision has been welcomed by some students, who argue that unconditional offers can create unrealistic expectations and put pressure on students to perform well. \"I was given an unconditional offer by another university, but it was a huge weight off my shoulders when St Mary's decided to stop offering them,\" said Sophie Jenkins, a student who is set to start a degree in English literature at the university in September.\n\nHowever, not all students are pleased with the decision. Some have expressed concerns that the move will make it harder for them to secure a place at university, particularly if they are from disadvantaged backgrounds. \"I was given an unconditional offer by a university and it was a huge relief for me and my family,\" said Jamal Khan, a student who is set to start a degree in computer science. \"I'm worried that without unconditional offers, I won't be able to get a place at university.\"\n\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) has also weighed in on the debate, calling on other universities to follow St Mary's lead. \"We believe that unconditional offers can create unrealistic expectations and put pressure on students to perform well,\" said a spokesperson for the NUS. \"We urge other universities to review their admissions processes and consider abandoning unconditional offers in favor of more holistic approaches to admissions.\"\n\nThe move by St Mary's University has also sparked a wider debate about the role of unconditional offers in the university admissions process. Some experts argue that unconditional offers can be a useful tool for universities looking to attract students from a wider range of backgrounds, while others argue that they can create unrealistic expectations and put pressure on students to perform well.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether other universities will follow St Mary's lead and abandon unconditional offers. However, one thing is clear: the decision has sparked a much-needed conversation about the role of unconditional offers in the university admissions process and the impact they can have on students and universities alike.",

        "Text": "LOS ANGELES -- The film executive behind book-to-film blockbusters like \"Life of Pi\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\" will rebuild her operation at Sony Pictures after being jettisoned by Walt Disney Studios. Sony and HarperCollins Publishers said on Monday that they would finance a yet-to-be-named venture run by the executive, Elizabeth Gabler, who is considered Hollywood's foremost bridge to the New York publishing world. Ms. Gabler, 63, was previously president of Fox 2000, a division of 20th Century Fox, which Disney absorbed in March as part of a $71.3 billion deal with Rupert Murdoch. In addition to \"Life of Pi\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" Fox 2000 hits include \"The Fault in Our Stars,\" \"Hidden Figures,\" \"Marley & Me\" and the \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" series. To the surprise of many in Hollywood -- Ms. Gabler in particular -- Disney immediately pulled the plug on Fox 2000; Disney had signaled for months that it intended to keep it running. Disney insiders asserted that Ms. Gabler's operation was too expensive and that her track record at the box office had grown spotty amid the film industry's shift toward fantasy franchises. \"The Hate U Give\" was one recent Fox 2000 disappointment, costing roughly $50 million to make and market and collecting $35 million worldwide last year, about half of which went to theater owners. \"This re-establishes us as a big buyer,\" Ms. Gabler said in an interview, referring to her all-female Fox 2000 team, which she will take with her to the new division. (There are 10 executives and assistants.) Ms. Gabler emphasized that her new Sony label would also develop films based on books from publishers other than HarperCollins and that she could make movies for third-party distributors if Sony passed. Gabler's departure from Disney was seen as a significant loss for the studio, given her extensive experience and track record of producing successful book-to-film adaptations. However, the executive was quick to emphasize that her new venture at Sony would be a fresh start, allowing her to rebuild her team and focus on developing projects that align with her vision.\n\n\"We're not just looking to replicate what we did at Fox 2000,\" Gabler said. \"We're going to take a more strategic approach to our film development, focusing on projects that have a strong emotional resonance and a clear audience appeal.\"\n\nGabler's new division is expected to be headquartered in Los Angeles, with a team of around 10 executives and assistants who will work closely with Sony's existing film division. The executive has already begun meeting with authors, publishers, and agents to discuss potential projects, and is looking to make a significant impact in the film industry.\n\n\"We're not just looking to make movies based on bestselling books,\" Gabler said. \"We're looking to develop projects that have a strong narrative voice and a clear visual style. We're looking for stories that will resonate with audiences and leave a lasting impression.\"\n\nGabler's partnership with HarperCollins is seen as a significant coup for the publisher, which is looking to expand its presence in the film industry. The partnership will allow HarperCollins to tap into Gabler's extensive network of authors and agents, and to develop projects that will appeal to a broad range of audiences.\n\n\"This is a huge opportunity for us to expand our reach and to develop projects that will resonate with readers and audiences alike,\" said Brian Murray, CEO of HarperCollins. \"Elizabeth Gabler is a highly respected and accomplished executive, and we're thrilled to be partnering with her on this new venture.\"\n\nThe partnership is also seen as a significant boost for Sony, which has been looking to expand its presence in the film industry. The studio has had success with films like \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" and \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" but has struggled to replicate the success of its major franchises.\n\n\"Elizabeth Gabler is a highly respected and accomplished executive, and we're thrilled to have her on board,\" said Tony Vinciquerra, CEO of Sony Pictures. \"Her expertise and experience will be invaluable as we look to develop new projects and expand our presence in the film industry.\"\n\nGabler's new division is expected to begin producing films in the coming months, with a focus on developing projects that will appeal to a broad range of audiences. The executive is confident that her new venture will be a success, and is looking forward to the opportunity to work with authors, publishers, and agents to develop projects that will leave a lasting impression on audiences.",

        "Text": "A group of Republican elder statesmen is calling for a tax on carbon emissions to fight climate change. The group, led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, with former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former secretary of the Treasury, says that taxing carbon pollution produced by burning fossil fuels is \"a conservative climate solution\" based on free-market principles. Mr. Baker is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, Jared Kushner, the senior adviser to the president, and Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, as well as Ivanka Trump. In an interview, Mr. Baker said that the plan followed classic conservative principles of free-market solutions and small government. He suggested that even former President Ronald Reagan would have blessed the plan: \"I'm not at all sure the Gipper wouldn't have been very happy with this.\" He said he had no idea how the proposal would be received by the current White House or Congress. The Baker proposal would substitute the carbon tax for the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, a complex set of rules to regulate emissions which President Trump has pledged to repeal and which is tied up in court challenges, as well as other climate regulations. At an initial price of $40 per ton of carbon dioxide produced, the tax would raise an estimated $200 billion to $300 billion a year, with the rate scheduled to rise over time. The tax would be collected where the fossil fuels enter the economy, such as the mine, well or port; the money raised would be returned to consumers in what the group calls a \"carbon dividend\" amounting to an estimated $2,000 a year for the average family of four. The plan would also incorporate what are known as \"border adjustments\" to increase the costs for products from other countries that do not have a similar system in place, an idea intended to address the problem of other \"free-rider\" nations gaining a price advantage over carbon-taxed domestic goods. The proposal, dubbed the \"Conservative Climate Plan,\" aims to reduce the country's carbon footprint while also promoting economic growth and job creation. According to Baker, the plan would create a level playing field for American businesses by putting a price on carbon pollution, making it more expensive for companies to emit greenhouse gases.\n\n\"This is not a tax on American industry, it's a tax on carbon pollution,\" Baker emphasized. \"We're not trying to punish anyone, we're trying to create a market-based solution that rewards innovation and efficiency.\"\n\nThe plan's carbon dividend, which would be returned to consumers, is designed to offset the increased costs of energy and goods, making it a more palatable solution for those who might otherwise oppose a carbon tax.\n\n\"We believe that the benefits of this plan far outweigh the costs,\" said Shultz, a former secretary of state and treasury secretary. \"By putting a price on carbon, we can reduce emissions, promote clean energy, and create jobs in the clean energy sector.\"\n\nThe proposal has already received support from some conservative groups, including the American Enterprise Institute and the National Review. However, it is unclear whether the plan will gain traction with the current administration, which has been skeptical of climate change and has rolled back several Obama-era environmental regulations.\n\nDespite the challenges, Baker remains optimistic that the plan can find common ground with the White House and Congress.\n\n\"We're not naive about the politics of this issue,\" he said. \"But we believe that this plan is a conservative solution that can appeal to people on both sides of the aisle. We're willing to work with anyone who is serious about addressing climate change and promoting economic growth.\"\n\nThe Baker plan is not the only carbon tax proposal currently on the table. Democratic lawmakers have introduced several bills aimed at taxing carbon emissions, and some environmental groups are pushing for a more comprehensive approach to addressing climate change.\n\nHowever, the Conservative Climate Plan's emphasis on free-market principles and small government has set it apart from other proposals, making it a unique offering in the ongoing debate over climate change policy.\n\nAs the proposal makes its way through the political process, it remains to be seen whether the Baker plan can find a path forward and become a viable solution to the country's climate change challenges.",

WASHINGTON -- Politics have been at the center of the public debate about the Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&T's $85 billion purchase of Time Warner. But the trial itself, starting later this month, is shaping up to be a fight focused on classic issues in antitrust law. In court filings on Friday, the Justice Department and AT&T laid out the arguments that they plan to make in the trial. Regulators will argue that the deal will hurt competition and lead to higher prices. According to the Justice Department's filings, the acquisition would give AT&T too much control over the distribution of popular content, such as HBO and CNN, and would allow the company to favor its own content over that of its rivals. The department also claims that the deal would stifle innovation and limit consumer choice.\n\nAT&T, on the other hand, is expected to argue that the acquisition is necessary to stay competitive in a rapidly changing media landscape. The company will likely point to the growing importance of streaming services and the need for content creators to adapt to new distribution models. AT&T will also argue that the deal will actually increase competition, as it will allow the company to offer a wider range of content to consumers and compete more effectively with online giants like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nThe trial is expected to focus on several key issues, including the definition of a \"relevant market\" in the antitrust context. The Justice Department will argue that the relevant market is the distribution of popular content, while AT&T will argue that it is the broader market of telecommunications and media services.\n\nThe trial is also expected to delve into the issue of \" vertical integration,\" or the practice of owning multiple parts of the content creation and distribution chain. The Justice Department will argue that vertical integration can lead to anti-competitive behavior, while AT&T will argue that it is necessary to create a more efficient and cost-effective business model.\n\nThe outcome of the trial is difficult to predict, as it will depend on the judge's interpretation of the evidence and the legal precedents. However, the case has significant implications for the future of the media and telecommunications industries, and will likely have far-reaching consequences for consumers and businesses alike.\n\nThe trial is set to begin on March 19th and is expected to last several weeks. The outcome of the trial will likely be appealed, and the case could ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. Regardless of the outcome, the trial is likely to have significant implications for the future of the media and telecommunications industries, and will be closely watched by consumers, businesses, and policymakers alike.",

They said Kyle used a \"bullying methodology\" and \"abusive language\" to provoke participants on his cancelled talk show, with the host's swearing sometimes edited out before broadcast to give a misleading impression to audiences. The show's in-house director of aftercare was also accused of a \"complete abdication of the duty of care\" by allowing the crew to continue filming a \"highly agitated and distressed\" individual with severe mental health and addiction issues backstage, rather than intervening to help the person after they had stormed off the programme. The assessment of the footage provided by a former member of the programme's crew was carried out by a clinical psychologist and media studies professor employed as expert witnesses for the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. \"It is clear that once the cameras started rolling on The Jeremy Kyle Show there was no safe space for anyone in a highly distressed state, verified by the behind-the-scenes footage passed to the committee by a whistleblower,\" said the committee chair, Damian Collins. The findings of the committee's investigation have sent shockwaves through the broadcasting industry, with many calling for greater accountability and oversight of reality TV shows. ITV has faced intense scrutiny over its handling of the show, which was cancelled in May 2019 following the death of a participant, Steve Dymond, who had appeared on the program.\n\nThe committee's report highlights a culture of exploitation and neglect on the part of the show's producers, who prioritized ratings and drama over the well-being of their participants. The footage obtained by the committee shows participants being subjected to aggressive and belittling treatment by Kyle and his crew, as well as being manipulated and provoked to elicit extreme reactions.\n\nThe report also criticizes the show's in-house aftercare system, which was supposed to provide support to participants after they left the show. Instead, the committee found that the system was inadequate and failed to provide adequate support to participants who were struggling with the emotional trauma of appearing on the show.\n\nThe committee's chair, Damian Collins, has called for ITV to take immediate action to address the issues raised in the report. \"ITV must take responsibility for the harm caused by The Jeremy Kyle Show and take concrete steps to prevent similar failures in the future,\" he said.\n\nThe findings of the report have also sparked calls for greater regulation of reality TV shows. Many have argued that the industry needs stricter guidelines and oversight to ensure that participants are protected from exploitation and harm.\n\nIn response to the report, ITV has issued a statement apologizing for the harm caused by the show and committing to improve its practices and procedures. However, the company has faced criticism for not doing enough to address the issues raised in the report and for not taking adequate responsibility for the harm caused by the show.\n\nThe controversy surrounding The Jeremy Kyle Show is a stark reminder of the need for greater accountability and oversight in the broadcasting industry. As the industry continues to evolve and change, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being and safety of participants and ensure that they are protected from exploitation and harm.",

        "Text": "With the start of a new year, many are setting lofty self-improvement goals that will soon be abandoned. But there are apps that can help you stick to your resolutions. One of my goals this year is to control how much I use my phone -- to resist constantly looking at all the notifications that pop up from my apps. So I'm using the Forest app to help, and it's surprisingly fun. The idea is that you set a time during which you will resist all urges to check Facebook or email or play a game. Then Forest plants a \"seed\" on its screen for you. As your timer counts down, the seed grows into a full-fledged tree or bush, rewarding you with cute graphics and a sense of achievement. If you're tempted to move away from the app and you unlock your phone, Forest displays a cajoling message (which you can customize) telling you to put your phone back down. And if you do fail and switch to another app, your cute plant withers and dies and Forest tries to make you feel bad about it. When you manage to finish the timer properly, you are rewarded with coins that you can use to unlock different types of trees in the app. There are analytics so you can track your forest growth achievements over time, and you can even compare your statistics to those of other users around the world. Forest works well, and if your 2017 goal is to be more in the moment, ignore your phone and actually talk to your friends when you are with them, this is the app for you. It's $2 on iOS and free on Android. Repeating a new habit is the trick to making it stick, but it is also difficult. The Power of Habit Formation: How Forest App Can Help You Achieve Your Goals\n\nThe struggle to form new habits is a common phenomenon, especially when it comes to self-improvement goals. Many of us start the year with high aspirations, only to see them fizzle out within weeks. However, with the right tools and strategies, it is possible to break the cycle of procrastination and achieve lasting change.\n\nThe Forest app is a prime example of a tool that can help you stick to your resolutions. By gamifying the process of habit formation, Forest makes it fun and engaging to resist the temptation of constant phone checks. The app's unique approach to habit formation is rooted in the concept of \"temptation bundling,\" which involves linking a pleasurable activity to a desired behavior.\n\nIn the case of Forest, the pleasurable activity is the growth of a virtual tree or bush, which serves as a visual representation of your progress. As you resist the urge to check your phone, the seedling grows into a full-fledged plant, providing a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue. The app's use of cute graphics and rewards makes the experience enjoyable and addictive, making it easier to stick to your goals.\n\nBut Forest is not just about the rewards; it's also about the analytics. The app tracks your progress, providing you with valuable insights into your habits and behaviors. You can see how often you're able to resist the temptation of your phone, and how long you're able to stay focused on your goals. This data can be used to identify patterns and make adjustments to your habits, helping you to stay on track and achieve lasting change.\n\nThe app's social features also play a crucial role in its effectiveness. By comparing your progress to that of other users, you're motivated to stay on track and push yourself to achieve more. This sense of community and accountability can be a powerful driver of change, helping you to stay committed to your goals and avoid falling back into old habits.\n\nIn conclusion, the Forest app is a powerful tool that can help you achieve your self-improvement goals. By gamifying the process of habit formation and providing valuable analytics and social features, Forest makes it easier to stick to your resolutions and achieve lasting change. Whether your goal is to reduce your phone use, improve your productivity, or simply be more present in the moment, Forest is an app that can help you get there.",

        "Text": "Is there actually a case for the Wall? Donald Trump's boast to build a \"big, beautiful\" wall along the southern border clearly provided a lift to his candidacy, arguably delivering him the Republican presidential nomination. Along with his promise to deport millions of immigrants who are living in the United States without legal authorization, it remains the leitmotif of his campaign, despite occasional bursts of softer rhetoric. Mr. Trump is not wrong that immigration from Mexico and other countries in the poorer south over the last quarter-century has injured some American workers who competed with immigrants in the job market. It is not his concern alone; similar fears are shared by organized labor and others on the left of the political spectrum. However, the notion that building a wall along the entire southern border is the solution to this problem is a misguided and costly approach. According to a study by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, the majority of undocumented immigrants in the US are not from Mexico, but rather from other countries in Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nMoreover, the economic benefits of immigration, particularly in industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality, are often overlooked in the debate. Immigrants also contribute to the US economy through entrepreneurship, innovation, and tax payments. A report by the National Foundation for American Policy found that foreign-born entrepreneurs have founded over 40% of America's top 50 venture-backed companies, creating jobs and driving economic growth.\n\nFurthermore, the construction of a wall would be a significant undertaking, requiring billions of dollars in funding and resources. It would also be an ineffective way to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability in the countries of origin.\n\nInstead of building a wall, experts recommend a comprehensive approach to immigration reform that includes increased funding for border security, improved visa programs, and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. This approach would not only address the concerns of American workers but also recognize the valuable contributions that immigrants make to the US economy and society.\n\nIn conclusion, while concerns about immigration and its impact on the job market are legitimate, building a wall along the southern border is not a viable or effective solution. A more nuanced and balanced approach to immigration reform is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding immigration and to ensure that the US remains a welcoming and inclusive nation for generations to come.",

Guillem has been extremely coy with journalists trying to get in touch, offering the same email response to everyone, and only allowing the models in the picture to be contacted via him, using their stage names of \"Laura\" and \"Mario\". Despite the initial reluctance to share more information, Guillem eventually opened up to a few select media outlets, revealing the story behind the viral image. According to Guillem, the photo was taken on a sunny day in Barcelona's famous Park GÃ¼ell, a popular tourist destination known for its stunning views of the city.\n\nThe photographer explained that he was looking to capture a scene that would showcase the complexities of human relationships, and the \"distracted boyfriend\" scenario seemed like the perfect subject.

Bernanke, is the leading candidate to become vice chairman of the Fed, according to former and current administration officials. If nominated, and then confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Fischer, 70, would succeed Janet L. Yellen, whom President Obama nominated to succeed Mr. Bernanke as the Fed's leader when his term ends in January. Mr. Fischer is at once a surprising choice and a popular pick among economists and investors. He is a highly regarded economist with significant policy-making experience, yet many had considered his selection improbable because of his recent service in a foreign government. News about Mr. Fischer's possible nomination was reported on Israeli television. That experience could become a concern if he is nominated, as could his experience at Citigroup, where he was vice chairman between 2002 and 2005. The company's expansion during that period eventually ended in a federal bailout. As the Fed's vice chairman, Mr. Fischer would most likely exert a moderating influence on Ms. Yellen, echoing, in a way, her intellectual partnership with Mr. Bernanke. Ms. Yellen is a forceful advocate for the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. Mr. Fischer has been generally supportive of those efforts, but has raised questions about the particulars. He offered measured support at a conference last month for the Fed's bond-buying campaign, describing it as \"dangerous\" but \"necessary.\" At the same time, he has expressed greater skepticism about the companion effort to hold down borrowing costs by declaring that short-term interest rates will remain low, describing such forward guidance as potentially confusing. Despite the potential concerns, many economists and investors believe that Mr. Fischer's unique blend of experience and expertise would make him an excellent fit for the role of vice chairman. \"Stanley Fischer is a highly respected economist with a deep understanding of monetary policy and international finance,\" said Dr. Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and professor at Columbia University. \"He has a proven track record of making tough decisions and has a strong intellectual foundation to inform his policy judgments.\"\n\nMr. Fischer's experience at the Bank of Israel, where he served as governor from 2005 to 2013, has also been cited as a major asset. During his tenure, he played a key role in navigating the country through the global financial crisis, and his leadership was praised by international financial institutions.\n\nHowever, some critics have raised concerns about Mr. Fischer's experience at Citigroup, where he was vice chairman from 2002 to 2005. The company's aggressive expansion during that period, which was fueled by lax regulation and excessive risk-taking, ultimately led to a federal bailout. \"While Mr. Fischer was not directly responsible for the company's actions, his involvement in the financial industry during that period raises questions about his judgment and accountability,\" said Dr. Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.\n\nDespite these concerns, many believe that Mr. Fischer's qualifications and experience make him an excellent candidate for the role of vice chairman. \"The Fed needs someone with a deep understanding of monetary policy and international finance, and Mr. Fischer has that in spades,\" said Dr. Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary and current president of Harvard University. \"He is a thoughtful and nuanced thinker who would bring a level of sophistication and expertise to the role.\"\n\nIf Mr. Fischer is nominated and confirmed, he would join a Fed leadership team that is likely to be shaped by the ongoing debate about the future of monetary policy. With Ms. Yellen at the helm, the Fed is expected to continue its efforts to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment, but there are growing concerns about the potential risks and unintended consequences of these policies.\n\nAs the Fed's vice chairman, Mr. Fischer would play a key role in shaping the central bank's approach to these issues, and his experience and expertise would be invaluable in helping to navigate the complex and uncertain economic landscape.",

It was the lowest interest rate Italy has been able to sell one-year debt at since an auction in June -- and less than half the 5.952 percent Italy had to offer at the last sale, in early December. In Madrid, the Spanish Treasury said Thursday it sold a total of 10 billion euros ($12.8 billion) of bonds -- twice the amount it had set as a target -- with yields down from previous auctions. For example, $4.3 billion in three-year notes were sold at a yield of 3.384 percent, compared with 5.187 percent in December for three-year notes. Both Spain and Italy have been under intense pressure from investors because of their public finances, with recently installed governments scrambling to push through additional austerity packages to rein in deficits and debt levels. Both countries' longer-term debt yields, which reflect higher risk and uncertainty, remain relatively high. Another bellwether of the crisis comes Friday, when Italy tries to auction more than $9 billion in longer-term debt. The Italian Treasury's successful auction of 12-month bills comes as a relief to investors and policymakers alike, who had been bracing for a potential credit crunch in the region. The low interest rate and high demand for the debt securities indicate that investors are willing to lend to Italy at a relatively low cost, at least for now.\n\nHowever, analysts warn that the situation remains fragile and that the European Central Bank's efforts to ease credit conditions may not be enough to stem the tide of the crisis. \"While the auction results are positive, they don't change the fundamental dynamics of the crisis,\" said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit. \"Italy's debt levels are still too high, and the country needs to implement more structural reforms to boost growth and reduce its reliance on foreign capital.\"\n\nThe Spanish Treasury's successful auction of bonds, which was twice the amount it had set as a target, is also seen as a positive sign. The lower yields on the bonds, particularly the three-year notes, indicate that investors are becoming more confident in Spain's ability to manage its finances and implement austerity measures.\n\nDespite the positive auction results, the European Central Bank's decision to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 percent was seen as a cautious move. The bank's president, Mario Draghi, indicated that the ECB is prepared to take further steps to ease credit conditions if necessary, but only if inflation remains low and the economy continues to struggle.\n\nThe ECB's stance is seen as a delicate balance between supporting the economy and avoiding inflationary pressures. The bank has already implemented a series of measures to ease credit conditions, including a series of long-term refinancing operations and a program to purchase government bonds.\n\nThe next test for the European Central Bank and the Italian and Spanish governments will come on Friday, when Italy tries to auction more than $9 billion in longer-term debt. The auction will be closely watched by investors and policymakers, who will be looking for signs of whether the recent improvement in market sentiment is sustainable.\n\nIn the meantime, the Italian and Spanish governments are under pressure to implement more austerity measures and structural reforms to reduce their debt levels and boost economic growth. The European Union has given the two countries until the end of the year to implement a series of reforms, including increasing the retirement age and reducing public sector employment.\n\nThe fate of the European Union's single currency, the euro, is also at stake. A credit crunch in Italy and Spain could have far-reaching consequences for the entire eurozone, including higher borrowing costs and a potential loss of confidence in the currency.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, investors and policymakers will be watching closely for signs of whether the recent improvement in market sentiment is sustainable, and whether the European Central Bank's efforts to ease credit conditions are enough to prevent a regional credit freeze.",

        "Text": "AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, called the blockbuster merger with Time Warner a \"vision deal\" that would allow AT&T to better compete with Silicon Valley giants. WASHINGTON -- AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, on Thursday attacked the Justice Department's lawsuit to block its merger with Time Warner, saying that a combined company would be no different from the Silicon Valley giants that make and distribute video content. As the last witness for the defense in the Justice Department's legal battle against AT&T's $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner, Mr. Stephenson portrayed the 140-year-old phone giant as being in an existential crisis and in need of the deal with Time Warner to compete against tech companies. He called the blockbuster merger a \"vision deal\" that would allow AT&T to better match up against Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google, which he referred to as \"F.A.A.N.G.\" \"The F.A.A.N.G. are all focused on premium video,\" Mr. Stephenson said, comparing the proposed merger to the businesses of tech giants. \"All of them are vertically integrated.\" The Justice Department sued to block the union of AT&T and Time Warner last November, saying it would hurt consumers who would likely see their monthly cable bills increase. Stephenson's testimony came as the Justice Department's lawyers wrapped up their case, presenting evidence that the merger would stifle competition and lead to higher prices for consumers. The government's lawyers argued that the deal would give AT&T too much control over the distribution of content, allowing it to favor its own programming over that of its competitors.\n\nBut Stephenson countered that the merger would actually increase competition, as AT&T would be able to offer a wider range of content to its customers. He pointed out that the company had already made significant investments in its streaming services, including DirecTV Now and HBO Go, and that the merger would allow it to offer even more options to consumers.\n\nThe Justice Department's lawsuit is the latest challenge to AT&T's plans to expand its media empire. The company has faced opposition from lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, who are concerned about the potential impact of the merger on competition and consumer choice.\n\nDespite the opposition, AT&T remains committed to the deal, and Stephenson made it clear that the company is willing to fight to make it happen. \"We're not going to let the government dictate the future of our company,\" he said. \"We're going to continue to innovate and compete, and we're going to make sure that our customers have access to the best content and services available.\"\n\nThe judge in the case, Richard Leon, is expected to issue a ruling in the coming weeks. If the merger is approved, it would mark a major milestone in the consolidation of the media industry, and would give AT&T a significant advantage over its rivals.\n\nThe deal has also sparked concerns about the potential impact on jobs and the media landscape. Some critics have argued that the merger would lead to layoffs and consolidation in the media industry, as AT&T seeks to cut costs and increase efficiency.\n\nBut Stephenson dismissed these concerns, saying that the company is committed to preserving jobs and investing in its media assets. \"We're not going to sacrifice quality for cost,\" he said. \"We're going to make sure that our customers continue to get the best content and services available, and that our employees continue to have the opportunity to innovate and grow.\"\n\nThe fate of the merger remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the battle over AT&T's deal with Time Warner is just beginning.",

        "Text": "Netflix went live with its streaming television service in nearly every country across the world on Wednesday, an unexpected acceleration of the company's aggressive quest for global ubiquity by the end of 2016. Yet one major region on Netflix's world map remains dark: China, home to nearly a quarter of the world's broadband households. And in many of the 190 countries where Netflix now is available -- including Turkey, Russia and Poland -- the service is available in English, but not the local language. \"We still have a lot of work to do,\" Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said in a telephone interview Wednesday afternoon. \"Because of the number of countries, it seems like we are ahead of plan. But we still have China -- we still have a quarter of the world to go.\" Mr. Hastings's cautious demeanor on the phone was in contrast to the more commanding pose he struck hours earlier when he announced at International CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, that Netflix had simultaneously added more than 130 countries to its world service map. \"Right now, you are witnessing the birth of a global TV network,\" Mr. Hastings said from the stage in a keynote address. A montage of global flags scrolled in the background followed by a map of the world emblazoned with the hashtag #netflixeverywhere. \"Whether you are in Sydney or St. Petersburg, Singapore or Seoul, Santiago or Saskatoon, you now can be part of the Internet TV revolution,\" Mr. Hastings added. The proclamation was a bold move from Netflix to address growing skepticism about whether it can sustain its breakneck expansion and deliver on its promises. Costs are running high for Netflix. In addition to its global rollout, the company plans to spend more than $6 billion in cash on programming in 2016, offering more than 600 hours of original series, films and other content. As Netflix embarks on its ambitious global expansion, the company is facing a mix of challenges and opportunities. While the addition of 130 countries to its service map is a significant milestone, the lack of availability in China, a market of over 600 million broadband households, remains a major concern.\n\nChina's strict internet regulations and censorship policies have long been a hurdle for foreign streaming services, including Netflix. The country's government has been slow to grant licenses to foreign companies, and even then, they are often subject to strict content guidelines.\n\nDespite these challenges, Netflix remains optimistic about its prospects in China. The company has been working to develop a localized content strategy, which includes partnering with Chinese production companies to create original content that appeals to local audiences.\n\n\"We believe that our global content strategy, combined with our ability to localize our service, will help us to succeed in China,\" said a Netflix spokesperson. \"We are committed to working with the Chinese government and local partners to bring our service to the Chinese market.\"\n\nIn addition to China, Netflix is also facing challenges in other regions, including Turkey, Russia, and Poland, where the service is available only in English. The company is working to add local language support to these markets, but the process is complex and time-consuming.\n\n\"We are working hard to add local language support to our service, but it's a challenging process,\" said the Netflix spokesperson. \"We need to ensure that our content is translated accurately and that our service meets the needs of local audiences.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Netflix's global expansion is seen as a major opportunity for the company. The streaming service has been growing rapidly in recent years, and its global reach is expected to accelerate this growth.\n\n\"Netflix's global expansion is a major milestone for the company,\" said a media analyst. \"It will allow Netflix to reach new audiences and increase its revenue potential. However, the company will need to navigate the challenges of entering new markets and ensuring that its service meets the needs of local audiences.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Netflix's global expansion is a significant milestone for the company, but it also presents a number of challenges. The company will need to navigate the complexities of entering new markets, including China, and ensure that its service meets the needs of local audiences. Despite these challenges, Netflix remains optimistic about its prospects and is committed to delivering its service to audiences around the world.",

        "Text": "In a shard of galactic archaeology that offers a less-than-inviting hint at our own future, astronomers have discovered a chunk of a former planet orbiting the remains of its former star, now a smoldering cinder known as a white dwarf. The fragment, made mostly of iron, nickel and other metals, lies 410 light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. It could be a mile, or hundreds of miles, in diameter, but to be dense enough to have survived the explosive demise and subsequent evolution of its host star, it likely was part of a large planet with a wider more distant orbit. Now it circles the white dwarf so closely that it completes an orbit every 123 minutes. \"The fact that we have discovered a body orbiting on a two-hour period is clear evidence that a planetary body can survive this destructive process,\" said Christopher Manser, a physicist at the University of Warwick in England, and the leader of an international team that reported their results in Science on Thursday. The discovery of the iron-rich fragment has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, sparking a flurry of questions about the potential for life to thrive in the face of catastrophic planetary destruction. According to Manser, the team's findings suggest that the fragment is likely the remnant of a large planet that was once home to a diverse range of ecosystems.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for our understanding of planetary evolution,\" said Manser. \"We've long known that stars like our own will eventually exhaust their fuel and explode, but we've never seen a planetary body survive the aftermath. This discovery opens up new possibilities for the search for life beyond Earth.\"\n\nThe team used a combination of observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft to identify the fragment and track its orbit around the white dwarf. The data revealed that the fragment is moving at a blistering pace, completing an orbit in just 123 minutes.\n\n\"This is incredibly fast for a planetary body,\" said Manser. \"It's a testament to the incredible forces at play in the aftermath of a star's death. The fragment is being pulled towards the white dwarf by its gravity, but it's also being flung away by the star's residual energy. It's a delicate balance that's allowing it to survive.\"\n\nThe discovery has also raised questions about the potential for other planetary bodies to have survived similar cataclysmic events in the distant past. Manser believes that it's possible that other fragments may be lurking in the cosmos, waiting to be discovered.\n\n\"We've only scratched the surface of what's out there,\" said Manser. \"There could be countless other fragments orbiting white dwarfs, or even other stars that have undergone similar transformations. The possibilities are endless, and we're excited to continue exploring the universe to uncover more secrets.\"\n\nAs the scientific community continues to study the fragment and its implications, the discovery has sparked a renewed sense of wonder and curiosity about the mysteries of the universe. For Manser and his team, the discovery is a reminder of the incredible complexity and beauty of the cosmos, and the endless possibilities that await us as we continue to explore and discover.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement sputtered forward on Tuesday as officials from the United States, Canada and Mexico concluded their second round of talks with plenty of pleasantries but little major progress to announce. After five days of discussions in Mexico City, trade negotiators from the three countries said they were encouraged by the talks' cooperative tenor and remained confident that they could reach a deal by the end of the year. \"I am pleased to report that we have found mutual agreement on many important issues,\" Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said during a briefing with reporters at the conclusion of the talks. \"Our work continues at a record pace.\" In a joint statement, Mr. Lighthizer and his counterparts -- Canada's foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, and Mexico's secretary of the economy, Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal -- said that they had hashed out new ideas and consolidated existing proposals into a single text that will be the basis for future negotiations. The third round of Nafta talks begins on Sept. 23 in Ottawa, Ontario. Despite their optimistic tone, however, there was no public discussion of the thorniest points of contention between the countries. The latest round of talks came as the Trump administration promised to upend America's trade agreements with the goal of creating better deals for domestic manufacturers. In recent days, Mr. Trump has threatened to withdraw from a trade pact with South Korea. And late last month, he laced into Canada and Mexico for being \"very difficult\" in the Nafta negotiations, offering a warning in a post on Twitter that he \"may have to terminate\" the agreement. The lack of concrete progress raises questions about whether the three countries will be able to rewrite Nafta this year, if at all. Despite the optimistic tone of the trade negotiators, the lack of concrete progress on key issues has raised concerns about the feasibility of rewriting Nafta by the end of the year. One of the main sticking points is the issue of labor standards, with the United States pushing for stronger protections for workers in Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe Trump administration has been critical of Mexico's labor laws, which it claims do not provide adequate protections for workers. The administration is seeking to include provisions in Nafta that would require Mexico to improve its labor standards and enforcement mechanisms. However, Mexico has resisted these demands, arguing that its labor laws are already in compliance with international standards.\n\nCanada, on the other hand, is concerned about the impact of Nafta on its dairy industry. The country has a protected dairy market, and the Trump administration has been pushing to open it up to more imports from the United States. Canada has been resistant to these demands, and the issue has become a major point of contention in the negotiations.\n\nAnother issue that remains unresolved is the dispute over the treatment of certain industries, such as the automotive and steel sectors. The United States has been seeking to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, citing concerns about unfair trade practices. However, Mexico and Canada have resisted these demands, arguing that they are not necessary and would harm their economies.\n\nDespite these challenges, the trade negotiators remain optimistic about the prospects for a new Nafta deal. They have agreed to continue talks in Ottawa, Ontario, and have set a deadline of the end of the year to conclude the negotiations.\n\nHowever, the lack of concrete progress has raised concerns about the feasibility of meeting this deadline. The Trump administration has a reputation for being unpredictable, and the uncertainty surrounding Nafta has created a sense of unease among businesses and investors.\n\nIn the meantime, the fate of Nafta remains uncertain. The agreement has been in place since 1994, and its renegotiation has been a complex and contentious process. While the trade negotiators remain optimistic, the lack of concrete progress has raised concerns about the prospects for a new deal.\n\nIn a statement, Chrystia Freeland, Canada's foreign affairs minister, said that the talks had been \"productive\" but that there was still much work to be done. \"We are committed to reaching a deal that works for all three countries,\" she said. \"We will continue to work tirelessly to achieve that goal.\"\n\nFor its part, the Mexican government has also expressed optimism about the prospects for a new Nafta deal. In a statement, Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, Mexico's secretary of the economy, said that the talks had been \"constructive\" and that Mexico was committed to reaching a deal that would benefit all three countries.\n\nThe fate of Nafta will likely be decided in the coming months. The trade negotiators will continue to meet and negotiate, and the outcome will depend on the ability of the three countries to reach a deal that works for all parties involved.",

Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, also said the government would go ahead with a ban on leaseholds on new-build houses first announced in July, and will force developers to cut controversial ground rents to zero for all new apartments and houses. The government will also write to all developers that have sold homes with \"onerous ground rent terms\" to ask them to provide \"necessary redress\". Taylor Woodrow has set aside Â£130m to assist leasehold buyers but other developers have steadfastly refused to pay any form of compensation. Javid said: \"It's unacceptable for homebuyers to be exploited through unnecessary leaseholds, unjustifiable charges and onerous ground rent terms. The government's announcement is a significant step towards addressing the long-standing issue of leasehold practices, which have been criticized for being unfair and exploitative. The new rules are expected to benefit thousands of homeowners who have been trapped in leasehold agreements with onerous conditions, including sky-high ground rents and hefty fees for minor repairs.\n\nThe ban on leaseholds on new-build houses is a major victory for campaigners who have been fighting for reform. The practice of selling new homes with leaseholds has been widely criticized, as it can leave homeowners with little control over their property and exposed to costly and unpredictable charges.\n\nThe government's decision to force developers to cut ground rents to zero for all new apartments and houses is also a significant move. Ground rents, which are typically paid to the freeholder, can add thousands of pounds to the cost of owning a home. The abolition of ground rents will provide significant relief to homeowners and help to make property ownership more affordable.\n\nHowever, the government's announcement has also sparked concerns about the potential impact on the property market. Some industry experts have warned that the abolition of leaseholds and ground rents could lead to a surge in property values, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.\n\nDespite these concerns, the government is pressing ahead with its plans, which are expected to come into effect in the coming months. The Department for Communities and Local Government has announced that it will be working closely with developers and industry stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition to the new system.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by campaigners and homeowners who have been affected by leasehold practices. \"This is a major victory for leaseholders and a significant step towards ending the exploitation of homebuyers,\" said Peter Bolton-King, chief executive of the National Leasehold Campaign. \"We look forward to seeing the government's plans come into effect and to seeing the positive impact they will have on homeowners across the country.\"\n\nThe government's announcement is also expected to have significant implications for the property industry, which has long been criticized for its role in perpetuating leasehold practices. The industry has been accused of prioritizing profits over the needs of homeowners, and the government's decision to ban leaseholds and ground rents is seen as a major blow to its business model.\n\nIn conclusion, the government's announcement is a significant step towards addressing the issue of leasehold practices and providing relief to homeowners who have been affected by these practices. While there are concerns about the potential impact on the property market, the government's decision is expected to have a positive impact on homeowners and help to make property ownership more affordable.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- Britain operates one of the largest welfare states in Europe. And that, it seems, is just fine with many of the British. Despite the worst recession since World War II, many people here show little appetite for shrinking a system that eats up half the nation's economic output, more than in Portugal, Greece or Spain -- all of which are trying to push through painful cuts. However, not everyone in Britain is content with the status quo. A growing chorus of economists, politicians, and business leaders is warning that the country's welfare state is unsustainable and is hindering economic growth.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the UK's welfare spending has increased by 15% since the 2008 financial crisis, while the economy has grown by only 5%. This has led to a significant increase in the national debt, which now stands at over Â£1.8 trillion.\n\n\"The welfare state is a vital safety net for many people, but it's not sustainable in its current form,\" said Dr. Robert Chote, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. \"The UK needs to find a way to make its welfare system more efficient and targeted, rather than just throwing more money at it.\"\n\nThe debate over the welfare state is particularly sensitive in the UK, where the system is seen as a cornerstone of the country's social fabric. Many Britons view the welfare state as a symbol of fairness and equality, and are reluctant to see it reduced or reformed.\n\nHowever, some argue that the current system is not only unsustainable but also inefficient. A recent study by the think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, found that 20% of welfare spending goes towards benefits that are not actually needed or are being misused.\n\n\"The welfare state is a complex system, and it's not surprising that there are inefficiencies and mistakes,\" said Dr. Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies. \"But what's really worrying is that the system is not being properly monitored or audited, and there's a lack of transparency and accountability.\"\n\nThe debate over the welfare state is likely to continue in the coming months, as the UK government prepares to announce its budget for the next financial year. While some are calling for significant cuts to the welfare system, others are arguing that the focus should be on finding ways to make the system more efficient and targeted.\n\nFor now, it remains to be seen how the UK will balance its desire to maintain its welfare state with the need to address its growing national debt and economic challenges. One thing is certain, however: the debate over the welfare state is far from over, and will continue to be a major issue in British politics for the foreseeable future.",

        "Text": "Wall Street is going vegan. At some point in the next four weeks, Beyond Meat, a pioneering plant-based meat alternative startup, will debut on Wall Street at a valuation of about $1.2bn. And in the meantime its rivals are cutting deals with some of the biggest names in food. Beyond Meat is the latest in a series of \"unicorns\" â€“ private companies valued at over $1bn â€“ to go public. And this one is edible. The company, based in El Segundo, California, was founded 10 years ago by tech entrepreneur Ethan Brown. It found early backing from legendary Silicon Valley financiers Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers â€“ and later from Bill Gates and Leonardo DiCaprio â€“ before it brought its first product, a chicken-free \"chicken\", to market in 2013. Now the company is going public, at a pivotal moment for meat-like products created from plant-based protein, mainly yellow peas, which are being used to create a new wave of burgers (which actually \"bleed\" with beet juice), together with poultry and sausage substitutes that taste far closer to the real thing than their predecessors. The benefits of eating less meat from both ethical, environmental and health standpoints, have never been greater. And the business community has spied the potential for big profits. Two weeks ago, Beyond Meat's main competitor, Impossible Foods, launched a meatless Whopper at Burger King, and the fast-food chain Del Taco announced the development of a meatless taco. The surge in popularity of plant-based meat alternatives has been swift and significant, with many major food chains and retailers jumping on the bandwagon. According to a recent report by Euromonitor International, the global plant-based meat market is expected to grow by 14% annually between 2020 and 2025, driven by increasing consumer demand for healthier and more sustainable food options.\n\nBeyond Meat's success is a testament to the growing appetite for plant-based protein sources. The company's products, which include burgers, sausages, and ground \"beef\", are made from a combination of plant-based ingredients, including yellow peas, rice, and potato starch. The company's proprietary technology allows it to mimic the taste and texture of traditional meat, making it a popular choice for health-conscious consumers and environmentally aware individuals.\n\nThe company's decision to go public comes at a time when the plant-based meat market is experiencing unprecedented growth. In addition to Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, other companies such as Quorn and Tofurky are also gaining traction in the market. The trend is not limited to food companies, with major retailers such as Walmart and Kroger also investing in plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nBeyond Meat's IPO is expected to be one of the most highly anticipated in recent years, with many investors eager to get in on the ground floor of the plant-based meat revolution. The company's valuation of $1.2 billion is a testament to its success and potential for future growth. With the company's products already available in major retailers such as Whole Foods and Kroger, and its partnership with major food chains such as Burger King and Del Taco, the company is well-positioned for continued success in the years to come.\n\nIn addition to its financial success, Beyond Meat has also made a significant impact on the environment. The company's plant-based meat alternatives require significantly less water and land to produce than traditional meat, making them a more sustainable option for consumers. The company has also committed to reducing its carbon footprint, with plans to power its operations with 100% renewable energy.\n\nAs Beyond Meat prepares to debut on Wall Street, the company is poised to become one of the most successful plant-based food companies in the world. With its innovative products, commitment to sustainability, and strong financial performance, the company is well-positioned to continue to lead the charge in the plant-based meat revolution.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- President Trump's trade war with China is about to hit home for many consumers. On Thursday, the administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on another $16 billion worth of Chinese products, bringing the total so far to $50 billion. Officials are now weighing a 25 percent tariff on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, including materials used in many of the consumer products that were spared in the first round. Nearly 400 companies, trade groups and others descended on Washington this week to testify at six days of hearings before the United States trade representative. While some have spoken out in support of the tariffs, a majority of those testifying are opposed and trying to persuade American officials not to tax the Chinese products or materials they depend on. They warn the tariffs could force them to raise prices and potentially destroy their businesses. Whether you're a college student, a parent, an entrepreneur, an outdoor enthusiast or a retiree, the tariffs could ultimately affect the products you covet. \"With operations at this scale we anticipate that the proposed tariffs, if approved at a rate of 25 percent, would result in Trek paying an additional $30 million in tariffs each year. Trek will be forced to pass these costs on to the consumer, raising prices on adult bicycles, kids' bicycles, components and key bicycle safety equipment like helmets.\" No matter your brand preference, the bike you buy in America is most likely made in part or sourced entirely in China. \"Implementing a tariff on our products will not bring jobs to the U.S.A. As the hearings drew to a close, the concerns of the business community were echoed by experts in various industries. Dr. Jane Smith, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, testified that the tariffs would have a ripple effect on the entire economy. \"The tariffs will not only increase prices for consumers but also lead to job losses and a decline in economic growth,\" she said. \"The administration's assertion that the tariffs will bring jobs back to the US is unfounded and ignores the complexities of global supply chains.\"\n\nThe opposition to the tariffs was not limited to the business community. Environmental groups also expressed concerns about the potential impact on the production of renewable energy technologies. \"The tariffs will make it more difficult for us to source critical components from China, which could slow down the transition to clean energy,\" said John Doe, executive director of the Renewable Energy Association.\n\nAs the debate surrounding the tariffs continues, consumers are left wondering what it means for them. For many, the impact will be felt in their wallets. \"I'm a college student, and I rely on affordable electronics and gadgets to stay connected with my friends and family,\" said Sarah Johnson, a junior at the University of Washington. \"If prices go up, I'll have to make some tough choices about what I can and can't afford.\"\n\nThe tariffs have also sparked concerns about the potential for retaliation from China. The country has already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of US goods, including soybeans, corn, and pork. \"We're already seeing the effects of the tariffs in our farm community,\" said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA). \"The administration needs to consider the long-term consequences of this trade war and find a more balanced approach.\"\n\nAs the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how the administration will respond to the concerns of the business community and consumers. One thing is certain, however: the trade war with China is far from over, and its impact will be felt for a long time to come.",

        "Text": "When population was growing at its fastest rate in human history in the decades after World War II, the sense that overpopulation was stunting economic development and stoking political instability took hold from New Delhi to the United Nations' headquarters in New York, sending policy makers on an urgent quest to stop it. In the 1970s the Indian government forcibly sterilized millions of women. Families in Bangladesh, Indonesia and elsewhere were forced to have fewer children. In 1974, the United Nations organized its first World Population Conference to debate population control. China rolled out its one-child policy in 1980. Then, almost as suddenly as it had begun, the demographic \"crisis\" was over. As fertility rates in most of the world dropped to around the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman -- with the one major exception of sub-Saharan Africa -- population specialists and politicians turned to other issues. By 1994, when the U.N. held its last population conference, in Cairo, demographic targets had pretty much been abandoned, replaced by an agenda centered on empowering women, reducing infant mortality and increasing access to reproductive health. \"Some people still regret that; some applaud it,\" said Joel E. Cohen, who heads the Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University in New York. \"I'm not sure we need demographic goals but we need forward thinking.\" The shift in focus from population control to empowering women and improving reproductive health was a significant turning point in the global conversation around population dynamics. According to Dr. Cohen, the change was driven by a growing understanding that population growth was not the only, or even the most important, factor influencing economic development and social stability.\n\n\"One of the key lessons we learned is that population growth is not a standalone issue,\" Dr. Cohen explained. \"It's deeply intertwined with issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. By focusing on empowering women and improving reproductive health, we can actually address the root causes of population growth and create more sustainable, equitable societies.\"\n\nThe Cairo conference in 1994 marked a significant milestone in this shift, as world leaders and experts came together to prioritize the health and well-being of women and girls. The conference resulted in the Programme of Action, a comprehensive plan aimed at reducing maternal mortality, increasing access to education and employment for women, and promoting reproductive health and rights.\n\nSince then, significant progress has been made in many parts of the world. According to the United Nations, the number of women dying in childbirth has decreased by more than 40% since 1990, and the number of children under the age of five dying from preventable causes has decreased by more than 50%. Additionally, more women are entering the workforce and participating in decision-making processes, leading to greater economic and social empowerment.\n\nHowever, despite these gains, significant challenges remain, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where fertility rates remain high and access to reproductive health services is limited. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 200 million women in developing countries still lack access to modern contraception, and many more face barriers to seeking reproductive health care.\n\nAs the global population continues to grow, experts like Dr. Cohen emphasize the need for continued forward thinking and innovative solutions to address the complex interplay between population growth, economic development, and social stability. \"We need to be proactive and strategic in our approach, recognizing that population growth is not a problem to be solved, but rather an opportunity to be leveraged,\" Dr. Cohen said. \"By empowering women, improving reproductive health, and promoting sustainable development, we can create a more equitable, prosperous, and peaceful world for all.\"",

Liz Day, a senior story editor for The Times's new television show, \"The Weekly,\" discussed the tech she's using. \"The Weekly\" is something new that's coming from The Times. What should we know about it? It's The Times's most ambitious TV project ever: a 30-minute documentary show, premiering in June, that will air on FX on Sunday nights and then stream on Hulu. We're taking great reporting from the Times newsroom and bringing it to TV for a new audience. You should tune in. You've also worked at ProPublica and \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.\" What kind of tech did you use in those workplaces? At ProPublica, we used databases like LexisNexis Public Records for people-finding, Pacer for federal court records and Factiva for news clips. Because investigative reporters are often looking for those who don't want to be found, we'd also keep an eye out for weird sites that promised to unearth off-the-grid cellphone numbers or scrape the deep web. ProPublica has a wonderful open-source culture devoted to the public interest. Anytime they got their hands on unruly government data, the talented folks there would build an app to make access easy. Thanks to them, you can look up your doctor to see how much money he or she gets from drug companies. When I joined \"Last Week Tonight,\" I discovered a whole new world of video that I hadn't known existed. Did you know there's a database where you can search all of President Trump's video appearances, including a vlog he kept from 2011 to 2014? As a TV producer, I was fascinated by the vast array of video content available. The show's creators would often use these databases to find unique and obscure footage to use in their segments. One of the most impressive databases I encountered was the Internet Archive, which has a vast collection of videos, including old news broadcasts and public domain films.\n\nThe show's writers would often use these archives to find historical footage to illustrate a point or add context to a story. For example, they might use a clip from an old news broadcast to show how a particular issue was reported on in the past. The Internet Archive also has a vast collection of music and audio recordings, which the show's composers would use to create custom soundtracks.\n\nIn addition to these databases, the \"Last Week Tonight\" team also used a range of video editing software to create their segments. They would often use Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro to edit their videos, and would also use plugins like DaVinci Resolve to color grade and add effects to their footage.\n\nAs someone who has worked on both TV and digital projects, I can attest to the fact that the technology used in each medium can be quite different. When working on digital projects, I often use a range of tools like WordPress and Medium to create and publish content. I also use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to promote my work and engage with my audience.\n\nHowever, when working on TV projects, the technology is often more specialized and requires a different set of skills. For example, TV producers need to have a good understanding of broadcast standards and formats, as well as the ability to work with large files and complex video editing software.\n\nDespite these differences, I believe that the skills and knowledge I gained from working on TV projects have been invaluable in my digital work. For example, my experience working on TV has given me a strong understanding of storytelling and pacing, which has helped me to create more engaging and effective digital content.\n\nIn conclusion, as a TV producer, I have had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies and tools that have helped me to create engaging and informative content. From databases and video editing software to social media platforms and online publishing tools, I believe that technology has the power to enhance and transform the way we tell stories and communicate with our audience.",

Henpecked son Melvyn will now be approaching retirement (and, boy, did he earn it). Meanwhile, grandson Anthony, whom we last heard of when grandma was memorably making light of his woeful exam performance, should now be in the prime of his career after shrugging off the initial disappointment of only attaining passes in pottery (\"Anthony, people will always need plates\") and sociology (\"he gets an 'ology' and he says he's failed!\"). At least, that's how the Bellmans' future would have been envisaged back in the late 1980s, when the family hogged our television ad breaks. The problem is that the retirement plans of both Melvyn and Anthony are now in danger of needing a considerable rethink. This is the case for employees of a number of major firms across the country â€“ but, fittingly, BT Group is among them. The news that BT Group, the very company that made Beattie Bellman a household name, is facing a major restructuring effort has sent shockwaves throughout the industry. The telecommunications giant has announced plans to cut thousands of jobs, citing a need to adapt to the rapidly changing market and reduce costs.\n\nFor Melvyn Bellman, this news is particularly concerning. As he approaches retirement, he had been counting on a comfortable nest egg to support his golden years. However, with the uncertainty surrounding his job security, he may be forced to rethink his plans. \"I've worked for BT for over three decades,\" he said in an interview. \"I've seen a lot of changes, but this is different. I'm not sure what the future holds, and it's unsettling.\"\n\nAnthony Bellman, on the other hand, is facing a different set of challenges. As a young professional, he had been building a successful career in a field related to his sociology degree. However, with the restructuring efforts, he may be forced to consider a career change or look for new opportunities outside of the company. \"It's tough to see the company I grew up with going through this,\" he said. \"I'm just trying to stay positive and focus on my future.\"\n\nThe news has also raised concerns about the impact on the Bellman family's legacy. Beattie, the lovable but feisty matriarch, had become an iconic figure in British advertising. Her character's witty one-liners and humorous banter had made her a beloved figure in many households. However, as the company undergoes significant changes, it's unclear what the future holds for her character and the legacy she left behind.\n\nAs the dust settles, one thing is clear: the Bellman family's future is uncertain, and their plans for retirement and career advancement are now in jeopardy. The news serves as a reminder that even the most iconic and beloved brands are not immune to the challenges of the modern business world.",

        "Text": "The Bank of England has told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risk fresh action against reckless lending as it warned of a looming \"spiral of complacency\" about mounting consumer debt. In its toughest warning yet about the possibility of a rerun of the financial crisis that devastated the economy 10 years ago, Threadneedle Street admitted it was alarmed about the increase in the amount of money being borrowed on easy terms over the past year. \"Household debt â€“ like most things that are good in moderation â€“ can be dangerous in excess\", Alex Brazier, the Bank director for financial stability, said in a speech in Liverpool. The Bank of England's warning comes as consumer debt in the UK has reached a record high, with the total amount of debt owed by households exceeding Â£1.7 trillion. The majority of this debt is made up of mortgages, credit card debt, and personal loans.\n\nThe Bank's concerns are centered around the rapid growth of consumer credit, particularly in the form of credit card debt and car loans. Brazier warned that if left unchecked, this trend could lead to a \"spiral of complacency\" among lenders, who may become too relaxed about the risks associated with lending to households.\n\n\"The problem is that many lenders are not taking sufficient account of the risks they are taking on,\" Brazier said. \"They are not doing enough to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers, and they are not setting aside enough capital to cover potential losses. This is a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nThe Bank's warning has sparked concerns among consumer groups, who fear that the increasing debt levels could have serious consequences for households. \"The Bank's warning is a stark reminder of the dangers of reckless lending,\" said a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy group, Which?. \"We urge lenders to take a more responsible approach to lending and to prioritize the financial well-being of their customers.\"\n\nThe Bank's concerns are also echoed by some economists, who warn that the increasing debt levels could have a negative impact on the broader economy. \"The rapid growth of consumer debt is a major concern,\" said Dr. Simon Wren-Lewis, an economist at the University of Oxford. \"If households become over-extended, it could lead to a decline in consumer spending, which would have a negative impact on economic growth.\"\n\nThe Bank of England's warning comes as the UK government is under pressure to take action to address the issue of consumer debt. The government has announced plans to introduce new regulations to improve the transparency of credit agreements and to make it easier for consumers to switch lenders.\n\nIn response to the Bank's warning, the UK's largest banks and lenders have pledged to take a more responsible approach to lending. \"We take the Bank's warning very seriously,\" said a spokesperson for Barclays Bank. \"We are committed to lending responsibly and to supporting our customers in managing their debt.\"\n\nThe Bank of England's warning is a timely reminder of the importance of responsible lending and borrowing. As the UK economy continues to grow, it is crucial that households and lenders alike take a more cautious approach to debt. The consequences of reckless lending could be severe, and it is up to all parties involved to take action to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A British security researcher, who became an internet hero after he was credited with stopping a malicious software attack this year, was arrested at the Las Vegas airport and charged in connection with a separate attack. Marcus Hutchins, the researcher, was widely praised for identifying a way to disable the WannaCry malicious software, or malware, attack that seized hundreds of thousands of computers this year. Researchers credited Mr. Hutchins's discovery of a so-called kill switch in the malware for stopping its spread and preventing the attack from infecting millions more computers. According to an indictment filed in federal court in Milwaukee that was unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Hutchins, 23, and an unidentified accomplice conspired to create and sell malware intended to steal login information and other financial data from online banking sites. The indictment alleges that Hutchins and his accomplice, who remains at large, created and distributed a type of malware known as Kronos, which was designed to steal login credentials, credit card numbers, and other sensitive financial information from online banking customers. The malware was allegedly sold to cybercriminals through dark web marketplaces.\n\nAccording to court documents, Hutchins and his accomplice used the stolen information to withdraw cash from infected victims' accounts, as well as to make fraudulent purchases online. The indictment charges Hutchins with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.\n\nHutchins's arrest has sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity community, with many experts expressing surprise and disappointment at the news. \"Marcus Hutchins was a hero in the eyes of many in the cybersecurity community for his role in stopping the WannaCry attack,\" said cybersecurity expert, Bruce Schneier. \"It's difficult to reconcile the person who saved millions of computers from destruction with the allegations in this indictment.\"\n\nHutchins's lawyer, Marc Zwillinger, released a statement denying the allegations and saying that his client is innocent. \"Marcus Hutchins is a brilliant young man who has made significant contributions to the field of cybersecurity,\" Zwillinger said. \"We are confident that he will be exonerated and cleared of these charges.\"\n\nThe FBI arrested Hutchins at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas on August 2, as he was about to board a flight to London. He is currently being held in custody pending a detention hearing, which is scheduled for later this month.\n\nThe case against Hutchins is being prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section. If convicted, Hutchins faces up to 20 years in prison for each count of conspiracy, as well as fines and restitution to victims of the alleged malware attacks.\n\nAs the investigation continues, cybersecurity experts are left to wonder how someone who was once hailed as a hero could be accused of such serious crimes. The case serves as a reminder that even those who work to protect us from cyber threats can sometimes find themselves on the wrong side of the law.",

About 50,000 holidaymakers are stranded in Greece, 21,000 in Turkey, 15,000 in Cyprus and 4,500 in Tunisia. Thousands of tourists are also stuck in the US and dozens of other countries. Most of the tourists are from the UK with an estimated 150,000 people, followed by Germany with about 140,000 holidaymakers. Many of Thomas Cook's German subsidiaries have stopped trading, but at present the group's German airline, Condor, is still operating. About 240,000 people are booked to return home on Condor flights, but the airline will not carry those who booked their trips via Thomas Cook. The situation in Germany could get worse if Condor fails in its attempt to secure a â‚¬200m (Â£176m) bridging loan from the German government. Melisa RodrÃ­guez, a Spanish politician and representative for Tenerife, said the collapse of Thomas Cook could hit the Spanish economy and the Canary Islands in particular. As the repatriation efforts continue, governments are scrambling to provide assistance to the stranded tourists, many of whom are facing financial and logistical challenges. In the UK, the government has set up a dedicated hotline for Thomas Cook customers, while the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is working to arrange flights to bring people home.\n\nMeanwhile, the economic impact of Thomas Cook's collapse is beginning to unfold. The company's demise is expected to have a significant impact on local economies, particularly in destinations that were heavily reliant on Thomas Cook's business. In Greece, for example, the tourism industry is estimated to have lost millions of euros in revenue due to the collapse.\n\nThe situation is also having a ripple effect on other industries, such as travel agencies and tour operators. Many of these businesses had contracts with Thomas Cook and are now facing financial uncertainty. In Germany, the country's largest travel agency, TUI, has announced that it will be absorbing some of Thomas Cook's German subsidiaries, but it is unclear what this will mean for the thousands of employees who worked for the company.\n\nAs the fallout from Thomas Cook's collapse continues to unfold, experts are warning of a potential domino effect on the global travel industry. The company's demise is a stark reminder of the risks involved in the travel business, and the need for companies to be prepared for unexpected events.\n\nIn the Canary Islands, which were a popular destination for Thomas Cook customers, the local government is bracing for the impact of the collapse. The islands' economy is heavily reliant on tourism, and the loss of Thomas Cook's business is expected to have a significant impact on local businesses and residents.\n\nThe collapse of Thomas Cook is also having a human impact, with many employees and customers left feeling stranded and uncertain about their futures. The company's demise has sparked widespread criticism of its management and leadership, with many calling for greater accountability and transparency in the wake of the collapse.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the collapse of Thomas Cook is a major blow to the global travel industry, and its impact will be felt for months to come.",

        "Text": "Sleigh Bells, an indie rock band, has filed a copyright infringement suit against Demi Lovato, accusing the pop star of stealing, at the very least, the beat of one of its songs. \"The sonic qualities of portions of 'Infinity Guitars' and 'Stars' are at least substantially similar,\" reads Sleigh Bells's complaint, filed in a California court on Monday. \"Stars\" was released by Ms. Lovato. While the producers of Ms. Lovato's song have denied the claims, she joins a growing list of musicians accused of plagiarism, including Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and members of Led Zeppelin. In response to these cases, Dolly Parton, a renowned country musician, described a creative process that some psychologists might refer to more formally as cryptomnesia. \"You don't set out to try and steal anything, but it can happen,\" Ms. Parton said in an interview with the BBC last week. \"Especially in music, because there's so much of it. If you write all the time, you're going to collect those things and not know it.\" Cryptomnesia occurs when someone claims to have had an original thought (or in the case of a song, a melody or beat) but actually encountered the notion or sound earlier and forgot about it. To different degrees, we have all been guilty of cryptomnesia. And in a world flooded with information, we are especially prone to forgetting where ideas originated. Perhaps you tell a friend, \"Hey, I have an idea, let's go to this new restaurant for dinner.\" And then your friend says, \"Yeah ... I said we should do that a week ago.\" You might be certain the idea was yours, when in reality, you had a lapse in memory, said Amanda C. Gingerich, an associate professor of psychology at Butler University. The phenomenon of cryptomnesia has been studied extensively in the field of psychology, and experts agree that it is a common occurrence. \"Cryptomnesia can happen to anyone, regardless of their profession or creative abilities,\" said Dr. Gingerich. \"It's a natural part of the human brain's processing and storage of information.\"\n\nIn the context of music, cryptomnesia can be particularly problematic. With the vast amount of music being produced and consumed daily, it's easy to absorb and forget melodies, rhythms, and beats. \"As a songwriter, you're constantly exposed to new music, and it's natural to be influenced by what you hear,\" said Ms. Parton. \"But the key is to be aware of those influences and give credit where credit is due.\"\n\nThe case of Sleigh Bells vs. Demi Lovato highlights the importance of intellectual property protection in the music industry. \"Copyright laws are in place to protect the creative work of artists and songwriters,\" said music industry expert, Michael Levine. \"While it's possible that Demi Lovato may have unintentionally borrowed from Sleigh Bells' song, it's the responsibility of the artist to ensure that their work is original and not infringing on others.\"\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Sleigh Bells against Demi Lovato is just the latest in a string of high-profile cases of alleged plagiarism in the music industry. In recent years, Ed Sheeran has been accused of borrowing from Marvin Gaye's song \"Let's Get It On,\" while Sam Smith has faced similar claims over their hit song \"Stay With Me.\" Even legendary rock band Led Zeppelin has been accused of stealing from Spirit's song \"Taurus.\"\n\nDespite the prevalence of cryptomnesia, experts agree that it's not an excuse for plagiarism. \"While it's possible that someone may have unintentionally borrowed from another artist, it's still important to acknowledge the original work and give credit where credit is due,\" said Dr. Gingerich. \"In the end, it's about respecting the creative work of others and upholding the principles of intellectual property protection.\"\n\nAs the music industry continues to evolve and new artists emerge, the issue of plagiarism and cryptomnesia is likely to remain a topic of discussion. However, by acknowledging the phenomenon and taking steps to protect intellectual property, artists and songwriters can ensure that their work is respected and recognized.",

        "Text": "Google and the University of Chicago Are Sued Over Data Sharing\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- When the University of Chicago Medical Center announced a partnership to share patient data with Google in 2017, the alliance was promoted as a way to unlock information trapped in electronic health records and improve predictive analysis in medicine. On Wednesday, the University of Chicago, the medical center and Google were sued in a potential class-action lawsuit accusing the hospital of sharing hundreds of thousands of patients' records with the technology giant without stripping identifiable date stamps or doctor's notes. The suit, filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, demonstrates the difficulties technology companies face in handling health data as they forge ahead into one of the most promising -- and potentially lucrative -- areas of artificial intelligence: diagnosing medical problems. Google is at the forefront of an effort to build technology that can read electronic health records and help physicians identify medical conditions. But the effort requires machines to learn this skill by analyzing a vast array of old health records collected by hospitals and other medical institutions. That raises privacy concerns, especially when is used by a company like Google, which already knows what you search for, where you are and what interests you hold. In 2016, DeepMind, a London-based A.I. lab owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, was accused of violating patient privacy after it struck a deal with Britain's National Health Service to process medical data for research. The lawsuit, filed by a group of patients who claim to have been affected by the data sharing, alleges that the University of Chicago Medical Center and Google failed to properly anonymize the patient data, making it possible to identify individuals through the inclusion of date stamps and doctor's notes. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and an injunction to stop the continued sharing of the data.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the University of Chicago Medical Center and Google entered into a partnership in 2017 to create a platform that would allow for the sharing of patient data with the goal of improving medical research and treatment. As part of this partnership, the hospital transferred hundreds of thousands of patient records to Google, including sensitive information such as medical diagnoses, prescriptions, and test results.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the data sharing was done without the proper consent of the patients, and that the hospital and Google failed to take adequate measures to protect the privacy of the individuals whose data was shared. The plaintiffs argue that the inclusion of date stamps and doctor's notes in the data makes it possible to identify individuals, and that this information could be used to discriminate against patients or to market medical products and services.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest in a series of high-profile cases involving the sharing of patient data and the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of hospitals and healthcare systems sharing patient data with technology companies without proper consent, and of AI systems being used to analyze and make decisions about patient care without adequate oversight.\n\nThe University of Chicago Medical Center and Google have not commented on the lawsuit, but the hospital has previously stated that it takes the privacy and security of patient data seriously and has implemented measures to protect it. Google has also faced criticism for its handling of patient data in the past, including a 2016 incident in which the company was accused of violating patient privacy after it struck a deal with Britain's National Health Service to process medical data for research.\n\nThe lawsuit is a reminder of the importance of protecting patient privacy in the age of artificial intelligence and big data. As technology continues to play a larger role in healthcare, it is essential that patients are informed and consent to the sharing of their data, and that healthcare providers and technology companies take adequate measures to protect it.",

        "Text": "Earth is continuously plowing through extraterrestrial dust. Tens of thousands of tons of the stuff, mostly from asteroids and comets, settles all over the planet every year. We are the shoulder to a universe of dandruff. But even the faintest detritus has a story to tell. Recently, scientists analyzed dust collected from Antarctic snow and found an excess of radioactive iron. After ruling out contamination from nuclear weapons testing and other sources, the team concluded that the iron was produced by supernovas, fleeting explosions of stars more massive than the sun. This discovery suggests that stellar blasts might have rocked Earth and the rest of the solar system in the not-too-distant past. The results were published on Aug. 12 in Physical Review Letters. Meteorite hunters are drawn to Antarctica because the space rocks, which are dark, stand out against the snow. Dominik Koll, a doctoral candidate in nuclear physics at the Australian National University in Canberra, appreciates Antarctica for other reasons: its remote location and desert climate, which ensure that whatever extraterrestrial dust falls from the sky remains relatively uncontaminated and undiluted. In 2015, a colleague of Mr. Koll's collected roughly 1,100 pounds of snow near Kohnen Station in Antarctica. The snow, which had fallen within the past 20 years, was shipped to Germany, where it was melted and filtered. The researchers then analyzed the filtered snow sample, searching for any signs of radioactive isotopes. To their surprise, they found an abundance of radioactive iron-60, a rare isotope that is not typically found on Earth. The team was able to rule out any contamination from nuclear weapons testing or other human activities, as the iron-60 was present in a specific ratio that is characteristic of supernovas.\n\n\"This is a really exciting discovery,\" said Dr. Koll, who led the research team. \"The presence of iron-60 in the Antarctic snow suggests that a supernova exploded relatively recently, within the past few million years. This is significant because it means that the solar system has been affected by these powerful stellar explosions more recently than we previously thought.\"\n\nThe researchers used computer simulations to model the trajectory of the supernova's debris and determine that it likely originated from a star that exploded in the Milky Way galaxy. They also found that the iron-60 was likely deposited on Earth during a period of intense solar activity, which would have made it more likely for the particles to survive their journey through the atmosphere.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the solar system's history. Supernovas are known to release large amounts of heavy elements, including iron, into space. These elements can then be incorporated into new stars and planets, influencing the formation of our solar system.\n\n\"This finding suggests that the solar system has been shaped by supernovas more recently than we thought,\" said Dr. Koll. \"It's a reminder that our solar system is still connected to the rest of the universe, and that we can learn a lot about our own history by studying the extraterrestrial dust that falls on our planet.\"\n\nThe research team is now planning to conduct further analysis of the Antarctic snow sample to see if they can find any other clues about the supernova's origins. They are also exploring the possibility of using similar techniques to study other extraterrestrial dust deposits around the world.\n\nThe discovery of iron-60 in Antarctic snow is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary research, combining expertise in nuclear physics, astronomy, and geology to uncover new insights into the history of our solar system. As scientists continue to study the extraterrestrial dust that falls on our planet, they may uncover even more surprises about the universe and our place within it.",

        "Text": "'Access to Literacy' Is Not a Constitutional Right, Judge in Detroit Rules\n\nDo students at poorly performing schools have a constitutional right to a better education? On Friday, a Federal District Court judge in Michigan decided that they did not when he dismissed a class-action lawsuit filed by students at troubled schools in Detroit. The suit, filed in September 2016, argued that students at some of the city's most underperforming schools -- serving mostly racial minorities -- had been denied \"access to literacy\" because of underfunding, mismanagement and discrimination. The judge's ruling, which was met with disappointment from advocates for the students, stated that while the plaintiffs had demonstrated that the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) had failed to provide an adequate education, they had not shown that this failure was a result of intentional discrimination or a violation of their constitutional rights.\n\nU.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood wrote in her opinion that while the students had been harmed by the district's failures, \"the mere fact that a school district is underfunded or mismanaged does not necessarily rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of approximately 15,000 students, sought to address the chronic issues plaguing the Detroit Public Schools, including crumbling infrastructure, outdated textbooks, and a lack of qualified teachers. The plaintiffs argued that these conditions had resulted in a denial of their right to access literacy, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDespite the judge's ruling, advocates for the students vowed to continue fighting for their right to a quality education. \"Today's decision is a setback, but it is not the end of the road,\" said Mark Rosenbaum, a lawyer with the Public Interest Law Center, which represented the students. \"We will continue to push for systemic change and to hold accountable those who have failed to provide our children with the education they deserve.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was seen as a major test of the constitutionality of the right to education, and its dismissal has significant implications for students across the country who attend underperforming schools. While the ruling does not necessarily preclude future lawsuits, it sets a high bar for plaintiffs seeking to establish a constitutional right to a better education.\n\nIn the meantime, the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan are working to address the systemic issues plaguing the public school system. A state-appointed emergency manager has been overseeing the district since 2011, and efforts are underway to improve teacher training, increase funding, and revamp the district's curriculum.\n\nFor students at the affected schools, the ruling is a disappointment, but they remain hopeful that their voices will be heard and their rights will be protected. \"We deserve better,\" said 12-year-old Destiny Johnson, a student at one of the affected schools. \"We deserve to learn in a safe and supportive environment, and we deserve to have the same opportunities as other kids.\"",

Miriam Jordan, a national immigration correspondent based in Los Angeles, discussed the tech she's using. What tech tools do you use most on the job? My Lenovo laptop, printer and iPhone are the main tools of my trade. And I use the Voice Memos app exclusively to record news conferences. But let me step back. While technology is great, there's no substitute for building a rapport with someone, especially as an immigration reporter. I prefer face-to-face conversations, whenever possible. Because I am frequently in the field talking to Spanish speakers in sometimes precarious situations, I find that just jotting down what people say in a notebook is more discreet than using the Notes app or recording a conversation. There is a formality inherent in recording that I feel inhibits folks from speaking freely, and many of the people I interview are undocumented. Keeping a record of what they tell me in a device makes them worry about being exposed to immigration authorities, especially in the current political climate. You travel a lot for work then. What gadgets help with that? As a national immigration correspondent, Miriam Jordan's work takes her to various parts of the country, often to remote or underserved areas where technology can be limited. To stay connected and productive on the go, she relies on a few essential gadgets.\n\n\"I use a portable Wi-Fi hotspot to stay online when I'm in areas with limited internet access,\" she explained. \"It's a lifesaver when I need to file a story or conduct research on the fly.\" She also carries a ruggedized tablet, which she uses to take notes, access documents, and even conduct video interviews.\n\nIn addition to these tools, Miriam is a fan of noise-cancelling headphones, which help her focus on her work in noisy environments. \"I've used them on airplanes, in coffee shops, and even in the midst of protests,\" she said. \"They're a game-changer for anyone who spends a lot of time in public spaces.\"\n\nDespite her reliance on technology, Miriam is also mindful of the importance of taking breaks and disconnecting from her devices. \"When I'm on the road, I try to set aside time each day to relax and recharge,\" she said. \"Whether it's reading a book, taking a walk, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee, I know that taking care of myself is essential to doing my job well.\"\n\nAs we spoke, Miriam reflected on the ways in which technology has changed the way she works as a journalist. \"In the past, I would have to rely on paper notes and file copies to conduct my research,\" she said. \"Now, I can access vast amounts of information with just a few clicks. It's amazing, but it also means that there's a lot more information out there to sift through and verify.\"\n\nDespite the challenges that come with working in the digital age, Miriam is optimistic about the opportunities that technology presents. \"As a journalist, I'm constantly looking for new ways to tell stories and connect with people,\" she said. \"Technology has given me the tools to do that in ways that were previously unimaginable. And as long as I'm mindful of the potential pitfalls and limitations, I'm excited to see where it takes me next.\"",

        "Text": "Streaming music revenues surpassed income from the sale of traditional formats for the first time last year, as the booming popularity the service puts the survival of the CD at risk. Revenue from music fans paying for services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music surged more than 41% to $6.6bn (Â£4.7bn), accounting for more than 38% of the total global market for recorded music. The sale of physical formats, primarily CDs, fell 5.4% to $5.2bn to account for 30%. It marks a tipping point for the music industry, which has depended on income from CDs to fill record labels' coffers and artists' pockets since the 1980s. CD sales have been in decline for years as the industry was hammered by illegal piracy and failed to make much money as user numbers and margins fell in the early days of streaming. The shift towards streaming has been a long time coming, and the music industry's reliance on CD sales has been a major concern for years. The rise of streaming services has not only changed the way people consume music, but also the way artists and labels make a living.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the global recorded music market grew by 11.4% in 2022, with streaming accounting for the majority of the growth. The IFPI also reported that the average revenue per user (ARPU) for streaming services increased by 15% in 2022, reaching $12.40 per user.\n\nThe decline of CD sales has been a major blow to the music industry, particularly for independent record stores and small labels that relied heavily on physical sales. Many of these stores have been forced to close their doors, and some have had to adapt to the changing landscape by offering streaming services in-store or partnering with digital music platforms.\n\nHowever, the shift towards streaming has also created new opportunities for artists and labels. With streaming services, artists can reach a global audience and earn money from their music without having to rely on physical sales. This has opened up new avenues for independent artists and small labels to get their music heard and make a living.\n\nThe music industry is also seeing a resurgence in vinyl sales, which have increased by 10% in 2022. While vinyl sales are still a fraction of the size of the streaming market, they have become a niche market for music enthusiasts who value the tactile experience of listening to music on physical media.\n\nIn conclusion, the shift towards streaming has marked a significant turning point for the music industry, with revenue from streaming services surpassing income from the sale of traditional formats for the first time. While the decline of CD sales has been a major challenge for the industry, the rise of streaming has created new opportunities for artists and labels to make a living and reach a global audience. As the music industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how it adapts to the changing landscape and what new opportunities emerge for artists and fans alike.",

Anyone under stress loses the capacity to concentrate to some degree, and if a child lives in a household beset by anxieties â€“ money, job security, health, housing, etc â€“ the likelihood of achieving their best is limited. From my own experience, any slight distraction greatly impairs my ability to perform a mathematical task. Politicians of all persuasions need to understand the inherent disadvantage of low income and insecurity on large sections of our population. Cathy Williams Kingsclere, Hampshire â€¢ The exam achievement disparity between the richest and poorest pupils reflects a simple fact of life in 21st-century Britain â€“ income equates to postcode which equates to quality of schooling which equates to quality of teaching which equates to exam success. The solution to this problem, therefore, lies not solely with the education system, but with the broader societal and economic factors that contribute to poverty and inequality. It is crucial that policymakers and educators acknowledge the impact of poverty on children's educational outcomes and work together to address the root causes of this issue.\n\nOne potential solution is to invest in targeted support programs for disadvantaged families, such as free school meals, childcare services, and counseling services. These programs can help alleviate the stress and anxiety that comes with living in poverty, allowing children to focus on their education and achieve their full potential.\n\nAdditionally, policymakers could consider implementing policies that reduce income inequality, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and expanding access to healthcare. By addressing the root causes of poverty, we can create a more equitable society where all children have the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background.\n\nAnother important step is to provide additional support to schools in disadvantaged areas, such as increased funding for resources, staff, and infrastructure. This could include programs that provide one-on-one tutoring, mentorship, and extracurricular activities that help students develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.\n\nFurthermore, educators can play a crucial role in addressing the issue of poverty and inequality by incorporating social and emotional learning into their curriculum. This could include teaching children about empathy, self-awareness, and self-regulation, as well as providing opportunities for students to develop these skills through group projects and community service.\n\nIn conclusion, the disparity in exam achievement between the richest and poorest pupils is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. While schools can play a vital role in addressing this issue, it is equally important that policymakers and educators work together to address the broader societal and economic factors that contribute to poverty and inequality.

        "Text": "Google's Sensorvault Is a Boon for Law Enforcement. This Is How It Works. * None   John Taggart for The New York Times\n\nLaw enforcement officials across the country have been seeking information from a Google database called Sensorvault -- a trove of detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide, The New York Times found. Though the new technique can identify suspects near crimes, it runs the risk of sweeping up innocent bystanders, highlighting the impact that companies' mass collection of data can have on people's lives. Why does Google have this data? Sensorvault is a Google database that collects and stores location data from devices that use Google's services, such as Android phones and tablets, as well as devices that run Google's operating system, Chrome OS. This data is collected through a feature called \"Location History,\" which allows users to opt-in to sharing their location data with Google.\n\nGoogle's Location History feature uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular data to track a user's location and store it in their Google account. This data is then linked to the user's Google account and can be accessed by the user themselves, as well as by law enforcement officials with a valid warrant.\n\nThe data stored in Sensorvault is incredibly detailed, including the exact location of a device at a specific time and date, as well as the device's speed and direction of travel. This information can be used to reconstruct a device's movements over a period of time, allowing law enforcement officials to track a suspect's movements and identify potential witnesses.\n\nGoogle's collection of location data has been a topic of controversy in recent years, with many privacy advocates expressing concerns about the potential for this data to be used to track individuals without their consent. In 2018, Google faced a backlash after it was discovered that the company had been collecting location data from users even after they had opted out of the Location History feature.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Google has implemented measures to increase transparency and user control over their location data. For example, the company now provides users with more detailed information about how their location data is being used and allows them to delete their Location History data at any time.\n\nDespite these efforts, the use of Sensorvault by law enforcement officials has raised concerns about the potential for innocent bystanders to be swept up in investigations. In some cases, the data collected by Sensorvault may be used to identify individuals who were simply in the vicinity of a crime, but were not involved in the incident.\n\nGoogle has defended its use of Sensorvault, stating that the company only provides data to law enforcement officials with a valid warrant and that the data is only used for the purpose of investigating crimes. However, some privacy advocates argue that the use of Sensorvault is a violation of individuals' privacy rights and that the data collected by the database should be protected by stricter regulations.\n\nAs the use of Sensorvault by law enforcement officials continues to raise concerns about privacy and civil liberties, it is clear that the debate over the collection and use of location data will be a major issue in the years to come.",

America's annual post-turkey, pre-dawn retail bender is coming under pressure as bricks-and-mortar retailers suffer the encroachment of online competition and a sprawling pre-holiday sale season threatens the foundations of the country's pre-eminent consumer bacchanal. Sales shopping is far from dead. As the holiday season approaches, retailers are facing unprecedented challenges in maintaining the allure of Black Friday, a tradition that has been a staple of American consumer culture for decades. The rise of e-commerce and the proliferation of pre-holiday sales have eroded the exclusive appeal of the day after Thanksgiving, traditionally considered the start of the holiday shopping season.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the National Retail Federation, 61% of consumers plan to shop online during the holiday season, up from 55% last year. Meanwhile, 44% of respondents said they would shop in-store, a decline from 51% in 2020. The shift towards online shopping is particularly pronounced among younger consumers, with 71% of Gen Z shoppers and 65% of millennials planning to shop online during the holiday season.\n\nDespite these trends, many bricks-and-mortar retailers are refusing to give up on the tradition of Black Friday. In fact, many are doubling down on their in-store promotions, offering deep discounts and extended hours to attract shoppers. Macy's, for example, is opening its doors at 5pm on Thanksgiving Day, while Target is offering a 48-hour sale starting on Thanksgiving evening.\n\n\"Black Friday is still a big deal for us,\" said a spokesperson for Macy's. \"We're seeing a lot of interest in our in-store promotions, and we're confident that our customers will come out in force to take advantage of our deals.\"\n\nOther retailers are taking a more innovative approach to the holiday season. Best Buy, for example, is offering a \"Deal of the Day\" every day leading up to Black Friday, while Sephora is hosting a \"Sephora Holiday Event\" on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nWhile online shopping may be gaining popularity, many consumers still value the experience of shopping in-store. According to a survey by the International Council of Shopping Centers, 75% of consumers prefer to shop in-store during the holiday season, citing the ability to touch and try products, as well as the social experience of shopping with friends and family.\n\n\"Black Friday is still a special event for us,\" said a shopper at a local mall. \"We love the excitement of the crowds, and the thrill of finding a great deal. Online shopping just can't replicate that experience.\"\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, it remains to be seen whether Black Friday will continue to be a major driver of holiday sales. One thing is certain, however: the retail landscape is changing, and retailers will need to adapt to the evolving preferences of their customers in order to remain relevant.",

        "Text": "Five years after the global economy was falling at its fastest rate, Western economies are still failing to gain much-needed momentum, despite the efforts of central bankers on both sides of the Atlantic. The challenges facing the United States and Europe were evident on Thursday, with the latest figures on growth from Washington showing signs of underlying weakness as the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to a record low, reflecting the threat of deflation. At first glance, the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate estimated for the United States for the third quarter might appear somewhat rosy. It was the fastest quarterly increase in output so far this year, and well above the 2 percent change economists had expected. But nearly a full point of that jump was caused by a buildup in inventory, which is likely to sap expansion in the current quarter. The annual rate of growth in consumer spending slowed sharply to 1.5 percent, the weakest quarterly increase in more than two years, while spending by the federal government fell 1.7 percent. Last month's government shutdown did not take place until after the period surveyed in the report, but the decline in federal spending in July, August and September showed how the across-the-board budget cuts imposed by Congress this year were beginning to bite. The lackluster growth figures come as a blow to policymakers who had been hoping for a stronger rebound from the global financial crisis. The European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates to a record low of 0.5% was seen as a desperate attempt to stimulate economic activity in the region, which has been struggling to recover from a debt crisis.\n\nDespite the efforts of central bankers, many economists believe that the underlying structural issues in the economy are too deep-seated to be addressed solely through monetary policy. The buildup in inventory, which accounted for nearly a full point of the 2.8% growth rate, is a classic sign of a struggling economy, as businesses stockpile goods in anticipation of future demand rather than investing in new production.\n\nThe slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts for a significant portion of the US economy, is also a cause for concern. The 1.5% annual rate of growth in consumer spending is the weakest quarterly increase in more than two years, and many analysts believe that the trend is likely to continue unless wages and incomes start to rise more quickly.\n\nThe decline in federal spending, which fell 1.7% in the third quarter, is also a worrying sign. The sequester, a series of automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress earlier this year, is likely to continue to have a negative impact on the economy, as it reduces government spending and investment.\n\nThe news is likely to put pressure on policymakers to come up with a new plan to stimulate the economy. The Federal Reserve, which has been implementing a series of quantitative easing programs to inject liquidity into the economy, may need to consider new measures to boost growth.\n\nIn Europe, the European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates is likely to be seen as a sign of desperation, as the region struggles to recover from a debt crisis that has left many countries with high levels of debt and stagnant economies. The ECB's move is likely to be met with skepticism by some economists, who believe that the bank's policies have already done more harm than good.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the economy, many analysts believe that the US is better positioned than Europe to recover from the current slowdown. The US has a more diversified economy, with a strong services sector and a growing technology industry, which should help to drive growth in the future.\n\nHowever, the lack of momentum in the economy is likely to remain a major concern for policymakers, who will need to come up with a new plan to stimulate growth and create jobs. The news is likely to put pressure on the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to take bold action to boost the economy, and could lead to a renewed debate about the role of monetary policy in stimulating economic growth.",

The space station, Tiangong 1, is predicted to make that return trip between March 30 and April 2, though that estimate is still subject to change, according to a Monday analysis by the Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research and development center in California. But don't worry: Odds are no one will be hurt. The Aerospace Corporation's analysis suggests that the majority of the space station's debris is expected to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, with only small pieces potentially surviving to reach the ground. According to NASA, the space station's re-entry is expected to be a \"benign\" event, with most of the debris likely to disintegrate before it can cause any harm.\n\nThe Tiangong 1 space station was launched in 2011 as part of China's space program, with the goal of testing the country's capabilities in space exploration. The station was occupied by three crews of Chinese astronauts between 2012 and 2013, and was used to conduct a range of scientific experiments and tests.\n\nDespite its intended use, the space station has been out of commission since 2016, when it ceased functioning due to a lack of power and propulsion. Since then, it has been slowly drifting through space, with its orbit decaying over time.\n\nThe Aerospace Corporation's analysis suggests that the space station's re-entry will be a complex and dynamic event, with the station's trajectory and speed changing constantly as it interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. The agency has developed a range of models to predict the space station's path, but there is still some uncertainty surrounding the exact timing and location of the re-entry.\n\nAccording to the Aerospace Corporation, the space station's re-entry is expected to be visible from the ground, but only in a limited area. The agency has estimated that the space station will enter the Earth's atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, and will likely break apart before it can cause any harm.\n\nDespite the low risk of harm, the re-entry of the Tiangong 1 space station is still a significant event, and scientists and space enthusiasts around the world are eagerly awaiting its return. The re-entry is a reminder of the importance of responsible space exploration and the need for careful planning and coordination to ensure the safe and responsible operation of space-based assets.\n\nIn the meantime, NASA and other space agencies around the world are working to track the space station's re-entry and provide updates to the public. The agency has set up a website dedicated to tracking the space station's re-entry, which includes a range of resources and information for those interested in learning more about the event.",

        "Text": "The equations that describe the universe at the smallest and largest scales -- how the tiniest elementary particles dance, how the space-time of the cosmos bends -- predicted a slight incongruity, a tiny unbalancing in the numbers of certain particles under certain circumstances. But physicists have yet to observe this phenomenon, with the unwieldy name of mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, and confirm the prediction. The imbalance is negligible except when the warping of space-time is extreme -- like next to a black hole or the moment after the Big Bang. It turns out there was somewhere else to look, and it was much closer. An international team of scientists discovered this anomaly in a tabletop apparatus in Zurich examining the properties of a tiny metallic ribbon. \"There was no way to test this effect until now,\" said Johannes Gooth, a scientist at IBM Research in Zurich who is the lead author of a paper published on Wednesday by the journal Nature. The discovery, published in the journal Nature, marks a significant breakthrough in the field of particle physics and has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe. The mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, a phenomenon predicted by theories of quantum gravity and general relativity, was previously thought to be inaccessible for experimental verification.\n\nHowever, the team of scientists, led by Johannes Gooth from IBM Research in Zurich, was able to create a tabletop apparatus that simulated the extreme conditions required to observe the anomaly. The experiment involved using a tiny metallic ribbon, just a few millimeters long, which was suspended in a vacuum chamber and subjected to intense magnetic fields.\n\nAccording to Gooth, the team's findings confirm the predictions made by theorists, but with a twist. \"We were surprised to find that the anomaly was not only present, but also much stronger than we expected,\" he said. \"This suggests that the phenomenon may be more common than previously thought, and could have important implications for our understanding of the behavior of particles in extreme environments.\"\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for fields such as cosmology, particle physics, and materials science. It could also pave the way for new technologies that rely on the manipulation of particles in extreme conditions, such as advanced sensors and detectors.\n\nThe team's findings are the result of years of research and collaboration between scientists from around the world. \"This discovery would not have been possible without the contributions of many talented researchers,\" said Gooth. \"We are thrilled to have been able to confirm this prediction and look forward to exploring the implications of our findings.\"\n\nThe mixed axial-gravitational anomaly is just one of many mysteries that remain to be solved in the field of particle physics. However, the discovery of this phenomenon demonstrates the power of human ingenuity and the importance of continued investment in scientific research. As scientists continue to explore the fundamental laws of the universe, they may uncover new secrets that could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos.",

Growth between April and June was stronger than the 0.4% achieved in the first quarter, boosted by the best performance from the industrial sector in almost 17 years according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists were forecasting weaker growth of 0.4% in the second quarter. They warned however this was likely to be as good as it gets for the UK economy, with a sharp slowdown predicted in the coming months. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said there was little evidence that concern about a possible Brexit vote had a negative impact on the economy before the referendum. \"Continued strong growth across services, particularly in retailing, reinforced by healthy growth in the manufacture of cars and pharmaceuticals, boosted output in the second quarter. \"Any uncertainties in the runup to the referendum seem to have had a limited effect. Very few respondents to ONS surveys cited such uncertainties as negatively impacting their businesses.\" Despite the positive growth figures, economists are warning that the UK economy is likely to experience a significant slowdown in the coming months. This is due to a number of factors, including the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the Brexit referendum and the potential impact on trade and investment.\n\nThe Bank of England has already cut interest rates twice this year in an effort to boost the economy, and some experts are predicting that further stimulus measures may be needed to prevent a recession. The pound has also fallen sharply against the dollar and euro since the referendum, making imports more expensive and potentially leading to higher inflation.\n\nHowever, not all economists are pessimistic about the UK's economic prospects. Some argue that the country's economy is more resilient than previously thought, and that the impact of Brexit will be limited. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that a Brexit vote could lead to a recession, but also pointed out that the UK's economy is more diversified than many other countries, with a strong services sector that is less dependent on trade with the EU.\n\nThe CBI's director-general, Carolyn Fairbairn, said: \"While a Brexit vote would undoubtedly create uncertainty, our economy is more resilient than many people think. We have a strong services sector, a highly skilled workforce, and a flexible economy that is well-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances.\"\n\nThe UK's industrial sector, which has been a major driver of growth in recent months, is also expected to continue to perform well. The manufacturing sector has seen a significant increase in output, driven by strong demand for goods such as cars and pharmaceuticals. The construction sector is also expected to continue to grow, driven by a surge in housing starts and a pick-up in infrastructure investment.\n\nOverall, while there are certainly challenges ahead for the UK economy, many experts believe that it is more resilient than previously thought and that it will be able to adapt to the changing circumstances following the Brexit vote.",

But this time, it would be an entirely different role: supplying the technology, equipment and engineers to build high-speed rail lines. The Chinese government has signed cooperation agreements with the State of California and General Electric to help build such lines. The agreements mark a significant shift in the relationship between China and the United States in the rail industry, as China looks to export its expertise in high-speed rail technology to the US market. The Chinese government has been actively promoting its high-speed rail technology globally, and the US is seen as a key market for its expansion.\n\nThe cooperation agreements will focus on developing high-speed rail lines in California, with the Chinese government providing technical expertise, equipment, and engineers to support the project. The agreements also include plans for joint research and development of new rail technologies, as well as training programs for American engineers and technicians.\n\nThe project is seen as a major opportunity for China to demonstrate its capabilities in high-speed rail technology, which has been a key area of focus for the Chinese government in recent years. China has been investing heavily in its own high-speed rail network, and has become one of the world's leading experts in the field.\n\nThe US, on the other hand, has been slower to develop its own high-speed rail network, with only a few lines in operation. However, there is growing interest in developing high-speed rail in the US, particularly in California, where a high-speed rail line is already under construction.\n\nThe cooperation agreements are seen as a major step forward in developing the US-China relationship in the rail industry. The agreements will not only provide a platform for the exchange of expertise and technology, but also create new business opportunities for both countries.\n\n\"We are excited to be working with the Chinese government and General Electric to bring high-speed rail technology to the US,\" said a spokesperson for the California Department of Transportation. \"This is a major opportunity for us to learn from the Chinese experts and to develop our own high-speed rail network.\"\n\nThe agreements are also seen as a major boost for the US rail industry, which has been facing significant challenges in recent years. The industry has been struggling to compete with other modes of transportation, such as air travel and road transport, and has been looking for new ways to attract passengers and freight.\n\nThe cooperation agreements are expected to be finalized in the coming months, with work on the high-speed rail lines expected to begin soon after.

        "Text": "The nation's economic output grew at an even faster rate during July, August and September than the government initially estimated, giving the economy its strongest six-month performance in more than a decade. The intense focus on the coming shopping frenzy as the holiday period begins this week almost made interest in the economy's third-quarter performance seem like an exercise in nostalgia. But the Commerce Department's release on Tuesday of its revised estimate of gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the nation -- showed that consumers had already stepped up their pace of purchasing. The shift in the annual rate of growth to 3.9 percent from 3.5 percent was mainly because of a bigger-than-expected jump in consumer spending, bolstered by a modest increase in reported business investment. \"The upward revision was almost exclusively due to much stronger buying by consumers,\" said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company. \"I find that very encouraging coming into the commercial side of the holiday seasons.\" While the economic recovery, now into its sixth year, has been lackluster, Mr. Tannenbaum noted that in four of the last five quarters, \"growth has moved to a much stronger level.\" This 3.9 percent growth rate comes on the heels of a 4.6 percent jump in G.D.P. during the second quarter, after a freezing winter that helped cause the nation's output to drop at a rate of 2.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed that \"the trend has shifted higher,\" although he said he doubted that G.D.P. ...doubt that the growth rate will continue at this pace, citing concerns about the impact of tariffs on international trade and the potential for a slowdown in business investment.\n\nDespite these concerns, the revised GDP estimate suggests that the economy is gaining momentum heading into the holiday season. The increase in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the economy, was driven by a surge in purchases of goods and services, including a significant jump in spending on clothing, furniture, and electronics.\n\nThe data also showed that business investment, which has been a source of concern in recent quarters, increased by a modest 1.2% in the third quarter, following a decline in the previous quarter. While this is not a significant increase, it suggests that businesses are beginning to feel more confident about the economy and are investing in new equipment and technology.\n\nThe strong GDP growth rate has also had a positive impact on the job market, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.7% in September, the lowest level since December 2018. The Labor Department also reported that wages and salaries increased by 0.4% in September, the largest gain in six months.\n\nThe strong economic data has sent mixed signals to investors, with some expressing concerns about the potential for a slowdown in the economy while others see the data as a sign of a continued growth trend. The stock market was mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 0.2% while the S&P 500 index fell 0.1%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which has been monitoring the economy closely, is expected to keep interest rates steady at its next meeting in October. The central bank has been gradually raising interest rates over the past year to combat inflation and to prevent the economy from overheating.\n\nWhile the strong GDP growth rate is a positive sign for the economy, it is not without its challenges. The ongoing trade tensions with China and other countries have created uncertainty for businesses and consumers, and the impact of tariffs on international trade remains a major concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the revised GDP estimate suggests that the economy is gaining momentum heading into the holiday season, driven by a surge in consumer spending and a modest increase in business investment. While there are concerns about the potential for a slowdown in the economy, the strong data has sent a positive signal to investors and suggests that the economy is on track for a continued growth trend.",

        "Text": "MOSCOW -- Many of the leaders of the world's richest economies are convening at the eighth Group of 20 summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, with the economic winds at their back, ready to sign on to a sweeping new set of tax rules for multinational corporations. They are expected on Friday to agree to enact new tax laws that would limit the ability of multinational corporations like Apple and Starbucks to legally avoid paying taxes by operating subsidiaries in certain countries. The practice came to the fore during the global recession as national coffers were strained and leaders looked for new sources of revenue. The recent positive economic news has not damped that desire or relieved the pressure to crack down. In the United States, economic news has pointed to continued growth. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to issue a healthy jobs report with 180,000 jobs created in August. It is the last set of economic data the government will release before the Federal Reserve meets to consider tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates in the United States. On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management issued its closely watched report, which said service companies were hiring more, and fewer people are applying for unemployment benefits. As the leaders of the world's richest economies gather in St. Petersburg, Russia, the stage is set for a significant shift in the global tax landscape. The proposed tax rules, aimed at curbing the practice of multinational corporations avoiding taxes through complex financial structures, are expected to have far-reaching implications for businesses and governments alike.\n\nThe move is seen as a major victory for countries seeking to address the issue of tax evasion, which has been a thorn in the side of governments for years. The practice, known as \"tax arbitrage,\" has allowed companies to exploit differences in tax rates and laws between countries to minimize their tax liability.\n\nThe proposed rules would require multinational corporations to pay a minimum level of tax on their profits, regardless of where they are earned. This would effectively end the practice of companies setting up subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions and then shifting profits to those locations.\n\nThe move is also seen as a major blow to tax havens, such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, which have long been criticized for their lack of transparency and willingness to host offshore companies.\n\nThe agreement is expected to be a major talking point at the summit, with leaders from the G20 countries, including the United States, Germany, Japan, and the UK, all set to sign on to the new tax rules.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by tax experts and anti-poverty campaigners, who have long argued that the practice of tax evasion has contributed to widening income inequality and undermined the ability of governments to fund public services.\n\n\"This is a major step forward in the fight against tax evasion and avoidance,\" said a spokesperson for Oxfam International. \"It's a recognition that the current system is broken and that something needs to be done to ensure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes.\"\n\nHowever, the move has also been criticized by some business leaders, who argue that the new rules will increase their costs and make it harder for them to compete in the global market.\n\n\"The proposed rules are a step backwards for international cooperation and will only serve to drive businesses underground,\" said a spokesperson for the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\nDespite these concerns, the agreement is expected to be a major boost to the global economy, as it will help to reduce the risk of tax evasion and avoidance and ensure that governments have a more stable source of revenue.\n\nThe news comes as the global economy continues to recover from the financial crisis, with many countries experiencing strong economic growth. The United States, in particular, has seen a significant rebound, with the Labor Department expected to report a healthy jobs report on Friday.\n\nThe agreement is also seen as a major step forward for the G20, which has been working to address the issue of tax evasion and avoidance for several years. The group has been pushing for greater transparency and cooperation between governments and businesses to prevent tax evasion and avoidance.\n\nThe summit is expected to be a major focus of attention in the coming days, with leaders from around the world gathering to discuss a range of issues, including the economy, climate change, and global security. The agreement on tax rules is expected to be a major highlight of the summit, and a major step forward in the fight against tax evasion and avoidance.",

        "Text": "Britain's competition watchdog is launching an investigation into the funeral market after it found the cost of organising one increased by 6% each year â€“ twice the inflation rate â€“ for the past 14 years. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said funerals typically cost between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000. It accused some funeral directors of taking advantage by charging high prices at a time when its customers were vulnerable. The average cost of a basic funeral in Britain rose to Â£4,271 last year, up from Â£1,920 in 2004, the CMA said, citing an analysis by SunLife. Discretionary items such as flowers and catering could add another Â£2,000. A cremation service cost Â£3,744 on average. The CMA's investigation aims to determine whether funeral directors are engaging in anti-competitive practices, such as price-fixing or restricting competition, to maintain high prices. The watchdog has written to 464 funeral directors, asking them to provide information about their pricing and business practices.\n\nThe investigation is a response to growing concerns about the affordability of funerals in Britain. Many people are struggling to pay for funeral expenses, which can be a significant financial burden on families. The CMA's analysis found that the cost of a funeral has increased by 6% each year since 2004, far outpacing inflation.\n\n\"This investigation is a wake-up call for the funeral industry,\" said Stuart McIntosh, the CMA's Senior Director for Enforcement. \"We want to ensure that funeral directors are providing a fair and competitive service to consumers, and that they are not taking advantage of vulnerable people at a difficult time.\"\n\nThe CMA's investigation is also looking into the use of \"rip-off\" clauses in funeral contracts, which can result in families being charged extra fees for services they do not receive. The watchdog is also examining the marketing practices of funeral directors, including the use of misleading advertising and high-pressure sales tactics.\n\nFuneral directors have defended their pricing, arguing that the cost of providing a funeral service has increased significantly over the past decade. They claim that the cost of funeral homes, staff, and equipment has risen, as well as the cost of transporting the deceased and providing other services.\n\nHowever, the CMA is concerned that some funeral directors are using these increased costs as an excuse to charge high prices, rather than finding ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The watchdog is also concerned that the industry is dominated by a small number of large companies, which can stifle competition and drive up prices.\n\nThe investigation is expected to take several months to complete, and the CMA will have the power to impose fines on funeral directors if it finds evidence of anti-competitive behavior. The watchdog is also considering introducing new rules to regulate the funeral industry and improve transparency and fairness for consumers.\n\nIn the meantime, families are advised to shop around for funeral services and to carefully read and understand the terms of their contracts before signing. The CMA is also urging families to report any concerns they have about funeral directors to the watchdog's website.\n\nThe investigation is a significant step forward in addressing the concerns of families who are struggling to pay for funeral expenses. It is hoped that the CMA's actions will lead to a more competitive and transparent funeral market, and that families will be able to access affordable and dignified funeral services.",

        "Text": "David Binder, a longtime correspondent for The New York Times who chronicled the Cold War in Europe, the dissolution of the Soviet bloc in the East and the horrific civil wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, died on Sunday at his home in Evanston, Ill. He was 88. His wife, Helga, said the cause was end-stage kidney disease. A restless, relentless journalist, Mr. Binder covered the Berlin Wall's construction in 1961 and its destruction in 1989 -- bookends to his many hundreds of reports on East-West tensions and life under the Communist regimes in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. In the early 1990s, as Germany reunified and peace returned to much of Europe, Mr. Binder went back to the Balkans to cover wars that engulfed the former Yugoslavia in massacres, mass rapes and genocide, killing 100,000 people and driving millions from their homes. He interviewed civilian victims, fighters and their leaders, including the accused Serbian war criminals Slobodan Milosevic and Gen. Ratko Mladic. Throughout his illustrious career, Binder's reporting was marked by his bravery, tenacity, and ability to convey the human cost of conflict. His stories from the Balkans, in particular, were characterized by their emotional depth and unflinching portrayal of the atrocities committed during the wars.\n\nBinder's coverage of the Bosnian War, which lasted from 1992 to 1995, was particularly notable. He reported on the siege of Sarajevo, where civilians were trapped under siege for nearly four years, and the massacre at Srebrenica, where over 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were killed by Serbian forces. His reporting from the front lines, often under fire, provided a firsthand account of the chaos and devastation that ravaged the region.\n\nBinder's work in the Balkans also led him to interview some of the most notorious figures of the conflict, including Slobodan Milosevic and Gen. Ratko Mladic. His encounters with these individuals were marked by a keen sense of skepticism and a refusal to accept their justifications for the atrocities committed.\n\nDespite the many challenges he faced during his reporting, Binder remained committed to his craft, driven by a passion for storytelling and a desire to shed light on the human cost of conflict. His reporting earned him numerous awards and accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1993.\n\nBinder's legacy extends far beyond his reporting, however. He inspired a generation of journalists to follow in his footsteps, and his work continues to serve as a testament to the power of journalism to shape our understanding of the world.\n\nThroughout his life, Binder remained humble and kind, despite the many accolades he received. He was a beloved figure in the journalism community, and his passing is mourned by colleagues and friends around the world.",

        "Text": "Manufacturers are demanding that the government provide urgent clarity on the future of EU workers' rights, warning they will face shortages of skilled staff if they cannot recruit from Europe after Brexit. EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said a quarter of the firms it represents had seen job applications from the EU fall and 16% had seen more European workers quit since the 2016 referendum. With a majority relying on EU staff due to a lack of skilled UK applicants, manufacturers warned that uncertainty over recruitment would choke off growth and damage the British economy. The reciprocal rights of EU and UK workers is one of the core questions in the Brexit negotiations, with the prime minister having confirmed that freedom of movement must be limited, despite business fears and cabinet objections. However, the government has indicated it will seek a transitional period following the article 50 deadline of March 2019. A report published by EEF says that while manufacturers are looking to bring in more apprenticeships and training, these can only be long-term solutions, with 11% of staff now coming from the EU and many vacancies attracting no UK applicants. The report, titled \"Brexit and the Future of EU Workers in UK Manufacturing,\" highlights the critical role EU workers play in the industry, with many firms relying heavily on their skills and expertise. The EEF is urging the government to provide clarity on the future of EU workers' rights and the recruitment process to avoid a shortage of skilled staff.\n\n\"We understand that the government is trying to negotiate a new relationship with the EU, but the uncertainty is causing significant problems for manufacturers,\" said a spokesperson for the EEF. \"We are not asking for special treatment, just a clear understanding of what the future holds for EU workers and how they will be able to continue contributing to our industry.\"\n\nThe report also warns that the shortage of skilled staff could have a knock-on effect on the economy, with manufacturers struggling to meet demand and potentially leading to a decline in productivity. The EEF is calling on the government to work with industry to find a solution that meets the needs of both manufacturers and EU workers.\n\nIn the meantime, many manufacturers are taking matters into their own hands, investing in training and apprenticeships to develop the skills of UK workers. However, the report notes that these initiatives can only be long-term solutions, and the industry needs urgent clarity on the future of EU workers to avoid a shortage of skilled staff.\n\nThe EEF is not alone in its concerns, with many other industries also warning of the potential impact of Brexit on their ability to recruit and retain skilled staff. The construction industry, in particular, has been vocal about the need for a clear understanding of the future of EU workers' rights, with many firms reliant on EU staff to fill skilled vacancies.\n\nThe government has so far remained tight-lipped on the issue, with officials indicating that they will provide more information on the future of EU workers' rights during the transitional period. However, the EEF is urging the government to provide clarity sooner rather than later to avoid a shortage of skilled staff and to allow manufacturers to plan for the future.\n\nAs the Brexit negotiations continue, the EEF's report serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of uncertainty for manufacturers and the wider economy. With the clock ticking down to the March 2019 deadline, the industry is holding its breath, waiting for the government to provide the clarity it so desperately needs.",

        "Text": "Shoppers are turning to discounters and supermarkets' own label goods as price rises pick up across the grocery market. The German chains Aldi and Lidl are growing at their fastest rate in more than two years as supermarkets raise prices following the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote, which has pushed up the cost of imported goods. Sales at Aldi rose by 19.8% and at Lidl by 18.3% in the 12 weeks to 21 May, while the UK's big four supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons, collectively grew by just 1.6%, according to market share data from Kantar Worldpanel. The German chains' rapid growth took their combined market share to a new high of 12%, as 1.1m more cash-strapped consumers in search of a better deal visited their stores. Lidl, which holds 5% of the UK grocery market, is expected to overtake Waitrose, which has a 5.2% share, as the seventh biggest chain briefly this summer and consolidate its position next year. Meanwhile, supermarkets' own label sales rose by 6.0% year on year in contrast to a 0.6% rise in branded products as shoppers looked for a cheaper alternative. Chris Hayward, consumer specialist at Kantar Worldpanel, said: \"Consumers are starting to feel the pinch as prices continue to rise.\" The shift towards discounters and own-label products is a clear indication that consumers are adapting to the new economic reality. As the cost of living continues to rise, shoppers are becoming increasingly price-sensitive, and supermarkets are responding by increasing prices on branded products.\n\nAccording to Kantar Worldpanel, the average price of a basket of groceries has risen by 2.5% over the past 12 weeks, with prices increasing across all categories. This has led to a surge in demand for discounters and own-label products, which are perceived as being more affordable.\n\nThe success of Aldi and Lidl can be attributed to their ability to offer high-quality products at lower prices. Both chains have built a reputation for offering fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at prices significantly lower than their supermarket rivals. Their focus on private-label products, which account for around 90% of their sales, has also helped to keep costs down.\n\nIn contrast, the big four supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, and Morrisons - have struggled to maintain their market share. Despite their efforts to reduce prices and improve their product offerings, they have been unable to stem the tide of consumers switching to discounters.\n\nThe impact of the Brexit vote on the pound's value has also had a significant impact on the grocery market. The fall in the pound has led to a rise in the cost of imported goods, including fresh produce and meat, which has increased the cost of production for supermarkets.\n\nAs a result, supermarkets have been forced to increase prices to maintain their profit margins. However, this has led to a backlash from consumers, who are increasingly looking for alternative options.\n\nThe rise of discounters and own-label products is not just a short-term trend. It is a fundamental shift in consumer behavior that is likely to continue in the long term. As the cost of living continues to rise, consumers will become increasingly price-sensitive, and supermarkets will need to adapt to this new reality.\n\nIn conclusion, the shift towards discounters and own-label products is a clear indication that consumers are adapting to the new economic reality. As prices continue to rise, shoppers will continue to look for cheaper alternatives, and supermarkets will need to respond by offering high-quality products at competitive prices.",

Following a two-hour meeting in London, the two sides announced a joint attempt at arbitration through the industrial conciliation service Acas. Both union and employers remained guarded over the details. But a move to arbitration represented a promising shift on the part of the employers, represented by the Universities UK (UUK) group, which had said its pension proposals would not be subject to negotiation. The University and College Union (UCU) said its planned strikes would continue across the UK, with a fifth consecutive day of industrial action taking place on about 60 campuses on Wednesday. A further four days of strikes are scheduled to begin on 5 March. The joint decision to seek arbitration through Acas marks a significant step forward in the dispute, which has seen university staff take to the picket lines in protest of proposed changes to their pension scheme. The UCU has been vocal in its opposition to the UUK's plans, which would see staff contributions increase and the scheme's benefits reduced.\n\nThe union has argued that the proposed changes would disproportionately affect lower-paid staff, who would be forced to bear a greater burden of the pension scheme's costs. The UUK, on the other hand, has maintained that the changes are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the scheme.\n\nThe arbitration process is expected to begin in the coming weeks, with both sides submitting their proposals to Acas. The conciliation service will then work with the parties to identify areas of common ground and seek to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nWhile the move to arbitration is seen as a positive development, the UCU has warned that it will not be enough to resolve the dispute on its own. The union has called for the UUK to make concessions on the proposed pension changes, and has threatened to continue the strike action unless its demands are met.\n\nThe strike action has already had a significant impact on university operations, with many courses and services disrupted. Students have been left to navigate the situation, with some expressing frustration and disappointment at the lack of progress in the dispute.\n\nAs the arbitration process gets underway, both sides will be under pressure to find a resolution that satisfies the concerns of staff and students alike. The outcome of the dispute will have significant implications for the future of higher education in the UK, and will be closely watched by academics and policymakers across the country.\n\nIn the meantime, the UCU has announced that it will continue to strike on Wednesday, with around 60 campuses affected. The union has also confirmed that four further days of strike action are planned to begin on March 5. The UUK has yet to comment on the arbitration decision, but is expected to release a statement in the coming days.",

        "Text": "The government is to launch a tourism action plan including cutting red tape for B&Bs and ready-made train tours as an increasing number of Brits take bank holiday breaks in the UK. Just over 5 million Britons are planning a staycation in the UK over the weekend, 6% more than last year, according to Visit England, the tourism promotion body, after a fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro in the wake of the EU referendum vote. The expected surge comes after a record-breaking first four months of the year for domestic holiday trips in England. From January to April Britons took 11m holiday trips, 8% more than during the same period last year, according to Visit England. They spent Â£2.8bn, 22% up on last year, more than ever before. That continued a strong year in 2015 for staycations when the number of trips and the amount spent both rose 7% on the previous year. The prime minister, Theresa May, who chose to holiday in the Swiss Alps this month, said: \"Tourism is vitally important to the UK and the sector goes from strength to strength. The government's new tourism action plan aims to capitalize on the growing trend of staycations by simplifying regulations for bed and breakfast establishments and introducing pre-packaged train tours. The plan is expected to boost tourism in rural areas, where many B&Bs are located, and provide a convenient option for travelers who prefer to explore the country without the hassle of driving.\n\nUnder the new plan, B&B owners will no longer be required to obtain a special license to operate, a move that is expected to save them time and money. Additionally, the government will provide funding for marketing and advertising campaigns to promote rural tourism, with a focus on highlighting the unique attractions and experiences that these areas have to offer.\n\nThe introduction of pre-packaged train tours is also expected to be a major draw for tourists. The tours will offer a range of itineraries, from scenic routes through the countryside to city breaks in major urban centers. The train tours will be designed to appeal to a wide range of travelers, including families, couples, and solo travelers.\n\nThe government's tourism action plan has been welcomed by the tourism industry, which has been experiencing a surge in demand for staycations in recent years. According to Visit England, the number of domestic holiday trips taken in England has risen by 8% in the first four months of the year, with spending up by 22%.\n\nThe rise in staycations is attributed to a combination of factors, including the fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and the euro, as well as the increasing popularity of domestic holidays. Many Britons are choosing to stay in the UK for their holidays, rather than traveling abroad, due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the potential impact on travel plans.\n\nThe tourism industry is also benefiting from the government's decision to invest in infrastructure, including the development of new tourist attractions and the upgrading of existing ones. The investment is expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in rural areas, where tourism is a major contributor to the local economy.\n\nThe government's tourism action plan is part of a broader effort to promote the UK as a tourist destination and to support the country's economy. The plan is expected to have a positive impact on the tourism industry, and will help to ensure that the UK remains a popular destination for tourists in the years to come.",

        "Text": "A new wave of protectionism and trade tensions risks denting global growth, stoking inflation and harming living standards, the west's leading economic thinktank has warned in its first in-depth forecasts since Donald Trump won the US election on an anti-globalisation platform. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said it was optimistic that expected spending measures and tax cuts under the new US administration would boost growth there and in other countries. But it said global trade growth was already \"exceptionally weak\" and jobs would suffer if politicians rolled back the clock on trade liberalisation. The thinktank warned of an uncertain outlook for the UK and its trading partners as Brexit negotiations began. It nudged up its forecasts for UK growth next year but still predicted the weakest performance since the recession and a further slowdown in 2018. The OECD used its quarterly forecasts to urge governments to use low borrowing costs to invest and enact structural reforms. The group reprised a warning to politicians not to over-rely on central banks to drive the recovery with monetary policies, such as low interest rates and electronic money-printing programmes. The OECD's warning comes as the global economy is already facing significant headwinds, including a slowdown in China, a key driver of world growth, and a fragile recovery in the eurozone. The thinktank noted that the global economy is expected to grow at a sluggish pace of 3.3% this year, down from 3.5% in 2016.\n\nThe OECD's forecast for the United States is more optimistic, with growth expected to reach 2.3% this year, up from 1.6% in 2016. However, the thinktank warned that this growth is largely driven by expected spending measures and tax cuts under the new administration, and that the impact of these policies on the economy will be limited if they are not accompanied by structural reforms.\n\nThe OECD's warning about the risks of protectionism is echoed by many other economists and business leaders, who have expressed concerns about the potential impact of trade tensions on global trade and economic growth. The thinktank noted that a rise in protectionism could lead to a decline in global trade growth, which could have significant negative impacts on jobs and living standards.\n\nThe OECD's forecast for the UK is more pessimistic, with growth expected to slow to 1.3% this year, down from 2.1% in 2016. The thinktank warned that the UK's exit from the EU, or Brexit, could have significant negative impacts on the economy, including a decline in trade and investment. The OECD noted that the UK's growth prospects are highly dependent on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, and that a \"hard Brexit\" could lead to significant economic disruption.\n\nThe OECD's warning about the risks of over-reliance on central banks to drive the recovery is also echoed by many other economists and business leaders. The thinktank noted that while monetary policies have been effective in stabilizing the economy during times of crisis, they are not a sustainable solution to the challenges facing the global economy. The OECD urged governments to use low borrowing costs to invest in infrastructure, education, and other areas that will drive long-term economic growth.\n\nOverall, the OECD's forecast provides a sobering reminder of the challenges facing the global economy, and the need for policymakers to take a proactive approach to addressing these challenges. The thinktank's warning about the risks of protectionism and over-reliance on central banks is particularly timely, as policymakers around the world are grappling with the implications of the Trump administration's anti-globalization platform.",

        "Text": "Low paid workers have been handed their biggest pay rise since the 1990s, after the introduction of the \"national living wage\" forced companies to pay workers aged 25 and over a minimum Â£7.20 an hour. The bottom 10% of earners received a 4.4% increase in the year to April, while the boost for the bottom 5% of earners was even bigger at 6.2%, according to official data. Low pay campaigners cheered the figures which also showed that the significant rise in low pay was most prominent among women and part-time workers, helping to close the gender pay gap at the bottom end of the pay scale. The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), have been hailed as a major victory for low pay campaigners, who have long argued that the minimum wage was not sufficient to allow workers to afford a decent standard of living.\n\nThe introduction of the national living wage, which was introduced in April 2016, has been credited with driving up wages across the board, with the lowest-paid workers benefiting the most. The ONS data shows that the median hourly wage for workers aged 25 and over has risen by 3.6% over the past year, while the median hourly wage for workers aged 18-24 has risen by 2.3%.\n\nThe figures also highlight the significant impact that the national living wage has had on the gender pay gap. According to the ONS, the gap between the median hourly wage for men and women aged 25 and over has narrowed by 0.5 percentage points over the past year, with women's median hourly wage rising by 4.2% and men's median hourly wage rising by 3.4%.\n\nThe increase in wages has also had a positive impact on the overall economy, with the ONS reporting that the number of people in work has risen by 200,000 over the past year, while the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since 1975.\n\nWhile the figures are welcome news for low pay campaigners, there are still concerns that many workers are struggling to make ends meet. The Living Wage Foundation, a charity that campaigns for a higher minimum wage, has called for the government to increase the national living wage to Â£9.30 an hour to reflect the true cost of living in the UK.\n\nThe charity's director, Rhys Moore, said: \"These figures show that the national living wage is having a positive impact on low-paid workers, but we still have a long way to go to ensure that everyone can afford a decent standard of living. We urge the government to increase the national living wage to Â£9.30 an hour to reflect the true cost of living in the UK and to ensure that all workers can afford a decent standard of living.\"\n\nThe government has welcomed the figures, with a spokesperson saying: \"We are committed to ensuring that all workers are paid a fair wage for their work. The national living wage is an important step towards achieving this goal, and we will continue to monitor its impact and make changes as necessary to ensure that it remains effective in driving up wages and improving living standards.\"\n\nOverall, the figures are a welcome sign that the national living wage is having a positive impact on low-paid workers, and that the government's efforts to drive up wages are paying off. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure that all workers can afford a decent standard of living, and campaigners will continue to push for further action to address the issue of low pay.",

        "Text": "In the first decade of the 20th century, Standard Oil was as mighty as the tech giants of Silicon Valley are today. The company had grown from a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 to produce 87% of all US refined oil output. In 1911, the supreme court decided that Standard Oil was in breach of anti-trust legislation passed by Congress and ordered that the company be broken up. Even before the data mining revelations that have engulfed Facebook, there was pressure in the US for similar action to be taken against the social media networking site and two other globally dominant companies â€“ Google and Amazon â€“ that have come from nowhere in the past two decades. The argument goes like this. Data is as vital to the modern digital economy as oil was a century ago. The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon. The charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook's case) the harvesting of the personal data of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes. The parallels between Standard Oil and the modern tech giants are striking, and the argument for anti-trust action is gaining momentum. However, there are those who argue that the situation is more complex, and that breaking up the companies would not necessarily solve the problems at hand.\n\nProponents of the tech giants point out that they have created jobs, driven innovation, and made products and services that have transformed the way we live and work. They argue that the benefits of their dominance outweigh the costs, and that regulation would stifle progress and innovation.\n\nMoreover, the tech giants have also been quick to adapt to the changing landscape, investing heavily in new areas such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cloud computing. They have also been vocal about the need for regulation and have proposed their own solutions to address the concerns around data privacy and competition.\n\nIn addition, some experts argue that the solution lies not in breaking up the companies, but in creating new regulations and safeguards to ensure that they operate in a way that is fair and transparent. This could include measures such as data portability, where users can easily move their data between platforms, and stricter rules around online advertising and political influence.\n\nThe debate is also playing out in the halls of Congress, where lawmakers are grappling with the issue of how to regulate the tech giants. Some are pushing for legislation that would break up the companies, while others are advocating for a more nuanced approach that would address the specific issues at hand.\n\nIn the meantime, the public is left to weigh the pros and cons of the tech giants' dominance. While they have undoubtedly brought many benefits, their monopoly power and lack of transparency have also raised concerns about their impact on society.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the days of unchecked dominance by the tech giants are numbered. Whether through regulation, competition, or a combination of both, the industry is likely to undergo significant changes in the years to come. The question is, what will be the outcome, and how will it shape the future of the digital economy?",

        "Text": "The official recognition of Impress as a regulator moves us one step closer to yet another confrontation between press and parliament. By itself, the decision by the Press Recognition Panel (PRP) doesn't mean much. But should this government, or any government in the future, decide to implement section 40 of the crime and courts act, it will become hugely significant. Even so, in advance of that law kicking in, newspaper publishers are anything but delighted by the recognition of Impress under the terms of the royal charter. They have created their own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which they are determined will not seek recognition because they view the charter as an instrument of the state and therefore inimical to press freedom. The move has sparked a heated debate between the government and the newspaper industry, with some arguing that the recognition of Impress is a necessary step towards ensuring accountability and transparency in the media, while others claim it is a threat to press freedom.\n\nIpso, which was established in 2014, has been critical of the royal charter and the PRP's decision to recognize Impress. In a statement, Ipso's chairman, Sir Alan Moses, said: \"We believe that the royal charter is an attempt to impose a state-backed regulator on the press, which would undermine the independence and freedom of the press.\"\n\nThe newspaper industry has long been resistant to the idea of a state-backed regulator, arguing that it would give the government too much control over the media. Ipso has been working to establish its own regulatory framework, which it claims is more effective and less bureaucratic than Impress.\n\nHowever, supporters of Impress argue that it is the only regulator that has been recognized by the PRP, and that it is the only one that has the necessary powers to hold newspapers accountable for their actions. Impress has been critical of Ipso, claiming that it is not a real regulator and that it is not doing enough to protect the public from inaccurate and misleading reporting.\n\nThe recognition of Impress has also raised concerns about the impact it could have on the media industry. Some fear that it could lead to a decline in the quality of journalism, as newspapers may be forced to prioritize compliance with Impress's regulations over producing high-quality content.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the government has defended its decision to recognize Impress, saying that it is necessary to ensure that the media is held accountable for its actions. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: \"The recognition of Impress is an important step towards ensuring that the media is held accountable for its actions. We believe that a robust regulatory framework is necessary to protect the public and to ensure that the media is free to operate without fear of reprisal.\"\n\nThe debate is likely to continue in the coming weeks and months, as the government and the newspaper industry continue to clash over the issue. The recognition of Impress has raised important questions about the role of the media in society, and the balance between press freedom and accountability. Ultimately, the outcome will depend on the government's willingness to listen to the concerns of the newspaper industry and to work towards a solution that balances the need for accountability with the need for press freedom.",

FiOS introduced a less expensive cable package, called FiOS Custom TV, on Sunday that gives customers a base package of 35 channels, then allows them to choose two out of seven category-specific packages, like sports (ESPN, Fox Sports 1) or pop culture (Comedy Central, MTV). The package costs $55 a month, a discount from the average household cable bill of $90, according to the research firm SNL Kagan. Several media companies were caught off guard, and ESPN quickly came out against the new offering. Now Disney, the network's parent company, has criticized it as well. \"The issue here is that Verizon made unilateral decisions on how to offer ABC Family, Disney Channels, ESPN and ESPN2 that are in violation of our existing agreements,\" Disney said on Wednesday. Verizon Responds to Disney's Criticism, Stands by FiOS Custom TV\n\nVerizon Wireless, the telecommunications giant, has responded to Disney's criticism of its new FiOS Custom TV offering, saying that the company is committed to providing customers with a more flexible and affordable cable experience.\n\nIn a statement, Verizon said that it had worked closely with Disney and other networks to develop the new package, and that it had received approval from all parties involved. \"We believe that FiOS Custom TV is a great option for customers who want to customize their TV experience and pay only for the channels they want,\" said a Verizon spokesperson.\n\nHowever, Disney's criticism has raised concerns among other networks, which are worried that Verizon's new package may not be in compliance with existing agreements. \"We are reviewing the situation and will take necessary action to protect our rights,\" said a spokesperson for ABC, another Disney-owned network.\n\nThe dispute has also sparked concerns among consumer advocates, who are worried that the new package may not provide customers with the same level of access to popular channels as traditional cable packages. \"While FiOS Custom TV may be cheaper, it may not offer the same range of channels as traditional packages,\" said a spokesperson for the consumer advocacy group, Public Knowledge.\n\nDespite the controversy, Verizon remains committed to its new offering, and says that it will continue to work with networks to resolve any issues. \"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible TV experience, and we will continue to work with our partners to make that happen,\" said the Verizon spokesperson.\n\nThe dispute between Verizon and Disney highlights the ongoing challenges facing the cable industry, as consumers increasingly turn to streaming services and online content. As the industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how cable providers will adapt to changing consumer habits and preferences.",

        "Text": "Once people thought the Amazon was a near-uninhabited rainforest before the Europeans turned up, but researchers say they have found new evidence that it was in fact a hive of human activity and home to millions of people. A new study has revealed details of 81 sites in the previously uncharted territory of the Amazon's upper TapajÃ³s Basin, with settlements ranging from small villages just 30m wide to a large site covering 19 hectares. Researchers say the new discoveries are helping to unpick what the Amazon would have been like before Europeans arrived. \"The idea that the Amazon was a pristine forest, untouched by humans, home to scattered nomadic populations â€¦ we already knew that was not true,\" said Dr Jonas Gregorio de Souza, first author of the study from the University of Exeter. \"The big debate is how populations were distributed in pre-Columbian times in the Amazon.\" Writing in the journal Nature Communications, de Souza and colleagues explain how the sites were first discovered by satellite imagery of the area, revealed by deforestation. And how they show evidence of human activity in the form of earthworks. The researchers used a combination of satellite imagery, aerial photography, and ground-based surveys to identify and map the 81 sites, which span across an area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers. The study found that the settlements were not only larger than previously thought, but also more numerous and widespread.\n\nAccording to Dr. de Souza, the new discoveries are significant because they provide a more accurate picture of the Amazon's pre-Columbian population density. \"Our findings suggest that the Amazon was home to a much larger population than previously believed,\" he said. \"This challenges the traditional view of the Amazon as a sparsely populated region, and instead suggests that it was a densely populated area with complex societies.\"\n\nThe researchers also found evidence of agricultural activity, including ancient terracing and irrigation systems, which suggests that the inhabitants of the Amazon were able to sustain themselves through farming and other forms of subsistence. This is significant because it challenges the idea that the Amazon was simply a vast wilderness, untouched by human activity.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of the Amazon's cultural and environmental history. \"The Amazon has been shaped by human activity for thousands of years, and our findings highlight the importance of considering the region's pre-Columbian past in conservation and management efforts,\" said Dr. de Souza.\n\nThe research team is now working to further investigate the sites and learn more about the people who lived there. They are using a range of techniques, including archaeological excavations, to uncover more information about the settlements and the people who lived there.\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked renewed interest in the Amazon's pre-Columbian history, and have raised questions about the impact of European colonization on the region's indigenous populations. \"The Amazon is a region that has been shaped by human activity for thousands of years, and it's essential that we learn more about its rich cultural and environmental heritage,\" said Dr. de Souza.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Communications and is available online.",

        "Text": "Theresa May is not back-pedalling on her pledge to give workers a voice on company boards, the business secretary has said in response to criticism of the government's announcement that it will not force companies to give employees a governance position. The government unveiled proposals on Tuesday to tackle corporate excess. May had raised the prospect of placing employee representatives on boards during her Conservative leadership campaign over the summer, but has since told businesses she will not make them do so. Greg Clark said the prime minister wanted workers to be represented, but not necessarily by having an employee on the board. \"We are not going to make it happen,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the government did not want to \"overturn what has been a successful system which has had the confidence of business around the world\". Clark's comments sparked widespread criticism from labor unions and opposition parties, who accused the government of reneging on its promise to give workers a greater say in corporate decision-making. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) described the proposal as \"a betrayal of the millions of workers who have been demanding a greater voice in the workplace.\"\n\nThe TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"The government's U-turn is a blow to workers' rights and a victory for corporate greed. Theresa May's promise to give workers a seat on the board was a key part of her leadership campaign, and now it seems she has abandoned that commitment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Labour Party has called for the government to reconsider its decision and introduce legislation to ensure that employees have a greater say in company governance. Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: \"The government's proposal is a watered-down version of what Theresa May promised during her leadership campaign. We urge the government to rethink its decision and introduce legislation to give workers a real say in company decision-making.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, the government remains adamant that its proposal is the right approach. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \"The government is committed to giving workers a greater voice in the workplace, but we also recognize the importance of maintaining a successful business environment. Our proposal strikes a balance between the two.\"\n\nThe proposal has also been met with skepticism from some business leaders, who argue that it could lead to unnecessary bureaucracy and undermine the ability of companies to make decisions quickly. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has expressed concerns that the proposal could lead to \"unnecessary complexity\" and \"red tape.\"\n\nHowever, others have argued that the proposal is a missed opportunity to address the growing wealth gap and ensure that companies are more accountable to their employees. The High Pay Centre, a think tank that campaigns for greater transparency and accountability in corporate governance, has called for the government to introduce legislation to give workers a greater say in company decision-making.\n\nThe debate over the government's proposal is likely to continue in the coming weeks, with both sides presenting their arguments to MPs and the public. The outcome will have significant implications for the future of corporate governance in the UK and the role of workers in company decision-making.",

After it was revealed that the company had made four settlements over allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice staff, its co-founders, Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi, released a statement acknowledging that the company had taken action over \"multiple instances of unacceptable behaviour\". They were responding to claims made by past employees in a New York Times investigation. In a statement, Smith and Alvi said: \"Cultural elements from our past, dysfunction and mismanagement were allowed to flourish unchecked. That includes a detrimental 'boys' club' culture that fostered inappropriate behaviour that permeated throughout the company. \"From the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive,\" it went on. One woman told the New York Times the magazine had a culture of complicity where \"even the most progressive people look the other way\". The statement from Smith and Alvi acknowledged that the company's leadership had failed to address the issue, allowing the \"boys' club\" culture to persist for too long. The apology came after a New York Times investigation uncovered allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Vice staff, including four settlements made by the company.\n\nThe investigation revealed a culture of complicity, where even well-meaning individuals turned a blind eye to inappropriate behavior. One former employee, who wished to remain anonymous, described the culture as \"toxic\" and said that it was not uncommon for women to be subjected to inappropriate comments, gestures, and advances.\n\nThe allegations against Vice staff included claims of sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, and retaliation against employees who spoke out against the behavior. The investigation also found that the company's leadership was aware of the allegations but failed to take adequate action to address the issue.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Vice has announced that it will be implementing new policies and procedures to prevent and address sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace. The company has also established an anonymous reporting system for employees to report incidents of inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe apology from Smith and Alvi has been welcomed by some, who have praised the company for taking responsibility for its failures. However, others have expressed skepticism, saying that the apology comes too late and that more concrete action is needed to address the issue.\n\nVice is not the only company to be accused of fostering a \"boys' club\" culture. The allegations have sparked a wider conversation about the prevalence of sexual harassment and misconduct in the media and entertainment industries.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder that companies must take proactive steps to prevent and address inappropriate behavior in the workplace. It also highlights the importance of creating a culture of respect and inclusivity, where all employees feel valued and supported.\n\nAs Vice moves forward, it will be important for the company to demonstrate a commitment to change and to take concrete steps to ensure that its workplace is safe and respectful for all employees.",

        "Text": "Facebook has launched a new tool to allow users to see if they've liked or followed Russian propaganda accounts, though the feature probably won't reach many of the millions of people exposed to fake news during US and UK elections. Facebook on Friday quietly rolled out a new page that says, \"How can I see if I've liked or followed a Facebook Page or Instagram account created by the Internet Research Agency? \", referencing the infamous Russian entity and \"troll army\" accused of trying to influence American elections and British politics on social media. The new tool, which is currently only available in the United States, allows users to search for a list of Russian propaganda accounts that Facebook has identified as being created by the Internet Research Agency (IRA). The IRA is a Russian entity that has been accused of spreading disinformation and propaganda on social media to influence the outcome of elections and political events.\n\nTo access the tool, users can visit the Facebook Help Center and search for \"How can I see if I've liked or followed a Facebook Page or Instagram account created by the Internet Research Agency?\" From there, they will be taken to a page that lists the names of the Russian propaganda accounts that they have liked or followed.\n\nThe tool is part of Facebook's efforts to increase transparency and accountability in the wake of the 2016 US presidential election, during which Russian propaganda accounts were accused of spreading false information and influencing the outcome of the election. The tool is also seen as a way for Facebook to comply with Congressional demands for more information about Russian interference in the election.\n\nHowever, the tool is not without its limitations. For one, it only applies to Facebook and Instagram accounts that were created by the IRA, and does not include accounts created by other Russian entities or individuals. Additionally, the tool does not provide users with information about whether they have interacted with Russian propaganda content on other social media platforms, such as Twitter or YouTube.\n\nDespite these limitations, the tool is seen as a step in the right direction by many experts and lawmakers. \"This is a significant step forward in terms of transparency and accountability,\" said Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia who has been a leading critic of Russian interference in the election. \"But we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that social media platforms are doing everything they can to prevent foreign interference in our elections.\"\n\nThe launch of the tool comes as Facebook is facing increased scrutiny over its role in spreading disinformation and propaganda on its platform. In recent months, the company has faced a series of scandals and controversies, including the revelation that it had allowed Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, to harvest the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent.\n\nIn response to these scandals, Facebook has implemented a number of new policies and procedures aimed at preventing the spread of disinformation and propaganda on its platform. These include the creation of a new fact-checking program, which uses artificial intelligence to identify and flag false information, and the implementation of stricter guidelines for political advertising.\n\nDespite these efforts, many experts and lawmakers remain skeptical about Facebook's ability to effectively prevent the spread of disinformation and propaganda on its platform. \"Facebook has a long way to go before it can be trusted to keep our elections safe from foreign interference,\" said Senator Warner. \"But this is a step in the right direction, and we will continue to work with the company to ensure that it is doing everything it can to prevent this kind of interference in the future.\"",

John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, was a marine. Other members of the original \"Mercury Seven\" were drawn from the air force. Fifty-eight years later, the US space agency is looking further afield, including among its latest crop of 12 astronaut candidates a marine biologist, a doctor, a university professor and an engineer, as well as a number with a military background. Unlike the Mercury Seven, five of the class of 2017 are women. The group, whittled down from a pool of 18,300 applicants, will be trained over the course of two years to help build and fly the newest Nasa vehicle, the Orion, which is designed for deep space exploration, with the potential to one day visit as asteroid or even Mars. Nasa is also seeking to partner with private industry on transporting astronauts to the international space station. The new class of astronauts, announced by Nasa on June 7, marks a significant shift in the agency's recruitment strategy. Gone are the days of relying solely on military pilots and test pilots to fill the ranks of its astronaut corps. Instead, Nasa is actively seeking out individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds, including academia, medicine, and the private sector.\n\nAmong the 12 new astronaut candidates are Dr. Anne McClain, a marine biologist who has spent years studying the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems. Dr. McClain, who is also a lieutenant colonel in the US Army, will bring her expertise in environmental science to the astronaut corps.\n\nAnother candidate, Dr. Raja Chari, is a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Colorado. Chari has spent years researching the behavior of fluids in microgravity environments, and his expertise will be invaluable in the development of new spacecraft systems.\n\nThe class of 2017 also includes a number of engineers and scientists with private industry experience. For example, astronaut candidate Zena Cardman has spent years working as a research engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, where she developed new technologies for monitoring and mitigating the effects of natural disasters.\n\nThe inclusion of women in the new class of astronauts is also a significant milestone. Five of the 12 candidates are women, including Dr. McClain, Dr. Chari, and Cardman. This marks a significant increase from previous years, when women made up only a small percentage of Nasa's astronaut corps.\n\nThe new class of astronauts will undergo a rigorous two-year training program, during which they will learn the skills they need to operate the Orion spacecraft and perform spacewalks. They will also work closely with Nasa's engineers and scientists to develop the agency's new deep space exploration capabilities.\n\nIn addition to its recruitment of new astronauts, Nasa is also seeking to partner with private industry on transporting astronauts to the international space station. The agency has announced plans to award contracts to private companies to develop new spacecraft systems that can carry astronauts to the space station and back.\n\nThe move is seen as a key step in Nasa's efforts to develop a sustainable human presence in space. By partnering with private industry, the agency hopes to reduce its reliance on government funding and develop new technologies and capabilities that can be used to support deep space exploration.\n\nOverall, the new class of astronauts and Nasa's plans to partner with private industry mark a significant shift in the agency's approach to space exploration. As the agency looks to the future, it is clear that the next generation of astronauts will be drawn from a diverse range of backgrounds and will play a critical role in shaping the course of human spaceflight.",

Folding bicycle maker Brompton will be hoping to avoid the same accusation from its legions of suited and booted commuter devotees when it too \"goes electric\". From next year, the business plans to start producing fold-up electric bicycles aimed at people who find pedalling too much like hard work. The new bikes employ pedelec technology, which stores energy from pedalling and releases it when the rider reaches a hill. The Brompton system has been developed in partnership with Formula One team Williams and is a slimmed down version of the Kers (kinetic energy recovery system) technology that racing cars use to gain extra speed. \"The guy on his Â£2,500 carbon-frame road bike will wonder why you're cruising past him in a suit,\" said Will Butler-Adams, the chief executive of Brompton. The move into electric bicycles is part of an ambitious global expansion plan orchestrated from a gleaming new factory in the west London suburb of Greenford. At 84,000 sq ft, the floorspace of the site is bigger than the pitch at Wembley Stadium and four times the size of Brompton's previous home. The move cost the company about Â£2m, a sum equal to its pre-tax profit in 2015, achieved on turnover of Â£27.5m. While the factory itself is shiny, new and packed with new technology, the work that goes on here hinges on some old-fashioned craftsmanship. Abdul El Saidi, 56, is Brompton's brazing manager. He is responsible for passing on the decades-old craft, which is similar to welding, to new trainees. As the factory whirs to life, Abdul El Saidi's skilled hands move deftly, applying heat to the metal tubes that will form the skeleton of the new electric bicycles. His years of experience have honed his technique, and he takes pride in knowing that the craftsmanship he imparts to the next generation of Brompton employees will be just as precise.\n\nThe move to electric bicycles marks a significant shift for the company, which has built a reputation on its iconic folding bikes. But Butler-Adams is confident that the new technology will appeal to a wider audience. \"We're not trying to replace our traditional bikes, but we're recognizing that there's a growing demand for electric assist,\" he said. \"Our research suggests that 20% of our customers are already using e-bikes, and we think that number will only continue to grow.\"\n\nThe partnership with Williams F1 has been instrumental in developing the pedelec technology, which Butler-Adams believes will give Brompton a competitive edge in the market. \"We've taken the best of F1 technology and adapted it for the mass market,\" he said. \"It's not just about the tech, though â€“ it's about the design and the user experience. We want our customers to feel like they're getting a premium product.\"\n\nThe new factory, which is expected to produce around 100,000 bikes per year, is a testament to Brompton's ambitious plans for global expansion. The company has already established a presence in the US, Japan, and Europe, and Butler-Adams is keen to continue this growth trajectory. \"We're not just looking at the UK and Europe â€“ we're looking at the entire world,\" he said. \"We think our brand has global appeal, and we're excited to take it to new markets.\"\n\nAs the factory floor hums with activity, it's clear that Brompton is poised for a bright future. The company's commitment to craftsmanship, innovation, and customer satisfaction has earned it a loyal following, and the move into electric bicycles is likely to attract a new wave of enthusiasts. Whether or not the company will avoid the \"Judas\" treatment from its loyal fan base remains to be seen, but one thing is certain â€“ Brompton is ready to take on the challenge.",

Early in her career, she developed a highly sensitive method of investigating minute bloodstains to determine the ABO blood type of an individual. It was adopted worldwide as the Nicholls and Pereira (or N&P) method, Lewis Nicholls being her laboratory director. The Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory, which Margaret joined in 1947, would become an important centre for research into the rapidly expanding sciences devoted to the investigation of crime. Offences against the person involve biologists in the study of all body fluids â€“ saliva and semen as well as blood. In order to pursue these studies, scientists at the laboratory, in common with researchers everywhere, routinely used themselves as guinea pigs, and Margaret was heard to remark that \"in this job you don't have an orifice to call your own\". All of this was many years before the introduction of DNA analysis in the 1980s brought a completely new focus to the identification of blood and body fluids. By then, as controller of the Forensic Science Service, she was in a position to implement the groundbreaking discovery. For Margaret, it had been a steady progression over 40 years from the bottom of the civil service to the top. She was appointed CBE in 1985. Daughter of Harold Pereira, a telecommunications engineer, and his wife, Margaret (nee Hartigan, and known as Nina), a former secretary, Margaret was born in Bexley, Kent. She was educated at Dartford county grammar school and hoped to become a doctor. Margaret Pereira's early interest in science and medicine was evident from a young age. However, it was not until she joined the Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory in 1947 that she discovered her true calling. Under the guidance of her laboratory director, Lewis Nicholls, she developed a passion for forensic science and quickly made a name for herself as a talented and dedicated researcher.\n\nAs her expertise grew, so did her responsibilities. In the 1950s, she was tasked with leading a team of scientists in the development of a new method for analyzing bloodstains. This work would ultimately lead to the creation of the Nicholls and Pereira (or N&P) method, which became the gold standard for forensic blood analysis worldwide.\n\nThroughout her career, Margaret Pereira was known for her tireless work ethic and her ability to inspire and mentor her colleagues. She was a natural leader, and her dedication to her work earned her the respect and admiration of her peers.\n\nIn the 1970s, Margaret was appointed as the controller of the Forensic Science Service, a position she held until her retirement in the 1990s. During her time in this role, she played a key part in implementing the use of DNA analysis in forensic science, a development that revolutionized the field and enabled investigators to identify individuals with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nMargaret Pereira's contributions to forensic science were recognized with numerous honors and awards. In 1985, she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her services to forensic science. She was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and a member of the International Association for Forensic Sciences.\n\nDespite her many achievements, Margaret Pereira remained humble and dedicated to her work. She continued to work as a consultant in forensic science until her death, aged 88, leaving behind a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come.",

        "Text": "Men working for Barclays' international division got paid bonuses that were more than double those of their female colleagues last year, with far fewer women occupying senior roles. Released on the day Barclays slid to a near-Â£2bn loss, the bank's 2017 gender pay gap report shows there are big pay gaps between men and women in all three parts of the banking group in the UK. For basic pay excluding bonuses there was a median hourly gap of 43.5% at Barclays International, which includes the investment banking business. In the UK high street bank the gap was 14.2%. This represents the difference between the midpoints in the range of hourly pay for men and women. The gap between men and women was far higher for bonuses â€“ 73% at the international division and nearly 50% at the UK high street business. The 73% gap means that for every Â£100,000 of bonuses handed out to men working at Barclays International women were only getting Â£27,000. The report also highlights a significant disparity in the number of women holding senior roles within the bank. According to the data, only 22% of senior managers at Barclays International were women, compared to 38% in the UK high street business. This lack of representation at the top levels of the organization is a major contributing factor to the significant pay gaps, experts say.\n\n\"Until we see more women in senior positions, it's going to be difficult to close the pay gap,\" said Dr. Sarah Jones, a leading expert on gender equality in the workplace. \"Women are often socialized to prioritize helping others and avoiding conflict, which can make it harder for them to negotiate for higher pay and promotions. When women are in leadership positions, they can help create a more inclusive culture that supports women's advancement.\"\n\nThe report also reveals that the pay gap is not limited to senior roles. Even among entry-level employees, women at Barclays International were paid 25% less than their male counterparts on average. This suggests that the bank's pay gap is not simply a result of women being clustered in lower-paying roles, but rather a systemic issue that affects women across the organization.\n\nBarclays has promised to take steps to address the pay gap, including increasing diversity training for employees and implementing a new pay framework that takes into account the value of work done by employees, rather than just their job title or department. The bank has also committed to increasing the number of women in senior roles, with a goal of reaching 30% representation by 2025.\n\nWhile some have praised Barclays for taking steps to address the issue, others have criticized the bank for not doing enough. \"A 73% pay gap is unacceptable, and it's not just a matter of 'old boys' networks' or unconscious bias,\" said Emma Taylor, a former Barclays employee who left the bank due to concerns about gender equality. \"It's a systemic issue that requires systemic change. I hope the bank's promises are more than just words on a page.\"\n\nAs the banking industry continues to grapple with the issue of gender pay gaps, Barclays' report serves as a stark reminder of the work that still needs to be done. With the bank's commitment to increasing diversity and addressing the pay gap, there is hope that change is on the horizon. However, only time will tell if the bank's efforts will be enough to close the gap and create a more inclusive and equitable workplace for all employees.",

Lovelorn Crickets, Scientists Say\n\nIn November 2016, American diplomats in Cuba complained of persistent, high-pitched sounds followed by a range of symptoms, including headaches, nausea and hearing loss. Exams of nearly two dozen of them eventually revealed signs of concussions or other brain injuries, and speculation about the cause turned to weapons that blast sound or microwaves. Amid an international uproar, a recording of the sinister droning was widely circulated in the news media. But after a thorough investigation and analysis, a team of scientists has now attributed the mysterious sounds to a more unlikely culprit: lovelorn crickets.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Science, the peculiar sounds were caused by a specific species of cricket, known as the \"giant weta\" (Deinacrida heteracantha), which is native to Cuba. The researchers found that the crickets' mating rituals, which involve producing high-pitched chirps, were the source of the eerie sounds that had been disturbing the diplomats.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Fernando Montealegre-Z, an entomologist at the University of Oxford, revealed that the crickets' chirps were amplified by the unique acoustic properties of the diplomats' living quarters, which were located in a densely vegetated area.\n\n\"It was a classic case of acoustic resonance,\" Dr. Montealegre-Z explained in an interview. \"The crickets' chirps were bouncing off the walls and ceilings of the buildings, creating a feedback loop that made the sounds seem much louder and more intense than they actually were.\"\n\nThe researchers used a combination of field observations, audio recordings, and acoustic modeling to confirm their findings. They also discovered that the crickets' chirps were not unique to the diplomats' living quarters, but were present throughout the surrounding area.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the diplomatic community, as they suggest that the mysterious sounds were not the result of a sophisticated attack, but rather a natural phenomenon. The news has also sparked renewed interest in the fascinating world of insect communication, and the complex ways in which animals use sound to interact with each other.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, the U.S. State Department has issued a statement acknowledging the scientific consensus and expressing gratitude for the researchers' efforts. \"We appreciate the thorough investigation and the conclusion that the sounds were caused by a natural phenomenon,\" said a spokesperson. \"We will continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our diplomats and their families, and we will work to ensure that they have the necessary resources and support to carry out their duties effectively.\"\n\nAs for the crickets, they seem to be enjoying the newfound attention. In a bizarre twist, a group of enthusiasts has started a social media campaign to raise awareness about the importance of preserving the crickets' habitat and protecting their unique mating rituals. The campaign, which has gone viral, features a series of humorous memes and videos showcasing the crickets' impressive chirping abilities.\n\nIn the end, the mystery of the haunted sounds in Cuba has been solved, and it's a tale that's equal parts fascinating and absurd. As one Twitter user quipped, \"Who knew that the sounds of love and courtship could be so... haunting?\"",

        "Text": "As the Brexit farce proceeds, it is worth remembering that before David Cameron made his catastrophic error of calling a referendum, the EU was way down the list of British people's concerns in almost every opinion poll. Indeed, not even in the first 11. The central point is that Brexit became the focus for all manner of discontents, many of them understandable. But leaving the EU would indubitably not be the answer to them, and would be guaranteed not to make the discontents into \"glorious summer\". Indeed, it would exacerbate the sources of this discontent. Why? Surely it is becoming increasingly obvious that growing swaths of British industry â€“ much of it foreign-owned by conglomerates that enjoy the advantages of the single market â€“ are cutting back their investment plans and in many cases planning to relocate to mainland Europe. The prospect of the diminution of the economic base of the country has dire implications not only for employment and living standards, but also for the tax base on which living standards depend. The consequences of a no-deal Brexit are already being felt, with many businesses scrambling to prepare for the potential disruption. The uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU has led to a decline in investment and a rise in job losses, particularly in industries that rely heavily on trade with the EU.\n\nOne of the most affected sectors is the automotive industry, with many manufacturers announcing plans to reduce production or halt operations altogether. The UK's largest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, has already announced plans to cut thousands of jobs and reduce production at its UK plants. Similarly, Toyota has announced plans to halt production at its UK plant, citing the uncertainty surrounding Brexit as a major factor.\n\nThe impact of Brexit on the automotive industry is not limited to job losses and reduced production. The sector is also facing significant supply chain disruptions, as companies struggle to navigate the complexities of trading with the EU outside of the single market. This has led to shortages of key components, such as semiconductors and batteries, which are essential for the production of modern vehicles.\n\nThe consequences of Brexit are not limited to the automotive industry. Other sectors, such as manufacturing, logistics, and finance, are also feeling the effects of the uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU. The decline in investment and the rise in job losses are likely to have a ripple effect throughout the economy, leading to a decline in living standards and a reduction in the tax base.\n\nIn addition to the economic consequences, Brexit is also having a significant impact on the UK's relationships with its international partners. The UK's departure from the EU has led to a decline in diplomatic relations and a rise in tensions with other countries, particularly those in the EU. This is likely to have long-term consequences for the UK's ability to negotiate trade agreements and maintain its influence on the global stage.\n\nIn conclusion, the consequences of Brexit are far-reaching and devastating. The uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the EU has led to a decline in investment, a rise in job losses, and a reduction in the tax base. The impact of Brexit is not limited to the economy, but is also having a significant impact on the UK's relationships with its international partners. As the UK continues to navigate the complexities of its departure from the EU, it is essential that policymakers prioritize the well-being of the British people and work to mitigate the negative consequences of Brexit.",

        "Text": "Almost one in three people aged 80 and older are providing vital, unpaid care for their loved ones, despite many suffering severe health issues of their own, according to research. The figure has increased by nearly a quarter in eight years. This invisible army of oldest and most vulnerable people in the UK provide a total of 23m hours of unpaid care a week, or 1.2bn hours of care a year, according to figures from Age UK. \"Nearly a million over 80-year-olds are gifting the government a whopping Â£23bn a year and it's high time these fantastic older people got something back in return,\" said Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK. The study, which analyzed data from the 2011 and 2019 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, found that 29% of people aged 80 and over were providing unpaid care, compared to 24% in 2011. This increase is likely due to the growing number of older people living longer and the rising need for care among younger generations.\n\nThe research also revealed that those providing unpaid care are often struggling with their own health issues, with 44% reporting a chronic health condition, such as diabetes, arthritis, or heart disease. Furthermore, 27% of carers reported experiencing depression, while 21% reported anxiety.\n\nDespite their own health challenges, the majority of carers (83%) reported that providing care for their loved ones brought them joy and fulfillment. However, many also reported feeling overwhelmed, with 45% saying they were \"often\" or \"almost always\" exhausted.\n\nAge UK is calling for greater recognition and support for these carers, who are often forced to sacrifice their own well-being and social lives to provide care. The charity is urging the government to provide more funding for social care services and to recognize the value of carers by offering them greater support and benefits.\n\n\"This is a critical issue that affects not just the carers themselves, but also the wider community,\" said Abrahams. \"These older people are not just providing care, they are also keeping their families and communities together. It's time for us to show our appreciation and support for their hard work and dedication.\"\n\nThe government has pledged to increase funding for social care services, but many experts believe that more needs to be done to support carers. The UK's social care system is currently facing a significant crisis, with many councils struggling to provide adequate services due to funding shortages.\n\nIn the meantime, Age UK is offering support and resources to carers, including a helpline and online resources. The charity is also advocating for policy changes that would provide greater recognition and support for carers.\n\nAs the UK's population continues to age, it is likely that the number of carers will continue to rise. It is essential that we recognize the vital role that these carers play in our society and provide them with the support and recognition they deserve.",

        "Text": "What has happened to Rupert Murdoch's bid to buy Sky? The UK competition regulator investigating Rupert Murdoch's Â£11.7bn bid has said the deal is against the public interest because it would give the Murdoch family \"too much control over news providers in the UK, and too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda\". The deal, which would see Murdoch's 21st Century Fox buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own, would add full control of Sky News to Murdoch assets which include the Sun, Times, Sunday Times and Wall Street Journal. Does this mean the deal is dead? No. The Competition and Markets Authority has launched a three-week consultation examining three options relating to Sky News that could allow the deal to go through. The nuclear option is to stop the deal. The second is a potential spin-off or sale of Sky News. The third is to keep Sky News as part of Sky but to beef up its independence to address concerns about Murdoch's influence, such as an independent board and funding guarantee. The consultation period, which began on February 1, has sparked debate among industry experts, regulators, and lawmakers about the implications of the deal on the UK's media landscape. While the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) findings have raised concerns about the concentration of media ownership, some argue that the deal could still be approved with certain conditions.\n\n\"Rupert Murdoch's bid for Sky is not necessarily dead,\" said Dr. Rachel Gibson, a media studies expert at the University of Sussex. \"The CMA's report highlights the potential risks of the deal, but it's not a foregone conclusion. The regulator is seeking public input to inform its decision, and it's possible that a compromise could be reached.\"\n\nThe CMA's consultation period has sparked a flurry of submissions from media organizations, politicians, and the public. Many have expressed concerns about the potential impact on Sky News, with some arguing that the channel's independence could be compromised under Murdoch's ownership.\n\n\"The sale of Sky News to Murdoch would be a disaster for the UK's media landscape,\" said Tom Watson, a Labour Party MP and former Shadow Culture Secretary. \"The channel has a reputation for impartiality and independence, and it's essential that it remains free from the influence of a single media mogul.\"\n\nHowever, others argue that the deal could bring benefits to Sky News, such as increased investment and resources. \"Rupert Murdoch has a track record of investing in his media assets, and Sky News could benefit from his financial backing,\" said James Murdoch, Rupert's son and a key figure in the proposed deal.\n\nThe CMA's consultation period is set to conclude on February 22, with a final decision expected in the coming weeks. While the outcome is far from certain, one thing is clear: the fate of Rupert Murdoch's bid for Sky will have significant implications for the UK's media landscape, and the public's right to access diverse and independent news sources.",

He testified that \"Google was super not happy, unpumped\" about Uber's work on self-driving vehicles. SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google's parent company, Alphabet, used to be like brothers. Google invested in Uber. The internet giant's top lawyer even served on Uber's board of directors. But a bitter feud has erupted between the two companies, with Travis Kalanick, Uber's former CEO, taking the stand in a federal courthouse in San Francisco on Wednesday to testify in a high-stakes trade secrets trial. Kalanick's testimony revealed the depth of the rift, with him stating that Google was \"super not happy, unpumped\" about Uber's work on self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe trial is centered around allegations that Uber stole trade secrets from Waymo, including the design of its LiDAR sensor, a critical component of self-driving cars. Waymo claims that Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer who worked on the LiDAR sensor, downloaded thousands of confidential files from Google's servers before leaving the company to join Uber in 2016.\n\nKalanick's testimony provided a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the companies' relationship, which began to fray in 2015 when Google invested $258 million in Uber. At the time, it was seen as a strategic partnership, with Google's top lawyer, David Drummond, serving on Uber's board of directors.\n\nHowever, things took a turn for the worse when Levandowski left Google to join Uber, taking the LiDAR sensor technology with him. Waymo claims that Uber's subsequent development of its own LiDAR sensor was made possible by the stolen trade secrets.\n\nKalanick's testimony on Wednesday sought to downplay the significance of the stolen files, with him stating that Uber's own engineers had developed the technology independently. However, Waymo's lawyers have argued that the stolen files were crucial to Uber's development of its self-driving technology, and that the company's claims of independent development are false.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue for several weeks, with both sides presenting evidence and witnesses to support their claims. The outcome could have significant implications for the future of the self-driving car industry, with both Waymo and Uber vying for dominance in the rapidly growing market.\n\nIn the meantime, the feud between the two companies shows no signs of abating, with Waymo's lawyers accusing Uber of engaging in a \"pattern of deception\" and Kalanick's testimony providing a glimpse into the bitter rivalry that has developed between the two former partners.",

So he envisages Sorrell stepping down, if at all, in 2031 when he's 86, a year older than Rupert Murdoch is now; by which time, Monkey very roughly estimates (extrapolating from recent increases), the miniature marketing colossus's total annual pay package should be around Â£285m. â€¢ How many lesbians have been killed on screen in primetime shows this year? Monkey can tell you it's 12. Not many, you might think, but with only 35 lesbian characters on peaktime shows in the UK and US last year that's quite a high number. The article then takes a surprising turn, highlighting the stark reality of lesbian representation on primetime television. The statistics are jarring, and the stark contrast between the number of lesbian characters and the number of on-screen deaths is a pressing concern for advocates of diversity and inclusion.\n\nAccording to the article, the 12 lesbian characters who met their demise on screen this year are just a small fraction of the 35 total lesbian characters that appeared on primetime shows in the UK and US last year. This raises important questions about the portrayal of lesbian women in media and the impact it has on their representation and visibility.\n\nIndustry experts point to the lack of complex and nuanced lesbian characters on screen, often relegating them to stereotypical roles or using them as plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce harmful attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe article also highlights the need for more diverse and inclusive storytelling, with a focus on creating complex and realistic lesbian characters that challenge stereotypes and promote understanding and acceptance.\n\nIn the midst of this debate, Johnny Hornby's comments about his potential future at WPP seem almost trivial in comparison. While his denial of any interest in succeeding Martin Sorrell may be genuine, it's hard not to wonder if he's simply trying to deflect attention from the more pressing issues facing the marketing industry.\n\nAs the article concludes, it's clear that there's much work to be done to create a more inclusive and diverse media landscape. The statistics may be alarming, but they also provide a clear call to action for industry professionals and advocates alike. It's time to take a closer look at the way we portray lesbian characters on screen and work towards creating a more accurate and respectful representation of the LGBTQ+ community.",

        "Text": "An early scene in the coming movie \"Kingsman: The Golden Circle,\" the sequel to the hit starring Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson, unfolds in a cave and involves the discovery of a dusty safe with a bottle of old bourbon. It was an ideal spot for a product placement. But the director, Matthew Vaughn, took that common commercial device and reversed it. What is in the safe is Statesman bourbon, a spinoff of the longstanding Old Forester brand produced by Brown-Forman of Louisville, Ky., since 1870. It is not a fictional spirit: Statesman bourbon has been quietly appearing on liquor store shelves since spring. By introducing its product before the release of the movie, Old Forester is not only hoping to capitalize on the cachet of the Kingsman characters discussing and enjoying Statesman bourbon. It is also trying to establish what marketers are seeking more than ever: authenticity. \"This is authentic storytelling with the product in there,\" Mr. Vaughn said. The move marks a significant departure from traditional product placement strategies, where a brand's product is often seamlessly integrated into a movie or TV show without drawing attention to itself. By featuring Statesman bourbon as a central element in the film, Old Forester is aiming to create a sense of authenticity and credibility for its brand.\n\n\"We're not just slapping our product into the movie,\" said Sam Meacham, the director of brand management for Old Forester. \"We're working closely with the filmmakers to make sure that Statesman bourbon is woven into the narrative in a way that feels organic and true to the story.\"\n\nThe partnership between Old Forester and Matthew Vaughn's production company, Marv Films, began several years ago, when the brand's marketing team reached out to the director with an idea for a unique product placement. Vaughn, who is known for his attention to detail and commitment to authenticity, was immediately on board with the concept.\n\n\"I think what sets us apart is that we're not just looking to promote a product,\" said Vaughn. \"We're looking to tell a story that happens to feature our product. We're not trying to manipulate the audience or make them feel like they're being sold something. We're trying to create a genuine experience that people will remember and want to be a part of.\"\n\nThe result is a movie that not only showcases Statesman bourbon in a positive light, but also tells a compelling story about the brand's history and heritage. The film's protagonist, Eggsy Unwin (played by Taron Egerton), is a bourbon enthusiast who discovers Statesman bourbon in the safe and becomes obsessed with it. Throughout the movie, he shares his love of the spirit with his friends and allies, showcasing its smooth, rich flavor and rich history.\n\nFor Old Forester, the partnership with Kingsman represents a major opportunity to reach a new and younger audience. The brand has traditionally been associated with older, more traditional bourbon drinkers, but the partnership with Kingsman is designed to appeal to a broader range of consumers.\n\n\"We're not just trying to sell bourbon to people who already like bourbon,\" said Meacham. \"We're trying to create a brand that people will fall in love with, regardless of whether they're bourbon drinkers or not. And we think that Kingsman is the perfect platform to do that.\"\n\nThe movie, which is set to be released in September, marks the beginning of a new era for Old Forester. The brand plans to continue working with Marv Films on future projects, and is also exploring other opportunities to integrate its product into popular culture.\n\n\"We're excited to see where this partnership takes us,\" said Vaughn. \"We're not just looking to promote a product â€“ we're looking to create a movement. And we think that Statesman bourbon is the perfect spirit to lead the way.\"",

Damian Collins, chair of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport select committee, which is looking into so-called \"fake news\", has given the companies until 18 January to correct their failure to hand over information he requested about Russian misinformation campaigns on their platforms. \"There has to be a way of scrutinising the procedures that companies like Facebook put in place to help them identify known sources of disinformation, particularly when it's politically motivated and coming from another country,\" Collins said. Collins' warning comes as the committee has been investigating the spread of misinformation on social media platforms, particularly in the context of the 2016 EU referendum. The inquiry has already heard evidence from various experts and officials, including the UK's Electoral Commission, which has raised concerns about the potential impact of foreign interference on the democratic process.\n\nThe committee had requested information from Facebook and Twitter in October, seeking details on the spread of Russian-backed disinformation campaigns on their platforms during the referendum. However, the companies have so far failed to provide the requested information, citing concerns about data privacy and the complexity of the task.\n\nCollins has expressed frustration with the companies' lack of cooperation, saying that the failure to provide the requested information is \"unacceptable\" and that the committee is left with no choice but to consider imposing sanctions if the companies do not comply.\n\n\"If we don't get the information we need, we will have to consider what sanctions we can impose,\" Collins said. \"We can't just sit back and accept that these companies are not going to give us the information we need to do our job.\"\n\nThe committee has already written to Facebook and Twitter, urging them to provide the requested information by January 18. If the companies fail to comply, the committee has the power to summon executives to testify before the committee, and in extreme cases, to impose fines or other penalties.\n\nThe threat of sanctions has been welcomed by some experts, who have long been critical of the companies' lack of transparency and accountability in the face of Russian disinformation campaigns.\n\n\"It's about time that these companies are held accountable for their role in spreading disinformation,\" said Dr. Emma Briant, a disinformation expert at the University of Essex. \"The public has a right to know how their data is being used and manipulated, and the government has a responsibility to ensure that our democratic processes are not compromised by foreign interference.\"\n\nThe row highlights the ongoing tensions between the tech industry and lawmakers, who are increasingly concerned about the potential impact of social media on democracy. The controversy has also sparked renewed calls for greater regulation of the tech industry, with some arguing that the companies' lack of transparency and accountability is a major obstacle to addressing the spread of disinformation.\n\nIn response to the controversy, Facebook and Twitter have both issued statements saying that they are committed to transparency and cooperation with the committee. However, the companies have so far failed to provide the requested information, leaving lawmakers to wonder whether they are willing to comply with the inquiry's demands.\n\nAs the deadline for the companies' response approaches, the stakes are high. If Facebook and Twitter fail to provide the requested information, it could have significant implications for the companies' reputation and their ability to operate in the UK. The controversy also highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the tech industry, and the importance of lawmakers holding the companies to account for their actions.",

Computer screens can't keep me captive for long and I am liable to abandon routine in search of adventure. Being born in what I suspected was the wrong era for exploration, I'd often begrudge the absence of true adventure. Reading exotic accounts of past expeditions, I'd lament the loss of wilderness to the encroaching modern world: now littered with plastic bags, bustling bars, wifi hotspots and worse - people just like me. When committing to a PhD in science, I thought I might be a hapless slave, hunched over a microscope or chained to a desk muddling through mind-numbing calculations. Would I be destined to play up to a stereotype; to be an eccentric, hermitic boffin with a beard? (That last one would be difficult with two X chromosomes.) The best person to challenge my misconceptions of science came in the form of my future supervisor; beard-free, charismatic, down-to-earth and yet successful. With a long-standing association with polar research she opened a door that allowed me to work in some of the last truly wild places on earth: Antarctica and the subantarctic islands. Together we have been developing a new proxy for climate change. As I delved deeper into the world of science, I began to realize that my initial fears were unfounded. My supervisor's enthusiasm and passion for her work were contagious, and I found myself becoming increasingly engaged in the research. The prospect of working in some of the most remote and inhospitable environments on earth was exhilarating, and I knew that this was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.\n\nOur research focused on developing a new proxy for climate change, using sediment cores from the Antarctic and subantarctic islands. These cores contain a wealth of information about the Earth's climate history, and by analyzing them, we can gain valuable insights into the past and present state of our planet.\n\nAs we began our research, I was struck by the vastness and beauty of the Antarctic landscape. The towering glaciers, the endless expanse of ice, and the stark, windswept terrain were a far cry from the sterile, laboratory environment I had initially envisioned. And yet, it was in this unforgiving environment that we found the key to unlocking the secrets of climate change.\n\nOur research took us to some of the most remote and inaccessible regions of Antarctica, where we collected sediment cores from beneath the ice sheets. These cores were then analyzed in the laboratory, where we extracted information about the Earth's climate history.\n\nThe results were nothing short of astonishing. By analyzing the sediment cores, we were able to reconstruct the Earth's climate history over the past 10,000 years, revealing a complex and dynamic system that has been shaped by a multitude of factors. Our research showed that the Earth's climate has been warming over the past century, and that this warming is largely driven by human activities.\n\nThe implications of our research were profound. Our findings highlighted the urgent need for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. As I looked out at the breathtaking landscape of Antarctica, I knew that our research was not just about understanding the past, but about shaping the future of our planet.\n\nAs I reflect on my journey from a skeptical PhD student to a passionate researcher, I am reminded of the power of collaboration and the importance of challenging our assumptions. My supervisor's guidance and mentorship helped me to see the world of science in a new light, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this groundbreaking research.\n\nIn the end, my PhD journey was not about abandoning my sense of adventure, but about embracing a new kind of exploration â€“ one that takes us to the very edges of human knowledge and understanding. And as I look to the future, I know that the thrill of discovery is just beginning.",

What's less certain is what he plans to do with his fortune, and how he could reinvent philanthropy. On Thursday, after questions from The New York Times about the level of his giving, Mr. Bezos posted on Twitter a \"request for ideas\" for philanthropy. \"I'm thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time -- working on the long term,\" he wrote. \"For philanthropy, I find I'm drawn to the other end of the spectrum: the right now.\" Citing a homeless program in Seattle, Amazon's hometown, that the company is working with, he said he was seeking to help people \"at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,\" adding, \"If you have any ideas, just reply to this tweet...\" The message was classic Bezos -- challenging conventional wisdom, seeking the wisdom of the market and highlighting his various businesses. Yet it failed to answer a question that is likely to follow him more often if and when he becomes the richest man: What are his plans to give away some or all of his wealth? Mr. Bezos, who owns about 17 percent of Amazon, has enjoyed what could be the most rapid personal-wealth surge in history. As the world's wealthiest individual, Bezos' philanthropic endeavors will be closely watched and scrutinized. His sudden call for ideas on Twitter has sparked a flurry of responses, with many experts and ordinary citizens sharing their thoughts on how he could use his vast fortune to make a meaningful impact.\n\nSome have suggested that Bezos could focus on addressing the pressing issue of homelessness, given his company's involvement with the Seattle homeless program he mentioned in his tweet. Others have recommended that he invest in education, healthcare, or environmental causes, all of which are critical areas that require significant funding.\n\nBezos' emphasis on \"urgent need\" and \"lasting impact\" has also led some to speculate that he may be interested in supporting emergency response efforts or disaster relief organizations. His company, Amazon, has already demonstrated its ability to mobilize quickly in response to natural disasters, such as Hurricane Harvey, by providing critical supplies and resources to affected areas.\n\nWhile Bezos has not provided any concrete details on his philanthropic plans, his willingness to engage with the public and seek input is a departure from the traditional approach of many billionaires, who often keep their charitable endeavors private and opaque.\n\nBezos' net worth is expected to continue growing as Amazon's stock price rises, and his philanthropic efforts will be closely monitored by the media and the public. His decision to prioritize \"the right now\" over long-term investments could have significant implications for the way philanthropy is approached in the future.\n\nIn an era where the world's wealthiest individuals are increasingly using their resources to shape the global agenda, Bezos' philanthropic strategy will be closely watched. Will he use his vast fortune to address the world's most pressing challenges, or will he focus on more niche areas that align with his personal interests? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the world is eagerly waiting to find out.",

Customers can choose from one of seven causes selected for the brand partnership. \"It's a way of engaging millennials in a playful way and the way they consume today and the way they use their smartphones,\" said Silvia Galfo, the chief marketing officer for David Yurman. \"You don't just give money, but you give part of your time.\" By nature, fine jewelry is a discretionary purchase, which means that integrating a philanthropic element has to be done with a deft touch. \"When you give yourself something, you're being generous to yourself,\" said Sybil Yurman, a co-founder of the jewelry company. \"When you're generous to yourself, it's much easier to be generous to others.\" The partnership between David Yurman and Elbi is a strategic move to appeal to the brand's target audience of millennials, who are increasingly prioritizing social responsibility and sustainability in their purchasing decisions. By integrating philanthropy into the holiday shopping experience, David Yurman aims to create an emotional connection with its customers and differentiate itself from other luxury brands.\n\n\"We're not just selling jewelry, we're selling a feeling,\" said Silvia Galfo. \"We want our customers to feel good about what they're buying, and to know that they're making a positive impact on the world.\"\n\nThe seven causes selected for the partnership with Elbi include organizations such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and the Nature Conservancy. Customers can choose to support one of these causes and receive a digital badge on their Elbi profile, which can be shared on social media to encourage friends and family to join in.\n\nThe partnership is also designed to be highly shareable, with users encouraged to create their own projects and share them with their networks. This social sharing element is a key feature of the Elbi app, and is intended to create a sense of community and social proof around the causes being supported.\n\n\"We're not just asking people to donate money, we're asking them to take an active role in creating change,\" said Natalia Vodianova, founder of Elbi. \"By sharing their projects and encouraging others to join in, our users are helping to amplify the impact of their donations and create a ripple effect of kindness.\"\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, David Yurman is hoping that its partnership with Elbi will help to drive sales and increase brand awareness. But more importantly, the brand is hoping to create a lasting impact on the world by inspiring its customers to make a positive difference.\n\n\"Philanthropy is not just about giving money, it's about giving time and energy and passion,\" said Sybil Yurman. \"We're excited to see how our customers will respond to this opportunity to make a difference, and to be a part of something bigger than themselves.\"",

        "Text": "For viewers who had never heard of Alex Jones before Sunday evening, Megyn Kelly's much-hyped interview with him on NBC did not paint a flattering picture. In a 17-minute segment -- which had generated hours of commentary and a raft of protests before it aired -- Ms. Kelly repeatedly challenged Mr. Jones, the conspiracy theorist, Infowars founder and influential right-wing personality. She pressed him on his baseless claims that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. She confronted him about describing teenage victims of the terror attack in Manchester, England, in May as \"liberal trendies.\" And she described his behavior as \"reckless accusation, followed by equivocations and excuses.\" Ms. Kelly's solemn and scolding tone -- \"That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown,\" she told Mr. Jones at one point as he tried to explain his views on Sandy Hook -- may placate some who objected when the former Fox News anchor announced her feature on Mr. Jones. However, the interview also sparked a heated debate among media critics and pundits, with some arguing that Ms. Kelly's approach was overly confrontational and failed to provide a balanced perspective on Mr. Jones' views. Critics pointed out that while Ms. Kelly did challenge Mr. Jones on his conspiracy theories, she also allowed him to dominate the conversation and present his views without sufficient pushback.\n\nAdditionally, some observers noted that the interview seemed to reinforce Mr. Jones' reputation as a provocative and polarizing figure, rather than challenging him to confront the harm caused by his rhetoric. \"By giving him a platform and allowing him to spew his hate speech, Megyn Kelly inadvertently perpetuated the very kind of divisiveness and vitriol that she claims to be fighting against,\" said one media critic.\n\nDespite the controversy, NBC defended the decision to air the interview, citing the importance of free speech and the need for journalists to engage with controversial figures. \"We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision to feature Alex Jones, but we believe that it is essential to provide a platform for diverse perspectives, even those that are unpopular or offensive,\" said a network spokesperson.\n\nIn the aftermath of the interview, Mr. Jones took to social media to lash out at Ms. Kelly and NBC, accusing them of trying to \"silence\" him and claiming that the interview was a \"setup\" designed to discredit him. The controversy surrounding the interview is likely to continue to generate headlines in the coming days, with many wondering whether Ms. Kelly's approach will have a lasting impact on the way that journalists cover controversial figures and issues.",

The Bank of England said new mortgages for house purchases were the weakest since January 2015 at 61,039, down by almost 6%, and remortgaging approvals fell by 14% to 46,475. The house purchase figures coincided with a report showing sellers in some parts of London are discounting their prices by as much as 10% to secure a sale. Oxford, Cambridge and Aberdeen were also highlighted as cities hit by house price discounting, according to the Hometrack Cities Index, in contrast to the rest of the UK, which maintained solid house price growth. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said December's marked drop in mortgage approvals suggested that housing market activity, already under pressure from an inflationary squeeze on disposable incomes and Brexit uncertainty, took a further hit from the Bank of England raising interest rates in early November. \"We expect 2018 to be a very challenging year for the housing market, with activity likely to be lacklustre and house price rises limited to 2%,\" Archer said. The decline in mortgage lending and remortgaging approvals is a stark contrast to the previous year, when the housing market was experiencing a surge in activity. The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates in November is likely to have had a significant impact on the market, as it increased the cost of borrowing for many homebuyers.\n\nThe Hometrack Cities Index, which tracks house prices across the UK, revealed that Oxford, Cambridge, and Aberdeen were among the cities that saw the biggest discounts on property prices. In these cities, sellers are offering discounts of up to 10% to secure a sale, a trend that is likely to continue in the coming months.\n\nThe decline in the housing market is not limited to these cities, however. According to the Bank of England, the number of new mortgages for house purchases fell by almost 6% in December, the weakest figure since January 2015. Remortgaging approvals also fell by 14% to 46,475, a significant decline from the previous year.\n\nThe housing market has been under pressure for some time, with many experts warning of a potential bubble. The Bank of England's decision to raise interest rates has added to the uncertainty, making it more difficult for homebuyers to secure a mortgage.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the housing market, some experts believe that the decline in mortgage lending and remortgaging approvals is a sign of a more sustainable market. \"The housing market has been experiencing a surge in activity in recent years, driven by low interest rates and government schemes to encourage homebuying,\" said Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. \"However, this surge has been unsustainable, and the market is now correcting itself.\"\n\nArcher believes that the decline in mortgage lending and remortgaging approvals is a sign of a more balanced market, where prices are more in line with earnings. \"We expect 2018 to be a very challenging year for the housing market, with activity likely to be lacklustre and house price rises limited to 2%,\" he said.\n\nThe decline in the housing market is likely to have a significant impact on the wider economy, particularly in cities that rely heavily on the housing market for growth. However, some experts believe that the decline is a sign of a more sustainable market, where prices are more in line with earnings.\n\nIn conclusion, the decline in mortgage lending and remortgaging approvals is a sign of a more challenging year for the housing market, with activity likely to be lacklustre and house price rises limited.

Yet something close to such a record has now been retrieved from the unlikeliest of places -- a glacier in central Greenland. The record is written not in Latin but in lead. Lead emissions generated by mining operations in Northern Europe reached Greenland and were washed down in snowfall. The discovery of the ancient lead record in the Greenland glacier has sent shockwaves through the academic community, providing a unique window into the economic history of the Roman Empire. The find is a testament to the far-reaching impact of human activities on the environment, and offers a new perspective on the Roman Empire's economic rise and fall.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a lead researcher on the project, the lead emissions were detected in the glacier's ice core, which dates back to the 1st century AD. \"We were surprised to find such a clear record of lead pollution in the ice core,\" she said. \"It's a reminder that the environmental impact of human activities is not limited to local areas, but can have global consequences.\"\n\nThe lead emissions were likely generated by mining operations in Northern Europe, where the Romans were known to extract metals such as copper, lead, and silver. The lead was then transported to Greenland through atmospheric circulation patterns, where it was deposited in the snow and ice.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the Roman Empire's economy. \"The Roman Empire was known for its extensive trade networks and mining operations,\" said Dr. John Smith, an expert in ancient economies. \"But this find suggests that their economic activities had a much broader impact than we previously thought. It's a reminder that the ancient world was not isolated from the rest of the world, and that their actions had consequences that were felt globally.\"\n\nThe discovery also raises questions about the environmental impact of human activities in the ancient world. \"The Romans were known for their advanced engineering and architectural achievements, but they also had a significant impact on the environment,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"This find is a reminder that we need to consider the long-term consequences of our actions, and to think about how we can mitigate the environmental impact of our activities.\"\n\nThe discovery of the lead record in the Greenland glacier is a significant breakthrough in the field of environmental history, and offers a new perspective on the Roman Empire's economic history. As researchers continue to analyze the find, it is likely to shed new light on the ancient world and its impact on the environment.",

        "Text": "The National Enquirer, President Trump's favorite supermarket tabloid, is about to have a new owner: James Cohen, a son of the founder of the Hudson News franchise. American Media Inc., The Enquirer's publisher, announced the deal Thursday. The money-losing title was put up for sale several weeks ago, after its principal owner decided it no longer wanted to be associated with the magazine, according to several people familiar with the matter. The publication attracted the scrutiny of federal investigators for its role in the 2016 presidential campaign. American Media had been in talks with several potential buyers, including the California billionaire Ronald W. Burkle. After those talks fell apart last week, Mr. Cohen, whose father started the chain of Hudson News shops, swooped in to buy the troubled tabloid. As part of the deal, American Media, led by David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump's, has also agreed to sell two of its other tabloids: the Globe and the National Examiner. The Washington Post first reported the sale, which it pegged at $100 million. The principal owner of American Media, the hedge fund Chatham Asset Management, led by Anthony Melchiorre, pushed Mr. Pecker to sell The Enquirer after the publication found itself under federal investigation. Mr. Melchiorre no longer saw an upside in being associated with the tabloid, whose financial losses and falling circulation numbers provided further motivation for a sale. Mr. Pecker is said to have helped Mr. Trump's candidacy through a deal American Media struck with Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who said she had an affair with the president. The sale of the National Enquirer to James Cohen, a son of the founder of Hudson News, marks a significant shift in the tabloid's ownership and potentially its editorial direction. Under American Media Inc.'s leadership, the Enquirer had become embroiled in controversy, particularly due to its role in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAs part of the deal, Cohen will take over as the new publisher of the Enquirer, Globe, and National Examiner, three of American Media's most prominent tabloids. The sale is expected to be completed within the next few weeks, pending regulatory approval.\n\nCohen's father, Edward Cohen, founded Hudson News in 1908, and the company grew to become one of the largest newsstand chains in the country. James Cohen has been involved in the family business for many years and has experience in the media industry.\n\nThe sale of the Enquirer comes at a time when the tabloid industry is facing significant challenges. With the rise of digital media and social platforms, traditional print publications have struggled to maintain circulation numbers and revenue.\n\nThe Enquirer, in particular, has faced financial difficulties in recent years, with declining circulation numbers and significant losses. The tabloid's reputation was also tarnished by its involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign, which led to a federal investigation into its activities.\n\nUnder American Media's leadership, the Enquirer had become a key player in the Trump campaign, with the tabloid publishing stories that were favorable to the candidate. The Enquirer's publisher, David J. Pecker, was a longtime friend of Trump's, and the tabloid's coverage of the campaign was widely seen as pro-Trump.\n\nThe sale of the Enquirer to Cohen marks a significant shift in the tabloid's editorial direction. While Cohen has not commented on his plans for the publication, it is likely that he will look to revamp the Enquirer's content and direction to appeal to a wider audience.\n\nThe sale of the Enquirer also raises questions about the future of American Media Inc. and its other publications. The company has been facing financial difficulties in recent years, and the sale of its flagship tabloid may be a sign that it is looking to divest itself of other assets.\n\nIn a statement, American Media Inc. said that it was \"pleased to have reached an agreement with James Cohen to acquire the National Enquirer, Globe, and National Examiner.\" The company added that it would continue to operate its other publications and would provide \"full support\" to Cohen as he takes over the Enquirer.\n\nThe sale of the National Enquirer is a significant development in the world of tabloid journalism, and it will be closely watched by industry observers and media critics. As Cohen takes over the publication, he will face significant challenges in revamping the Enquirer's content and direction, and in rebuilding its reputation in the eyes of the public.",

        "Text": "SEATTLE -- When malicious software first became a serious problem on the internet about 15 years ago, most people agreed that the biggest villain, after the authors of the damaging code, was Microsoft. As a new cyberattack continues to sweep across the globe, the company is once again at the center of the debate over who is to blame for a vicious strain of malware demanding ransom from victims in exchange for the unlocking of their digital files. This time, though, Microsoft believes others should share responsibility for the attack, an assault that targeted flaws in the Windows operating system. On Sunday, Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, wrote a blog post describing the company's efforts to stop the ransomware's spread, including an unusual step it took to release a security update for versions of Windows that Microsoft no longer supports. Mr. Smith wrote, \"As a technology company, we at Microsoft have the first responsibility to address these issues.\" He went on, though, to emphasize that the attack had demonstrated the \"degree to which cybersecurity has become a shared responsibility between tech companies and customers,\" the latter of whom must update their systems if they want to be protected. He also pointed his finger at intelligence services, since the latest vulnerability appeared to have been leaked from the National Security Agency. On Monday, a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Smith's post. To prepare for fallout with customers, Judson Althoff, a Microsoft executive vice president, sent an email to the company's field sales team on Sunday encouraging them to be supportive of businesses targeted by the attack, or even those who were simply aware of it. As the ransomware attack continues to spread, Microsoft's stance on shared responsibility has sparked a heated debate in the cybersecurity community. Some experts agree with Microsoft's assessment, arguing that customers and intelligence agencies must take a more proactive role in securing their systems and data.\n\n\"Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and it's not just the responsibility of technology companies like Microsoft,\" said cybersecurity expert, Dr. Lisa Nguyen. \"Individuals and organizations must take steps to protect themselves, including keeping their software up to date and using strong passwords.\"\n\nOthers, however, argue that Microsoft should take more responsibility for the attack, citing the company's long history of vulnerabilities in its operating system.\n\n\"Microsoft has a long history of producing software with vulnerabilities, and it's their responsibility to fix these issues,\" said security researcher, Chris Roberts. \"The company's decision to release a security update for outdated versions of Windows is a step in the right direction, but it's too little, too late.\"\n\nThe attack, which has been dubbed \"WannaCry,\" has already affected thousands of organizations worldwide, including hospitals, schools, and businesses. The malware demands a ransom in exchange for the unlocking of affected files, and experts warn that the attack could continue to spread unless affected systems are updated and secured.\n\nIn the meantime, Microsoft is working closely with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to track down the authors of the malware and bring them to justice. The company is also providing support and resources to affected customers, including a special support page with guidance on how to protect against the attack.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: cybersecurity is a shared responsibility that requires the cooperation and effort of technology companies, customers, and intelligence agencies. Only by working together can we hope to prevent similar attacks in the future and protect our digital lives.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- When Britain voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, its currency plummeted on world markets, reflecting agitation over the economic and financial disruption that seemed to lie ahead. Three years later, with Brexit still not achieved, trading in the pound has been telling a different story. After weeks of steady gains ahead of Thursday's general election, the pound jumped as exit polls suggested a victory of the Conservatives and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who campaigned on completing the rupture with Europe. The pound held on to most of its gains on Friday, after official results confirmed that the Conservatives had indeed won a majority. In currencies, as in other markets, traders like certainty. \"The market sees a Tory majority as the best outcome in the short term,\" said Lee Hardman, a currency economist at MUFG, a Japanese bank. \"It gives you more clarity over the direction of Brexit.\" The pound's surge in value is a significant development, as it suggests that investors are increasingly confident in the UK's economic future. The Conservative Party's victory is seen as a positive sign, as it brings a sense of stability and predictability to the Brexit process.\n\nFor months, the pound has been subject to wild fluctuations, as the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has kept investors on edge. The currency has been particularly volatile since the beginning of the year, when the UK and EU failed to reach an agreement on the terms of the divorce. The lack of clarity has led to concerns about the potential impact on trade and the economy, causing the pound to fall to its lowest level against the dollar in three years.\n\nHowever, the Conservative Party's victory is expected to bring a sense of stability to the Brexit process, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to complete the withdrawal from the EU by the end of January. The party's commitment to leaving the EU has been a major factor in the pound's recent gains, as investors see it as a positive step towards resolving the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.\n\nThe pound's surge has also been driven by the Conservative Party's promise to increase public spending and reduce taxes, which is expected to boost the economy. The party's plan to increase public spending by Â£13 billion over the next three years is seen as a positive step, as it is expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.\n\nHowever, not everyone is celebrating the pound's surge. Some economists have warned that the Conservative Party's victory could lead to a more extreme Brexit, which could have negative consequences for the economy. The party's hardline stance on immigration and trade has raised concerns about the potential impact on the UK's trade relationships with other countries, and could lead to a more isolationist approach to international trade.\n\nDespite these concerns, the pound's surge is seen as a positive development, as it suggests that investors are increasingly confident in the UK's economic future. The Conservative Party's victory has brought a sense of stability and predictability to the Brexit process, which is expected to have a positive impact on the economy. As the UK begins the process of leaving the EU, the pound's surge is seen as a sign of things to come, as the country looks to establish itself as a major player on the global stage.",

        "Text": "Trump Rails Against Leaks. But What Exactly Are They? If there were an award for news media buzzword of the week, this one could go to \"leak.\" Since the resignation on Monday night of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser -- and reports in various places, including The New York Times, about communications between President Trump's campaign and Russia -- Mr. Trump has railed against leaks and the news organizations that have published articles based on them. He has repeatedly called them \"illegal\" and has threatened to \"find the leakers.\" Right-leaning news outlets have seized on this narrative, too, focusing their coverage on unauthorized disclosures streaming out of Washington and raising questions about whether the leaks are intended to damage Mr. Trump. The president's denouncements have called attention to what has long been a staple of journalism. They have raised the question: Is the substance of the leaks, or are the leaks themselves, the bigger story? But what exactly constitutes a leak? The concept of a leak in journalism refers to the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or classified information to the media or the public. Leaks can take many forms, including documents, emails, phone records, or even verbal conversations. In the context of the Trump administration, leaks have become a hot topic, with the president and his supporters accusing news organizations of publishing sensitive information without proper authorization.\n\nAccording to journalism ethics, leaks are considered a valuable tool for holding those in power accountable. They can provide insight into government decision-making, reveal corruption or wrongdoing, and shed light on issues that might otherwise remain hidden. However, leaks can also be damaging to individuals, organizations, or even national security if they compromise sensitive information.\n\nIn the case of the Trump administration, leaks have been a frequent occurrence, with reports of internal conflicts, policy disagreements, and even allegations of wrongdoing. The leaks have often been attributed to anonymous sources within the government, which has led to a game of cat and mouse between the Trump administration and the news media.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding leaks, many journalists and media organizations argue that they are a necessary part of a free and functioning democracy. Leaks can provide a check on government power, allowing the public to hold those in office accountable for their actions.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration's attacks on leaks have raised concerns about the potential chilling effect on journalism. If the president and his supporters continue to label leaks as \"illegal\" and threaten to \"find the leakers,\" it could create a climate of fear and intimidation that discourages sources from coming forward with important information.\n\nIn the end, the debate over leaks is not just about the substance of the information being leaked, but also about the principles of a free press and the importance of transparency in government. As the Trump administration continues to grapple with the fallout from the Flynn resignation and the Russia investigations, it remains to be seen how the issue of leaks will play out. One thing is certain, however: the public's right to know will continue to be a crucial part of the democratic process, and leaks will remain a vital tool for journalists seeking to uncover the truth.",

        "Text": "THE worst wildfire season in years is forcing many Californians from their homes and has caused the destruction of hundreds of houses, cars and other property. Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a nonprofit group that assists consumers with insurance issues, urges homeowners who live in areas at risk of wildfires to double-check their policies to ensure they have adequate coverage to rebuild their home if it is destroyed. While California is prone to devastating fires, she says, they can occur elsewhere as well, particularly in other parts of the West. (CoreLogic has published an analysis of residential wildfire risk in 13 states.) You can take your policy limit, she suggests, and divide it by your home's square footage to get a rough estimate. If the number is less than $200 per square foot, you're probably underinsured and should consider purchasing more coverage. You should also make sure you have \"code upgrade\" coverage, which helps cover the cost of bringing your new home up to the latest building standards. \"Think about, 'What would a contractor charge to rebuild from the ground up?'\" Bach emphasizes that it's crucial for homeowners to review their policies annually, especially after a devastating wildfire season like the current one. \"It's easy to assume that your policy is sufficient, but the reality is that many policies are outdated or inadequate,\" she warns.\n\nAccording to CoreLogic, a leading provider of property data and analytics, the risk of residential wildfires is not limited to California. The company's analysis found that 13 states, including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, are at high risk of wildfires.\n\nBach suggests that homeowners in these areas take proactive steps to ensure they have adequate coverage. \"Don't wait until it's too late,\" she advises. \"Review your policy today and make any necessary adjustments to ensure you're protected in the event of a wildfire.\"\n\nIn addition to reviewing policy limits and coverage, Bach recommends that homeowners also consider purchasing additional coverage for specific items, such as jewelry, artwork, or collectibles. \"These items can be difficult to replace, and standard policies may not provide adequate coverage,\" she notes.\n\nThe California Department of Insurance has also issued guidance for homeowners in the wake of the devastating wildfires. The department recommends that homeowners review their policies to ensure they have adequate coverage for rebuilding and replacement costs.\n\nAs the state continues to recover from the devastating wildfires, Bach urges homeowners to take a proactive approach to protecting their properties. \"Don't assume that your policy will cover everything you need,\" she warns. \"Take the time to review your policy and make any necessary adjustments to ensure you're protected in the event of a wildfire.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the nonprofit United Policyholders is offering free assistance to homeowners affected by the wildfires. The organization provides guidance on insurance claims, policy review, and other resources to help homeowners navigate the recovery process.\n\nAs the state and federal governments work to rebuild and recover from the devastating wildfires, homeowners are urged to take a proactive approach to protecting their properties. By reviewing their policies and making any necessary adjustments, homeowners can ensure they're protected in the event of a wildfire.",

But his maelstrom of activity -- the bold executive orders, the fiery Twitter posts, the brazen speeches -- has also exposed, and perhaps exacerbated, ideological differences. For those devouring news about the administration, the choice of narratives has become starker, with brighter lines drawn around the content. For the readers and viewers, it's follow the narrative of your choice, and be wary of the great chasm between. Over the weekend, as protesters descended on airports across the country in response to Mr. Trump's immigration ban, fissures began to emerge even among right-wing news organizations. On Monday, the divide only widened. And not everyone behaved predictably. \"It is certainly responsible and logical for a new president to institute updated protections for this country by ordering specific temporary immigration actions,\" Mr. O'Reilly said. \"However, it's also responsible for a federal judge to order that foreigners with the proper credentials already issued not be punished. There should be room for case-by-case decision making.\" He even invoked the Statue of Liberty to make his point. Some of Mr. O'Reilly's guests were also critical. Karl Rove said of Mr. Trump that \"the controversy is hurting him more than the controversy is helping him.\" As the debate raged on, it became clear that even within the conservative media landscape, there were cracks in the armor. Fox News, once a bastion of Trump support, was now featuring a mix of opinions, with some hosts and guests questioning the legality and morality of the immigration ban.\n\nMeanwhile, liberal outlets were reveling in the chaos, using the controversy to bolster their narratives about Trump's authoritarian tendencies. CNN, MSNBC, and The New York Times were all devoting extensive coverage to the protests, the legal challenges, and the fallout from the ban.\n\nBut amidst the cacophony of voices, one figure stood out: Bill O'Reilly, the veteran Fox News host. Known for his bombastic style and unwavering support for Trump, O'Reilly surprised many by taking a more measured approach to the immigration ban.\n\nIn an appearance on his show, O'Reilly argued that while he supported Trump's goal of protecting the country, he believed that the ban was too broad and needed to be refined. He also expressed concerns about the impact on innocent people who were being caught up in the ban.\n\nO'Reilly's comments sparked a lively debate on social media, with some of his fans praising his willingness to question Trump's actions, while others accused him of being a traitor to the cause. The reaction was a testament to the evolving nature of the media landscape, where even the most unlikely voices were now being amplified and scrutinized.\n\nAs the debate continued to rage on, it was clear that the Trump presidency was already having a profound impact on the media. The old certainties were being upended, and a new era of polarization and division was emerging. The question on everyone's mind was: what would happen next? Would the media continue to fragment along ideological lines, or would there be a return to a more balanced and nuanced approach to reporting the news? Only time would tell.",

Those numbers exceeded the American television audience for the final game of the 2014 Stanley Cup hockey finals. Not a second of the surfing competition was shown on traditional live television in the United States; instead, it was streamed on YouTube, with 35 to 40 percent of its viewers on mobile. \"It was hard for us to realize a direct relationship to linear TV,\" Paul Speaker, the chief executive of the World Surf League, said. \"We're a global sport, so there is always a time zone concern, and we have to wait for swells\" -- suitable wave conditions -- \"so we don't have a start time and an end time like other sports.\" The World Surf League's successful web-first broadcast strategy is at the leading edge of a gradual transformation taking hold in sports television. As more and more viewers move online and audiences become more global, the professional leagues have all adopted streaming as an important way to attract younger fans around the world. But the purity of surfing's model -- reaching millions of viewers online without being beholden to exclusivity contracts with broadcast and cable networks -- demonstrates the power of online audiences for sports big and small. \"It's one of those things where there's a lot of fans out there,\" explained Matt McLernon, a spokesman for YouTube. \"But they're not necessarily combined enough into a media market where it makes sense to put this sporting event on TV. This shift towards online streaming has significant implications for the sports industry as a whole. Gone are the days of exclusive broadcast deals and limited television coverage. With the rise of digital platforms, sports leagues can now reach a global audience without being tied to traditional television networks.\n\nThe World Surf League's success is not an isolated incident. Other sports organizations, such as the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), have also seen significant growth in online viewership. The NFL's digital streaming platform, NFL Game Pass, has attracted millions of subscribers, while MLB's streaming service, MLB.TV, has become a staple for fans looking to catch games on-the-go.\n\nBut what's driving this shift towards online streaming? According to Paul Speaker, the CEO of the World Surf League, it's all about the younger generation. \"Younger fans are more likely to consume sports content online,\" he said. \"They're used to having access to content whenever and wherever they want it, and traditional TV just doesn't fit that model.\"\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Matt McLernon, a spokesman for YouTube. \"Younger fans are more likely to be watching sports on their mobile devices, and that's where we're seeing a lot of growth,\" he said. \"We're seeing a lot of sports content being uploaded to our platform, and it's resonating with fans.\"\n\nThe World Surf League's success also highlights the importance of flexibility in sports broadcasting. With the unpredictable nature of surfing, the league can't rely on traditional broadcast schedules. Instead, they've adopted a flexible streaming model that allows them to broadcast events live, without the need for a fixed start and end time.\n\nThis approach has also allowed the World Surf League to tap into a global audience. With the ability to broadcast events live, fans from around the world can tune in and watch the action unfold in real-time. This has been particularly beneficial for the league, which has a strong following in Brazil, Australia, and other countries.\n\nAs the sports industry continues to evolve, it's clear that online streaming will play a major role in the future of sports broadcasting. With its flexibility, global reach, and ability to reach younger fans, online streaming is poised to revolutionize the way we consume sports content.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber says it is not renewing its permit to test self-driving vehicles in California until the police and regulators wrap up an investigation into how one of its autonomous vehicles struck and killed a woman in Arizona last week. The company decided to withdraw its renewal application late last week. The move came to light in a letter that California's Department of Motor Vehicles sent to Uber on Tuesday. The letter informed Uber that its testing permit will expire on Saturday and that it will have to address \"any follow-up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in Arizona\" if it applies for a new permit in the future. The loss of the permit, reported earlier by The San Francisco Chronicle, is the latest roadblock for Uber as the company weighs the future of its self-driving car program. Uber halted all testing of its driverless cars after one of them killed Elaine Herzberg, 49, who was walking her bicycle across a road in Tempe, Ariz. The car was going 40 miles per hour and did not slow down before impact, the Tempe police said. Arizona's governor, Doug Ducey, ordered the company to suspend the testing of its autonomous vehicles on Monday, eight days after the crash, saying footage of the accident \"raises many questions about the ability of Uber to continue testing in Arizona.\" Uber said it withdrew its California application on Friday because it wouldn't have been able to respond to questions from the state's regulators until it had time to review the findings of the investigation in Arizona. The decision to withdraw its permit application comes as a significant setback for Uber, which has been at the forefront of the autonomous vehicle testing industry. The company has been testing its self-driving cars in California since 2015 and had planned to expand its operations to other states.\n\nThe incident in Arizona has raised serious concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles and has sparked a debate about the need for stricter regulations to govern the industry. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched an investigation into the crash, and the company is also facing a lawsuit from the victim's family.\n\nIn a statement, Uber said that it is cooperating fully with the investigation and is working to determine the cause of the crash. The company has also suspended its testing of autonomous vehicles in Arizona and Pittsburgh, where it had been testing its self-driving cars.\n\nThe loss of its permit in California is a significant blow to Uber's self-driving car program, which has been a major focus of the company's efforts in recent years. The company has invested heavily in the technology and has been testing its self-driving cars on public roads in several states.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the ability of autonomous vehicles to operate safely in complex environments, such as urban areas with heavy traffic and pedestrians. The crash has highlighted the need for more rigorous testing and validation of the technology before it is deployed on public roads.\n\nIn response to the incident, several other companies that are testing autonomous vehicles have suspended their testing operations, including Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. and Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors.\n\nThe incident has also sparked a debate about the need for stricter regulations to govern the industry. Some experts have called for more rigorous testing and validation of the technology before it is deployed on public roads, while others have argued that the technology has the potential to significantly reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety.\n\nAs the investigation into the crash continues, the future of Uber's self-driving car program remains uncertain. The company has not said when it plans to resume testing its autonomous vehicles, and it is unclear whether it will be able to recover from the setback.\n\nIn the meantime, the incident has raised important questions about the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, and has highlighted the need for more rigorous testing and validation of the technology before it is deployed on public roads.",

The research follows previous work by the team from University of Sussex which compiled a directory of horse facial expressions, and revealed that Black Beauty can read your emotions â€“ a phenomenon also seen in dogs. \"We knew that horses could register emotional expressions, so we wanted to know if they could remember them, so that they can actually use those memories to guide their future interactions with specific individuals,\" said Karen McComb, co-author of the study and professor of animal behaviour and cognition at the University of Sussex. McComb and colleagues analysed data from 11 horses who had been shown a photograph of a human pulling an angry face and 10 horses shown a picture of a human smiling. Each horse was shown a large photograph of one of two participants for two minutes; three to six hours later they were brought face-to-face with the person they had seen in the photograph who was sporting a neutral expression. The researchers found that horses that had seen the angry face were significantly more cautious and wary of the individual, taking longer to approach and displaying more avoidance behaviors. In contrast, horses that had seen the smiling face were more relaxed and friendly, approaching the person more quickly and displaying fewer avoidance behaviors.\n\n\"This suggests that horses are able to remember and use the emotional expression they saw earlier to guide their behavior towards that individual,\" said McComb. \"It's not just a simple association between the face and the emotion, but a more complex recognition of the emotional state of the person.\"\n\nThe study also found that the horses were able to remember the faces of the individuals, even when they were shown a neutral expression. This ability to recognize and remember faces is a key component of social cognition, allowing horses to form complex social relationships and recognize individuals within their social group.\n\nThe researchers believe that this ability to recognize and remember emotional expressions could have important implications for horse training and welfare. For example, it could be used to help horses become more confident and relaxed around people, or to reduce stress and anxiety in horses that are already experiencing these emotions.\n\n\"This study highlights the importance of considering the emotional state of horses when interacting with them,\" said McComb. \"By taking the time to understand and recognize the emotional expressions of horses, we can build stronger and more positive relationships with them.\"\n\nThe study was published in the journal Animal Behaviour and was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).",

        "Text": "Let's hope AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio is right. The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group makes the immediate outlook for the UK seem, if not rosy, then at least steady. The economy is \"resilient\". Borrowers can cope with a quarter-point rise in interest rates to 0.5%. And we shouldn't get too excited about the increase in consumer debt because levels are still 25% below those of a decade ago. These are all fair points, and Lloyds' third-quarter results illustrated the theme of resilience. The bank's percentage of impaired loans continues to run at historically low levels, despite a hit from an unnamed and mysterious \"single large corporate\". Impairment charges over the nine months rose 20% to Â£538m but the loan book itself is larger after the purchase of the MBNA credit card business. Can we relax, then? Should we stop obsessing over every twist in the Brexit negotiations and spend more time looking at the underlying picture? Before anybody runs away with that idea, three points are worth making. First, Horta-OsÃ³rio's economic punditry always comes with the caveat that he's looking only six to 12 months into the future. If he's still talking up resilience in a year's time, that would be more significant. By then, we will know if the fall-off in business investment is affecting employment and thus banks' bad debt charges. However, it's the second point that should give pause for concern. While Lloyds' impaired loan levels may be historically low, the bank's own figures show that the quality of its loan book is not uniform. The group's commercial property loan book, for instance, has seen a significant increase in impairments, up 43% year-on-year. This is a sector that has been particularly vulnerable to the economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit, and it's unclear whether the resilience Horta-OsÃ³rio speaks of will extend to this area.\n\nFurthermore, the third point to consider is that the current economic picture may be skewed by the fact that the UK is still in a period of economic adjustment following the 2008 financial crisis. The recovery has been slow and uneven, and it's possible that the resilience we're seeing now is simply a reflection of the economy's ability to adapt to new circumstances rather than a genuine sign of long-term strength.\n\nIn addition, there are concerns about the impact of the rise in consumer debt on the wider economy. While Horta-OsÃ³rio is right that levels are still below those of a decade ago, the rate at which debt is growing is starting to accelerate. This could lead to a situation where households become increasingly reliant on credit to make ends meet, rather than building up savings and reducing their debt burdens.\n\nIn conclusion, while Lloyds' third-quarter results do offer some encouragement, they should not be taken as a reason to relax about the state of the UK economy. The resilience we're seeing now may be short-lived, and there are still many uncertainties surrounding the impact of Brexit and the state of the global economy. As such, it's crucial that policymakers and businesses alike remain vigilant and continue to monitor the situation closely.",

        "Text": "Some 12,000 years ago, the saber-toothed cat stalked grasslands across the Americas, pouncing on unsuspecting horses and bison before sinking its ferocious fangs into their throats and bellies. But catching that prey came at a price. The big cats, known as Smilodon fatalis, suffered injuries to their shoulders and lower backs as a result of their hunting, a new study suggests. These battle wounds contrasted with those obtained by another top Pleistocene predator, the dire wolf. The wolves, which chased their prey over long distances and often to exhaustion, instead strained their necks and paws while on the hunt. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Arizona, led by Dr. Emma Taylor, analyzed the fossilized remains of Smilodon fatalis and Canis dirus, the dire wolf, to better understand the hunting strategies and physical toll of these ancient predators. By studying the skeletal remains, the team identified specific patterns of injury that provided insight into the hunting methods employed by each species.\n\nAccording to Dr. Taylor, the saber-toothed cat's injuries were largely concentrated in the shoulders and lower back, suggesting that they relied on powerful ambush tactics to catch their prey. \"These big cats were built for short, intense bursts of speed and power,\" she explained. \"They likely used their powerful legs and sharp claws to pounce on unsuspecting prey, which would have resulted in significant strain on their shoulders and lower backs.\"\n\nIn contrast, the dire wolves, which were adapted for long-distance running, showed a different pattern of injuries. The team found evidence of wear and tear on the wolves' necks and paws, indicating that they relied on endurance-based hunting strategies. \"The dire wolves were built for speed and agility, but they also needed to be able to chase their prey over long distances,\" said Dr. Taylor. \"This would have put a lot of stress on their necks and paws, leading to the types of injuries we observed.\"\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science Advances, provides new insights into the hunting strategies and physical adaptations of these ancient predators. The findings also offer a glimpse into the complex and dynamic ecosystems that existed during the Pleistocene era, when these species roamed the Americas.\n\nDr. Taylor and her team plan to continue their research, analyzing more fossilized remains to gain a deeper understanding of the hunting habits and ecological roles of these iconic predators. As they delve deeper into the past, they hope to uncover new secrets about the lives of these magnificent creatures and the ecosystems they inhabited.",

Is your sense of direction like a weather vane spinning in strong winds? For the directionally challenged, getting from Point A to Point B can be a frustrating, time-wasting ordeal. If the idea of trying to get someplace unfamiliar makes you anxious, fear not: Experts say there are steps you can take to improve your sense of direction. Review a map of your proposed route before heading out, and perhaps even trace it with your finger, Dr. Brendan Kelley, a neurologist at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said in an email. According to Dr. Kelley, reviewing a map and tracing the route with your finger can help to solidify the path in your mind, making it easier to navigate. \"When we look at a map, our brain is processing visual information, which helps to create a mental map,\" he explained. \"By tracing the route with your finger, you're engaging your motor skills and creating a more tactile experience, which can further enhance your sense of direction.\"\n\nDr. Kelley also recommends using landmarks and visual cues to help guide you along the way. \"Pay attention to distinctive buildings, street signs, and other visual features that can serve as reference points,\" he advised. \"This can help to create a mental framework for navigation, making it easier to find your way even when you're not looking at a map.\"\n\nFor those who are particularly prone to getting lost, Dr. Kelley suggests practicing navigation in familiar environments before venturing into unfamiliar territory. \"The more you practice navigating in your own neighborhood or a familiar area, the more your brain will develop a sense of spatial awareness and improve your ability to find your way,\" he said.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Kelley notes that technology can also be a valuable tool for improving one's sense of direction. \"Many smartphones have built-in GPS capabilities that can provide turn-by-turn directions and help you stay on track,\" he said. \"You can also use apps that provide interactive maps and real-time traffic updates to help you navigate more efficiently.\"\n\nFor those who are still struggling with their sense of direction, Dr. Kelley recommends seeking the help of a professional. \"If you're consistently getting lost and it's causing significant distress or impacting your daily life, it may be worth consulting with a healthcare professional or a licensed therapist who specializes in anxiety or spatial cognition,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, improving one's sense of direction takes practice, patience, and a willingness to learn and adapt. By following these simple tips and strategies, even the most directionally challenged individuals can develop a stronger sense of direction and navigate the world with greater confidence.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook, facing withering criticism from governments around the world, said Thursday that it had been more aggressive in recent months about scrubbing its platform of hate speech. In a report the company releases biannually, Facebook also said its automated detection software that scrubs illicit content was improving: It now automatically detects and removes more than half of the hate speech on the platform. Regulators have expressed renewed interest in cracking down on Facebook after a gunman in Christchurch, New Zealand, live-streamed his mass killings on his Facebook account. The video was viewed just 4,000 times before Facebook removed it, but it spread rapidly across the internet and was reposted millions of times. The quick distribution of the video -- and the apparent inability of Facebook and other tech companies to stop it from spreading -- led to calls from regulators who said the company must do a better job of policing the content posted on its platform. Facebook's efforts to address hate speech on its platform come as governments around the world are increasingly scrutinizing the company's role in spreading harmful content. In the wake of the Christchurch attack, Facebook faced intense pressure to take action and has since implemented several measures aimed at reducing the spread of hate speech.\n\nOne of the key initiatives is the company's use of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and remove illicit content. Facebook's AI-powered system, which is trained on a vast dataset of user-generated content, is able to identify and flag potentially harmful posts with greater accuracy than ever before. According to the company's report, the AI system is now able to detect and remove more than half of all hate speech on the platform, a significant improvement from just a few years ago.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, critics argue that Facebook still has a long way to go in addressing the issue of hate speech on its platform. Many have pointed out that the company's algorithms, which are designed to prioritize content that is most engaging and attention-grabbing, can actually perpetuate harmful ideologies and amplify hate speech.\n\n\"We need to see more than just a report from Facebook,\" said Sarah T. Roberts, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied the spread of hate speech online. \"We need to see concrete action and accountability from the company. Until then, we can't trust that they're truly committed to addressing this issue.\"\n\nFacebook has also faced criticism for its handling of the Christchurch video, which was live-streamed on the platform and viewed by thousands of users before it was removed. The company has since implemented several measures aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future, including the use of AI-powered tools to detect and remove violent content.\n\nDespite these efforts, many remain skeptical about Facebook's ability to effectively police its platform. \"The problem is that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user engagement, and hate speech is often highly engaging,\" said Joan Donovan, a researcher at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. \"Until Facebook fundamentally changes its business model, it's hard to see how they'll be able to effectively address this issue.\"\n\nIn response to these concerns, Facebook has announced plans to increase its investment in AI research and development, with a focus on developing more advanced tools to detect and remove hate speech. The company has also pledged to increase transparency around its content moderation policies and to provide more information to users about how their content is being used.\n\nWhile these efforts are a step in the right direction, many remain skeptical about Facebook's ability to effectively address the issue of hate speech on its platform. As the company continues to grapple with the fallout from the Christchurch attack, it remains to be seen whether it will be able to make good on its promises and truly become a force for good in the fight against hate speech.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- A new front is opening in the battle to restore so-called net neutrality rules: state legislatures. Lawmakers in at least six states, including California and New York, have introduced bills in recent weeks that would forbid internet providers to block or slow down sites or online services. Legislators in several other states, including North Carolina and Illinois, are weighing similar action. They are responding to the Federal Communications Commission's vote last month to end regulations that barred internet service providers from creating slow and fast lanes for different sites and services. The new policy will go into effect in the coming weeks. By passing their own law, the state lawmakers say, they would ensure that consumers would find the content of the choice, maintain a diversity of voices online and protect businesses from having to pay fees to reach users. And they might even have an effect beyond their states. California's strict auto emissions standards, for example, have been followed by a dozen other states, giving California major sway over the auto industry. As the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prepares to implement its new policy, state lawmakers are racing to pass their own net neutrality laws to protect consumers and online businesses. The move is seen as a crucial step in preserving the open internet, which has been a cornerstone of American innovation and free speech.\n\nCalifornia, a leader in the effort, has already introduced a bill that would prohibit internet service providers from blocking or throttling online content. The bill, which has bipartisan support, aims to ensure that consumers have access to the content of their choice, without interference from internet providers.\n\nNew York is also taking a similar approach, with lawmakers introducing a bill that would require internet service providers to maintain a \"neutral\" network, free from blocking or throttling. The bill also includes provisions to protect small businesses and startups, which often rely on the open internet to reach customers and grow their businesses.\n\nOther states, such as North Carolina and Illinois, are also considering similar legislation. In North Carolina, lawmakers have introduced a bill that would prohibit internet service providers from blocking or throttling online content, while also requiring them to disclose their network management practices.\n\nThe push for state-level net neutrality laws is seen as a response to the FCC's decision to repeal the Obama-era net neutrality rules. The FCC's new policy, which takes effect in the coming weeks, allows internet service providers to create fast and slow lanes for different sites and services, effectively giving them the power to control what content consumers can access online.\n\nProponents of state-level net neutrality laws argue that they are necessary to protect consumers and online businesses from the potential negative consequences of the FCC's new policy. They point to the example of California's strict auto emissions standards, which have been followed by a dozen other states, giving California major sway over the auto industry.\n\n\"We're not going to let the FCC's decision go unchallenged,\" said California Assemblymember Susan Bonilla, who introduced the state's net neutrality bill. \"We're going to take action to protect our consumers and small businesses, and ensure that the internet remains an open and free platform for all.\"\n\nThe push for state-level net neutrality laws has also garnered support from online businesses and advocacy groups. The Internet Association, which represents companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, has urged lawmakers to pass net neutrality legislation to protect the open internet.\n\n\"The internet is a critical part of our economy and our democracy,\" said Michael Beckerman, CEO of the Internet Association. \"We need to ensure that it remains an open and free platform, and that's why we're supporting state-level net neutrality laws.\"\n\nAs the debate over net neutrality continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the future of the open internet hangs in the balance. With state lawmakers racing to pass their own net neutrality laws, the battle to restore the open internet is far from over.",

The craft, SpaceShipTwo, soared at speeds topping out at 2.9 times the speed of sound -- around 2,200 miles per hour -- through nearly three layers of Earth's atmosphere to reach space, the company said. SpaceShipTwo topped out at an altitude of 51.4 miles, just surpassing the Federal Aviation Administration's definition of where space begins but lower than the widely accepted boundary of 62 miles. Thursday's accomplishment gave Richard Branson, the British billionaire who started Virgin Galactic in 2004 with the objective of ferrying tourists on short flights into space, a victory in the highly competitive but elusive contest of commercial space tourism. The successful test flight marked a significant step forward for Virgin Galactic, which has been working towards making commercial space tourism a reality for over a decade. The company's vision is to offer a unique experience for paying customers, allowing them to soar to the edge of space and enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness and breathtaking views of the curvature of the Earth.\n\nThe SpaceShipTwo spacecraft, which is designed to carry six passengers and two pilots, is the latest iteration of Virgin Galactic's space tourism program. The company has been testing the craft's capabilities for several years, and Thursday's flight was the most successful to date.\n\nDuring the flight, SpaceShipTwo was released from its mothership, WhiteKnightTwo, at an altitude of 46,000 feet. The spacecraft then ignited its rocket engine, propelling it to an altitude of 51.4 miles, where it remained for about a minute before returning to Earth.\n\nThe flight was witnessed by a team of engineers and technicians from Virgin Galactic, as well as representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has been working closely with the company to ensure the safety of its space tourism operations.\n\nThursday's test flight was a major milestone for Virgin Galactic, as it demonstrated the company's ability to consistently reach space and return safely. The achievement is expected to pave the way for the company to begin commercial operations, which could start as early as next year.\n\nRichard Branson, the founder of Virgin Galactic, was thrilled with the success of the flight, saying it was a \"proud moment\" for the company. \"We're one step closer to making space travel accessible to all,\" he said in a statement.\n\nVirgin Galactic's space tourism program is not the only one of its kind. Several other companies, including Blue Origin and SpaceX, are also working towards making commercial space travel a reality. However, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo is the only spacecraft that has successfully reached space and returned to Earth.\n\nThe company plans to continue testing its spacecraft over the coming months, with the goal of beginning commercial operations in the near future.

        "Text": "There's an ancient Greco-Roman poem that tells the tale of brave fishermen who harpooned a sea monster. Once they hooked the beast, the men reeled it in from their rowboats near the shore and hauled it onto the beach. The text, which is dated to the second or third century, describes one onlooker as standing on a cliff and beholding the \"tremendous toil of the men in this warfare of the sea.\" But was this \"sea monster,\" or \"cetus\" as it is called in Latin, actually a whale? A study published Wednesday provides the first direct evidence that two whale species, the gray whale and the North Atlantic right whale, may have lived near Mediterranean shores some 2,000 years ago. Today these whales are not found in the Mediterranean Sea. The finding, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, expands the historical range of the whale species and suggests they once roamed the same waters as the ancient Romans. The study, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a marine biologist at the University of Barcelona, analyzed fossil records and ancient texts to reconstruct the historical distribution of whale species in the Mediterranean. The researchers used a combination of radiocarbon dating and morphological analysis to identify the fossils, which were found in sediment cores and ancient coastal deposits.\n\nThe team discovered that the gray whale, which is currently found in the Pacific Ocean, had a wider distribution in the past. Fossil evidence suggests that it may have migrated to the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar, which connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean. The North Atlantic right whale, on the other hand, is currently found in the North Atlantic Ocean, but the study suggests that it may have ventured into the Mediterranean during certain times of the year.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the ancient Mediterranean ecosystem. \"The Mediterranean Sea was once a much more diverse and complex ecosystem than we previously thought,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"The presence of these whale species suggests that the sea was a key habitat for many marine animals, including fish, squid, and other invertebrates.\"\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of preserving ancient texts and fossil records. \"These sources provide a unique window into the past, allowing us to reconstruct the history of marine ecosystems and the impact of human activities on the environment,\" said Dr. Rodriguez.\n\nThe finding has also sparked interest among historians and archaeologists, who are eager to learn more about the interactions between ancient humans and whales. \"This discovery challenges our previous understanding of the relationship between humans and whales in the ancient Mediterranean,\" said Dr. John Smith, a historian at the University of Cambridge. \"It's a fascinating area of study that can provide valuable insights into the cultural and economic practices of ancient societies.\"\n\nThe study's findings have also raised questions about the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems. \"As the climate continues to change, we're seeing shifts in the distribution of marine species,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"This study suggests that even 2,000 years ago, the Mediterranean Sea was experiencing changes in its ecosystem, which highlights the importance of monitoring and managing marine ecosystems to ensure their long-term health.\"\n\nThe research team plans to continue their study, analyzing more fossil records and ancient texts to gain a better understanding of the historical distribution of whale species in the Mediterranean. The discovery has already sparked a renewed interest in the ancient Mediterranean ecosystem, and researchers are eager to learn more about the complex relationships between humans and whales in the past.",

For all the attention devoted to the widening chasm between the very rich and the rest of American society, perhaps the most urgent question is whether the trend can realistically be turned around within, say, the next two or three decades. The answer may well be no. \"I am very pessimistic about the capacity of the American political system to redistribute income within a reasonable period of time,\" said Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in concluding comments at a seminar on inequality that drew some of the top scholars on the subject to New York last month. Despite the dire prognosis, many experts believe that there are steps that can be taken to mitigate the effects of income inequality. One approach is to focus on education and job training, particularly for low-income and minority communities. \"Investing in education and job training can help bridge the skills gap and provide more opportunities for individuals to move up the economic ladder,\" said Dr. Heather Boushey, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.\n\nAnother strategy is to increase the minimum wage and implement policies that promote fair labor practices. \"Raising the minimum wage can help ensure that low-wage workers are paid a living wage and can afford the basic necessities of life,\" said Dr. Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute. \"Additionally, policies like paid family leave and affordable childcare can help working families balance work and family responsibilities, reducing the pressure to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet.\"\n\nSome experts also advocate for policies that promote economic growth and create good-paying jobs. \"Investing in infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and public transportation, can create jobs and stimulate economic growth,\" said Dr. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"Additionally, policies that promote entrepreneurship and innovation, such as tax credits for small businesses and research and development, can help create new industries and job opportunities.\"\n\nHowever, many experts agree that addressing income inequality will require a fundamental shift in the way society values work and wealth. \"We need to recognize that the value of work goes beyond just the paycheck,\" said Dr. Barbara Ehrenreich, a sociologist and author. \"We need to prioritize policies that promote fairness, equality, and social justice, rather than just focusing on economic growth and profits.\"\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, many experts remain hopeful that income inequality can be addressed. \"While it's true that the trend of income inequality is difficult to reverse, it's not impossible,\" said Dr. Solow. \"With a concerted effort from policymakers, businesses, and individuals, we can work towards a more equitable society.\"",

        "Text": "London-based transit app Citymapper is today launching Smart Ride, a hybrid bus and taxi service that will take riders around a fixed network in the capital. The company is operating the service under a private hire licence from Transport for London, following a pair of trial \"smart bus\" routes in the capital. The new licence limits the firm to operating vehicles that can carry eight or fewer people, but frees it to run future routes that can change dynamically as demand shifts, rather than being legally mandated to stick to specific timetables and stopping patterns. \"We believe in the future of shared transportation in cities, there is no way we're going to solve for congestion and pollution otherwise,\" Omid Ashtari, Citymapper's president and head of business, told the Guardian. \"But the regulations we see are not stacked in the favour of the bus industry to make sure that works. \"We decided to take on a different service, and launch something else. So we're launching Smart Ride. It's a shared-first service, the only one in London.\" Citymapper's Smart Ride service will operate a fleet of eight-seater vehicles, which will be available for booking through the company's app. The service will offer a fixed network of routes, with riders able to choose from a range of pick-up and drop-off points. According to Citymapper, the service will be designed to be more flexible than traditional bus routes, with the ability to adjust its schedule and routes in real-time based on demand.\n\nThe company has partnered with a number of taxi operators to provide the vehicles for the service, and has also developed its own proprietary technology to manage the fleet and optimize routes. Citymapper claims that its Smart Ride service will be more efficient than traditional bus services, with the ability to reduce congestion and emissions by up to 50%.\n\nThe launch of Smart Ride comes as Citymapper continues to expand its services beyond its core transit app. The company has already launched a number of other services, including a bike-sharing platform and a ride-hailing service, and has partnered with a number of major cities around the world to develop its own transportation infrastructure.\n\nCitymapper's move into the taxi industry is seen as a major challenge to the traditional taxi business, which has been struggling to compete with ride-hailing services like Uber. However, Citymapper's president and head of business, Omid Ashtari, believes that the company's focus on shared transportation will ultimately benefit the taxi industry.\n\n\"We're not trying to disrupt the taxi industry, we're trying to augment it,\" Ashtari said. \"We believe that shared transportation is the future of urban mobility, and we're excited to be at the forefront of that revolution.\"\n\nThe launch of Smart Ride is the latest development in Citymapper's efforts to transform the way people move around cities. The company's innovative approach to transportation has made it a leader in the industry, and its new service is likely to be closely watched by transportation experts and enthusiasts alike.",

        "Text": "The number of students receiving unconditional offers for university places has leapt again this year, prompting calls for an overhaul of the UK's convoluted and unreliable university admissions process. Ucas figures show that nearly one in four 18-year-olds applying from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have received an unconditional offer â€“ meaning they can accept an undergraduate place without meeting the A-level or BTech grades predicted by their teachers. According to Ucas, 23% of this year's cohort have been made at least one unconditional offer. In 2016 the proportion was a little under 13%, and in 2013 it was just 1% â€“ meaning the number of students benefiting has risen from 2,500 five years ago to 58,000 this year. Experts Warn of Unintended Consequences as Unconditional Offers Surge\n\nThe surge in unconditional offers has sparked concerns among educators and policymakers, who fear that the trend may have unintended consequences on the university admissions process. Dr. Sarah Jones, a leading education expert, warned that the rise of unconditional offers could lead to a watering down of academic standards.\n\n\"If we're not careful, unconditional offers could create a culture where students are prioritized over academic merit,\" Dr. Jones said. \"This could result in students who may not be adequately prepared for university-level work being accepted into programs, which could ultimately impact their academic success and the quality of education they receive.\"\n\nThe Ucas figures also show that the proportion of unconditional offers varies significantly across different regions and institutions. While some universities have seen a significant increase in unconditional offers, others have reported a decline.\n\nAccording to Ucas, the top five universities for unconditional offers are all located in the South East of England, with the University of Kent and the University of Surrey topping the list. In contrast, some universities in the North of England and Wales have seen a decline in unconditional offers, with some institutions reporting a decrease of up to 20%.\n\nThe surge in unconditional offers has also raised concerns about the impact on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Research has shown that students from lower-income families are less likely to receive unconditional offers, which could exacerbate existing inequalities in the education system.\n\n\"We're seeing a concerning trend where students from disadvantaged backgrounds are being left behind in the university admissions process,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading researcher on education inequality. \"Unconditional offers could further entrench these inequalities, making it even harder for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to access higher education.\"\n\nIn response to the concerns, Ucas has announced plans to introduce new measures to improve transparency and accountability in the university admissions process. The organization is also working with universities to develop more nuanced and contextualized approaches to unconditional offers.\n\n\"We understand the concerns around unconditional offers and are committed to ensuring that our system is fair and equitable for all students,\" said a Ucas spokesperson. \"We're working closely with universities to develop new approaches that prioritize academic merit while also taking into account the individual circumstances of each student.\"\n\nAs the debate surrounding unconditional offers continues, educators and policymakers are urging for a more comprehensive overhaul of the university admissions process. With the number of students receiving unconditional offers set to continue rising, it remains to be seen whether the current system can adapt to the changing landscape of higher education.",

        "Text": "A privately educated elite continues to dominate the UK's leading professions, taking top jobs in fields as diverse as the law, politics, medicine and journalism, according to new research. The Sutton Trust educational charity has been carrying out similar surveys for more than a decade, and though it reports \"small signs\" of progress, this year's results confirm what has long been known â€“ that if you have a private education, you are considerably more likely to get to the top of British public life. Although just 7% of the population attend independent fee-paying schools, the survey reveals that almost three quarters (71%) of top military officers were educated privately, with 12% having been taught in comprehensive schools. In the field of law, 74% of top judges working in the high court and appeals court were privately educated, while in journalism, more than half (51%) of leading print journalists went to independent schools, with one in five having attended comprehensive schools, which currently educate 88% of the population. In medicine, meanwhile, Sutton Trust research says 61% of the country's top doctors were educated at independent schools; nearly a quarter (22%) went to grammar school and the remainder to comprehensives. In politics, the picture is a little better, with under a third (32%) of MPs having been privately educated, though that figure goes up to half of the cabinet, compared with 13% of the shadow cabinet. Graduates of Oxford and Cambridge universities also continue to dominate the field, though they educate less than 1% of the population. In law, nearly three quarters (74%) of the top judiciary went to Oxbridge; 54% of the country's leading journalists went to Oxbridge, and just under half (47%) of the cabinet attended Oxbridge, compared with 32% of the shadow cabinet. The Sutton Trust's Leading People 2016 report, which is published on Wednesday, tracks the educational backgrounds of leading figures in 10 areas of public life, among them film and music, which make an interesting contrast. The report highlights the stark contrast between the educational backgrounds of those in power and the general population. While 88% of the population attend comprehensive schools, the majority of top professionals in various fields have attended independent fee-paying schools. This raises questions about the lack of diversity in the UK's elite and the potential barriers to entry for those from less privileged backgrounds.\n\nThe Sutton Trust's research also suggests that attending Oxford and Cambridge universities can be a significant factor in achieving top positions. While these universities educate less than 1% of the population, nearly 75% of top judges, 54% of leading journalists, and almost half of the cabinet have attended Oxbridge. This concentration of talent at a few elite institutions may contribute to the dominance of privately educated individuals in top professions.\n\nThe report's findings are not limited to the legal, medical, and journalistic professions. In the field of politics, the majority of MPs have attended comprehensive schools, but the cabinet is dominated by privately educated individuals. This could be a reflection of the different paths to power, with those who attend comprehensive schools more likely to enter politics through local government or community activism.\n\nThe Sutton Trust's research also highlights the importance of social networks and connections in achieving success. Many of those who have attended independent schools and Oxbridge universities have access to a network of influential contacts and mentors, which can be a significant advantage in advancing their careers.\n\nThe report's authors suggest that the lack of diversity in the UK's elite is not solely due to educational background, but also to other factors such as socioeconomic status, family connections, and access to resources. They argue that addressing this issue will require a multifaceted approach, including increased support for state schools, targeted outreach programs, and initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in top professions.\n\nThe Sutton Trust's research is not without its critics, however. Some have argued that the report's findings are not surprising, given the historical dominance of the private sector in British society. Others have pointed out that the report's focus on educational background oversimplifies the complex factors that contribute to success and achievement.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the Sutton Trust's report provides a valuable snapshot of the UK's elite and highlights the need for greater diversity and inclusion in top professions. As the country grapples with issues of social inequality and economic mobility, the report's findings serve as a reminder of the importance of creating a more level playing field and promoting opportunities for all, regardless of their background or educational history.",

        "Text": "Lloyds Banking Group has put aside more cash to cover a late rush in customers claiming they were mis-sold payment protection insurance, bringing its total bill for the scandal to more than Â£20bn. The lender took another Â£550m in PPI charges in the second quarter after a \"significant increase\" in customers requesting information from the bank in the run-up to the 29 August claims deadline. Lloyds said the queries would lead to a rise in the number of complaints and administrative costs. The additional provision will help Lloyds Banking Group to better manage the influx of claims, which is expected to continue in the coming months. The bank's decision to set aside more funds comes as no surprise, given the intense scrutiny it has faced over its handling of PPI claims.\n\nThe payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal, which dates back to the early 2000s, has been a major headache for Lloyds and other major lenders. PPI was sold to customers alongside credit agreements, such as loans and credit cards, with the promise of providing financial protection in the event of illness, injury, or unemployment. However, many customers were sold policies without fully understanding the terms and conditions, or without even realizing they had taken out the insurance.\n\nAs a result, millions of customers have been seeking compensation from banks and financial institutions, leading to a massive bill for the industry. Lloyds, which is one of the largest lenders in the UK, has been at the forefront of the scandal, with estimates suggesting that it may have to pay out as much as Â£30 billion to affected customers.\n\nThe bank's latest provision brings its total bill for PPI claims to over Â£20 billion, a significant increase from the Â£17.4 billion it set aside in 2018. The additional funds will be used to cover the costs of processing claims, as well as any potential compensation payments to customers.\n\nDespite the significant costs associated with the PPI scandal, Lloyds has been working to improve its handling of claims and to provide better support to affected customers. The bank has established a dedicated team to deal with PPI complaints, and has implemented new processes to ensure that customers receive a fair and timely resolution to their claims.\n\nIn a statement, Lloyds said: \"We continue to work hard to resolve PPI complaints as quickly and fairly as possible. We understand that this has been a frustrating and disappointing experience for many customers, and we are committed to making things right.\"\n\nThe bank's efforts to address the PPI scandal have been welcomed by consumer groups and regulators, who have been pushing for greater transparency and accountability from lenders. However, the scandal is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the banking industry, with many lenders still facing significant costs and reputational damage.\n\nIn the meantime, customers who believe they may have been mis-sold PPI are advised to contact their bank or financial institution to request information and to make a claim. The deadline for making a claim is August 29, 2022, after which time customers will no longer be able to make a claim.",

        "Text": "Despite President Trump's call on Twitter for a boycott, shares of AT&T, which acquired CNN last year, rose 1.7 percent on Monday. President Trump on Monday floated the notion of a consumer boycott of AT&T, the telecommunications firm turned media colossus, an apparent attempt to punish the company for the news coverage produced by one of its subsidiaries, CNN. \"I believe that if people stopped using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway,\" the president wrote on Twitter, shortly after touching down in Britain for a state visit. The tweet, which was met with widespread criticism from media organizations and free speech advocates, marked the latest salvo in the ongoing feud between the Trump administration and CNN. The president's call for a boycott came just days after CNN reported on a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had made a promise to a foreign leader, sparking a controversy that has engulfed Washington.\n\nDespite the president's assertion that CNN is \"dying in the ratings,\" the network has actually seen a significant increase in viewership in recent months. According to Nielsen ratings, CNN's primetime viewership has grown by 15% since the start of the year, while its total day viewership has increased by 12%.\n\nThe president's attack on CNN was widely condemned by media organizations and free speech advocates, who argued that it was an attempt to intimidate and silence a major news outlet. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit organization that advocates for press freedom, issued a statement expressing concern over the president's tweet.\n\n\"President Trump's call for a boycott of AT&T and CNN is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence a major news organization,\" said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. \"This kind of rhetoric is dangerous and undermines the very fabric of our democracy.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment on the president's tweet, but the administration has previously accused CNN of being \"fake news\" and has repeatedly attacked the network's reporting.\n\nThe president's call for a boycott also sparked concerns over the potential impact on AT&T's business. The company's shares may have risen on Monday, but analysts warned that a sustained boycott could have significant consequences for the company's bottom line.\n\n\"AT&T is a major player in the telecommunications industry, and a boycott could have a significant impact on its business,\" said Dan Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"If consumers start to boycott AT&T, it could lead to a decline in revenue and a potential impact on the company's stock price.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, AT&T's shares continued to rise on Tuesday, with the company's stock price up 2.5% in morning trading. The company's acquisition of Time Warner, which included CNN, was completed last year and has been a major focus of the Trump administration's antitrust enforcement efforts.\n\nThe president's tweet was also seen as an attempt to distract from the growing controversy over his handling of the whistleblower complaint. The complaint, which was filed with the Intelligence Community Inspector General, alleges that Trump made a promise to a foreign leader that was not in the best interest of the United States.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a heated debate over the president's handling of the complaint and his interactions with foreign leaders. The White House has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations have sparked a growing number of calls for the president's impeachment.\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, the president's call for a boycott of AT&T and CNN is likely to remain a major focus of the debate over the role of the media in American politics.",

Amigo specialises in guarantor loans, which use friends and family to guarantee repayments on loans to people who might otherwise struggle to borrow. The lender said it now expected no growth in its loan book as it adopted a \"more conservative view\" on lending. It also said it would be setting aside more cash as provisions to cover a rising number of customers falling behind on repayments. The company's warning sent shockwaves through the financial markets, with Amigo's shares plummeting to a record low. The sharp decline in the company's stock price wiped out millions of pounds in value, leaving investors reeling.\n\nIndustry analysts have expressed concerns about the impact of the regulatory crackdown on Amigo's business model. \"Guarantor loans have always been a high-risk product, and the regulators are finally taking steps to address the concerns around them,\" said Sarah Jones, a financial analyst at investment firm, Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nAmigo's reliance on guarantor loans has been a key factor in its success, but it has also been criticized for its aggressive marketing tactics and high interest rates. The company has faced numerous complaints from customers who have struggled to repay their loans, leading to a surge in defaults.\n\nThe company's decision to set aside more cash as provisions to cover defaults is seen as a prudent move, but it will also put pressure on Amigo's profits. The lender has already been struggling to maintain its profitability in recent years, and the additional provisions will only add to its financial woes.\n\nAmigo's warning comes at a time when the UK economy is facing significant uncertainty.

Some customers alleged that the IT \"upgrade\" had left them with rogue credits and debits on their accounts, while others complained they had been given access to random accounts. TSB said its 1.9 million mobile and internet banking customers suffered \"intermittent\" failures to access their accounts on Monday, while for about half an hour a glitch gave some users a view of \"nominee\" accounts they would not normally see. The transfer had been planned for months, and was supposed to be completed by Sunday evening, but on Monday morning the bank was bombarded with complaints from customers unable to log on. TSB was carved out of Lloyds Bank and then bought in 2015 by Spain's Banco Sabadell. Initially, Lloyds continued to handle the IT infrastructure for TSB but over the weekend it moved all customer accounts to a system designed by Sabadell for its UK customers. Customers were warned that they would not be able to conduct transactions on the internet or their mobile phone over the weekend. When problems emerged on Monday morning, TSB said it hoped to have its systems \"up and running again soon\" but the outages persisted all day. As the day wore on, frustration turned to anger among TSB customers, with many taking to social media to express their discontent. The hashtag #TSBFail trended on Twitter, with customers sharing their experiences of being unable to access their accounts or dealing with unexpected transactions.\n\n\"We've had customers who have been unable to access their accounts, and others who have been given access to accounts that aren't their own,\" said a spokesperson for TSB. \"We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe bank's IT system was initially thought to be the cause of the problems, but it later emerged that a combination of factors had contributed to the chaos. A technical glitch, combined with a surge in customer traffic, had overwhelmed the system, causing it to malfunction.\n\nTSB's CEO, Paul Pester, issued a statement apologizing for the disruption and assuring customers that the bank was doing everything it could to get its systems back up and running. \"We understand how frustrating this must be for our customers, and we are working around the clock to resolve the issue,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, customers were left to wait and hope that their accounts would be restored to normal soon. Some were forced to visit branches in person to access their money, while others were left with no choice but to wait until the issue was resolved.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the readiness of TSB's new IT system, which was designed to be more efficient and user-friendly. However, it appears that the bank may have underestimated the complexity of the transfer and the potential for technical issues.\n\nAs the dust settles, TSB is left to pick up the pieces and restore confidence among its customers. The bank has promised to provide a full investigation into the incident and to take steps to prevent similar problems in the future. For now, customers are left to hope that their accounts will be restored to normal soon and that the bank will learn from its mistakes.",

        "Text": "A spate of streaming services are on their way from major tech and entertainment companies, promising viewers a trove of binge-worthy new shows and movies. There's something for advertisers, too: your personal data. Recent deals involving the media conglomerate AT&T, the streaming device seller Roku, the advertising giant Publicis and other companies have expanded the surveillance infrastructure that operates in the background of streaming services. While viewers focus on the action onscreen, tracking technology quietly sops up information about their habits and uses it to target them with more relevant, traceable ads. It is a \"digital daisy chain of data-gathering on viewers,\" according to Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. Many streaming customers are unaware that the sitcom titles they prefer, the ads they do not skip, their email addresses and the serial numbers identifying the devices they use are being harvested and distributed. Others willingly opt in to, say, have a record of their recent cooking show binge, watched through Amazon Fire TV, transmitted to an advertiser that can then deliver a recipe book ad to their laptop or tablet. But recent research suggests that even when viewers try to shield their information, it is sometimes tracked without their permission and shared with corporate giants like Facebook, Google and Netflix. The practice of collecting and sharing user data has raised concerns among privacy advocates, who argue that it compromises the security and autonomy of individuals. \"The idea that you're giving permission to track your behavior and share it with third-party companies is a myth,\" said Chester. \"Most people don't realize that their data is being shared with multiple companies, and that's a major problem.\"\n\nThe recent deals between streaming services and advertising companies have only exacerbated the issue. For instance, AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, the parent company of HBO and Warner Bros., has given the telecommunications giant access to a vast amount of user data. Similarly, Roku's partnership with Publicis has enabled the advertising company to collect data on user viewing habits and target them with personalized ads.\n\nThe consequences of this data collection are far-reaching. According to a report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit digital rights organization, many streaming services are failing to provide users with adequate transparency and control over their data. The report found that only 12% of streaming services provide users with a clear explanation of how their data is being collected and used.\n\nThe lack of transparency has led to concerns about the potential for data breaches and misuse. \"When you're collecting and sharing so much personal data, you're creating a massive attack surface,\" said Chris Soghoian, a principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It's only a matter of time before we see a major data breach that exposes millions of people's personal information.\"\n\nIn response to growing concerns about data privacy, some streaming services are beginning to take steps to improve transparency and user control. For example, Netflix has introduced a feature that allows users to opt out of data collection and sharing. However, many experts argue that more needs to be done to protect users' privacy.\n\n\"The streaming industry needs to take a hard look at its data collection practices and provide users with more transparency and control,\" said Chester. \"The current system is unsustainable and poses a significant risk to users' privacy and security.\"\n\nAs the streaming wars continue to heat up, it remains to be seen whether the industry will prioritize user privacy or continue to prioritize profits. One thing is certain, however: the onus is on consumers to stay informed and take steps to protect their data in the face of an increasingly surveillance-heavy digital landscape.",

The UN expert, who visited Assange in Belmarsh prison, London, where he is currently serving a 50-week sentence for skipping bail, believes that Assange's condition is a direct result of the prolonged and intense psychological pressure he has faced since being arrested in 2019.\n\nAssange's lawyers have long argued that their client's health is deteriorating rapidly due to the harsh conditions of his imprisonment and the stress of facing extradition to the US, where he faces up to 175 years in prison for charges related to the publication of classified documents. The WikiLeaks founder has been held in solitary confinement for much of his time in prison, with limited access to fresh air, exercise, and social interaction.\n\nMelzer's appeal to the UK government is the latest development in a long and contentious legal battle that has raised concerns about the impact of extradition on Assange's mental and physical health. The UN expert's findings are likely to add significant weight to Assange's legal team's arguments that he is not fit to stand trial in the US.\n\nThe UK government has previously rejected calls to release Assange, citing the need to respect the US extradition request. However, Melzer's intervention is likely to put pressure on the government to reconsider its stance and prioritize Assange's human rights and well-being.\n\nAssange's supporters and human rights groups have long argued that his imprisonment and potential extradition to the US are a threat to press freedom and the right to publish classified information. The case has sparked a global debate about the limits of government power and the need to protect whistleblowers and journalists who expose government wrongdoing.\n\nThe UK government is expected to respond to Melzer's appeal in the coming days, with a decision on Assange's extradition likely to be made in the near future. The outcome of the case is likely to have significant implications for press freedom and human rights around the world.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- On the same day Facebook announced that it had carried out its biggest purge yet of American accounts peddling disinformation, the company quietly made another revelation: It had removed 66 accounts, pages and apps linked to Russian firms that build facial recognition software for the Russian government. Facebook said Thursday that it had removed any accounts associated with SocialDataHub and its sister firm, Fubutech, because the companies violated its policies by scraping data from the social network. \"Facebook has reason to believe your work for the government has included matching photos from individuals' personal social media accounts in order to identify them,\" the company said in a cease-and-desist letter to SocialDataHub that was dated Tuesday and viewed by The New York Times. Facebook gave the companies until Friday to detail what data they had taken and then delete it all. Facebook's move comes as the social media giant faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of disinformation and privacy concerns. The company's announcement on Thursday was part of a broader effort to address these issues, which has included the removal of hundreds of millions of fake accounts and the implementation of new policies aimed at reducing the spread of misinformation.\n\nThe removal of the Russian-linked accounts is particularly significant, as it highlights the ongoing efforts of foreign entities to use social media platforms for nefarious purposes. Facebook has faced criticism in the past for its handling of Russian disinformation campaigns, which were linked to the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nSocialDataHub and Fubutech, the two Russian firms targeted by Facebook, specialize in building facial recognition software for the Russian government. The companies have been accused of using social media data to identify individuals and track their online activities.\n\nFacebook's decision to remove the accounts comes after an investigation by the company's security team, which found that the firms had violated Facebook's policies by scraping data from the social network. The company's cease-and-desist letter to SocialDataHub warned that the firms had used Facebook's data to match photos of individuals with their personal social media accounts, in order to identify them.\n\n\"This activity is a clear violation of our policies and we have removed the accounts and apps associated with SocialDataHub and Fubutech,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. \"We take these issues very seriously and will continue to work to protect the privacy and security of our users.\"\n\nThe removal of the Russian-linked accounts is likely to raise concerns about the use of social media data by foreign governments. The incident highlights the need for social media companies to be more proactive in addressing these issues and ensuring that their platforms are not used to undermine democracy or facilitate human rights abuses.\n\nIn response to the incident, privacy advocates have called for greater transparency and accountability from social media companies. \"This is a clear example of why we need stronger privacy protections and greater transparency from social media companies,\" said Amie Stepanovich, the director of the domestic surveillance project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"Facebook needs to be more proactive in addressing these issues and ensuring that its platform is not used to harm individuals or undermine democracy.\"\n\nThe incident is also likely to raise questions about the role of social media companies in the global effort to combat disinformation. As social media platforms continue to play a central role in shaping public opinion and influencing political discourse, it is essential that they take a more active role in addressing these issues and ensuring that their platforms are used responsibly.\n\nIn the coming days, Facebook is expected to provide more information about the incident and the measures it is taking to prevent similar violations in the future. The company's decision to remove the Russian-linked accounts is a significant step forward in addressing the use of social media data by foreign governments, and it is essential that social media companies continue to take a proactive approach to addressing these issues.",

In his 1974 book, he argued that the modern delivery room bowed to the needs of doctors, women and procedures while often overlooking those of a primary player in the birth: the baby. Frederick Leboyer, a French physician whose natural birth methods were adopted in delivery rooms around the world, died on May 25 at his home in Vens, Switzerland. He was 98. Frederick Leboyer's Legacy Lives On: A Pioneer in Natural Childbirth\n\nFrederick Leboyer, a French physician and pioneer in natural childbirth, passed away on May 25 at the age of 98. His remarkable contributions to the field of obstetrics have left a lasting impact on the way babies are born, and his legacy continues to inspire and influence healthcare professionals around the world.\n\nBorn in 1922, Leboyer was a strong advocate for a more gentle and compassionate approach to childbirth. In his 1974 book, \"Birth Without Violence,\" he challenged the conventional medical practices of the time, arguing that the needs of doctors, medical procedures, and hospital protocols often took precedence over the well-being of the baby. He believed that by adopting a more natural and humane approach, mothers and babies could experience a more peaceful and empowering birth.\n\nLeboyer's ideas were revolutionary for their time, and his book sparked a global movement towards more natural and non-invasive childbirth practices. His methods, which emphasized the importance of positioning, movement, and emotional support during labor, have been adopted by hospitals and birthing centers worldwide.\n\nOne of Leboyer's most enduring contributions was the concept of the \"warm bath\" or \"water birth.\" He believed that immersing the baby in warm water immediately after birth could help reduce stress and promote a sense of calm. This practice, which was once considered unconventional, is now widely accepted and has become a standard component of many birthing plans.\n\nLeboyer's work has not only improved the birth experience for mothers and babies but has also led to a greater understanding of the importance of early skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding. His emphasis on the emotional and psychological well-being of new mothers has also helped to reduce the incidence of postpartum depression and anxiety.\n\nThroughout his career, Leboyer was a vocal advocate for women's rights and autonomy in childbirth. He believed that women should have the freedom to make informed choices about their own care and that healthcare providers should prioritize their needs and well-being above all else.\n\nAs the world mourns the loss of this remarkable individual, his legacy will continue to inspire and guide healthcare professionals, mothers, and babies alike. Leboyer's work has left a lasting impact on the way we approach childbirth, and his commitment to natural, compassionate, and empowering birth practices will be remembered for generations to come.",

Such is the thinking at NBCUniversal, which announced on Tuesday that its new streaming service would be named Peacock. \"For us, it's the perfect nod to the legacy without being too on the nose,\" said Bonnie Hammer, chairwoman of the upcoming streaming service. \"From my point of view, it screams that we are proud and we are bold.\" NBC has released the name and logo for its new streaming service. When Peacock makes its debut in April, it will join the growing list of new streaming services, including Apple TV Plus (Nov. 1), Disney Plus (Nov. 12) and HBO Max, which is also to start in April. These platforms will enter an increasingly competitive arena that already includes the established services Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. To compete, Peacock intends to have 15,000 hours of content from its vast library available on both its ad-supported and subscription-based services. Highlights will include complete seasons of \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" \"Cheers,\" \"Downton Abbey,\" \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" \"Friday Night Lights\" and \"Frasier.\" In June, NBCUniversal paid a $500 million to regain the rights to \"The Office,\" according to a person familiar with the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity because the terms were not public. The streaming service, Peacock, is expected to offer a mix of original content, including TV shows and movies, as well as a vast library of classic TV shows and movies from NBCUniversal's vast archives. The service will be available on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and streaming devices like Roku and Chromecast.\n\nIn addition to the extensive library of content, Peacock will also offer a range of original programming, including new TV shows and movies produced exclusively for the service.

The service's logo, which features a stylized image of a peacock's plumage, is designed to evoke the sense of fun and playfulness that is at the heart of NBCUniversal's brand.\n\n\"We're not trying to be the most serious or the most boring,\" said Hammer. \"We're trying to be the most fun and the most entertaining. We're trying to be the service that people want to spend their time with.\"\n\nThe service is set to launch in April, with a free, ad-supported option available to users. The service will also offer a premium, ad-free option for users who are willing to pay a monthly fee. The pricing for the premium option has not yet been announced.\n\nOverall, the launch of Peacock marks a significant milestone for NBCUniversal, as the company looks to expand its reach and offerings in the rapidly changing world of streaming. With its unique blend of classic TV shows, original programming, and live events, Peacock is poised to become a major player in the streaming wars.",

        "Text": "The former BBC director general Mark Thompson believes the UK is facing \"a total loss of culture sovereignty\" which will leave the country increasingly divided unless the government acts now to fund public service journalism and stop US companies such as Netflix from dominating the media landscape. Thompson left the BBC in 2012 to become chief executive of the New York Times, where he has helped turn the once-struggling newspaper into a digital success. He suggests that unless viewers recognise \"your language, your life experience, your community in the prevailing culture\" then they lose their sense of individual and collective agency, which plays into issues such as Brexit. \"No one wants to see the UK turn into a cultural Airstrip One, but it's a clear and present danger. Thompson's warning comes as the UK's media landscape continues to shift, with many traditional newspapers and broadcasters struggling to adapt to the rise of online platforms and streaming services. The dominance of US companies such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, which have billions of dollars to invest in content, has left many UK-based producers struggling to compete.\n\nAccording to Thompson, the lack of funding for public service journalism is exacerbating the problem, as it leaves a void in the market for high-quality, in-depth reporting on issues that affect the UK and its people. \"We're seeing a decline in the quality of journalism, particularly in the areas that matter most to people's lives, such as education, healthcare, and social justice,\" he said. \"This is not just a problem for the media industry, it's a problem for democracy itself.\"\n\nThompson's comments have been echoed by other industry experts, who warn that the loss of cultural sovereignty could have far-reaching consequences for the UK's identity and sense of community. \"When you have a dominant culture that is not representative of the people, it can lead to feelings of disconnection and disempowerment,\" said Dr. Emma Bond, a media studies expert at the University of Sussex. \"This can have a profound impact on people's sense of belonging and their ability to engage with the world around them.\"\n\nThe government has faced criticism for its lack of action on this issue, with many arguing that it is failing to provide adequate support for the UK's media industry. In response to Thompson's comments, a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that the government was \"committed to supporting the UK's media industry\" and was working to \"promote diversity and plurality in the media landscape\".\n\nHowever, Thompson remains skeptical, arguing that words are not enough and that concrete action is needed to address the crisis. \"The government needs to take concrete steps to support public service journalism and to prevent the dominance of US companies in the UK media market,\" he said. \"This includes providing funding for independent media outlets, promoting diversity and inclusion in the industry, and ensuring that the UK's media landscape reflects the country's unique culture and values.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, many are left wondering what the future holds for the UK's media industry. Will the country be able to maintain its cultural sovereignty, or will it become increasingly dominated by foreign companies? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the stakes are high, and the consequences of inaction could be severe.",

        "Text": "The average price of a UK home edged up by 0.2% in April, according to the UK's biggest building society, despite expectations that a busy start to the year would be followed by a sharp drop in demand. Nationwide said the average price paid for a property during the month had risen to a new high of Â£202,436, after breaking through the Â£200,000 barrier in March. The monthly rise was the lowest since November and brought the year-on-year rate of increase down to 4.9%, from 5.7% in March. The latest figures from Nationwide, which is one of the largest mortgage lenders in the UK, suggest that the housing market is still showing resilience despite the usual seasonal slowdown in April. The building society's chief economist, Robert Gardner, attributed the continued growth to a shortage of homes for sale, particularly in the face of strong demand from first-time buyers.\n\n\"Despite the usual spring slowdown, the housing market has continued to show remarkable resilience,\" Gardner said. \"The shortage of homes for sale remains a major constraint, and this is driving up prices. We expect this trend to continue in the coming months, although at a slower pace.\"\n\nThe data from Nationwide also showed that the number of properties sold in April increased by 1.4% compared to the same month last year, with the average number of days it takes to sell a property remaining at around 60 days. This suggests that the market is still relatively buoyant, despite the slight slowdown in price growth.\n\nHowever, some experts have warned that the market may be due for a correction, given the rapid pace of price growth in recent years. \"While the housing market has been performing well, we do need to be mindful of the risks of a bubble forming,\" said Kate Faulkner, a property expert at the website PropertyMyths. \"Prices have been rising at a rate that is unsustainable in the long term, and we may see a correction in the coming months.\"\n\nThe latest figures from Nationwide also highlight the regional variations in the housing market. The South West of England saw the biggest increase in prices, with a 2.1% rise in April, while the North East saw the smallest increase, with a 0.5% rise. London, which has been a major driver of the housing market in recent years, saw a 1.3% increase in prices, although this was still below the national average.\n\nOverall, the latest figures from Nationwide suggest that the UK housing market remains strong, although there are signs that the pace of growth may be slowing. As the market continues to evolve, it will be important to monitor the data closely to see if this trend continues, or if there are any signs of a correction on the horizon.",

The public rebuke came as Donald Trump reportedly prepared to pull out of the Paris climate accord, the agreement forged by close to 200 countries to address climate change. Some 62% of shareholders voted for the resolution and against Exxon's management at the company's annual meeting in Dallas, Texas. The vote to more clearly report how climate change affects Exxon's business comes as investors are increasingly demanding companies disclose the likely impact of global warming and follows the passing of similar proposals at two smaller energy companies earlier this month. Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England, which led the vote, said shareholders were showing how out of step the Trump administration had become on climate change. \"Trump is acting contrary to Wall Street and the world's largest investors,\" he said. The unexpected outcome of the vote sent a strong message to ExxonMobil's management and the oil industry as a whole, as well as the Trump administration, which has been criticized for its stance on climate change. The resolution, which was backed by several major investors, including the Church Commissioners for England, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund, calls on ExxonMobil to provide more detailed information on the financial risks associated with climate change.\n\nExxonMobil's CEO, Darren Woods, had previously resisted calls to disclose more information on climate change, citing concerns about the company's competitive advantage. However, the overwhelming support for the resolution suggests that investors are increasingly willing to hold companies accountable for their role in addressing the climate crisis.\n\nThe vote comes as ExxonMobil faces growing pressure from investors, regulators, and the public to take a more proactive role in addressing climate change. The company has faced criticism for its role in spreading misinformation about climate change and for its investments in fossil fuels, which are seen as a major contributor to the crisis.\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord has been widely criticized by world leaders and environmental groups, and the vote at ExxonMobil's annual meeting is seen as a rebuke to the administration's stance. The accord, which was signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe vote at ExxonMobil's annual meeting is also seen as a significant victory for environmental activists, who have been pushing for companies to take a more proactive role in addressing climate change. The resolution is seen as a step towards greater transparency and accountability for companies that are contributing to the crisis.\n\nIn a statement, ExxonMobil said it would \"carefully consider the outcome of the vote and will engage with our shareholders to understand their views.\" The company also reiterated its commitment to addressing climate change, but did not provide further details on how it plans to do so.\n\nThe outcome of the vote is likely to have far-reaching implications for the oil industry, as well as for companies in other sectors that are impacted by climate change. It is also likely to put pressure on other companies to disclose more information on the financial risks associated with climate change and to take a more proactive role in addressing the crisis.",

His death followed soon after he had admitted to being a British agent for the best part of 20 years. Its central claim was that Gerry Adams, the party's leader, had been responsible for ordering the murder. And such is the status of Spotlight that the allegation made headlines in Ireland's leading newspapers, plus one or two UK nationals.

An extreme close-up of a very thin slice of a human kidney stone reveals the intricate patterns of its mineral layers. Scientists Uncover Hidden Patterns in Human Kidney Stones\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Illinois has made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of urology, shedding light on the intricate patterns of mineral layers within human kidney stones. Led by Mayandi Sivaguru and Jessica Saw from the Bruce Fouke Lab and the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, the study has provided a deeper understanding of the composition and formation of these stones.\n\nThe researchers used advanced imaging techniques to capture an extreme close-up of a very thin slice of a human kidney stone. The resulting image reveals the complex patterns of mineral layers, which are typically invisible to the naked eye. The study's findings have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of kidney stones, which affect millions of people worldwide.\n\n\"Kidney stones are a common and painful condition, and understanding their composition and formation is crucial for developing effective treatments,\" said Sivaguru, the lead author of the study. \"Our research has shown that the patterns of mineral layers within kidney stones are much more complex than previously thought, and this information can be used to improve diagnostic techniques and develop new treatments.\"\n\nThe study used a technique called scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to capture the high-resolution image of the kidney stone. SEM is a powerful tool that uses a focused beam of electrons to produce high-magnification images of the sample's surface. In this case, the researchers used the technique to capture an image of a thin slice of the kidney stone, which revealed the intricate patterns of mineral layers.\n\nThe image shows a series of concentric rings, with each ring representing a different layer of minerals. The researchers found that the patterns of mineral layers varied depending on the type of stone and the individual's medical history. The study's findings suggest that the patterns of mineral layers may be used as a biomarker to diagnose kidney stones and predict their likelihood of recurrence.\n\nThe research has also shed light on the process of kidney stone formation, which is still not fully understood. The study suggests that the patterns of mineral layers may be influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle.\n\nThe study's findings have been published in the journal Urology and have significant implications for the field of urology. The researchers are now working to develop new diagnostic techniques and treatments that take into account the complex patterns of mineral layers within kidney stones.\n\n\"This research has the potential to revolutionize the way we diagnose and treat kidney stones,\" said Fouke, the director of the Bruce Fouke Lab. \"We are excited to continue our research and explore the many possibilities that this discovery presents.\"",

The former prime minister called for the creation of a joint Treasury-Bank strategic oversight group to assess risks to the economy, saying it was unfair for Threadneedle Street to be blamed for policy failures in areas it did not control. Speaking at a conference to mark 20 years since his decision to grant the Bank independence in 1997, Brown said the shock announcement within five days of Labour being elected had been vindicated. Brown's proposal for a joint oversight group comes as the Bank of England faces growing scrutiny over its role in the 2008 financial crisis and its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics have argued that the Bank's independence has led to a lack of accountability, with some calling for greater parliamentary oversight.\n\nThe former prime minister's comments have been met with support from some quarters, with economists and financial experts arguing that a joint approach would help to prevent future crises by ensuring that policymakers and regulators are working together more effectively.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced. Some have expressed concerns that the proposal could undermine the Bank's independence and lead to political interference in its decision-making. The Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, has previously emphasized the importance of maintaining the institution's independence, saying that it is essential for its ability to make tough decisions in the interests of the economy.\n\nDespite these concerns, Brown remains adamant that his proposal is the right way forward. He argues that the current system, in which the Bank is responsible for setting monetary policy but has limited powers to address broader economic issues, is unsustainable.\n\n\"The Bank of England is not responsible for the entire economy,\" Brown said. \"It's not responsible for the Treasury's fiscal policy, it's not responsible for the Chancellor's decisions on public spending. And yet, when things go wrong, the Bank is always the one that gets blamed.\"\n\nBrown's proposal is likely to be met with a mixed response from politicians and policymakers. Some will see it as a necessary step to ensure that the Bank is held accountable for its actions, while others will be concerned about the potential implications for the institution's independence.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the debate is likely to continue for some time. As the Bank of England marks 20 years since its independence, it is clear that the institution's role in the economy is still evolving. And with the global economy facing numerous challenges, from Brexit to climate change, the need for effective policymaking and regulation has never been greater.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, we can expect to see a lively debate about the future of the Bank of England and its relationship with elected politicians.

Many employees are expressing frustration and disappointment over the large payout, which they see as a slap on the wrist for Mr. O'Reilly's alleged misconduct.\n\n\"This is a slap in the face to all the women who have been affected by his behavior,\" said one Fox News employee, who wished to remain anonymous. \"It's like they're rewarding him for his actions, rather than holding him accountable.\"\n\nOthers are questioning whether the network's decision to part ways with Mr. O'Reilly was truly motivated by a desire to address the allegations of sexual harassment, or whether it was simply a PR move to avoid further negative publicity.\n\n\"I think it's clear that this was a business decision, not a moral one,\" said another employee. \"They're trying to save face and avoid a lawsuit, rather than actually doing what's right.\"\n\nThe news of Mr. O'Reilly's payout has also raised questions about the network's internal investigation into the allegations against him. While Fox News has maintained that it took the allegations seriously and conducted a thorough investigation, many are skeptical about the process and the findings.\n\n\"We're still waiting to see the results of the investigation, and until we do, it's hard to say whether the network really took the allegations seriously,\" said a source close to the investigation. \"It's clear that Mr. O'Reilly was given a free pass, and that's not acceptable.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Mr. O'Reilly's departure is not only affecting the network's employees, but also its reputation and viewership. Many have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment, and some have vowed to boycott the network in response to the payout.\n\n\"This is a black eye for Fox News, and it's going to take a long time to recover from this,\" said one viewer. \"I'm done with them, and I'll never watch their channel again.\"\n\nAs the fallout from Mr. O'Reilly's departure continues to unfold, it's clear that the network has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of its employees and viewers. The question is, will they be able to do so, or will the controversy surrounding Mr. O'Reilly's exit package continue to haunt them for years to come?",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Beyond Meat revealed details on Monday for its planned Wall Street debut, in what will be a test for businesses that want to replace meat with plant-based alternatives. The company said in a regulatory filing that it hoped to begin selling its stock at a price that would value the start-up at about $1.2 billion, slightly less than what it was worth in its most recent private investment round. The shares will be sold on the Nasdaq exchange. Beyond Meat's IPO: A Test for Plant-Based Meat Alternatives\n\nBeyond Meat, a leading manufacturer of plant-based meat alternatives, is set to make its highly anticipated debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The company's initial public offering (IPO) is expected to raise around $200 million, valuing the company at approximately $1.2 billion.\n\nThe IPO filing provides a glimpse into Beyond Meat's financials, revealing a company that has experienced rapid growth since its founding in 2009. The company's revenue has increased by over 170% in the past year, driven by the growing demand for plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nBeyond Meat's products, which include plant-based burgers, sausages, and ground beef, are already widely available in major retailers such as Whole Foods, Kroger, and Safeway. The company has also partnered with major fast-food chains, including Del Taco and TGI Fridays, to offer its products on their menus.\n\nThe IPO is seen as a test for plant-based meat alternatives, which have gained significant traction in recent years. Beyond Meat's success will likely have a ripple effect on the industry, influencing the valuations of other companies that are also seeking to replace meat with plant-based alternatives.\n\nBeyond Meat's IPO is also seen as a vote of confidence in the plant-based meat alternative market. The company's growth has been driven by the increasing demand for healthier and more sustainable food options. With the rise of flexitarianism and veganism, consumers are looking for alternatives to traditional meat products that are not only healthier but also more environmentally friendly.\n\nThe IPO is expected to be a hotly contested event, with many investors eager to get a piece of the action. The company has already received significant interest from institutional investors, including venture capital firms and private equity firms.\n\nBeyond Meat's IPO is set to take place on May 1, with the company expecting to begin trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol BYND. The IPO is expected to be a significant milestone for the company, marking a new chapter in its growth and development.\n\nIn conclusion, Beyond Meat's IPO is a significant event that will have far-reaching implications for the plant-based meat alternative industry. The company's success will likely influence the valuations of other companies in the space, and its IPO is seen as a test for the viability of plant-based meat alternatives as a viable alternative to traditional meat products.",

        "Text": "MILLBURN, N.J. -- Matthew Stewart believes there is a place for charter schools. Just not in his schoolyard. Mr. Stewart, a stay-at-home father of three boys, moved to this wealthy township, about 20 miles from Midtown Manhattan, three years ago, filling his life with class activities and soccer practices. But in recent months, he has traded play dates for protests, enlisting more than 200 families in a campaign to block two Mandarin-immersion charter schools from opening in the area. The group, Millburn Parents Against Charter Schools, argues that the schools would siphon money from its children's education for unnecessarily specialized programs. The schools, to be based in nearby Maplewood and Livingston, would draw students and resources from Millburn and other area districts. \"I'm in favor of a quality education for everyone,\" Mr. Stewart said. \"In suburban areas like Millburn, there's no evidence whatsoever that the local school district is not doing its job. So what's the rationale for a charter school?\" Suburbs like Millburn, renowned for educational excellence, have become hotbeds in the nation's charter school battles, raising fundamental questions about the goals of a movement that began 20 years ago in Minnesota. Charter schools, which are publicly financed but independently operated, have mostly been promoted as a way to give poor children an alternative to underperforming urban schools -- to provide options akin to what those who can afford them have in the suburbs or in private schools. As the debate surrounding charter schools in affluent suburbs like Millburn intensifies, educators and policymakers are grappling with the implications of this trend. Proponents argue that charter schools can bring innovative teaching methods and resources to areas that need them most, while critics contend that they divert funds and attention away from traditional public schools.\n\nIn Millburn, the proposed Mandarin-immersion charter schools have sparked heated discussions about the allocation of resources and the potential impact on local schools. The Millburn Township Public Schools district, which is consistently ranked among the top in the state, has expressed concerns about the potential loss of students and funding to the charter schools.\n\n\"We understand that parents may be interested in exploring alternative educational options, but we believe that our district is providing a high-quality education that meets the needs of our students,\" said Dr. Christine Johnson, superintendent of the Millburn Township Public Schools. \"We're worried about the potential disruption to our community and the potential loss of funding that could impact our ability to provide the same level of services to our students.\"\n\nThe debate has also raised questions about the role of charter schools in suburban areas, where traditional public schools are often well-funded and well-regarded. Some argue that charter schools are not necessary in these areas, as they are already receiving a high-quality education.\n\n\"I think it's a bit of a luxury problem to have,\" said Dr. Diane Ravitch, a prominent education historian and critic of charter schools. \"In urban areas, charter schools were seen as a way to provide an alternative to failing schools. But in suburban areas like Millburn, where the schools are already doing a great job, it's harder to make the case for charter schools.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, the demand for charter schools in suburban areas shows no signs of slowing down. In nearby Maplewood, the proposed charter school has already received over 1,000 applications for its 250 available slots.\n\n\"We're thrilled with the response,\" said Dr. Karen Smith, founder of the Maplewood Charter School. \"We believe that our school will provide a unique and innovative educational experience that will benefit students and families in the area.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the future of charter schools in suburban areas is far from certain. While some see them as a valuable tool for providing educational options, others view them as a threat to the very fabric of traditional public education. As the battle over charter schools in Millburn and other suburban areas heats up, one thing is certain: the outcome will have far-reaching implications for the future of education in America.",

But even as BP increased the money set aside for spill-related costs to $32.2 billion, executives reiterated that the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion was not a result of gross negligence by the company. BP said it would release the results of its investigation in a report next month. \"It is clear that this accident was the result of multiple equipment failures and human mistakes involving many companies,\" said Tony Hayward, who is stepping down as BP's chief executive after criticism of his handling of the spill. BP said it planned to sell $25 billion to $30 billion in exploration and production assets within the next 18 months, or as much as 13 percent of its production assets around the world. The planned sales represent a sharply higher target than BP's previous goal of selling $10 billion in assets to help pay for the spill. The new strategy will be led by an American executive, Robert Dudley, who worked for Amoco until BP bought it in 1998. BP said Mr. Dudley would take over as chief executive on Oct. 1, after a two-month transition period. \"We will look at what we have learned from this incident. We will look at our culture and our safety and operations,\" Mr. Dudley said in a telephone interview with a small group of reporters. \"We are looking at a slimmer company, not a smaller company.\" BP's allocation of $32.2 billion for spill costs led to record loss of $17 billion for the second quarter. The new strategy, dubbed \"Step Change,\" aims to transform BP into a more agile and efficient company, with a focus on safety, operational excellence, and cost reduction. The plan involves a significant overhaul of the company's operations, including the sale of non-core assets, reduction of bureaucracy, and implementation of new safety protocols.\n\nAs part of the strategy, BP will also establish a new safety and operational excellence function, which will be responsible for overseeing the company's safety performance and identifying areas for improvement. The company will also invest in new technologies and tools to enhance its safety and operational capabilities.\n\nBP's decision to sell $25 billion to $30 billion in exploration and production assets is a significant departure from its previous goal of selling $10 billion in assets. The company believes that the sale of these assets will not only help to pay for the costs of the spill, but also allow it to focus on its core businesses and improve its overall financial performance.\n\nThe appointment of Robert Dudley as CEO is seen as a major change for BP. Dudley, who has a background in the oil industry and has worked for several major companies, including Amoco and BP, is known for his operational expertise and his ability to drive change. He has been tasked with leading BP's transformation and implementing its new strategy.\n\nDudley has already begun to make his mark on the company, announcing plans to reduce BP's bureaucracy and flatten its organizational structure. He has also emphasized the importance of safety and operational excellence, and has vowed to make BP a more agile and responsive company.\n\nThe appointment of Dudley has been welcomed by many in the industry, who see him as a strong leader who can help to restore BP's reputation and improve its performance. However, some have expressed concerns about the impact of the sale of assets on BP's ability to invest in new projects and maintain its market share.\n\nDespite these challenges, BP remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company believes that its new strategy will help it to emerge from the crisis a stronger and more resilient company, better equipped to compete in a rapidly changing energy landscape. As Dudley takes the reins, BP is poised to embark on a new chapter in its history, one that will be marked by transformation, innovation, and a renewed commitment to safety and operational excellence.",

        "Text": "Shareholders are being urged to use the annual general meetings of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline to put pressure on the companies to lower the price of their life-saving pneumonia vaccines. ShareAction, the responsible investment charity, issued the call ahead of Pfizer's AGM in New York on Thursday, and GSK's annual meeting in London next week. MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) has just delivered petitions to both companies asking them to lower their vaccine prices to $5 (Â£3.43) for each child in developing countries, and plans to raise the issue at both AGMs. Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death for children under five globally and kills almost 1 million children a year, it is estimated. The two pharmaceutical companies have dominated the market for the main pneumococcal vaccines for years. Pfizer and the British company GSK have come under growing pressure from more than 50 countries and international health charities to reduce the high price of pneumococcal vaccines. The price tag was the main reason why the cost of fully vaccinating a child was now 68 times more expensive than it was in 2001, ShareAction said. Ten vaccines are on the World Health Organisation schedule. According to MSF, the current prices of Pfizer and GSK's pneumococcal vaccines are prohibitively expensive for many developing countries, making it difficult for them to access these life-saving vaccines. The charity is urging shareholders to demand that the companies reduce their prices to make the vaccines more affordable for countries that need them most.\n\n\"We are calling on shareholders to hold Pfizer and GSK accountable for their role in perpetuating this public health crisis,\" said ShareAction's executive director, Catherine Howarth. \"The prices of these vaccines are unsustainable for many developing countries, and it's time for the companies to take responsibility for their impact on global health.\"\n\nMSF has been campaigning for lower vaccine prices for years, and has already seen some success. In 2015, GSK agreed to reduce the price of its pneumococcal vaccine by 20% for developing countries. However, MSF argues that more needs to be done to make the vaccines affordable for all.\n\n\"Pneumonia is a preventable and treatable disease, but the high prices of these vaccines are making it impossible for many countries to protect their children,\" said Dr. Unni Karunakara, MSF's international president. \"We urge Pfizer and GSK to take immediate action to reduce their prices and make these life-saving vaccines accessible to all.\"\n\nThe issue of vaccine pricing is not just a matter of access, but also of equity. Many developed countries, such as the US and the UK, have access to the pneumococcal vaccines at a much lower cost than developing countries. This has led to concerns about the fairness of the current pricing system.\n\n\"Pfizer and GSK are making huge profits from these vaccines, while many developing countries are struggling to access them,\" said Howarth. \"It's time for the companies to take a more responsible approach to their pricing and make these vaccines affordable for all.\"\n\nThe annual general meetings of Pfizer and GSK are expected to be closely watched by investors and health advocates, who will be pushing for change on the issue of vaccine pricing. With the lives of millions of children hanging in the balance, the stakes could not be higher.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Wednesday that he would resign in mid-October, an unexpected decision that gives President Trump greater leverage over central bank policy. Mr. Fischer, 73, cited \"personal reasons\" in a brief letter addressed to Mr. Trump. His four-year term was to have ended next June. The resignation puts immediate pressure on the Trump administration to replenish the Fed's depleted board. Mr. Fischer's departure would leave only three people in the seven board seats, the smallest number of governors in the Fed's history. It also means that Mr. Trump can appoint a majority of the Fed's board, bending the direction of its policy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants the Fed to loosen some of the regulatory strictures it has imposed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Among the decisions the president will have to make is whether to replace Janet L. Yellen as chairwoman or keep her on when her four-year term ends in early February. He faces a choice between a nominee who, like Ms. Yellen, stresses economic growth, or someone more palatable to conservatives who favor greater emphasis on curbing inflation. Mr. Fischer joined the Fed's board in May 2014 after a distinguished career as an academic economist and an international policy maker. The resignation of Stanley Fischer, a highly respected and influential figure in the Federal Reserve, has sent shockwaves through the financial community. His departure will leave a significant void in the Fed's leadership, and President Trump will have a crucial opportunity to shape the direction of monetary policy.\n\nAs the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Fischer has played a key role in shaping the central bank's policies, particularly in the areas of monetary policy and regulation. His expertise and experience will be deeply missed, and his resignation is likely to have a significant impact on the Fed's decision-making process.\n\nFischer's departure also raises questions about the future of the Fed's leadership. As the current term of Chairwoman Janet Yellen is set to expire in early February, Trump will have the opportunity to appoint a new chair. The decision is likely to be a contentious one, as Trump has previously expressed his desire to appoint a more conservative candidate who prioritizes curbing inflation over promoting economic growth.\n\nThe Fed's board of governors is currently composed of seven members, with only three remaining after Fischer's resignation. The depleted board will make it challenging for the Fed to make key decisions, particularly in the areas of monetary policy and regulation. The Trump administration will need to move quickly to fill the vacancies and ensure a smooth transition.\n\nFischer's resignation is also likely to have implications for the Fed's regulatory policies. As a strong advocate for stricter regulations, Fischer has been a key voice in shaping the Fed's approach to financial regulation. His departure could lead to a shift in the Fed's regulatory stance, potentially making it more lenient on banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe resignation of Stanley Fischer is a significant development in the world of finance, and its implications will be closely watched by investors, policymakers, and economists alike. As the Trump administration moves to fill the vacancies on the Fed's board, it will be important to ensure that the Fed remains a stable and effective institution that serves the interests of the American people.",

It is doubtful that he bothered to read them while cruising the Mediterranean on his \"Â£100m superyacht\", but the mainstream media message could not be clearer. Green is the hate figure of the moment. I don't think too many people will share the view of Forbes commentator Tim Worstall that it amounts to a witch hunt. National newspaper editors obviously disagree with him. The Daily Mail's front page on Monday, \"Sir Shifty bids to 'blackmail watchdog'\", was echoed in other papers: \"After 88 years, doors close on high st icon destroyed by one man's greed\" (Daily Mirror); \"Green is 'evil' and an 'asset stripper', claims MP\" (The Independent); \"Green in the firing line\" (i). The Sun ran a picture of a sobbing BHS employee overprinted with the headline \"Now give back the Green stuff... and the knighthood, too\". The backlash against Sir Philip Green has been swift and severe, with many calling for him to be stripped of his knighthood and for the government to take action to prevent similar corporate scandals in the future.\n\nThe closure of BHS, a 88-year-old British institution, has left thousands of employees without jobs and has raised questions about the accountability of its former owner. Sir Philip Green's decision to sell the company to a consortium of investors, who then promptly put it into administration, has been widely criticized as a cynical attempt to avoid his responsibilities to the pension fund and other stakeholders.\n\nThe pensions regulator, The Pensions Protection Fund (PPF), is investigating the sale and has accused Sir Philip Green of attempting to stymie their inquiry. The regulator has claimed that Green's lawyers are trying to block access to key documents and evidence, which has led to accusations of obstruction and a possible breach of the Companies Act.\n\nThe government has also come under pressure to take action, with many calling for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood and for the government to introduce new laws to prevent similar corporate scandals in the future. The Labour Party has promised to introduce a new law to require company owners to prioritize the pension fund if a company is sold, while the Liberal Democrats have called for a full inquiry into the collapse of BHS.\n\nIn the meantime, the former employees of BHS are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their jobs and the uncertainty that lies ahead. Many have expressed their anger and frustration at Sir Philip Green's actions, and have called for him to be held accountable for the damage he has caused.\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, one thing is clear: Sir Philip Green's reputation has been severely damaged, and it remains to be seen whether he will be able to recover from the fallout of the BHS scandal.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The longest government shutdown in United States history resulted in a \"shocking\" number of taxpayers' calls to the Internal Revenue Service going unreturned or being left to languish on hold for unusually long periods, according to a government audit released on Tuesday. The audit, by the office of the National Taxpayer Advocate, found that over five million pieces of mail went unanswered and 87,000 amended tax returns were not processed during the shutdown, when thousands of I.R.S. workers were furloughed or working without pay. The issues were especially acute since they followed significant changes to the tax code -- ushered in by President Trump's $1.5 trillion tax overhaul -- that left many people with questions about filing their returns. The audit, which covered the period from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, also revealed that the IRS's online services, including its popular \"Where's My Refund?\" tool, were severely impacted by the shutdown. As a result, many taxpayers were left in the dark about the status of their refunds, causing frustration and anxiety.\n\nThe National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson, described the situation as \"unacceptable\" and warned that the shutdown's impact on taxpayer services could have long-lasting consequences. \"The IRS's failure to respond to taxpayers' questions and concerns during the shutdown has created a perfect storm of confusion, frustration, and fear among taxpayers,\" Olson said.\n\nThe audit also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the shutdown on vulnerable populations, including low-income individuals, seniors, and small business owners. Many of these groups rely heavily on the IRS's services, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit, to access critical financial assistance.\n\nThe IRS has since made efforts to catch up on the backlog of unanswered calls and unprocessed tax returns. However, the agency still faces significant challenges in restoring its services to pre-shutdown levels. The IRS has reported that it is working to process the remaining amended tax returns and is making progress on answering outstanding calls, but the process is expected to take several months.\n\nIn response to the audit's findings, lawmakers have called for increased funding and resources for the IRS to prevent similar shutdown-related disruptions in the future. The House Ways and Means Committee has proposed a bill to provide additional funding for the IRS, while the Senate Finance Committee has introduced a measure to improve the agency's technology and customer service capabilities.\n\nAs the IRS continues to work through its backlog, taxpayers are advised to be patient and to check the agency's website for updates on their refund status. The IRS has also set up a special hotline for taxpayers who are experiencing difficulties or have questions about their tax returns.\n\nThe shutdown's impact on the IRS serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adequate funding and planning for government agencies that provide critical services to the public. As the nation moves forward, it is essential that policymakers prioritize the needs of taxpayers and ensure that the IRS is equipped to provide timely and effective services, even in the face of unexpected disruptions.",

Pressured by budget cuts from clients amid competition with Facebook and Google, Publicis said it was in a \"painful situation.\" The ad giant behind marketing campaigns and media placement for corporations like Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and L'Oreal, Publicis slashed its sales forecast for the year. Its stock price sank. Arthur Sadoun, the company's chief executive, sounded less than thrilled on a call with investors, saying that Publicis has \"dug deep\" to understand \"the challenges we are facing.\" On Monday, Mr. Sadoun sent a memo to employees. In the memo, Sadoun acknowledged the tough times the company is facing and emphasized the need for a collective effort to turn things around. \"We are in a period of significant transformation in the industry, and we must adapt to remain competitive,\" he wrote. \"We will not shy away from the challenges ahead, but instead, we will face them head-on and come out stronger on the other side.\"\n\nThe memo also outlined several initiatives aimed at cutting costs and improving efficiency. These include a reduction in non-essential spending, a review of the company's global real estate portfolio, and a consolidation of certain business units. Sadoun stressed that these measures are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the company.\n\nDespite the gloomy outlook, Publicis is not giving up on its ambitious plans to expand its digital capabilities.

In fact, our honkers have another, more important function: They warm and humidify the air we breathe, helping prevent illness and damage in our airways and lungs. Because of this, scientists have long suspected that nose shape evolved partly in response to local climate conditions. According to a recent study published in the journal Science Advances, researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery that confirms the link between nose shape and climate. The team, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a renowned expert in evolutionary biology, analyzed the nasal cavities of over 1,000 individuals from diverse geographic locations.\n\nThe study found that people living in colder climates tend to have a more prominent nasal bridge, which is the bony part of the nose that separates the two nostrils. This unique feature allows for better warming and humidification of the air, making it easier to breathe in harsh, cold environments. On the other hand, individuals from warmer climates have a more shallow nasal bridge, which is better suited for hot and humid conditions.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the shape of the nasal septum, the thin wall of cartilage and bone that separates the two sides of the nasal passages, is also influenced by climate. In colder climates, the septum is thicker and more curved, which helps to warm and humidify the air more effectively. In contrast, the septum is thinner and more straight in warmer climates, allowing for better heat dissipation and reduced humidity.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and adaptation to different environments. \"Our research suggests that the shape of the nose is not just a matter of aesthetics, but is actually a critical adaptation that has allowed humans to thrive in a wide range of climates,\" said Dr. Rodriguez.\n\nThe study also has practical applications in the field of medicine. For example, individuals with respiratory problems, such as chronic bronchitis or asthma, may benefit from nasal surgery that aims to restore the natural shape of their nose. This could help improve their breathing and overall quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, the nose is more than just a sense organ â€“ it is a vital part of our respiratory system that plays a crucial role in our ability to survive and thrive in different environments. The discovery of the link between nose shape and climate is a significant breakthrough that sheds new light on the evolution of human adaptation and has important implications for our understanding of human health and disease.",

        "Text": "\"If only we had the down payment\" may be one of the most frequent complaints among aspiring home buyers in cities across the country. Yifan Zhang, a 29-year-old entrepreneur who often hears this lament among her friends, has come up with a service that tries to help. When she bought a townhouse in Seattle with her husband last summer, she knew that the spare bedroom could generate extra income on Airbnb. But when she learned just how much they could collect each month -- enough to cover the mortgage, and sometimes more -- her entrepreneurial instincts kicked in: Why not front would-be home buyers money for a down payment, and then collect a share of their Airbnb rental income in return? That was how Loftium, a service in Seattle, came about: It will provide prospective home buyers with up to $50,000 for a down payment, as long as they are willing to continuously list an extra bedroom on Airbnb for one to three years and share most of the income with Loftium over that time. \"It's for the people who don't have the parents to help, or the high income to save while paying rent,\" said Ms. Zhang, who founded Loftium with Adam Stelle, another entrepreneur, and who has already had about 200 Airbnb guests in her townhouse. The innovative startup, Loftium, is revolutionizing the way people buy homes by providing a unique solution to the age-old problem of affording a down payment. By offering up to $50,000 in down payment assistance, Loftium is helping aspiring homeowners overcome a major hurdle in the buying process.\n\nAccording to Yifan Zhang, founder of Loftium, the idea was born out of her own experience as a homeowner. When she and her husband purchased a townhouse in Seattle, they realized that the spare bedroom could generate significant income on Airbnb. This sparked the idea to provide financial assistance to others who may not have the means to save for a down payment.\n\nUnder Loftium's program, prospective home buyers can receive up to $50,000 in down payment assistance in exchange for listing an extra bedroom on Airbnb for one to three years. The startup will collect a share of the rental income over this period, ensuring that the investment is repaid.\n\nLoftium's service is particularly appealing to individuals who do not have access to traditional sources of down payment assistance, such as family members or high-paying jobs. \"It's for the people who don't have the parents to help, or the high income to save while paying rent,\" said Ms. Zhang.\n\nSince its launch, Loftium has already seen significant interest from potential clients. The startup has received inquiries from over 1,000 individuals, with many expressing excitement about the opportunity to own a home without the burden of a large down payment.\n\nWhile Loftium's innovative approach has generated buzz in the real estate industry, some experts have raised concerns about the potential risks involved. \"There are certainly risks associated with investing in real estate, and it's important for individuals to carefully consider their financial situation before entering into any agreement,\" said John Smith, a real estate expert.\n\nDespite these concerns, Loftium's founders believe that their service can provide a valuable solution for aspiring homeowners. \"We're not just providing a down payment â€“ we're providing a way for people to build wealth and achieve their dream of homeownership,\" said Adam Stelle, co-founder of Loftium.\n\nAs Loftium continues to grow and expand, it remains to be seen whether this innovative approach will become a game-changer for the real estate industry. However, one thing is clear â€“ Loftium's commitment to helping aspiring homeowners achieve their goals is a welcome development in the world of real estate.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The European telecom operator Altice completed its $17.7 billion deal for Cablevision on Tuesday, its second major acquisition in a year and a step toward its goal of becoming a leading cable and broadband internet provider in the United States. After its purchase of Cablevision, which includes Newsday and a television station, the Altice subsidiary Altice U.S.A. will have 4.6 million broadband and cable television subscribers, making it the fourth-largest cable and broadband operator in the country, with customers in 20 states, including the New York market. Altice is a global telecommunications firm based in the Netherlands started 15 years ago by the French-Israeli billionaire entrepreneur Patrick Drahi. In addition to the United States, it operates in Europe, the Caribbean and Africa. The company wants to keep expanding, creating more consolidation in the market for a utility service -- broadband -- consumer advocates fear is controlled by fewer firms. (Comcast, Charter and Altice now control 52 percent of the cable market in the United States.) In an interview, Dexter Goei, chairman and chief executive of Altice U.S.A., talked about the company's plans and how, despite the many regulations recently aimed at the cable and broadband industry, he is not scared off. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation. In one year, you have closed acquisitions of Cablevision and Suddenlink. What next? We are going to take our time and be thoughtful about next steps, but fundamentally we are in the business of getting larger. Scale drives better economics and better strategic flexibility. We will look to do more. When we will do something more, I don't know. In 2016, we are very focused on the integration of, not just the two businesses in the U.S., but the entire Altice family. In what ways do you want to get larger? \"We want to continue to expand our footprint in the United States, both organically and through strategic acquisitions,\" Goei said. \"We believe that scale is key to driving better economics and providing more value to our customers. By increasing our size, we can also invest more in our network and improve the overall customer experience.\"\n\nGoei emphasized that Altice's focus is not just on growing its customer base, but also on improving the quality of its services. \"We want to be a leader in the industry, not just in terms of size, but also in terms of the quality of our network and the services we offer,\" he said.\n\nDespite the recent consolidation in the industry, Goei remains optimistic about the future. \"We believe that there is still room for growth and innovation in the market,\" he said. \"We are committed to investing in our network and our employees to ensure that we continue to deliver the best possible service to our customers.\"\n\nWhen asked about the regulatory environment, Goei acknowledged that it can be challenging, but he does not believe it will deter the company from its growth plans. \"We understand that there are regulations in place to protect consumers, and we are committed to complying with those regulations,\" he said. \"We believe that our business model is sustainable and that we can continue to grow and thrive while also providing value to our customers and the communities we serve.\"\n\nGoei also highlighted the importance of Altice's international presence in its growth strategy. \"We have a strong presence in Europe, the Caribbean, and Africa, and we believe that our international operations can provide opportunities for growth and learning,\" he said. \"We will continue to explore opportunities to expand our international presence and leverage our global expertise to drive growth in our US business.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Goei emphasized that Altice's goal is to become a leading cable and broadband provider in the United States, and that the company is committed to achieving that goal through a combination of strategic acquisitions, organic growth, and investment in its network and employees. With its strong financial backing and international presence, Altice is well-positioned to make a significant impact in the US market and to continue to drive innovation and growth in the industry.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- In 1980, Dave Patterson, a computer science professor, looked at the future of the world's digital machines and saw their limits. With an academic paper published that October, he argued that the silicon chips at the heart of these machines were growing more complex with each passing year. But the machines, he argued, could become more powerful if they used a simpler type of computer chip. This counterintuitive idea spread across Silicon Valley, driven by the work of Mr. Patterson at the University of California in Berkeley and a second academic, John Hennessy, about 40 miles away at Stanford University. The concept, known as the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture, was initially met with skepticism by many in the industry. However, Patterson and Hennessy's research sparked a series of experiments and simulations that demonstrated the potential benefits of their approach.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a small group of entrepreneurs and engineers began to take notice of the RISC idea. One of them was a young computer scientist named Steve Jobs, who was then working at Apple. Jobs saw the potential for RISC to revolutionize the industry and decided to take a chance on the technology.\n\nIn 1985, Apple acquired a small startup called Pyramid Technology, which was developing a RISC-based computer chip. Jobs saw this as an opportunity to integrate RISC into Apple's product line and create a new generation of faster and more efficient computers.\n\nThe result was the PowerPC chip, which was released in 1991 and quickly gained popularity among computer manufacturers. The PowerPC chip was not only faster and more powerful than its predecessors but also more energy-efficient, making it ideal for use in laptops and other portable devices.\n\nThe success of the PowerPC chip can be attributed to the pioneering work of Dave Patterson and John Hennessy. Their research on RISC architecture laid the foundation for the development of modern computer chips and paved the way for the creation of faster, more efficient, and more powerful computers.\n\nToday, the RISC architecture is used in a wide range of applications, from smartphones and tablets to supercomputers and data centers. The idea that simplicity can be more powerful than complexity has become a guiding principle in the development of computer technology.\n\nIn recognition of their contributions, Patterson and Hennessy were awarded the Turing Award in 2013, widely considered the \"Nobel Prize of Computing.\" The award honored their work on RISC architecture and its impact on the development of modern computer technology.\n\nAs the world continues to rely on computers and digital machines to drive innovation and progress, the legacy of Dave Patterson and John Hennessy serves as a reminder of the importance of innovation and the power of simplicity in shaping the future of technology.",

The 5G-capable Mate 30 will be revealed at a 19 September event in Munich, CNBC reported on Friday. But the launch by a company that saw its share of the European smartphone market soar by 55.7% in 2018 is approaching under a cloud of uncertainty, thanks to the actions of the US government. Here's what you need to know about the dispute between the US and Huawei. What is Huawei? Huawei is a Chinese telecommunications company, founded in 1987, whose early history included updating China's telephone infrastructure and helping the nation transition away from relying on importing foreign-made technology. It has since expanded internationally and launched its own product lines, including smartphones that are increasingly competitive with Samsung and Apple. The company's rapid growth and success have not gone unnoticed by the US government, which has accused Huawei of posing a national security risk due to its alleged ties to the Chinese government. In May, the US Commerce Department added Huawei to its Entity List, effectively banning US companies from doing business with the company. This move has significant implications for Huawei's ability to operate in the global market.\n\nThe ban has already had a significant impact on Huawei's business. In recent weeks, the company has announced that it will no longer be able to source components from US companies, including Google, which supplies the Android operating system and popular apps like Google Maps and Google Play. This means that the Mate 30 will not have access to these services, which could make it less appealing to consumers who rely on these apps.\n\nHuawei has responded to the ban by announcing that it will develop its own operating system, known as HarmonyOS, which will be used in its future devices. The company has also been working on developing its own apps, including a replacement for Google Maps.\n\nDespite these efforts, the launch of the Mate 30 is still a significant challenge for Huawei. The company's ability to compete in the global smartphone market without access to Google's services and apps is uncertain. The Mate 30 will still be a 5G-capable device, but its lack of access to Google's ecosystem could make it less appealing to consumers.\n\nThe dispute between the US and Huawei has also had significant implications for the global technology industry. Many US companies, including chipmakers and software developers, have been forced to re-evaluate their relationships with Huawei. The ban has also raised concerns about the potential for a broader trade war between the US and China.\n\nIn a statement, Huawei said that it is committed to providing its customers with the best possible experience, despite the challenges posed by the ban. \"We will continue to innovate and provide our customers with the best possible products and services, even in the face of adversity,\" the company said.\n\nThe launch of the Mate 30 is set to take place on September 19 in Munich, and it will be closely watched by the technology industry and consumers around the world. The event will mark a significant milestone for Huawei, as it attempts to navigate the challenges posed by the US ban and continue to compete in the global smartphone market.",

A hundred years ago, the peculiar behavior of these insects charmed Mark Twain, who wrote in his travel memoir, \"Roughing It,\" that you could hold the flies underwater and they'd pop back up, alive and \"dry as a patent office report.\" For most insects, water is a death trap. \"Flies just do not crawl under water. It's just a stupid thing to do,\" said Michael Dickinson, who studies flies at the California Institute of Technology. In water, they inevitably become fish bait or can't escape or emerge too wet to function. But not the alkali flies. These peculiar creatures have evolved to thrive in the unique environment of Mono Lake, where the water is extremely alkaline and the air is filled with a high concentration of salt. According to Dickinson, the flies' ability to survive underwater is due to their unique physiology, which allows them to extract oxygen from the water using a specialized respiratory system.\n\nThe alkali flies' peculiar behavior was first documented by Mark Twain in the late 19th century, and since then, scientists have been fascinated by their ability to defy the conventional wisdom about insect behavior. \"It's like they're defying gravity,\" said Dickinson. \"Most insects would sink to the bottom of the lake and drown, but these flies can swim around and even fly away after being submerged for extended periods.\"\n\nDespite their remarkable abilities, the alkali flies are not as well-studied as some other insects. Dickinson and his team are currently conducting research to better understand the flies' behavior and physiology, and to determine how they have evolved to thrive in the unique environment of Mono Lake.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the alkali flies is their role in the ecosystem of Mono Lake. The flies are an important food source for many of the lake's inhabitants, including fish and birds. They are also a key component of the lake's nutrient cycle, helping to break down organic matter and recycle nutrients.\n\nFor visitors to Mono Lake, the alkali flies offer a unique and fascinating glimpse into the natural world. Scuba diving in the lake is a popular activity, and many divers make it a point to look for the flies as they swim through the water. \"It's like having your own personal aquarium,\" said one diver. \"You can see these tiny creatures swimming around you, and it's just amazing.\"\n\nOverall, the alkali flies of Mono Lake are a remarkable and fascinating aspect of the natural world, and their unique behavior and physiology make them a popular attraction for visitors to the lake.",

But while the molluscs and their slimy secretions are the bane of the green-fingered, it seems they have triggered a moment of inspiration in the laboratory. Researchers say they have developed tough, flexible glues designed to help patch up wounds, drawing on lessons learned from the creatures' sticky goo. Researchers at a leading biotechnology institute have made a breakthrough in the development of advanced wound care products, inspired by the unique properties of slug mucus. The team, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a renowned expert in biomaterials, has created a new class of glues that are both strong and flexible, capable of withstanding the rigors of the human body.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rodriguez, the researchers were drawn to the remarkable properties of slug mucus, which is capable of bonding with a wide range of surfaces, from skin to fabric, while also being highly flexible and resistant to degradation. \"We were fascinated by the way slug mucus can adapt to different environments and surfaces, and we saw an opportunity to apply those principles to the development of wound care products,\" she explained.\n\nThe new glues, which have been dubbed \"SlugGel,\" are designed to be used in a variety of medical applications, including wound closure, tissue engineering, and implantable devices. In initial testing, the glues have shown impressive results, with the ability to bond with skin and other tissues quickly and securely, while also allowing for flexibility and movement.\n\nOne of the key advantages of SlugGel is its ability to mimic the natural healing process, allowing wounds to breathe and heal from the inside out. \"Traditional wound care products can be rigid and restrictive, which can actually hinder the healing process,\" said Dr. Rodriguez. \"SlugGel, on the other hand, is designed to work with the body, allowing it to heal naturally and efficiently.\"\n\nThe researchers are optimistic about the potential of SlugGel to revolutionize wound care, and are already working with medical professionals to test the product in clinical trials. If successful, the new glues could be used to treat a wide range of wounds, from minor cuts and scrapes to more serious injuries and surgical incisions.\n\nWhile the idea of using slug mucus to develop medical products may seem unusual, Dr. Rodriguez believes that it is a prime example of the power of biomimicry, where nature is used as a model for innovation. \"By studying the remarkable properties of slug mucus, we have been able to develop a new class of materials that have the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs,\" she said.\n\nAs the researchers continue to refine and test SlugGel, they are excited about the potential to make a real difference in people's lives. And who knows, maybe one day the very mention of \"slug mucus\" will no longer be met with a curl of the lip, but rather with a sense of admiration for the incredible power of nature to inspire innovation.",

The tycoon's assurance to the 20,000 pensioners was left unchallenged, despite the committee's repeated attempts to get him to provide more detail.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems clear that the committee should have pushed harder to get a clearer answer. Instead, they accepted Green's vague promise at face value, and moved on to other aspects of his testimony. The result was a report that, while comprehensive and damning in its critique of Green's business practices, ultimately lacked the teeth it could have had if the committee had been more robust in its questioning.\n\nThe consequences of this failure are now becoming clear.

The farm's wheat crop is sold to a neighboring mill, providing a steady income stream.\n\n\"We're not just a farm, we're a small business,\" Bignon said in an interview. \"We're trying to be as self-sufficient as possible, so we can weather any economic storms.\"\n\nThe farm's commitment to sustainability is also evident in its use of renewable energy. The farm is powered by a combination of solar and wind energy, reducing its reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing its carbon footprint.\n\nBignon's farm is just one example of the growing trend towards sustainable agriculture in France. As consumers become increasingly aware of the environmental and social impact of their food choices, demand for organic and locally sourced products is on the rise.\n\nAccording to a recent report by the French Ministry of Agriculture, the country's organic farm sector has grown by 15% in the past year, with the number of organic farms increasing by 20%. The report also found that organic products now account for 4% of total food sales in France, up from just 2% in 2010.\n\nAs the demand for organic and locally sourced products continues to grow, Bignon's farm is well-positioned to meet the demand. With its focus on sustainability, diversification, and self-sufficiency, the farm is a model for the future of agriculture in France.\n\nIn addition to its commitment to sustainability, the farm is also dedicated to animal welfare. The farm's chickens are free-range, meaning they have access to the outdoors and are able to roam freely. This approach not only benefits the chickens, but also provides a higher-quality egg.\n\nBignon's farm is a testament to the fact that sustainable agriculture and economic viability are not mutually exclusive. By focusing on producing high-quality, organic products and reducing its environmental impact, the farm is able to thrive in a challenging economic environment.\n\nAs the demand for organic and locally sourced products continues to grow, Bignon's farm is well-positioned to meet the demand. With its focus on sustainability, diversification, and self-sufficiency, the farm is a model for the future of agriculture in France.",

        "Text": "Almost half of people planning to use an adblocker say a general dislike of ads is one of the main reasons for doing so, according to a new report that highlights the scale of the problems facing digital media. The report by KPMG, which is based on a survey of more than 2,000 people, found that 44% of UK adults said they were planning to use an adblocker within the next six months. Of those people, 46% said they would block ads because they \"do not like adverts at all\", only just behind the 47% of people who said that a key reason was that ads take up too much space on screen. The report also shed light on the demographics of those planning to use adblockers, with younger adults and those from lower-income households being more likely to adopt the technology. According to the survey, 54% of 18-24-year-olds said they planned to use an adblocker, compared to 35% of those aged 55 and over. Additionally, 51% of those earning less than Â£20,000 per year said they would use an adblocker, compared to 34% of those earning Â£50,000 or more.\n\nThe findings of the report have significant implications for the digital media industry, which relies heavily on advertising revenue. The widespread adoption of adblockers could lead to a significant decline in advertising revenue, making it increasingly difficult for digital media companies to operate profitably.\n\nIndustry experts are warning that the problem is not limited to individual users, but also extends to the wider ecosystem of digital media. \"The proliferation of adblockers is a major threat to the future of digital media,\" said John Smith, a leading expert in digital marketing. \"If left unchecked, it could lead to a decline in the quality and variety of online content, as well as a decrease in the ability of digital media companies to invest in new and innovative projects.\"\n\nIn response to the report, some digital media companies are already taking steps to adapt to the changing landscape. For example, some are experimenting with new forms of advertising, such as native advertising and sponsored content, which are designed to be more engaging and less intrusive than traditional display ads. Others are investing in content marketing, which involves creating high-quality, relevant content that attracts and engages users, rather than relying solely on advertising.\n\nHowever, others are more skeptical about the ability of digital media companies to adapt to the changing landscape. \"The problem with adblockers is that they are a symptom of a larger issue, which is the decline of traditional advertising models,\" said Jane Doe, a leading expert in digital media. \"Unless digital media companies can find new and innovative ways to monetize their content, they will continue to struggle to make a profit in the face of adblockers.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the rise of adblockers is a major challenge for the digital media industry, and one that will require innovative solutions and a willingness to adapt to changing consumer behavior.",

        "Text": "Italy managed to sell five-year bonds in an auction on Thursday, but yields were at their highest level in three years, a sign that some investors remained nervous about the risk of the sovereign debt crisis spreading from Europe's vulnerable periphery to its core economies. The sale came just before an informal meeting in Rome by officials from the European Central Bank, the European Commission and private lenders to discuss a second Greek rescue plan that leaders hope to announce next week. Investor worries about the deadlock among European leaders over a solution for the Greek debt crisis have pushed up borrowing costs in recent days for the much bigger European economies of Italy and Spain. Earlier doubts about whether the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and his finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, would agree on new austerity measures compounded the uncertainty. The Italian government's efforts to reassure investors were further complicated by the ongoing debate over the country's budget and the need for further austerity measures. Berlusconi's government has faced criticism from the European Commission and other EU members for its slow progress in implementing reforms and reducing its budget deficit.\n\nDespite the challenges, the Italian Treasury managed to sell â‚¬8.5 billion worth of five-year bonds, which was slightly above the â‚¬8 billion target. However, the yield on the bonds, which measures the return an investor can expect, rose to 4.85%, the highest level since 2009. This indicates that investors are demanding a higher return to compensate for the increased risk of lending to Italy.\n\nThe yield on Italy's 10-year bonds also rose to 6.15%, a level not seen since 2010. This increase in borrowing costs could make it more expensive for Italy to finance its debt, which currently stands at around 120% of its GDP.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the Greek debt crisis and the potential impact on Italy's economy has also led to a rise in borrowing costs for Spain. The yield on Spain's 10-year bonds rose to 5.45%, its highest level since 2011.\n\nThe informal meeting in Rome aimed to discuss a potential second Greek bailout package, which could include a combination of loans and debt relief measures. The meeting was attended by officials from the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and private lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe Greek government has been struggling to implement the austerity measures required by its first bailout package, which has led to widespread protests and unrest. The country's debt crisis has also had a significant impact on the global economy, causing concerns about a potential contagion effect on other European economies.\n\nThe situation is likely to remain volatile in the coming days, with investors closely watching developments in Greece and Italy. The European Central Bank has also indicated that it is prepared to take action to stabilize the financial markets if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, the Italian government has announced plans to implement new austerity measures, including a rise in value-added tax and cuts to public spending. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen, and the country's debt crisis is likely to remain a major concern for investors in the coming months.",

        "Text": "Nearly half of all tenants who make a formal complaint about their housing suffer a \"revenge eviction\" by private landlords, according to research by Citizens Advice. It estimated that 141,000 tenants have been subject to \"complain and you're out\" evictions since 2015. The evictions are possible because section 21 notices under the 1988 Housing Act allow landlords to force out tenants on a no-fault basis. Citizens Advice found that tenants who had received a section 21 notice were twice as likely to have complained to their landlord â€“ and eight times more likely to have complained to an official redress scheme. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"The chance of a family being evicted from their home for complaining about a problem shouldn't carry the same odds as the toss of a coin. \"There are serious question marks over the existence of a power that allows landlords to unilaterally evict tenants without reason.\" The research, which analyzed data from 2015 to 2020, also found that tenants who had complained about issues such as disrepair, noise, and rent arrears were more likely to receive a section 21 notice. This has raised concerns that landlords are using the notices as a way to silence tenants who dare to speak out about their living conditions.\n\nCitizens Advice is calling for the government to reform the section 21 notice system, which they argue is being abused by some landlords. The charity is urging ministers to introduce new safeguards to prevent \"revenge evictions\" and ensure that tenants are protected from unfair treatment.\n\nThe issue of section 21 notices has been a contentious one in recent years, with many campaigners arguing that they allow landlords to evict tenants without good reason. In 2019, the government announced plans to scrap section 21 notices, but the proposal has yet to be implemented.\n\nIn the meantime, tenants who are facing the threat of eviction are being left in a state of uncertainty and anxiety. Many are being forced to move out of their homes, often at short notice, and are struggling to find new accommodation.\n\nOne tenant, who wished to remain anonymous, told Citizens Advice that she had been forced to leave her home after complaining to her landlord about disrepair. \"I was shocked and upset when I received the section 21 notice,\" she said. \"I had been living in the property for over five years and had always paid my rent on time. I felt like I was being punished for speaking out about the problems in my home.\"\n\nThe government has been criticized for its handling of the issue, with many arguing that it has failed to provide adequate protection for tenants. In response to the Citizens Advice research, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said that the government was committed to protecting tenants and would continue to work with stakeholders to address the issue.\n\nHowever, critics argue that more needs to be done to prevent \"revenge evictions\" and ensure that tenants are treated fairly. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said that the government needed to take action to reform the section 21 notice system and prevent landlords from using it as a way to silence tenants.\n\n\"The government must take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that tenants are protected from unfair treatment,\" she said. \"We cannot continue to allow landlords to use section 21 notices as a way to evict tenants without reason. It is time for the government to take responsibility and introduce new safeguards to prevent'revenge evictions'.\"",

But the important question -- how retailers' profit margins were affected by their Thanksgiving weekend promotions -- remained unanswered. And several retailers said that they would discount even more in December. The figures released Thursday showed just the sales performance of stores open at least a year, \"so what we aren't seeing is the impact on those retailers' bottom lines, and we all saw how promotional last weekend was,\" said Megan Donadio, a retail strategist at the consulting firm Kurt Salmon. Adding to concerns, she said, even those deep discounts \"were not able to sustain the crowds through the entire weekend -- even from Friday morning, through the end of the day Friday, the number of people making purchases in the stores declined.\" Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.1 percent in November, according to a Thomson Reuters tally. The results included sales through Saturday, so the Sunday after Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday results were not included. But several stores that relied heavily on Black Friday momentum, including Target, Kohl's and J. C. Penney, did worse than analysts had expected. Despite the overall positive sales performance, many retailers are now facing concerns about the impact of deep discounts on their profit margins. With the majority of retailers reporting significant sales increases, it is unclear how much of the revenue was actually profit.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of retailers sacrificing profit margins for the sake of driving traffic and sales,\" said Donadio. \"While it's great to see sales numbers up, it's not sustainable if it's not translating to the bottom line.\"\n\nSome retailers, such as Best Buy and Costco, reported stronger-than-expected sales, while others, like Macy's and Nordstrom, reported more modest gains. However, even the strongest performers are expected to face challenges in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We're expecting a more promotional environment in December, which could put further pressure on profit margins,\" said Donadio. \"Retailers will need to be careful about how they balance their pricing strategies to ensure they're not sacrificing too much profit for the sake of driving sales.\"\n\nThe National Retail Federation, which represents the retail industry, is forecasting a 3.6% increase in holiday sales this year, with total sales expected to reach $730 billion. While this is a strong outlook, many retailers are still grappling with the challenges of a highly competitive market and the impact of e-commerce on traditional brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nIn an effort to stay competitive, many retailers are investing in digital marketing and e-commerce platforms to better reach customers and drive sales. However, this shift is also putting pressure on profit margins, as retailers invest in these new technologies and platforms.\n\nFor retailers, the key to success will be finding a balance between driving sales and maintaining profit margins. With the holiday season just getting underway, it remains to be seen how retailers will navigate this challenging landscape and emerge stronger in the new year.",

        "Text": "The FX show \"The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\" has explored issues of race, celebrity and the 24-hour news cycle. On Tuesday night, in the sixth episode, \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia,\" the series examines gender discrimination, and the withering scrutiny that the prosecutor Marcia Clark faced during the trial. Earlier this year, I spoke to Sarah Paulson about her surprisingly sympathetic performance of Ms. Clark, and about Tuesday night's episode specifically. Sarah Paulson's portrayal of Marcia Clark in \"The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\" has been widely praised for its nuance and empathy. In our previous conversation, she spoke about the challenges of bringing Clark's story to life, and the ways in which the show's writers worked to humanize a figure who was often reduced to a caricature in the media.\n\nTuesday night's episode, \"Marcia, Marcia, Marcia,\" delves deeper into the gender discrimination and sexism that Clark faced during the trial. The episode shows how the media and the public scrutinized her every move, from her appearance to her courtroom mannerisms. Paulson's performance is particularly effective in capturing the frustration and anger that Clark felt as she struggled to be taken seriously in a male-dominated profession.\n\n\"I think it's really important to show how women, particularly in positions of power, are treated differently than men,\" Paulson said. \"Marcia Clark was a brilliant prosecutor, but she was also a woman, and that made her a target. The show tries to capture the ways in which she was belittled and dismissed, and how that affected her.\"\n\nThe episode also explores the ways in which the media's portrayal of Clark contributed to her public image. The show features clips from news programs and talk shows, which frequently reduced Clark to her appearance or her relationship with her client, O.J. Simpson. Paulson said that she was struck by the ways in which the media's focus on Clark's personal life overshadowed her professional accomplishments.\n\n\"It's a really important reminder of how the media can shape our perceptions of people,\" Paulson said. \"Marcia Clark was a brilliant prosecutor, but she was also a woman, and that made her a target. The show tries to capture the ways in which she was belittled and dismissed, and how that affected her.\"\n\nThroughout the episode, Paulson's performance is both powerful and poignant. She captures the complexity and nuance of Clark's personality, and brings a depth and humanity to a character who was often reduced to a stereotype. The episode is a powerful reminder of the ways in which gender discrimination and sexism can affect women in positions of power, and it's a testament to the show's ability to explore complex issues in a thoughtful and nuanced way.\n\n\"The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\" has been praised for its thoughtful and nuanced portrayal of the O.J. Simpson trial, and Tuesday night's episode is no exception. With its powerful performances and thought-provoking themes, the show is a must-watch for anyone interested in the intersection of law, celebrity, and society.",

It is a significant voice in national politics and, with its extensive use of graphics and its comfort with editorializing, a major influence on its competitors. The network's pugnacious style and its position as a platform for conservative politics and ideas have made it a hit with an audience that felt ill-served by other news outlets. However, the network's dominance has not gone unchallenged. In recent years, MSNBC and CNN have made significant gains in ratings, particularly among younger viewers. This shift has led to a renewed focus on attracting a more diverse audience and producing content that resonates with a broader range of perspectives.\n\nOne of the key strategies employed by Fox News to maintain its market share has been its aggressive use of social media.

In an effort to toughen up the watchdog, which has been criticised for being soft on energy firms, regulatory economist Martin Cave has been selected as the regulator's new chair just months before it is due to impose a price cap on energy bills. A Whitehall source said: \"This appointment would send a clear signal to retail energy bosses that the government wants a strong regulator to design and bring in the cap ahead of the winter and protect millions of households from unfair price rises.\" The decision to appoint Cave, who is the preferred candidate of the business secretary, Greg Clark, makes clear there will be no rowing back on plans for a cap. Cave, who specialises in competition law, was deputy chair at the UK Competition Commission and deputy panel chair of the Competition and Markets Authority from 2012 to January this year. He was the competition watchdog's lone voice arguing for a price cap, nearly a year before the Conservatives adopted the policy as a flagship election pledge. Cave's appointment comes as the UK government faces mounting pressure to tackle rising energy costs, which have left millions of households struggling to pay their bills. The price cap, which is expected to be introduced in the coming months, aims to limit the amount energy suppliers can charge customers for their electricity and gas.\n\nAs the new chair of Ofgem, Cave will be responsible for designing and implementing the price cap, which is expected to have a significant impact on the energy market. He will also be tasked with ensuring that energy suppliers comply with the new regulations and do not engage in unfair practices.\n\nCave's appointment has been welcomed by consumer groups, who have long called for greater regulation of the energy industry. \"This is a major victory for consumers,\" said a spokesperson for Consumer Focus, a leading consumer advocacy group. \"Martin Cave has a reputation for being a strong advocate for consumers and we are confident that he will use his expertise to design a price cap that truly benefits households.\"\n\nHowever, the appointment has also been met with criticism from some industry insiders, who argue that Cave's background in competition law makes him too focused on punishing energy suppliers rather than promoting competition. \"This appointment sends a clear signal that the government is more interested in punishing energy suppliers than in promoting competition and innovation,\" said a spokesperson for the Energy Industry Association, a trade body that represents energy suppliers.\n\nDespite these concerns, Cave's appointment is seen as a major step forward in the government's efforts to reform the energy market. The price cap is expected to be a key part of this reform, and Cave's expertise in competition law will be crucial in ensuring that it is implemented effectively.\n\nIn a statement, the business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed Cave's appointment, saying that it marked an important step forward in the government's efforts to protect consumers. \"Martin Cave has a deep understanding of the energy market and a strong track record of promoting competition and protecting consumers,\" he said. \"I am confident that he will use his expertise to design a price cap that truly benefits households and promotes a fair and competitive energy market.\"\n\nThe appointment of Cave as the new chair of Ofgem is seen as a major development in the UK's energy market, and is likely to have significant implications for energy suppliers and consumers alike. As the country prepares for the introduction of the price cap, Cave's expertise and experience will be crucial in ensuring that it is implemented effectively and benefits households across the UK.",

It's no surprise then that space agencies and companies are champing at the bit to get people out into the far reaches of space to start loading up cargo ships up with killer xenomorphs with their facehuggers and chestbursters*. This week has seen two separate announcements proposing lunar space stations: one from Nasa/Roscosmos, who propose to put a crewed spaceport in lunar orbit, and one from Elon Musk, who says a new SpaceX craft will make it possible to build a base on the moon. In both cases, the lunar bases are intended as springboards for Mars missions and other deep-space travel. Back in Earth's labs, however, there are exciting hints at what the future may hold for gene editing, as a Chinese team managed to use \"chemical surgery\", also known as \"base editing\" for the first time to mend harmful mutations in human embryos. It's a technique similar to Crispr, but can change a single letter in a faulty gene. The breakthroughs in gene editing technology have sent shockwaves through the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a major step forward in the field. The technique, known as \"base editing,\" allows for precise and permanent changes to be made to the DNA sequence of an organism without cutting or altering the surrounding genetic material.\n\nThe Chinese team, led by Dr. Wei Li, used base editing to correct a faulty gene responsible for a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the nervous system. The technique was successful in reversing the mutation, and the corrected embryos were found to be healthy and normal.\n\n\"This is a major milestone in the field of gene editing,\" said Dr. Li. \"Our technique has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach genetic disorders and could potentially be used to treat a wide range of diseases.\"\n\nThe use of base editing in human embryos raises important ethical questions, however. While the technique has the potential to be a game-changer in the field of medicine, it also raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences and the possibility of creating \"designer babies.\"\n\n\"This is a highly complex and controversial area of research,\" said Dr. David King, director of Human Genetics at the Genetics and Public Policy Center. \"While the potential benefits of base editing are significant, we need to be careful to ensure that it is used responsibly and that we are not creating a new generation of genetically modified humans.\"\n\nDespite the ethical concerns, the breakthrough in base editing technology is likely to have a significant impact on the field of medicine. The ability to precisely and permanently change the DNA sequence of an organism has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach genetic disorders and could potentially be used to treat a wide range of diseases.\n\nIn related news, the European Union has announced plans to invest â‚¬1 billion in a new gene editing research program. The program, which will be led by the European Research Council, will focus on developing new gene editing technologies and exploring their potential applications in medicine and agriculture.\n\nThe investment is seen as a major boost for the field of gene editing, which has been plagued by controversy and uncertainty in recent years. The EU's investment is expected to help drive innovation and progress in the field, and could potentially lead to the development of new treatments and therapies for a wide range of diseases.\n\nIn other news, the search for extraterrestrial life continues to heat up, with NASA announcing plans to launch a new mission to search for signs of life on Mars. The mission, which is expected to launch in 2022, will use a combination of robotic and human exploration to search for signs of life on the Red Planet.\n\nThe mission, which is being led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will include a range of instruments and experiments designed to search for signs of life, including a rover that will be capable of collecting and analyzing samples from the Martian surface.\n\n\"This is a major step forward in the search for extraterrestrial life,\" said Dr. Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. \"We are excited to be taking this next step in our exploration of Mars and are hopeful that we will make a major discovery.\"\n\nThe mission is expected to be a major milestone in the search for extraterrestrial life, and could potentially lead to a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe.",

        "Text": "British government officials will meet with representatives of American technology companies this week to demand that they do more to help in the fight against terrorism and online hate speech, the latest move in a widening global push against encryption technology that blocks access to the private messages of criminal and innocent users alike. The meeting, set for Thursday, comes after Amber Rudd, Britain's home secretary, said that the country's intelligence agencies should have access to encrypted messages sent through WhatsApp, an instant-messaging service owned by Facebook. Her remarks are in response to the terrorist attack on Wednesday in London, when Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, drove a car into pedestrians, killing three of them, and then fatally stabbed a police officer. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but its precise connection to Mr. Masood is not clear. The London police said on Monday that they were focusing on Mr. Masood's communications and repeated a plea to anyone who knew him to come forward with tips. The British government's demands come as part of a growing global debate over the role of technology companies in preventing and investigating terrorist activities. The issue has been particularly contentious in the wake of recent attacks in Europe and the United States, which have been linked to online extremist propaganda and encrypted communications.\n\nThe meeting with American technology companies, which will include representatives from Facebook, Google, and Apple, is expected to focus on the development of new technologies that can help law enforcement agencies access encrypted messages without compromising the security of users' data. The British government has been pushing for greater cooperation from technology companies, arguing that their encryption methods are making it increasingly difficult for authorities to track and prevent terrorist plots.\n\nHowever, technology companies have been resistant to these demands, citing concerns about the potential for governments to misuse their technology to monitor and suppress political dissent. They argue that encryption is a critical tool for protecting the privacy and security of their users, and that any compromise on encryption would undermine the trust and confidence of their customers.\n\nThe debate has also sparked concerns about the potential for governments to use encryption as a means of surveillance and control. Critics argue that the British government's demands are part of a broader trend towards increased state surveillance and control, and that the erosion of encryption could have far-reaching consequences for individual privacy and freedom of expression.\n\nDespite these concerns, the British government is pressing ahead with its demands, citing the need to balance individual privacy with the need to protect national security. The meeting with American technology companies is seen as a key step in this process, and is expected to be closely watched by governments and technology companies around the world.\n\nIn the meantime, the London police continue to investigate the London attack, and are urging anyone with information about Khalid Masood's communications to come forward. The attack has sent shockwaves through the city, and has raised concerns about the potential for further attacks in the coming weeks and months.\n\nAs the debate over encryption and terrorism continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the British government's demands will be met, and what the implications will be for individual privacy and freedom of expression. One thing is certain, however: the issue is likely to be a major topic of discussion in the months and years to come.",

The president's nominee for defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, looked on quietly, awaiting his turn to take the stage.\n\nObama's comments were a nod to the progress made by his administration's economic policies, which have been criticized by some as being too slow to stimulate growth. However, the president's team pointed to the data as evidence that their strategy is working.\n\n\"We're seeing a sustained period of job growth, and that's a testament to the resilience of the American economy,\" said Jason Furman, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. \"We're not out of the woods yet, but we're making progress, and that's something to be proud of.\"\n\nThe president's remarks also came as a reminder that the economy is not yet out of the woods. The Federal Reserve has been keeping interest rates low to stimulate growth, and many economists believe that the recovery is still fragile.\n\nDespite the progress made, there are still concerns about the pace of growth and the impact of sequestration, the automatic budget cuts that are set to take effect in January. The cuts could have a significant impact on the economy, particularly in the defense sector.\n\nThe president's nomination of Hagel to lead the Defense Department is seen as a key part of his strategy to address the impact of sequestration. Hagel, a former senator from Nebraska, has been a vocal critic of the cuts and has promised to work with Congress to find a solution.\n\nThe nomination is also seen as a sign of the president's commitment to his economic agenda. Hagel has been a strong supporter of the president's plan to increase infrastructure spending and has advocated for a more balanced approach to budgeting.\n\nAs the president and his team look to the future, they are aware that the road ahead will not be easy. However, they are heartened by the progress made so far and are confident that their strategy will continue to yield positive results.\n\n\"We're not going to rest on our laurels,\" said Furman. \"We're going to keep working hard to build on this progress and create an economy that works for everyone.\"",

Unless the appeal is successful, the merger will formally take place on 7 December. Nine has said it intends to continue publishing the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review as well as the websites, but it is likely that regional publications and the New Zealand assets will be sold off or closed. The approval from the court marks a significant milestone in the merger process, which was first announced in June. The combined entity, to be known as Nine Entertainment Co Holdings, will be one of the largest media companies in Australia, with a significant presence in print, digital, and television.\n\nThe merger is expected to generate significant cost savings and efficiencies, which will be used to invest in digital transformation and new content initiatives. Nine has promised to maintain the editorial independence of its newspapers, including the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, and the Australian Financial Review, and to continue publishing them as separate entities.\n\nHowever, the fate of regional publications and New Zealand assets remains uncertain. Nine has indicated that it is likely to sell or close these operations, citing the need to focus on its core businesses. This has raised concerns among employees and local communities, who are worried about the impact on jobs and the loss of local news coverage.\n\nAntony Catalano, the former CEO of Domain, had launched a last-minute bid to block the merger, citing concerns about the potential impact on competition and the media landscape. While his appeal has been rejected, he has indicated that he may still pursue an appeal to the full federal court.\n\nThe merger is expected to be completed on December 7, pending the outcome of any further appeals. In the meantime, Nine is working to integrate its operations and prepare for the new entity.\n\nIndustry observers are watching the situation closely, as the merger is seen as a significant development in the Australian media landscape. The combined entity will have a significant presence in the market, and its impact on the industry will be closely monitored.\n\nThe Australian government has also been following the developments closely, with Communications Minister Paul Fletcher saying that the merger is subject to certain conditions, including the maintenance of editorial independence and the protection of regional news coverage.\n\nAs the merger moves closer to completion, the fate of regional publications and New Zealand assets remains uncertain. The outcome will have significant implications for the media industry, and will be closely watched by employees, investors, and the wider community.",

        "Text": "Verizon and AT&T face accusations that they colluded with a group that sets mobile industry standards to try to restrict a new technology, currently in relatively few devices, that allows consumers to easily switch carriers. WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into potential coordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, according to six people with knowledge of the inquiry. In February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology. The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said. The investigation is focused on whether AT&T and Verizon, the two largest wireless carriers in the United States, worked with the G.S.M.A. to restrict the adoption of eSIM technology, which is currently available in a limited number of devices, including some Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxy smartphones.\n\nThe G.S.M.A., which stands for Global System for Mobile Communications Association, is a non-profit organization that sets standards for the mobile industry. The group is responsible for developing and maintaining the technical specifications for mobile devices, networks, and services.\n\nAccording to the sources, the Justice Department is investigating whether AT&T and Verizon used their influence with the G.S.M.A. to shape the standards for eSIM technology in a way that would make it difficult for consumers to switch carriers easily. The technology allows users to remotely switch their wireless provider without having to physically insert a new SIM card into their device.\n\nThe investigation is also looking into whether the two carriers and the G.S.M.A. coordinated to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology. This would effectively prevent consumers from easily switching to a different carrier, even if they wanted to.\n\nThe Justice Department's investigation is still in its early stages, and it is unclear what specific evidence the agency has gathered so far. However, the fact that the agency has issued demands for information to AT&T, Verizon, and the G.S.M.A. suggests that it is taking the allegations seriously.\n\nThe investigation has sparked concerns among consumer advocates and industry experts, who argue that restricting the adoption of eSIM technology would harm consumers and stifle innovation in the mobile industry.\n\n\"This is a classic case of big carriers trying to protect their market share by restricting consumer choice,\" said a consumer advocacy group in a statement. \"The Justice Department should take a close look at these allegations and ensure that consumers are not being unfairly restricted from using eSIM technology.\"\n\nThe G.S.M.A. has declined to comment on the investigation, while AT&T and Verizon have denied any wrongdoing. The two carriers have said that they are committed to providing their customers with the best possible service and that they have no intention of restricting the adoption of eSIM technology.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation is likely to have significant implications for the mobile industry, as it could determine the future of eSIM technology and the level of competition in the wireless market.",

On Wednesday, BuzzFeed News reported that Ms. Reid's old blog had promoted a Sept. 11 conspiracy by suggesting that readers watch \"Loose Change,\" which posits that the attack was planned by the United States government. And on Thursday, BuzzFeed News surfaced a post that contained an image of Senator John McCain's head Photoshopped onto the body of Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people in the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech. Meghan McCain, the senator's daughter, wrote on Twitter that the post was \"beyond disgusting and disgraceful.\" Ms. Reid, 49, did not blame or mention hackers this time. In a statement on Friday, Ms. Reid, the \"AM Joy\" host, said that she had reached out to Ms. McCain, a former on-air colleague, and that she had the \"highest respect for Senator McCain.\" She said that she had evolved and that \"I'm a better person today than I was over a decade ago.\" \"There are things I deeply regret and am embarrassed by, things I would have said differently and issues where my position has changed,\" Ms. Reid said. \"Today I'm sincerely apologizing again.\" Reid's apology comes after a series of revelations about her decade-old blog, which have sparked widespread criticism and outrage. The latest discoveries, which include the 9/11 conspiracy theory and the disturbing image of Senator John McCain, have led many to question her judgment and character.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Reid's blog began earlier this year when she claimed that hackers were responsible for posting homophobic and offensive content on her site. However, as more posts emerged, it became clear that Reid was indeed the author of many of the offensive materials.\n\nReid's apology on Friday was met with skepticism by many, who felt that she had not gone far enough in acknowledging her mistakes. Meghan McCain, the daughter of Senator John McCain, was particularly critical of Reid's statement, saying that the apology was \"too little, too late.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Reid's blog has also raised questions about the level of scrutiny that public figures should be held to. While Reid has apologized for her mistakes, many are calling for her to take responsibility for her actions and to use her platform to promote greater understanding and tolerance.\n\nIn the meantime, Reid's show \"AM Joy\" has been facing criticism for its perceived liberal bias and lack of diversity. The show has been accused of marginalizing conservative voices and promoting a narrow, partisan agenda.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding Reid's blog continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how it will impact her career and her reputation. One thing is clear, however: the incident has sparked a much-needed conversation about the importance of accountability and the need for public figures to take responsibility for their actions.",

        "Text": "The government is under pressure to set up an independent ombudsman with the power to order housebuilders to pay out up to Â£50,000 or even reverse a sale, following reports of new-home buyers lumbered with defective properties. A group of MPs and peers has called on the government to make it mandatory for housebuilders to belong to the proposed scheme, which would be free for consumers and offer a quick resolution to disputes. The scheme would be funded by a levy on housebuilders, with larger ones such as Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt, Galliford Try, Redrow and Bovis Homes, paying more than small and medium-sized firms. A report, Better Redress for Home Buyers, by the all-party parliamentary group for excellence in the built environment, highlights the confusing landscape buyers face when trying to resolve building defects, not helped by a plethora of warranties, housebuilding codes and complaints procedures. It says the proposed ombudsman should be able to order payouts of up to Â£50,000 so buyers are not left out of pocket. The report also recommends that the ombudsman should have the power to reverse a sale if a buyer is unable to occupy their new home due to defects, and that it should be able to order housebuilders to carry out necessary repairs or rectify defects.\n\nThe all-party parliamentary group, which is made up of MPs and peers from across the political spectrum, is urging the government to make the scheme mandatory for all housebuilders, with the exception of those who are already members of the National House-Building Council (NHBC) or the Federation of Master Builders (FMB).\n\nThe group's chair, Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, said: \"The current system is a mess, and it's leaving many new-home buyers feeling frustrated and powerless. The proposed ombudsman scheme would provide a much-needed safety net for consumers, and would help to restore trust in the housebuilding industry.\"\n\nThe report highlights several examples of buyers who have been left with defective properties, including one family who were forced to live in a property with a collapsed roof for several months before it was finally repaired.\n\nThe family, who are still living in the property, said: \"We were left with a property that was completely uninhabitable. We were told that the defects would be fixed within a few weeks, but it took months. We were left feeling helpless and frustrated, and it was a huge stress on our family.\"\n\nThe report also cites a case where a buyer was forced to pay thousands of pounds to repair defects in their property, despite the housebuilder having promised to fix the issues.\n\nThe government has yet to respond to the report's recommendations, but the all-party parliamentary group is urging it to take action to protect new-home buyers.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"We are committed to ensuring that new-home buyers have the protection they need. We will carefully consider the report's recommendations and will work with the industry to improve the redress system for consumers.\"\n\nThe proposed ombudsman scheme is seen as a key step towards improving the redress system for new-home buyers, and would provide a much-needed boost to consumer confidence in the housebuilding industry.",

The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said only a universal service obligation (USO) would offer certainty that broadband speeds of at least 10Mbps would reach the whole of the UK by 2020. Broadband providers will now have a legal requirement to provide high-speed broadband to anyone who requests it, no matter where they are in the country. The announcement marks a significant shift in the UK's approach to broadband provision, with the government seeking to ensure that every household and business has access to high-speed internet by the end of the decade.\n\nUnder the new USO, broadband providers will be required to offer speeds of at least 10Mbps to all customers, regardless of their location. This will be a significant improvement for many rural areas, where slow and unreliable broadband connections have been a major obstacle to economic development and social inclusion.\n\nThe government has been under pressure to take action on broadband provision, with many rural communities and small businesses complaining about the lack of reliable and fast internet access. The USO is seen as a key step towards addressing this issue, and will help to ensure that the UK's digital infrastructure is fit for the future.\n\nThe move has been welcomed by many in the industry, with consumer groups and rural advocacy organizations hailing the announcement as a major victory. \"This is a huge step forward for the UK's digital future,\" said Tom Brake, a spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats. \"For too long, rural communities have been left behind when it comes to broadband provision. Today's announcement will help to bring them into the 21st century and unlock their full potential.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is pleased with the announcement. BT, one of the UK's largest broadband providers, had argued that a voluntary approach would be more effective and cost-efficient. \"We are disappointed that the government has chosen to impose a USO on the industry,\" said a spokesperson for BT. \"We believe that a voluntary approach would have been a more effective way to achieve the government's goals, and would have been better for consumers and taxpayers alike.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the government is confident that the USO will be a success. \"We are committed to ensuring that every household and business in the UK has access to high-speed broadband,\" said a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. \"The USO is the best way to achieve this goal, and we are confident that it will make a real difference to people's lives.\"\n\nThe USO will come into effect in 2020, with broadband providers required to begin offering high-speed internet to customers by that date. The government has also announced plans to provide additional funding to help support the rollout of the USO, and to ensure that it is delivered successfully.\n\nOverall, the announcement is seen as a major step forward for the UK's digital infrastructure, and will help to ensure that the country is well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities and challenges of the digital age.",

The BBC Breakfast Show presenter was found to have breached guidelines after saying she felt \"absolutely furious\" about the US president's language, after he told four Democratic congresswomen to \"go home\" despite them all being US citizens. \"I can imagine lots of people in this country will be feeling absolutely furious that a man in that position feels it's OK to skirt the lines with using language like that,\" Munchetty said at the time. David Jordan said that under the corporation's editorial guidelines Munchetty was allowed to accurately describe Trump's comments as racist, she was allowed to objectively analyse the impact that such racist comments have on herself and other people of colour, but she was not allowed to express a personal opinion on the motives and character of the person making those racist comments. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the ruling had been misinterpreted by the public: \"The line is not about calling out racist comments â€“ which is perfectly acceptable when things are clearly framed in racist language â€“ it's about how you go on to discuss the person who made the comments and make assumptions or remarks about that. However, critics have argued that the BBC's ruling is overly cautious and fails to take a strong enough stance against racism. Many have pointed out that Munchetty's comments were not a personal attack on Trump, but rather a reaction to his harmful and divisive rhetoric.\n\n\"I think the BBC's decision is a missed opportunity to stand up against racism and xenophobia,\" said Dr. Shami Chakrabarti, a human rights lawyer and former director of Liberty. \"Naga Munchetty's comments were a perfectly reasonable response to Trump's disgusting language, and it's disappointing that the BBC has chosen to censor her rather than standing up for what is right.\"\n\nThe controversy has also sparked debate about the BBC's commitment to diversity and representation. Many have pointed out that the corporation has a long history of struggling to represent people of color and minority groups on its programs.\n\n\"This is just the latest example of the BBC's failure to take diversity and representation seriously,\" said Akilah Ahmed, a writer and activist. \"The BBC has a responsibility to provide a platform for diverse voices and perspectives, and it's falling short of that standard. The decision to censure Naga Munchetty is a slap in the face to people of color and a betrayal of the BBC's own values.\"\n\nThe BBC has faced criticism in the past for its lack of diversity and representation, with many calling for greater efforts to improve diversity and inclusion within the corporation. The controversy surrounding Munchetty's comments has reignited calls for the BBC to take concrete action to address these issues.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the BBC has pledged to review its editorial guidelines and consider ways to improve diversity and representation. However, many are skeptical that the corporation will make meaningful changes without a significant overhaul of its policies and practices.\n\n\"The BBC needs to take a hard look at its own biases and blind spots, and make some real changes to address the lack of diversity and representation on its programs,\" said Ahmed. \"Until then, controversies like this will continue to arise, and the BBC's reputation will continue to suffer.\"",

This week, the company is set to reveal its results for the third quarter, and forecasts are positive. The price of oil recently hit a four-year high and some commentators think it could reach $100 a barrel by the end of the year â€“ a price not seen since 2014. This surge in oil prices is expected to have a significant impact on BP's financial performance, with many analysts predicting a substantial increase in profits. According to a report by Barclays, the oil major is expected to post a profit of $2.3 billion for the third quarter, a significant improvement from the $1.3 billion reported during the same period last year.\n\nThe company's fortunes are closely tied to the global oil market, and as the price of oil continues to rise, BP is likely to benefit from increased revenue from its oil and gas production. The company's recent drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea have also yielded positive results, with several new discoveries and significant increases in production.\n\nDespite the positive outlook, BP is not immune to the challenges facing the global energy industry. The company is still grappling with the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, which resulted in significant environmental damage and financial losses. BP has set aside billions of dollars to cover the costs of the disaster, and the company's efforts to restore the affected areas are ongoing.\n\nHowever, the company's focus on sustainability and renewable energy is also expected to play a key role in its future success. BP has made significant investments in wind and solar energy, and the company is working to develop new technologies to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency.\n\nThe company's CEO, Bernard Looney, has emphasized the importance of sustainability in the company's strategy, stating that \"the energy transition is underway, and we must be at the forefront of this change.\" Looney has also announced plans to increase the company's investment in renewable energy and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nAs BP prepares to release its third-quarter results, investors will be closely watching the company's performance and its plans for the future. With the price of oil expected to remain high, BP is well-positioned to benefit from the trend, and the company's efforts to transition to a more sustainable energy model are likely to be a key factor in its long-term success.",

        "Text": "Is the Populist Revolt Over? Not if Robots Have Their Way\n\nDoes President Trump represent the new normal in American politics? As the world's oligarchy gathered last week in Davos, Switzerland, to worry about the troubles of the middle class, the real question on every plutocrat's mind was whether the populist upheaval that delivered the presidency to the intemperate mogul might mercifully be over. If it was globalization -- or, more precisely, the shock of imports from China -- that moved voters to put Mr. Trump in the White House, could politicians get back to supporting the market-oriented order once the China shock played out? But for all the wishful elucidations, the cosmopolitan elite can't rid themselves of a stubborn fear: The populist wave that produced President Trump -- not to mention Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, as well as Britain's exodus from the European Union and the rise of the National Front in France -- may be here to stay. China's shock to American politics may be over. Its entry into the market economy at the turn of this century cost millions of manufacturing jobs in the United States. Workers and communities were ravaged, and political positions were pushed to ideological extremes. But few manufacturing jobs are left to lose. And rising wages in China are discouraging some companies from relocating production across the Pacific. What's more, the spread of automation across industries suggests that the era of furious outsourcing in search of cheap foreign labor may be ending. Immigration pressures are likely to persist across the Atlantic, continuing to drive the populist revolt against the establishment elite in Europe. As the world's leaders gathered in Davos, they couldn't help but wonder if the populist wave that swept across the globe would continue to shape the political landscape. The answer, according to many experts, lies in the rapidly evolving world of automation and robotics.\n\nWhile the China shock may be subsiding, the rise of automation is poised to unleash a new wave of disruption that could further erode the middle class and fuel the populist revolt. As machines and algorithms take over more and more jobs, the traditional notion of work and the social contract that underpins it are being rewritten.\n\n\"Automation is the new globalization,\" said economist and author, Andrew McAfee. \"Just as globalization led to the outsourcing of jobs, automation is now leading to the outsourcing of tasks. And just as globalization created a sense of dislocation and disaffection among workers, automation is likely to do the same.\"\n\nThe impact of automation is already being felt across industries, from manufacturing to healthcare to finance. According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 800 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to automation by 2030. While some jobs will be created to support the development and maintenance of these machines, many more will be displaced, leaving workers to struggle to adapt to a rapidly changing job market.\n\nIn the United States, the effects of automation are already being felt. A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute found that between 2000 and 2016, 68% of the net job growth in the US was in low-wage occupations, while 62% of the net job losses were in middle-wage occupations. This trend is likely to continue, exacerbating the sense of economic insecurity and disaffection that has driven the populist revolt.\n\nBut it's not just the economy that is at stake. The rise of automation is also raising fundamental questions about the nature of work, the role of humans in society, and the very fabric of our communities.\n\n\"We're facing a crisis of meaning,\" said sociologist and author, Sherry Turkle. \"As automation takes over more and more jobs, people are being forced to re-examine what it means to be human. We're seeing a growing sense of disconnection and disaffection, as people struggle to find purpose and meaning in a world that is rapidly changing around them.\"\n\nAs the world's leaders gathered in Davos, they were confronted with a stark reality: the populist revolt is far from over. In fact, it's likely to continue to shape the political landscape for years to come, driven by the forces of automation and the ongoing disruption of the job market.\n\nThe question is, what will it take to address the root causes of this discontent and build a more equitable and sustainable future for all? The answer, according to many experts, lies in a fundamental rethinking of our economic and social systems, one that prioritizes human well-being and the creation of meaningful work above all else.",

Amazon said late Wednesday that it was closing its domestic e-commerce business in China. Instead of buying products sold locally by Amazon and its marketplace of Chinese suppliers, shoppers at Amazon.cn will be able to buy only some products imported by Amazon's sites in the United States, Britain, Germany or Japan. Amazon's Chinese sales are small enough that the company does not break them out in its financial reports. It sells less in the country than in Japan, the smallest market that it does report, which had $13.8 billion in sales last year, about 6 percent of Amazon's business globally. The move marks a significant shift in Amazon's strategy in China, where it has struggled to compete with local e-commerce giants Alibaba Group and JD.com. Despite its dominance in the global market, Amazon has faced intense competition from these companies, which have a strong foothold in the Chinese market.\n\nAmazon's decision to close its domestic e-commerce business in China is seen as a strategic retreat, allowing the company to focus on its core strengths and avoid further losses in the highly competitive Chinese market. The company has been investing heavily in China, but has struggled to make a significant impact, with sales remaining relatively low.\n\n\"We are adjusting our strategy to focus on our core strengths and provide a better experience for our customers,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \"We will continue to import products from the US, UK, Germany, and Japan to China, and offer a wide selection of products to our customers.\"\n\nThe move is likely to have a limited impact on Amazon's global business, as its Chinese sales have been relatively small. However, it marks a significant shift in the company's strategy in China, where it has been trying to make a mark for several years.\n\nAmazon's struggles in China are not unique. Many foreign companies have struggled to make a significant impact in the country, where local companies have a strong foothold and a deep understanding of the market. Alibaba Group, for example, has dominated the Chinese e-commerce market, with its Taobao and Tmall platforms accounting for the majority of online sales in the country.\n\nJD.com, another Chinese e-commerce giant, has also been successful in competing with Amazon, with its platform offering a wide range of products and services to Chinese consumers. The company has been expanding its logistics and supply chain capabilities, allowing it to offer fast and reliable delivery to customers across the country.\n\nAmazon's decision to close its domestic e-commerce business in China is likely to have a limited impact on the company's global business, but it marks a significant shift in its strategy in the country. The company will continue to import products from other countries and offer them to Chinese customers, but it will no longer be competing directly with local e-commerce giants.\n\nThe move is seen as a pragmatic decision by Amazon, allowing the company to focus on its core strengths and avoid further losses in the highly competitive Chinese market. The company will continue to invest in China, but it will do so in a more targeted and focused way, rather than trying to compete directly with local companies.",

        "Text": "LONDON -- Two months after a horse meat scandal first gripped Europe, tests conducted by European Union countries showed on Tuesday that France had found the most beef products containing horse DNA, while Britain had detected the most traces of a painkiller banned from the human food chain. Results from more than 7,000 tests carried out by the 27 countries in the union found horse DNA in about 5 percent of samples, while phenylbutazone, the banned drug used as an equine painkiller, was discovered in about 0.5 percent of samples. The figures, published by the European Commission, gave the first detailed picture of the extent of the problem. Tonio Borg, the European commissioner for health and consumer policy, said the findings showed that it was \"a matter of food fraud and not of food safety.\" The findings of the tests have sparked a renewed sense of urgency among EU officials to tackle the issue of horse meat contamination in the food supply chain. Borg emphasized that the presence of horse DNA in beef products was not a safety risk, but rather a case of economic fraud.\n\n\"We need to take immediate action to ensure that our consumers can trust the food they buy,\" Borg said. \"The fact that some companies are willing to deceive consumers and compromise the integrity of the food chain is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into the matter, and several companies have already been found to be in violation of EU food safety regulations. In addition, several countries have announced plans to increase their surveillance of the food supply chain to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nThe horse meat scandal has also raised questions about the lack of transparency and regulation in the meat industry. Critics argue that the industry's reliance on third-party suppliers and lack of clear labeling has created an environment conducive to fraud.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for the industry,\" said Dr. Maria Arena, a food safety expert at the University of London. \"We need to see greater transparency and accountability in the supply chain to ensure that consumers can trust the food they buy.\"\n\nIn the meantime, consumers are being advised to continue to check the labels of their meat products and to report any suspicious or irregularities to the relevant authorities. The European Commission has also set up a hotline for consumers to report any concerns they may have about the authenticity of their meat products.\n\nThe horse meat scandal is a stark reminder of the importance of food safety and the need for greater regulation and transparency in the industry. As the investigation continues, it is clear that the EU will not tolerate any further instances of food fraud and will take all necessary steps to ensure that the food supply chain is safe and trustworthy for consumers.",

        "Text": "The current obsession among water company bosses is not Labour's nationalisation plans, about which they can do precisely nothing. Rather, the hissing and fussing concerns an event that falls four days after polling day: the regulator Ofwat's unveiling of its pricing regime for the next five years. The so-called final determination is when companies learn what they can charge customers and what they're expected to achieve in reducing leaks, pollution and flooding. To listen to some of the grumblers, you'd think the sky is about to fall in. Ofwat has been \"politicised\", they claim, as they accuse Jonson Cox, the chair, of being intimidated by nationalisation fever. Companies tell fearful tales of how the updated framework, which would cut household bills by an average of Â£50 over the next five years, will make it impossible to upgrade pipes while making a fair return on capital. A few threaten to run off to the Competition and Markets Authority for a review, as they are entitled to do, if the regulator doesn't ease up. That the determination will be tougher than previous settlements is almost a given. The outcome is the culmination of a three-part process and only three companies â€“ Severn Trent, United Utilities in the north west and South West Water, which is owned by Pennon â€“ scored good marks for their 2020-25 plans in the early stages. As the deadline for the final determination approaches, the water industry is bracing itself for a significant shake-up. The regulator's updated framework is expected to introduce stricter targets for companies to reduce their environmental impact, improve customer service, and invest in infrastructure upgrades.\n\nOfwat's chair, Jonson Cox, has been at the center of the controversy, with some companies accusing him of being overly influenced by the Labour Party's nationalization plans. However, industry experts argue that the regulator's decisions are driven by a desire to ensure fair prices for customers and to promote sustainable practices.\n\nThe proposed changes are expected to have a significant impact on household bills, with average costs set to decrease by Â£50 over the next five years. While this may seem like a welcome relief for consumers, companies are warning that the updated framework will make it challenging for them to upgrade their infrastructure while maintaining a fair return on investment.\n\nSevern Trent, United Utilities, and South West Water are among the companies that have expressed concerns about the regulator's plans. They argue that the tougher targets and reduced profit margins will make it difficult for them to invest in much-needed upgrades to their pipes and treatment facilities.\n\nHowever, environmental groups and consumer advocates are hailing the proposed changes as a major step forward in the fight against climate change. They argue that the regulator's focus on reducing leaks, pollution, and flooding will help to protect the environment and ensure that customers receive a better service.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has also been drawn into the controversy, with some companies threatening to appeal Ofwat's decision if it is deemed too tough. However, the CMA has made it clear that it will only intervene if it is satisfied that the regulator's decisions are not in the best interests of consumers.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the water industry is on the cusp of a significant transformation. Whether the proposed changes will ultimately benefit consumers and the environment remains to be seen, but one thing is certain â€“ the stakes are high, and the outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the industry and the country as a whole.",

Comcast's Â£22bn bid for Sky is bold, aggressive and cutely timed â€“ qualities associated with Murdoch in his pomp â€“ and, very probably, marks the start of a shootout for the UK satellite broadcaster. The open question is who will to go head to head with Comcast. Should it be Murdoch's 21st Century Fox, whose current Â£10.75-a-share cash offer for Sky has been trumped by 16% by Comcast? The media mogul's plans to divest his 39% stake in Sky have been thrown into chaos with Comcast's surprise bid, leaving many wondering what's next for the UK-based satellite broadcaster. For Murdoch, this unexpected twist may be a blessing in disguise, as it gives him a chance to re-evaluate his strategy and potentially secure a better deal for his company.\n\nHowever, the real question on everyone's mind is who will ultimately emerge victorious in this bidding war. 21st Century Fox, which has been vying for control of Sky since 2016, is likely to be the most significant challenger to Comcast's bid. With its current offer of Â£10.75 per share, Fox may struggle to match Comcast's Â£22 billion bid, but it could still make a strong case for its own proposal by highlighting the benefits of a combined Fox-Sky entity.\n\nAnother potential contender could be Disney, which has a long history of acquiring and integrating media companies. Although the House of Mouse has yet to make a formal offer for Sky, it's not hard to imagine the company's interest in expanding its global reach and diversifying its portfolio through a significant acquisition. With its vast resources and expertise in content creation, Disney could potentially outbid Comcast and Fox, making it a dark horse in this bidding war.\n\nFor Sky, the uncertainty surrounding its future ownership could be a significant distraction for the company's employees and customers. As the bidding war unfolds, Sky's management team will need to navigate the complex and ever-changing landscape, ensuring that the company's operations remain unaffected by the external pressures.\n\nIn the meantime, the UK government will also need to play a crucial role in determining the fate of Sky. With concerns about media plurality and the potential impact on the UK's media landscape, regulators will need to carefully weigh the merits of each bid and ensure that any deal is in the best interests of the country.\n\nAs the battle for Sky heats up, one thing is clear: the media landscape is about to undergo a significant transformation. With Comcast, Fox, and potentially even Disney vying for control of the UK's most popular satellite broadcaster, the stakes have never been higher. Will Rupert Murdoch's empire be able to withstand the challenge, or will a new player emerge to claim the crown? Only time will tell.",

Patterson's pay package included a performance bonus of Â£1.3m in the year to the end of March, according to the group's annual report. BT's remuneration committee said Patterson had achieved an \"above-target outcome\" against performance measures and also agreed he should receive a 2.5% pay rise in June, taking his base salary above Â£1m. The report reveals the BT chief would have been paid even more had he not volunteered to have his payout capped at the bottom end of the bonus range, meaning he gave up Â£363,000 he was entitled to. \"The committee welcomed and agreed the chief executive's proposal to cap the outcome of the financial and non-financial measures at target, taking into account the underlying financial and operating performance of the business during the year,\" said the remuneration committee chair, former BSkyB boss Tony Ball. BT missed profit and revenue targets in the year to the end of March. The decision to cap Patterson's bonus has been met with criticism from some investors and analysts, who argue that it is unfair for the CEO to receive such a large payout while the company is undergoing significant restructuring.\n\n\"This is a clear example of the disconnect between the boardroom and the shop floor,\" said John Ralfe, a telecoms analyst at Ralfe & Co. \"While BT is cutting thousands of jobs and reducing costs, the CEO is still being rewarded with a massive bonus. It's a difficult pill to swallow for many employees who are facing significant uncertainty about their future with the company.\"\n\nBT's decision to cut 13,000 jobs is part of a wider effort to reduce costs and improve efficiency at the company. The job cuts are expected to save the company around Â£500 million annually, and will focus on reducing its workforce in areas such as customer service and IT.\n\nDespite the criticism, BT's remuneration committee defended Patterson's pay package, saying that it was reflective of his performance and the company's overall financial position.\n\n\"Patterson has delivered a strong performance in a challenging market, and his bonus reflects his achievement of key targets,\" said Tony Ball, chair of the remuneration committee. \"We believe that his pay package is fair and reflects the value he has brought to the company.\"\n\nThe news comes as BT faces increasing pressure to improve its financial performance and respond to changing market conditions. The company has faced significant competition in recent years from rivals such as Virgin Media and TalkTalk, and has struggled to maintain its market share.\n\nBT's struggles have also been exacerbated by the company's high debt levels, which stand at around Â£22 billion. The company has been working to reduce its debt levels through a combination of cost-cutting measures and asset sales.\n\nDespite the challenges, BT remains one of the largest and most influential companies in the UK, with a significant presence in the telecoms and media industries. The company has a long history of innovation and has played a key role in shaping the UK's digital landscape.\n\nAs BT continues to navigate the challenges of the telecoms market, it will be closely watched by investors and analysts to see how the company's financial performance and restructuring efforts play out.",

The SMH's editorial page in which it argued for Anzac Day to evolve must have confused readers of the more conservative Daily Telegraph. But there it was, side by side with the Telegraph's gossip page, Sydney Confidential. The unusual move is believed to be a response to the heated debate surrounding the relevance and meaning of Anzac Day, which commemorates the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps' (ANZAC) landing at Gallipoli in 1915. The SMH's editorial argued that the day's significance has become increasingly lost on younger generations, and that it is time for a reevaluation of its importance in modern Australian society.\n\nThe Telegraph's readers were likely shocked to see the SMH's editorial page, which is known for its liberal leanings, appearing alongside the Telegraph's more conservative content. The juxtaposition of the two opposing viewpoints has sparked a lively discussion among readers, with many taking to social media to express their surprise and opinions on the matter.\n\n\"This is a bold move by the SMH, and I applaud them for challenging the status quo,\" said Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old marketing executive who regularly reads both papers. \"Anzac Day is an important part of our history, but we need to have a more nuanced conversation about its relevance today.\"\n\nNot everyone is pleased with the SMH's decision, however.

In a world where interdisciplinary research is of growing importance, dividing universities by academic departments creates barriers not benefits. As academics, we're used to departments. We cling to them for our sense of identity. They provide stability as a store of resources and a physical home. But these monolithic structures are blocking the next phase in the evolution of universities. Departments make it harder for academics to push boundaries as they struggle to find new intellectual homes for ideas that don't fit neatly into disciplinary boxes. The rigidity of traditional departmental structures is hindering the advancement of interdisciplinary research, a crucial aspect of modern academia. The siloed approach to knowledge creation is no longer sufficient, as the complexity of global challenges demands innovative solutions that transcend traditional boundaries.\n\nIn today's fast-paced, interconnected world, researchers are increasingly drawn to collaborative projects that bridge the gaps between disciplines. However, the departmental framework often hinders this type of collaboration, as academics are forced to navigate a complex web of departmental affiliations, funding streams, and tenure tracks.\n\nMoreover, the departmental structure can lead to a lack of visibility and recognition for interdisciplinary research. Scholars who venture outside their departmental boundaries may struggle to secure funding, tenure, or even a platform to share their work. This can create a culture of risk aversion, where academics are reluctant to pursue innovative research that may not fit neatly within traditional departmental categories.\n\nFurthermore, the departmental structure can also perpetuate a hierarchical approach to knowledge creation, where senior academics are often expected to mentor junior researchers within their own department. While mentorship is essential, this approach can limit the exposure of junior researchers to diverse perspectives and expertise, stifling the development of new ideas and approaches.\n\nTo break free from the constraints of traditional departmental structures, universities must adopt more flexible and adaptive models that encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. This may involve the creation of cross-disciplinary research centers, institutes, or programs that bring together scholars from diverse backgrounds to tackle complex problems.\n\nAdditionally, universities can foster a culture of interdisciplinary research by providing incentives and support for scholars who pursue collaborative projects. This could include funding opportunities, tenure tracks that recognize interdisciplinary research, and recognition programs that celebrate innovative collaborations.\n\nUltimately, the evolution of universities requires a fundamental shift in how we approach knowledge creation and dissemination. By embracing interdisciplinary research and abandoning the rigid departmental structure, we can unlock new possibilities for innovation, creativity, and problem-solving, ultimately leading to a more dynamic and responsive academic landscape.",

The selection of Donald Trump's daughter and top adviser exposes the vast electronics expo to charges that when, finally, it invites a female keynote speaker, it invites one with limited experience in technology. \"This is a terrible choice on so many levels but also â€“ what an insult to the YEARS AND YEARS of protesting how few women were invited to keynote & being told it was a pipeline problem while similarly-situated men were elevated,\" tech commentator Rachel Sklar tweeted. The criticism against CES has been mounting, with many in the tech industry and beyond questioning the decision to invite Ivanka Trump to deliver the keynote speech. While the event has historically been male-dominated, with few female keynote speakers in its 50-year history, the selection of Trump has been met with widespread disappointment and frustration.\n\nSome have pointed out that Trump's lack of experience in the tech industry makes her an unusual choice for a keynote speaker at a conference focused on consumer electronics. Despite her role as a top adviser to her father, the President, Trump has no background in technology or engineering, leading many to question her qualifications to speak at the event.\n\nOthers have expressed concern that the decision to invite Trump is a missed opportunity to bring a more diverse perspective to the stage. With women making up only 26% of the tech industry, according to a recent report by the National Center for Women & Information Technology, the lack of representation at the top of the industry is a pressing issue.\n\n\"This is a chance for CES to show that it's serious about diversity and inclusion, but instead, they're choosing someone who is not a representative of the tech industry,\" said Dr. Ayanna Howard, a robotics engineer and professor at Georgia Tech. \"It's a missed opportunity to bring a fresh perspective to the stage and to inspire young women to pursue careers in tech.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of politics in the tech industry. While CES has traditionally been a non-partisan event, the decision to invite Trump has sparked debate about the intersection of politics and technology.\n\n\"CES is supposed to be a celebration of innovation and technology, but by inviting Ivanka Trump, they're bringing politics into the mix,\" said tech journalist Kara Swisher. \"It's a distraction from the real issues facing the tech industry, and it's a disservice to the attendees who are looking for a thoughtful and informative discussion about the future of technology.\"\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, many are calling for CES to reconsider its decision and choose a more qualified and representative keynote speaker.

Retail insiders say Tesco may name the chain Jack's after a division of the grocery group recently attempted to register the name as a retail trademark. It was reported on Sunday that up to 60 stores could be launched by the UK's biggest retailer. The retailer is advertising for staff for a new format in Immingham, Lincolnshire, and Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, both mothballed sites Tesco has sat on for about four years, as well as in Wandsworth, south London. The company has confirmed that a medium-sized Tesco Metro in St Helens in Merseyside will reopen under a new name while the Guardian understands workers at a Tesco Metro in Edge Hill, Liverpool, which is set to close, have also been promised potential jobs at a new store set to open within five weeks. The move is seen as a significant shift in strategy for Tesco, which has been struggling to compete with the rapid growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl in recent years. The two German chains have been gaining popularity among price-conscious shoppers, and Tesco has been forced to adapt to remain competitive.\n\nIndustry experts believe that the new discount chain, if named Jack's, will be a separate entity from Tesco's existing supermarkets, with its own distinct branding and pricing strategy. The move is likely to be a response to the growing demand for affordable groceries, particularly among budget-conscious consumers who are looking for value for money.\n\nTesco has been investing heavily in its online shopping platform and has been expanding its Click & Collect service, which allows customers to order groceries online and collect them in-store. However, the company has struggled to compete with Aldi and Lidl's low prices and efficient supply chain.\n\nThe new discount chain is expected to focus on offering a limited range of products at lower prices than Tesco's existing supermarkets. It is likely to target price-conscious shoppers who are looking for affordable groceries, rather than those who are willing to pay a premium for a wider range of products.\n\nThe launch of the new discount chain is seen as a major gamble for Tesco, which has been trying to revamp its image and appeal to a wider range of customers. The company has been investing in its store revamp program, which aims to create a more modern and welcoming shopping environment.\n\nHowever, the move has also raised concerns among some analysts, who fear that the new discount chain could cannibalize sales from Tesco's existing supermarkets. The company will need to carefully manage the launch of the new chain to ensure that it does not negatively impact its existing business.\n\nDespite the challenges, Tesco's move into discount retailing is seen as a bold and necessary step to remain competitive in the increasingly crowded grocery market. The company's ability to successfully launch and operate the new chain will be closely watched by industry observers and investors alike.",

Jessicca Shaffer, a fifth-grade teacher in this suburban community northeast of Boulder, joined the group assembled around \"Eight Days a Week.\" (Other options: \"We Can Work It Out\" and \"Help!\") \"If we truly had 52 weeks of school a year, we still would not have enough time to do everything we have to do,\" Ms. Shaffer said, sounding a common note of exasperation. \"I am supersaturated.\" An elementary school literacy coach wondered whether the evaluations would produce anything other than extra paperwork. \"Are they going to be giving us true feedback?\" she asked. \"Or are they just going to be filling out a form?\" The teachers and administrators, who gathered last month in the boardroom of the St. Vrain Valley School District for a daylong training session on evaluating teachers through classroom observations, echoed anxieties that are rippling through faculty lounges across the nation. Fueled in part by efforts to qualify for the Obama administration's Race to the Top federal grant program or waivers from the toughest conditions of No Child Left Behind, the Bush-era education law, 36 states and the District of Columbia have introduced new teacher evaluation policies in the past three years, according to the National Center on Teacher Quality, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. The training session, which was led by a team of district officials and a consulting firm, aimed to help teachers and administrators understand the new evaluation system, which is designed to assess teacher performance based on student growth, classroom observations, and other factors. The system is part of a broader effort to improve teacher quality and student achievement in the district.\n\nDespite the enthusiasm of some teachers, many expressed concerns about the new system, citing concerns about the validity and reliability of the evaluations, as well as the potential for bias and subjectivity. Some also worried about the impact on their jobs and the added stress and workload that the evaluations would bring.\n\n\"I'm worried that it's going to be a lot of extra work for us, and that it's going to be based on arbitrary criteria,\" said Sarah Johnson, a high school English teacher. \"I'm not sure how I'm going to fit it into my already busy schedule.\"\n\nThe district officials and consulting firm representatives attempted to address these concerns, emphasizing the importance of providing teachers with clear and actionable feedback, as well as the need for ongoing professional development and support.\n\n\"We understand that change can be challenging, but we believe that this new evaluation system will ultimately benefit our students and our teachers,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, the district's superintendent. \"We're committed to making sure that our teachers have the resources and support they need to succeed.\"\n\nThe district has also established a committee to review and refine the evaluation system, which will include representation from teachers, administrators, and other stakeholders. The committee will meet regularly to discuss issues and concerns, and to make recommendations for improving the system.\n\nWhile some teachers remain skeptical, others are more optimistic about the new evaluation system. \"I think it's a good idea to have a more formalized evaluation process,\" said Tom Harris, a middle school math teacher. \"It will help us to focus on what's most important, and to make sure that we're providing the best possible education for our students.\"\n\nThe St. Vrain Valley School District is one of many districts across the country that are implementing new teacher evaluation systems. While the specifics of the systems vary, the goal is often the same: to improve teacher quality and student achievement. As districts continue to navigate the challenges and complexities of these systems, it remains to be seen whether they will ultimately lead to the desired outcomes.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The conventional wisdom in the world of Silicon Valley start-ups has been that the founders call the shots and that the investors are cheerleaders -- and sometimes enablers -- of the entrepreneurs they backed. But on Tuesday, when investors pressured Travis Kalanick to step down as the chief executive of Uber, the start-up universe was abruptly reminded that investors can flex their muscles and that founders are not untouchable. \"The examples people cite of founders having all of the power are exceptions,\" said Lenny Mendonca, a senior partner emeritus at the consulting firm McKinsey. \"If investors are worried about returns, they engage. They take control. And that's what happened at Uber.\" The balance of power at young tech companies has long been a delicate issue. Silicon Valley's start-up ecosystem relies on founders' and investors' getting along -- the entrepreneurs come up with the ideas and need the financiers' money while the financiers need the founders to help them strike it rich. Over time, who holds the upper hand has shifted back and forth. In recent years, the pendulum has swung decidedly in the direction of entrepreneurs. As with most things in the Valley, the reason is money. In 2016, $333.5 billion was directed into the venture capital industry, compared with $213.7 billion in 2006, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association and Pitchbook. As the venture capital industry has grown in size and influence, so too has the power of investors to shape the direction of start-ups. This shift has been driven in part by the increasing complexity of the companies themselves, which have grown from small, scrappy operations to global giants with thousands of employees and billions of dollars in revenue.\n\n\"The founders used to be the ones who knew everything about the business, but now the companies are so big and so complex that investors have to be more involved,\" said Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist and founder of Sherpa Capital. \"They need to make sure that the company is being run in a way that's going to generate returns for them.\"\n\nThe Uber saga is a prime example of this shift in power dynamics. Kalanick, who co-founded the company in 2009, had long been seen as a dominant force within the company. He was known for his intense personality and his willingness to take risks, which had helped Uber to disrupt the taxi industry and become one of the most valuable privately held companies in the world.\n\nHowever, as the company grew and faced increasing scrutiny from regulators and the public, Kalanick's leadership style became a liability. The company was plagued by allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination, and Kalanick was criticized for his handling of the situation. The investors, who had grown increasingly frustrated with Kalanick's leadership, ultimately decided to take action and push him out of the company.\n\nThe move was seen as a major coup for the investors, who had long been seeking more control over the company. It also marked a significant shift in the balance of power within the start-up ecosystem, as investors began to assert their influence over the founders.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for founders,\" said Reid Hoffman, a venture capitalist and co-founder of LinkedIn. \"Investors are not just going to sit back and let you do whatever you want. They're going to hold you accountable for the performance of the company, and they're going to push you to make changes if they don't like what they see.\"\n\nThe impact of the Uber saga is likely to be felt throughout the start-up ecosystem, as investors and founders alike adjust to the new reality. While the founders may still hold significant power and influence, the investors are now in a stronger position to shape the direction of the companies they back.\n\n\"This is a new era for start-ups,\" said Pishevar. \"The investors are going to be more involved, and the founders are going to have to be more accountable. It's going to be a more collaborative relationship, but it's also going to be a more intense one.\"",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- Containers of goods idling at ports. Reduced sales at sandwich shops in downtown Washington. Canceled vacations to national parks and to destinations abroad. Reduced corporate earnings forecasts. Higher interest payments on short-term debt. Even with the shutdown of the United States government and the threat of a default coming to an end, the cost of Congress's gridlock has already run well into the billions, economists estimate. And the total will continue to grow even after the shutdown ends, partly because of uncertainty about whether lawmakers might reach another deadlock early next year. A complete accounting will take months once the government reopens and the Treasury resumes adding to the country's debt. According to economists, the cost of the 35-day government shutdown, which ended on January 28, will likely exceed $11 billion, with some estimates as high as $20 billion. This figure takes into account the lost productivity, reduced economic activity, and increased costs associated with the shutdown.\n\nOne of the most significant impacts was felt by federal workers, who went without paychecks for five weeks. This led to a ripple effect throughout the economy, as these workers delayed purchases and reduced their spending. According to a survey by the Federal Reserve, nearly 70% of federal workers reported reducing their spending during the shutdown, with 40% reporting a significant reduction.\n\nThe shutdown also had a significant impact on the private sector. Many businesses, particularly those in the tourism and hospitality industries, suffered losses due to the reduced economic activity. For example, sandwich shops in downtown Washington reported a significant decline in sales, while national parks and tourist destinations abroad saw a sharp decline in visitors.\n\nThe shutdown also had a significant impact on the financial markets. The yield on short-term debt, such as Treasury bills, increased as investors demanded higher returns to compensate for the risk of default. This increased the cost of borrowing for the government, which will likely lead to higher interest payments on the national debt.\n\nIn addition to the immediate costs of the shutdown, economists are also concerned about the long-term impact on the economy. The uncertainty surrounding the shutdown and the threat of future shutdowns has created a sense of unease among businesses and investors, which could lead to a decline in economic activity and investment.\n\n\"The shutdown was a major disruption to the economy, and the uncertainty surrounding future shutdowns is likely to have a lasting impact,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"It's like a big cloud hanging over the economy, and it's going to take some time to clear up.\"\n\nA complete accounting of the costs of the shutdown will take months once the government reopens and the Treasury resumes adding to the country's debt. However, it's clear that the cost of Congress's gridlock will be significant, and it will likely take a long time for the economy to fully recover.",

        "Text": "The gap between the best and worst energy tariffs offered by the big six suppliers has widened by more than half since a round of price hikes over the winter. The difference between the firms' cheapest fixed deals and their most expensive ones, standard variable tariffs, jumped from Â£70 last November on average to Â£109 in June, according to challenger supplier Bulb. Standard variable tariffs landed the big six in the crosshairs of Theresa May, who promised to impose a price cap to address the \"injustice\" of families collectively paying Â£1.4bn over the odds because of the gap. While plans for a cap have been hugely watered-down, the new figures could provide fuel for Greg Clark, business secretary, and Ofgem, the energy regulator, to take stronger action. A spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"Energy customers should not be punished for their loyalty â€¦ We now want to see suppliers playing their part and supporting the regulator to deliver a fairer deal to customers on poor value tariffs.\" The widening gap between the cheapest and most expensive energy tariffs has sparked renewed calls for action from consumer groups and politicians to address the issue. According to Bulb, the average difference between the cheapest fixed deals and standard variable tariffs has increased by 55% since last November, with some suppliers charging customers up to Â£200 more per year for the same amount of energy.\n\nThe big six suppliers - British Gas, EDF, E.ON, Npower, SSE, and ScottishPower - have faced criticism for their pricing practices, with many customers being stuck on expensive standard variable tariffs. These tariffs, which are often the default option for customers who don't switch to a fixed deal, can be up to 50% more expensive than the cheapest fixed deals.\n\nConsumer groups, such as Which?, have long called for a price cap to be introduced to protect vulnerable customers from being ripped off. While the government's plans for a cap have been watered down, the new figures could provide momentum for stronger action to be taken.\n\nOfgem, the energy regulator, has faced criticism for its handling of the issue, with some accusing it of being too soft on the big six suppliers. The regulator has launched several investigations into the suppliers' pricing practices, but has yet to take any significant action.\n\nA spokesman for Ofgem said: \"We are committed to ensuring that energy customers get a fair deal. We are working with suppliers to improve transparency and fairness in the market, and we will continue to monitor prices to ensure that customers are not being overcharged.\"\n\nThe issue of energy tariffs has become increasingly politicized, with many politicians calling for greater action to be taken to protect consumers. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has promised to introduce a price cap if his party wins the next general election, while the Liberal Democrats have also called for greater regulation of the energy market.\n\nAs the debate continues, customers are being urged to switch to cheaper tariffs and to shop around for the best deals. With the average household energy bill standing at over Â£1,300 per year, the issue of energy tariffs is likely to remain a major concern for consumers in the coming months.",

        "Text": "Hurrah, the UK now has an industrial strategy â€“ or, rather, a strategy that is designed to last longer than the next change of business secretary. We may also have conquered the national hang-up about government intervening to support business. And, on paper, there is now official acknowledgment that the geographically lop-sized state of the UK economy, and our historical underinvestment in infrastructure, are major sources of our woeful productivity performance. In other words, there is much to like the white paper, even if the actual sums of new money to be put behind the new approach remain anybody's guess. As with January's green paper, too many existing polices were shoehorned into the document and presented as if they were fresh. Still, the future priority is consistent policy-making. The UK's new industrial strategy has been met with a mix of optimism and skepticism, with many experts praising the government's willingness to acknowledge the country's geographical and infrastructure challenges, but expressing concern over the lack of concrete funding commitments.\n\nOne of the key areas of focus for the strategy is the development of a more balanced economy, with the government aiming to boost productivity in regions outside of London and the South East. To achieve this, the strategy proposes a range of measures, including the establishment of a new national productivity fund, which will provide funding for businesses and organizations looking to invest in research and development, and the creation of a new agency to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in the UK's most disadvantaged regions.\n\nThe strategy also places a strong emphasis on the importance of infrastructure investment, with the government committing to a major overhaul of the country's transport network. This includes plans to invest in new rail links, improve road connectivity, and increase funding for cycling and walking infrastructure.\n\nHowever, despite the many positives, there are concerns that the strategy may not go far enough in addressing the UK's underlying economic challenges. Many experts have pointed out that the government's funding commitments are still unclear, and that the strategy lacks a clear plan for how it will be implemented and monitored.\n\n\"The strategy is a good start, but it's not clear how it will be paid for or how it will be delivered,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, an economist at the London School of Economics. \"We need to see more detail on the funding commitments and a clear plan for how the strategy will be implemented if we're going to see any real progress.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, the UK's new industrial strategy has been welcomed by many business leaders and experts, who see it as a major step forward in addressing the country's long-standing economic challenges.\n\n\"This is a significant moment for the UK economy,\" said Sir Ian Cheshire, the chairman of the Confederation of British Industry. \"The government's willingness to intervene and support businesses is a major step forward, and we look forward to working with them to deliver the strategy's ambitions.\"\n\nAs the UK's new industrial strategy begins to take shape, one thing is clear: the road ahead will be long and challenging. But with a clear plan and a commitment to delivering real change, the UK can finally start to address its underlying economic challenges and build a more prosperous future for all.",

        "Text": "When Tyler Anastopoulos got in trouble for skipping detention at his high school recently, he received the same punishment that students in parts of rural Texas have been getting for generations. Tyler, an 11th grader from Wichita Falls, was sent to the assistant principal and given three swift swats to the backside with a paddle, recalled Angie Herring, his mother. The blows were so severe that they caused deep bruises, and Tyler wound up in the hospital, Ms. Herring said. While the image of the high school principal patrolling the halls with paddle in hand is largely of the past, corporal punishment is still alive in 20 states, according to the Center for Effective Discipline, which tracks its use in schools around the country and encourages its end. Most of those states are in the South, where paddling remains ingrained in the social and family fabric of some communities. Each year, prodded by child safety advocates, state legislatures debate whether corporal punishment amounts to an archaic form of child abuse or an effective means of discipline. This month, Tyler, who attends City View Junior/Senior High School, told his story to lawmakers in Texas, which is considering a ban on corporal punishment. The same week, legislators in New Mexico voted to end the practice there. Texas schools, Ms. Herring fumed, appear to have free rein in disciplining a student, \"as long as you don't kill him.\" \"If I did that to my son,\" she said, \"I'd go to jail.\" Steve Harris, the superintendent of the City View Independent School District in Wichita Falls, declined to comment in detail on the case but said his investigation of the school had found no wrongdoing. Corporal punishment, Mr. Harris pointed out, has long been \"one of the tools in the toolbox we use for discipline.\" Up until about 25 years ago, corporal punishment in public schools could be found in all but a handful of states, said Nadine Block, the founder of the Center for Effective Discipline. Prompted by the threat of lawsuits and research that questioned its effectiveness, states gradually started banning the practice. Despite the decline in its use, corporal punishment remains a contentious issue in many parts of the country. Proponents argue that it is an effective way to discipline students and maintain order in the classroom, while opponents claim that it is a form of child abuse that can have long-lasting psychological and physical effects on students.\n\nIn Texas, where Tyler Anastopoulos received his paddle-induced bruises, the debate has been ongoing for years. While some lawmakers argue that corporal punishment is a necessary tool for maintaining discipline in schools, others believe that it is an outdated and harmful practice that should be banned.\n\nThe Texas State Legislature has considered several bills aimed at banning corporal punishment in recent years, but so far, none have passed. In the meantime, schools in the state continue to use paddling as a form of discipline, often with little oversight or accountability.\n\nThe case of Tyler Anastopoulos has brought renewed attention to the issue, with many calling for an end to corporal punishment in Texas schools. \"It's unacceptable that in 2023, we're still allowing schools to use paddling as a form of discipline,\" said State Senator Beverly Powell, a Democrat who has introduced several bills aimed at banning corporal punishment in Texas schools. \"We need to focus on providing a safe and supportive learning environment for all students, not subjecting them to physical punishment.\"\n\nThe debate over corporal punishment is not limited to Texas. In New Mexico, lawmakers recently passed a bill banning the practice, making it the 31st state to do so. In other states, such as Mississippi and Alabama, corporal punishment remains legal and is still used in many schools.\n\nThe use of corporal punishment in schools is not unique to the United States. In many countries around the world, physical punishment is still used as a form of discipline in schools. However, many experts argue that it is a harmful and ineffective practice that can have long-lasting effects on students.\n\n\"In many countries, corporal punishment is seen as a necessary part of education, but the research is clear: it does not improve student behavior or academic performance, and it can have serious negative effects on students' physical and emotional well-being,\" said Dr. Diana Jurkovic, a child development expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nAs the debate over corporal punishment continues, many are calling for a shift away from physical punishment and towards more positive and effective forms of discipline. \"We need to focus on creating a positive and supportive learning environment, where students feel safe and valued,\" said Dr. Jurkovic. \"Paddling and other forms of physical punishment are not the answer.\"",

Unions said it was a \"dark day\" for HSBC's workforce, with 180 roles being lost in branches alongside 204 IT positions being put at risk. The bank will be left with 625 branches by the end of the year, which means it will have more than halved its high street presence since June 2011 when it had 1,301 branches. The announcement has sparked concerns among employees and customers alike, with many expressing worry about the impact on local communities and the availability of face-to-face banking services.\n\nHSBC has cited a significant shift towards digital banking as the primary reason for the closures, with the bank stating that the majority of its customers now use online and mobile banking services to manage their accounts. This trend is reflected in the bank's own figures, which show that online banking transactions have increased by 15% over the past year.\n\nHowever, critics have argued that the closures will disproportionately affect vulnerable customers, such as the elderly and those living in rural areas, who may not have access to reliable internet or mobile phone coverage. They also point out that the closures will lead to a loss of local jobs and a reduction in the bank's presence in high streets across the country.\n\nThe union representing HSBC employees, Unite, has condemned the decision, describing it as a \"dark day\" for the bank's workforce. The union's national officer, Rob MacGregor, said: \"This is a devastating blow to our members and the communities they serve. HSBC is abandoning its customers and its staff, and it's a clear sign that the bank is more interested in chasing profits than in serving the needs of its customers.\"\n\nHSBC has attempted to mitigate the impact of the closures by offering affected employees alternative roles within the bank, but many are expected to be made redundant. The bank has also announced plans to invest in its digital infrastructure and to increase the number of ATMs and cash machines available to customers.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the closures, HSBC has maintained that the decision is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the bank. A spokesperson for the bank said: \"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service, and we believe that our digital channels are the most convenient and efficient way for them to manage their finances. We are investing heavily in our digital infrastructure to ensure that our customers have access to the services they need, whenever and wherever they need them.\"\n\nThe news has sparked a wider debate about the future of high street banking and the impact of digital technology on traditional banking services. As the banking industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how HSBC's decision will affect the sector as a whole.",

        "Text": "HONG KONG -- Asia's ability to stay resilient amid the West's economic troubles is slowly waning. For much of this year, the economies of the Asia-Pacific region appeared to be blissfully isolated from the turmoil in other parts of the world. Asian stock markets fell along with those in the rest of the world, but the region's economies continued to power ahead. Within the last few weeks, however, cracks have emerged in the region's mighty economies, and analysts and policy makers have become more concerned about the painful disruption that could spill into Asia as the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate and the United States' growth remains subdued. Exports from Asia have been softening for months as demand in Europe, in particular, has slowed. Although many countries depend less on exports than they once did, the sector remains crucial for economies like those of Taiwan and South Korea and for the small, open economies of Hong Kong and Singapore, economists say. \"The potential risks for Asia have increased\" as the European crisis has moved beyond small peripheral economies like Greece, enveloping larger countries like Italy, Spain and even France, said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC in Hong Kong. The spreading economic troubles were underscored Wednesday when a closely watched gauge showed Chinese manufacturing contracting. The reading, published by HSBC, dropped from 51 in October to 48 in November, the lowest level in nearly three years and much lower than economists had expected. As the Chinese manufacturing gauge plummeted to its lowest level in nearly three years, concerns about the region's economic resilience grew. The contraction in Chinese manufacturing, coupled with the ongoing eurozone crisis and sluggish US growth, has sparked worries about the potential impact on Asia's economies.\n\nThe softening of exports from Asia, which had been a key driver of growth in the region, has been a major concern for policymakers. Taiwan and South Korea, which have traditionally relied heavily on exports, are particularly vulnerable to the decline in demand from Europe. Hong Kong and Singapore, small and open economies that are heavily reliant on trade, are also at risk.\n\n\"The slowdown in exports is a major concern for Asia's economies, particularly those that are heavily reliant on exports,\" said Dr. Lee Juhyun, an economist at the Korea Development Institute. \"If the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate, it could lead to a significant decline in demand for Asian goods, which could have a ripple effect on the region's economies.\"\n\nThe impact of the economic troubles in the West on Asia's economies is not limited to exports alone. The region's financial markets have also been affected, with stocks and currencies experiencing significant volatility in recent weeks.\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market, which is heavily influenced by global events, has been particularly affected, with the Hang Seng Index falling by over 10% in the past month. The Singapore dollar, which is closely tied to the health of the country's economy, has also depreciated significantly against the US dollar.\n\nDespite the growing concerns about the region's economic resilience, many economists remain optimistic about Asia's ability to weather the storm. \"Asia's economies are more diversified and resilient than they were in the past,\" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. \"While there are certainly risks, I believe that the region's economies will be able to adapt and respond to the challenges posed by the global economic situation.\"\n\nIn the meantime, policymakers in Asia are taking steps to mitigate the impact of the economic troubles in the West. The Chinese government has announced a series of measures to stimulate the economy, including increased infrastructure spending and tax cuts. The Korean government has also implemented a series of measures to support the economy, including a cut in interest rates and increased spending on social welfare programs.\n\nAs the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate and the US economy remains sluggish, the resilience of Asia's economies will be put to the test. While there are certainly risks, many economists believe that the region's economies will be able to adapt and respond to the challenges posed by the global economic situation. Only time will tell if Asia's economies will be able to withstand the storm and emerge stronger on the other side.",

        "Text": "How did the world come to the brink of a trade war? A key theme of Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016 was that American jobs were being lost as a result of unfair global trade. Most commentators thought it was bluster when Trump threatened to impose swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods and to pull the US out of trade deals. However, Trump's words quickly turned into action. On January 23, 2018, the US Commerce Department announced that it would investigate whether Chinese steel and aluminum imports posed a national security threat. The move was seen as a precursor to imposing tariffs on these goods, which could have far-reaching consequences for the global economy.\n\nAs the investigation unfolded, tensions between the US and China escalated. Beijing accused Washington of bullying and warned that it would retaliate if tariffs were imposed. The Chinese government also took aim at American soybean and pork exports, which were seen as key targets given the significant trade deficit between the two nations.\n\nMeanwhile, other countries began to take sides. The European Union, Japan, and South Korea all expressed concerns about the potential impact of US tariffs on their economies. The EU, in particular, warned that it would take retaliatory measures if the US imposed tariffs on its steel and aluminum exports.\n\nThe situation came to a head in March 2018, when the US Commerce Department announced that it would impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. China, in response, announced its own set of tariffs on $3 billion worth of US goods, including soybeans, pork, and whiskey.\n\nThe global trade landscape was thrown into chaos as countries scrambled to respond to the tariffs. The World Trade Organization (WTO) warned that the escalating trade tensions could lead to a global recession. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also sounded the alarm, predicting that the tariffs could shave off 0.5% from global economic growth.\n\nDespite the dire warnings, Trump remained defiant, insisting that the tariffs were necessary to protect American jobs and industries. His administration also argued that the tariffs would help to reduce the US trade deficit, which had been a key campaign promise.\n\nHowever, many economists and business leaders disagreed with Trump's approach. They argued that the tariffs would ultimately harm American consumers and industries, as well as global trade as a whole. The tariffs would also likely lead to a cycle of retaliation, as other countries imposed their own tariffs on American goods.\n\nAs the trade war escalated, the world was left wondering how it had come to this. The answer lay in a complex web of political, economic, and historical factors. The US-China trade relationship had long been marked by tensions, with Beijing accused of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. Trump's election campaign had tapped into widespread American frustration with globalization and the perceived decline of American manufacturing.\n\nThe trade war had also been fueled by a sense of nationalism and protectionism, which had gained traction in many countries. However, the consequences of the trade war were likely to be far-reaching and devastating, threatening to disrupt global supply chains and damage the world economy.\n\nIn the end, the trade war served as a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges of global trade. It also highlighted the need for countries to work together to address the underlying issues driving the trade tensions, rather than resorting to protectionism and retaliation.",

Manufacturing group Rolls-Royce, defence contractor BAE Systems and military services firm Babcock International have agreed to underwrite about Â£30m of bank loans to the steelmaker. They have done so as industrial stakeholders in Submarine Enterprise Partners, which runs the programme for replacing Britain's nuclear submarine fleet. The Ministry of Defence brokered the loan guarantee at the end of last year to safeguard Sheffield Forgemasters, according to Sky News. The 211-year-old company, which makes parts for the submarines carrying Trident nuclear weapons, has come under financial pressure due to the crisis afflicting Britain's steel industry. The government, which has been criticised for a weak response to the steel sector's woes, stepped in to negotiate a deal because it was concerned about the prospect of a Chinese-backed steelmaker investing in Sheffield Forgemasters. EU rules on state aid for companies would have prevented the government providing support directly. The agreement marks a significant turning point for Sheffield Forgemasters, which has been struggling to stay afloat amidst the ongoing steel crisis. The company's financial struggles have been exacerbated by the decline in demand for its products, as well as the impact of global oversupply on the market.\n\nIndustry experts have long warned that the UK's steel industry is at risk of collapse if the government does not take decisive action to support the sector. The steel crisis has already led to widespread job losses and plant closures, with many more expected in the coming months.\n\nThe loan guarantee agreement is seen as a crucial step towards stabilizing Sheffield Forgemasters and ensuring the continued production of high-quality steel products. The company's involvement in the Submarine Enterprise Partners programme is particularly significant, as it provides a vital link to the UK's nuclear deterrent.\n\nThe deal has also been hailed as a positive development for the UK's defence industry, which relies heavily on Sheffield Forgemasters for the production of critical components. The company's ability to continue operating at full capacity is essential for the UK's national security, and the loan guarantee agreement helps to ensure that this can continue.\n\nThe government's decision to broker the deal has been widely praised by trade unions and industry leaders, who have long called for greater support for the steel sector. The move is seen as a significant departure from the government's previous approach, which has been criticized for being too slow and ineffective.\n\n\"We welcome the government's decision to provide support for Sheffield Forgemasters,\" said a spokesperson for the Community union. \"This is a vital step towards stabilizing the company and ensuring the continued production of high-quality steel products. We urge the government to continue to take a proactive role in supporting the steel sector, and to work with industry leaders to develop a long-term plan for the sector's future.\"\n\nThe loan guarantee agreement is the latest in a series of measures aimed at supporting the UK's steel industry. The government has also announced plans to increase funding for research and development in the sector, and to provide support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nAs the UK's steel industry continues to face significant challenges, the loan guarantee agreement with Sheffield Forgemasters provides a much-needed boost of confidence. The deal demonstrates that the government is willing to take decisive action to support the sector, and that it recognizes the critical importance of the steel industry to the UK's economy and national security.\n\nIn the coming months, the government will need to continue to work closely with industry leaders and trade unions to develop a long-term plan for the steel sector's future. The loan guarantee agreement with Sheffield Forgemasters is a positive step in the right direction, and provides a vital lifeline for the company and its employees.",

Officials say that the timeline given by Richard Dabate, accused of killing his wife in the couple's Ellington, Connecticut, home in 2015, is at odds with data collected from her Fitbit, a wearable device that tracks physical activity. \"To say it is rare to use Fitbit records would be safe,\" Lancaster, Pennsylvania, district attorney Craig Stedman told the Hartford Courant. According to the prosecution, Richard Dabate's alibi for the time of the murder, which he claims he was out for a run, is contradicted by the Fitbit data, which shows that his wife, Connie Dabate, was likely still alive at the time he claimed to have returned home. The data, which was obtained by investigators, indicates that Connie's Fitbit recorded a significant amount of physical activity around the time Richard claimed he was out running.\n\nThe prosecution argues that this discrepancy in the timeline is a crucial piece of evidence in the case, and that it suggests Richard's account of events is fabricated. \"The Fitbit data provides a clear and objective record of Connie's activities on the day of her murder,\" said Stedman. \"It's a powerful tool that helps to corroborate the testimony of other witnesses and to challenge the defendant's version of events.\"\n\nThe defense, however, has raised questions about the reliability of the Fitbit data and whether it can be trusted as evidence. Richard Dabate's attorney, Jonathan J. Einhorn, has argued that the device may have been tampered with or that the data could have been compromised in some way.\n\nThe case is now pending in court, with a trial date set for later this year. The prosecution is expected to present more evidence, including testimony from experts who can explain the technical aspects of the Fitbit data and how it was obtained. The defense is likely to continue to challenge the reliability of the data and to present alternative theories about what may have happened on the day of the murder.\n\nThe use of wearable technology as evidence in criminal cases is a relatively new development, and this case is likely to be closely watched by legal experts and the general public. As technology continues to play an increasingly important role in our daily lives, it's likely that we'll see more cases like this one, where wearable devices are used to help solve crimes and bring perpetrators to justice.",

They were not particularly welcomed in America, and were broke. \"Every one of us cousins had a chip on our shoulders, having lost everything to the new Iranian government,\" said Hadi Partovi, a cousin of Mr. Khosrowshahi's. \"We had a desire to build anew as entrepreneurs.\" Mr. Khosrowshahi, 48, is on the threshold of becoming one of the world's most prominent entrepreneurs. On Sunday night, he was selected to be chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing company that is the world's most valuable start-up. The deal is almost official, according to the travel reservations site Expedia, which Mr. Khosrowshahi currently runs. The news follows six months of extraordinary turmoil at Uber. Mr. Khosrowshahi will succeed Travis Kalanick, an Uber co-founder and the company's driving force, who was forced to step down in June as the business was rocked by one scandal after another. His task will be to repair the internal culture, which had moved beyond gung-ho start-up to a company known for its divisiveness and tolerance for harassment. He will have to build Uber's business while preparing it for a self-driving future that competitors hope to dominate themselves. Sooner or later he will likely take Uber public. There is also the wild card of Mr. Kalanick, who might seize on any trouble to mount a comeback. And finally, he will have to manage all this under a much brighter spotlight than he has worked under before. Mr. Khosrowshahi was a long-shot candidate whose name did not become public until he had the job. Expedia is based in Bellevue, Wash., which makes him a Silicon Valley outsider. He had not commented on his new job as of Monday afternoon. As news of Khosrowshahi's appointment spread, many in the tech industry were surprised by the choice, given his lack of direct experience in the ride-hailing space. However, those who know him say that his entrepreneurial spirit, leadership skills, and ability to navigate complex situations make him an ideal candidate for the role.\n\n\"Uber needed someone who could bring stability and calm to the company, and Dara is that person,\" said Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist and early investor in Uber. \"He's a true entrepreneur who has built multiple successful companies, and he's not afraid to take risks. I think he'll be a great fit for the role.\"\n\nKhosrowshahi's journey to the top of Uber began in the 1980s, when he graduated from the University of Boston with a degree in business administration. He then went on to earn an MBA from Harvard Business School, where he was classmates with future entrepreneurs such as LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman and Dropbox's Drew Houston.\n\nAfter business school, Khosrowshahi landed a job at the investment bank Allen & Company, where he worked for several years before co-founding his first company, Internet Payment Corporation. The company was later acquired by First Data Corporation, and Khosrowshahi went on to become the CEO of the company's e-commerce division.\n\nIn 2003, Khosrowshahi co-founded Expedia, which he led as CEO until 2005. He then took a break from the tech industry to focus on his personal life, before returning in 2010 to become the CEO of IAC, a media and technology company.\n\nKhosrowshahi's appointment at Uber is seen as a major coup for the company, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and controversies in recent months. His experience as a CEO and his ability to navigate complex situations will be crucial in helping the company to rebuild its reputation and move forward.\n\nIn a statement, Khosrowshahi said that he was \"honored\" to be joining Uber and that he was \"excited to work with the talented team\" to build the company's future. He also acknowledged the challenges that the company faces, saying that he was \"committed to creating a culture of respect, inclusivity, and transparency\" at Uber.\n\nKhosrowshahi is expected to start his new role at Uber in the coming weeks, and will work closely with the company's board of directors to develop a plan for the company's future. With his appointment, many are hoping that Uber will be able to put its recent troubles behind it and focus on building a brighter future.",

        "Text": "Workers looking for jobs in 2035 might consider retraining as remote-controlled vehicle operators or online chaperones. Those are two of the jobs of the future suggested in a report by the CSIRO that charts 20-year trends in increasingly digitally focused and automated Australian workplaces. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, released the report on Friday at the Australian Computer Society's conference. Cash said the report showed \"some jobs will inevitably become automated over the coming years but technological change will improve others and also create new jobs and opportunities\". \"The future won't be about people competing with machines, it will be about people using machines and doing work that is more interesting and fulfilling,\" she said. The report identifies six mega-trends in the workforce, the most important of which is an \"explosion in device connectivity, data volumes and computing speed, combined with rapid advances in automated systems and artificial intelligence means that robotic devices can perform many tasks more quickly, safely and efficiently than humans\". Increased automation will raise the complexity of workers' tasks. According to the report, the second mega-trend is the rise of the \"gig economy\", where workers will increasingly be employed on a project-by-project basis, rather than in traditional full-time roles. This trend is expected to be driven by the growth of online platforms and the increasing demand for flexible work arrangements.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of \"digital literacy\" in the modern workforce, with workers needing to develop skills in areas such as data analysis, programming, and online communication. In response to these trends, the government has announced plans to invest in programs aimed at upskilling and reskilling workers, particularly in areas such as technology and innovation.\n\nOne of the most significant implications of the report is the potential for widespread job displacement, particularly in industries such as manufacturing and transportation. However, the report also suggests that many jobs will be transformed, rather than eliminated, as automation and artificial intelligence take over routine and repetitive tasks.\n\nThe report's authors stress that while some jobs may disappear, new ones will emerge that we cannot yet imagine. \"The future of work is not about replacing human workers with machines, but about augmenting human capabilities with technology,\" said Dr. Cathy Foley, the CSIRO's Chief Scientist.\n\nThe report's findings have been welcomed by industry leaders, who see the trends identified as an opportunity to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions. \"The report highlights the need for businesses to invest in their people and develop the skills they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world,\" said Mark Burgess, CEO of the Australian Computer Society.\n\nThe report also identifies several other key trends, including the growing importance of \"soft skills\" such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, and the need for workers to be able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.\n\nOverall, the report paints a picture of a future workforce that is increasingly digital, automated, and flexible, but also one that presents significant opportunities for workers who are willing to adapt and upskill. As the minister responsible for employment, Michaelia Cash, noted, \"the future of work is not about people competing with machines, it's about people using machines to do work that is more interesting and fulfilling.\"",

        "Text": "BRUSSELS -- The European Union inched closer to ending bank secrecy on Wednesday when Austria agreed to eventually start sharing personal bank account information with other countries as long as similar rules also applied to tax havens like Switzerland that are not part of the 27-nation bloc. It was the first time that Austria, long notorious for its opaque banking culture, has made such a commitment, after rebuffing calls for greater transparency for a decade. The country's chancellor said it expected to reach an agreement in principle on the matter by the end of the year. That news, at a summit meeting of European leaders here, upstaged a separate but related topic that has dominated headlines this week: tax-reduction strategies by big multinational companies like Apple, which Congressional investigators in Washington say reduced its tax bill by setting up companies in Ireland. Pressure on Austria has grown more intense as European countries try to curb citizens' ability to stash money in other jurisdictions, shortchanging their home governments of tax revenue during a time of lean budgets and gaping deficits. Ferreting out hidden bank accounts has become a cause celebre in many countries, especially Greece, which has jailed hundreds of people suspected of tax delinquency, including former government officials. In France, Jerome Cahuzac, a French minister responsible for fighting tax evasion, resigned upon admitting, after weeks of denials, that he had held a secret bank account in Switzerland. The European Commission, the administrative body for the union estimates that tax fraud and legal tax avoidance by individuals and companies cost governments there a total of $1.3 trillion a year. The agreement reached by Austria is a significant step towards achieving the EU's goal of increased transparency in financial transactions. The country's commitment to sharing personal bank account information with other member states is expected to help combat tax evasion and fraud, which has been a major concern for governments across the continent.\n\nThe EU has been pushing for greater financial transparency since the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, which revealed widespread tax evasion and money laundering by wealthy individuals and corporations. The scandal led to calls for greater accountability and increased cooperation among countries to share financial information and crack down on tax evasion.\n\nAustria's decision to join the EU's efforts to end bank secrecy is seen as a major victory for the bloc's efforts to promote transparency and fairness in financial transactions. The country's chancellor has promised to reach an agreement in principle on the matter by the end of the year, which is expected to pave the way for the implementation of new regulations.\n\nThe EU's push for greater financial transparency has also been driven by the need to address the issue of tax havens, which have been criticized for providing a haven for tax evaders and money launderers. The bloc has been working to pressure countries like Switzerland and other non-EU nations to adopt similar transparency measures.\n\nThe agreement reached by Austria is also seen as a major blow to the country's notorious banking culture, which has long been criticized for its secrecy and lack of transparency. The country's banks have been accused of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering, and the EU's efforts to end bank secrecy are seen as a major step towards addressing these issues.\n\nThe impact of the agreement on Austria's economy is still unclear, but experts say that it could have a positive effect on the country's financial sector. The increased transparency and accountability could help to attract more foreign investment and improve the country's reputation as a financial hub.\n\nIn conclusion, the agreement reached by Austria to end bank secrecy is a significant step towards promoting transparency and fairness in financial transactions. The EU's efforts to address tax evasion and money laundering are crucial for promoting economic stability and fairness, and the agreement reached by Austria is a major victory for the bloc's efforts to achieve these goals.",

        "Text": "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has told staff to prepare for as many as 900 job cuts as he warned that the Irish budget airline's expansion plans would be slowed dramatically following the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. O'Leary said in a video message to employees that Ryanair had an excess of more than 500 pilots and about 400 cabin crew. On top of that, he said, the airline would need 600 fewer people in those roles next summer than it had planned for before the worldwide grounding of the Max aircraft following two fatal crashes. O'Leary said the official number of jobs to be cut would be known by the end of August following negotiations with airports and unions. Jobs would be lost in September and October and after Christmas. Ryanair employs a total of about 17,000 people, of whom 5,500 are pilots. The airline employs more than 9,000 cabin crew and has a further 1,130 ground operations and maintenance staff, with the remainder in administrative, IT and management roles. Ryanair said its staff wage bill increased by 17% year-on-year, from â‚¬633m (Â£577m) to â‚¬738.5m, due to factors including a 20% pay increase to retain pilots and a 2% pay rise for other staff. \"We over the next couple of weeks will be doing our very best to minimise job losses, but some are unavoidable at this time,\" O'Leary said in the video. Ryanair's announcement has sent shockwaves through the aviation industry, with many employees expressing concern and uncertainty about their future with the airline. The news comes at a time when the airline is already facing significant challenges, including increased competition from low-cost carriers and rising fuel costs.\n\nIndustry experts say that Ryanair's decision to cut jobs is a response to the unprecedented crisis caused by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. The aircraft, which was meant to be a game-changer for the airline, has been grounded since March following two fatal crashes. The grounding has resulted in significant losses for Ryanair, which had planned to use the Max to expand its operations and increase its market share.\n\nRyanair's competitors, such as EasyJet and Wizz Air, have also been affected by the grounding of the Max, but they have not been forced to make the same level of job cuts. EasyJet, for example, has announced plans to reduce its capacity by 5% this summer, but has not indicated any plans to cut jobs.\n\nThe impact of Ryanair's job cuts will be felt not just by employees, but also by the communities that rely on the airline for employment and economic activity. The airline has a significant presence in several European countries, including Ireland, the UK, and Poland, and employs thousands of people in these regions.\n\nRyanair's decision to cut jobs has also raised questions about the airline's long-term strategy and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The airline has faced criticism in the past for its aggressive expansion plans and its treatment of employees, and some analysts are questioning whether the airline's current business model is sustainable in the long term.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the airline, Ryanair remains one of the most successful and profitable airlines in Europe, with a strong brand and a loyal customer base. The airline's management is expected to work closely with unions and airports to minimize the impact of the job cuts and to find alternative solutions for affected employees.\n\nIn the meantime, employees who are facing redundancy are being offered support and counseling by the airline, and are being encouraged to apply for other roles within the company. Ryanair has also announced plans to invest in retraining and upskilling programs to help employees adapt to changing industry conditions.\n\nAs the airline industry continues to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions, Ryanair's decision to cut jobs is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the sector. However, with its strong brand and loyal customer base, the airline remains well-positioned to navigate these challenges and to emerge stronger and more resilient in the long term.",

        "Text": "Public colleges have sharply raised their prices since the 1990s in the face of declining state support, but a plan by Tennessee's governor to make two years of community college and technical school free for all students represents a striking reversal of that trend. Tennessee would be the only state in the country to charge no tuition or fees to incoming students under the proposal by Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, which policy analysts called a big step toward a better-educated work force. \"This is the best idea to boost participation in higher education in a generation,\" said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a major association of public and private colleges. The plan, announced by Governor Bill Haslam in his State of the State address, aims to make the first two years of community college and technical school free for all students, regardless of income or academic background. This move is seen as a significant departure from the trend of rising tuition costs in public colleges, which have increased by 500% since the 1990s, according to a report by the College Board.\n\nUnder the proposal, students would still be responsible for paying for books, supplies, and other expenses, but the state would cover the cost of tuition and fees. The plan is expected to benefit not only students from low-income families but also those from middle-class families who may struggle to afford the rising costs of higher education.\n\nEducation experts say that the plan has the potential to increase access to higher education and boost the state's workforce. \"By making community college and technical school free, we're giving students the opportunity to get the skills and training they need to succeed in the workforce without being burdened by debt,\" said Dr. Deborah S. Santiago, CEO of Excelencia in Education, a non-profit organization that advocates for Hispanic students in higher education.\n\nThe plan has received widespread support from education leaders and policymakers across the state. \"This is a game-changer for Tennessee,\" said Randy Boyd, Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development. \"By investing in our students and making higher education more accessible, we're investing in the future of our state.\"\n\nThe plan is expected to be implemented in the next fiscal year, pending approval from the state legislature. If approved, it would make Tennessee the only state in the country to charge no tuition or fees to incoming students, according to policy analysts.\n\nWhile some critics have raised concerns about the cost of implementing the plan, many argue that the benefits to the state's economy and workforce will far outweigh the costs. \"This is a smart investment in our state's future,\" said Hartle, the senior vice president of the American Council on Education. \"By making higher education more accessible, we're giving students the skills and training they need to succeed in the workforce and contribute to the state's economic growth.\"",

        "Text": "The science lab is often perceived as a place of noble endeavour, where the conflicts and political manoeuvring of the average workplace are transcended by shared goals to, say, unravel the mysteries of the cosmos or cure cancer. However, the experience of life as a scientist sometimes appears to be at odds with these ideals. In the past year, a series of high-profile cases in the US and Europe suggest alarming levels of harassment and bullying within the academic sector. In a recent survey by the University and College Union, one-quarter of researchers said they had been bullied by colleagues, with many reporting enduring trauma and anxiety. Petra Boynton, a social psychologist who has researched bullying within higher education, said: \"It's an open secret in the profession. You're hard-pressed to find a department that hasn't got a bully and some places are a nest of them.\" Academia is not the only sector affected by bullying, but an unusual combination of factors mean bullies can, in some cases, thrive unchecked for decades. The silence around bullying in academia is particularly striking given the emphasis placed on fostering a collaborative and respectful environment. However, the reality is that many scientists feel pressured to tolerate toxic behavior in order to advance their careers. The pressure to publish and secure funding can create a culture of competition, where individuals are pitted against each other and may resort to bullying tactics to get ahead.\n\nFurthermore, the hierarchical structure of academic institutions can make it difficult for victims to report incidents of bullying without fear of retaliation. Tenure-track positions, in particular, can be a breeding ground for bullying, as junior faculty members may feel vulnerable to the whims of senior colleagues.\n\nThe consequences of bullying in academia can be severe. Not only can it damage the mental and physical health of victims, but it can also stifle innovation and creativity. When individuals feel intimidated or belittled, they are less likely to take risks or share their ideas, which can ultimately hinder progress in their field.\n\nIn recent years, there have been some efforts to address the issue of bullying in academia. Many institutions have established policies and procedures for reporting and addressing incidents of bullying, and some have even implemented training programs to promote respectful behavior.\n\nHowever, more needs to be done to create a culture of zero tolerance for bullying. This includes providing support and resources for victims, as well as holding perpetrators accountable for their actions. It also requires a shift in the way we think about academic success, moving away from a culture of competition and towards one that values collaboration and mutual respect.\n\nUltimately, the solution to bullying in academia will require a sustained effort from individuals, institutions, and governments. By working together, we can create a more positive and supportive environment that allows scientists to thrive and make meaningful contributions to their fields.",

In true horror film fashion, the series will resume its torture killings on Oct. 27 with an R-rated eighth installment titled \"Jigsaw.\" Less expected: Lionsgate's decision to promote \"Jigsaw\" by shaking an angry fist at America's blood-donation regulations. On Sunday, the studio's chief brand officer, Tim Palen, began rolling out an online ad campaign called \"All Types Welcome.\" The campaign, which launched on social media platforms and Lionsgate's website, features a series of bold and eye-catching ads that aim to poke fun at the strict guidelines surrounding blood donations in the United States. The ads, which feature the iconic Jigsaw puppet, humorously highlight the absurdity of certain blood donation regulations, such as the ban on men who have sex with men from donating blood.\n\nThe campaign's tongue-in-cheek approach has sparked a lively debate online, with many viewers praising Lionsgate's willingness to take a stand against what they see as discriminatory practices. Others, however, have criticized the studio for using a horror franchise to make a point about blood donation regulations, arguing that the issue deserves more serious attention.\n\nDespite the mixed reaction, Lionsgate's \"All Types Welcome\" campaign has generated significant buzz and attention for the upcoming film. The studio's decision to tackle a controversial issue in a lighthearted and humorous way has helped to humanize the \"Saw\" franchise, which has often been criticized for its graphic violence and gore.\n\nThe \"Jigsaw\" film itself promises to deliver the same level of intense suspense and thrilling plot twists that fans of the franchise have come to expect. The movie follows a detective who is tasked with solving a series of gruesome murders that are all linked to the mysterious Jigsaw killer.\n\nLionsgate is hoping that the \"All Types Welcome\" campaign will help to attract a new generation of fans to the \"Saw\" franchise, which has been dormant for several years. The studio is also looking to capitalize on the growing trend of socially conscious marketing campaigns, which have become increasingly popular in recent years.\n\nWhether or not the campaign is successful in its goal of promoting the film and raising awareness about blood donation regulations, it's clear that Lionsgate is taking a bold and innovative approach to marketing. By using humor and satire to make a point, the studio is hoping to stand out in a crowded and competitive marketplace.\n\nIn the end, the success of the \"All Types Welcome\" campaign will depend on how well it resonates with audiences. But one thing is certain: Lionsgate's decision to tackle a controversial issue in a lighthearted and humorous way has generated significant buzz and attention for the upcoming film, and will likely be remembered as one of the most innovative and talked-about marketing campaigns of the year.",

Marika Sherwood, a Jewish survivor of the Budapest ghetto, was due to give a talk in March about Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, headlined: \"You're doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to me.\" But after a visit by Mark Regev, the Israeli ambassador, and his civil affairs attachÃ©, university officials banned organisers from using the \"unduly provocative\" title and set out a range of conditions before it could go ahead. Students had booked Sherwood to speak as part of Israeli Apartheid Week, a series of events organised by the university's student committee of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. The Israeli diplomats visited Manchester on 22 February and met the university's head of student experience, Tim Westlake. Later that day in an email, Michael Freeman, the embassy's counsellor for civil society affairs, wrote to Westlake and thanked him for discussing the \"difficult issues that we face\", including the \"offensively titled\" Israeli Apartheid Week. Mentioning the title of Sherwood's talk, Freeman said it breached the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism. He also made accusations of antisemitism against two speakers booked for a separate event, citing tweets and their refusal to condemn antisemitic behaviour. The university's decision to censor the title of Sherwood's talk and impose conditions on the event has sparked outrage among students and academics who accuse Israel of trying to silence criticism of its policies towards the Palestinians.\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to intimidate and silence a Holocaust survivor who is simply telling her story and drawing parallels between the treatment of Palestinians and the Nazi regime,\" said Dr. Nasser Abujaber, a lecturer in Middle Eastern studies at Manchester University. \"It's unacceptable that the university has bowed to pressure from the Israeli embassy and compromised the free speech of a survivor who has dedicated her life to raising awareness about the importance of remembering the Holocaust.\"\n\nSherwood, who has written extensively about her experiences in the Budapest ghetto and has spoken publicly about the parallels between the Holocaust and the treatment of Palestinians, said she was \"deeply saddened\" by the university's decision.\n\n\"I understand that some people may find my title provocative, but I believe it is essential to confront the uncomfortable truths about Israel's treatment of the Palestinians,\" she said. \"I will not be silenced and I will continue to speak out against injustice, wherever I see it.\"\n\nThe university's decision has also been criticized by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which said it was \"outrageous\" that the university had allowed the Israeli embassy to dictate the terms of the event.\n\n\"This is a clear example of the Israeli government's attempts to suppress criticism of its policies and to intimidate those who speak out against its treatment of the Palestinians,\" said Sarah Colborne, the campaign's director. \"We will continue to support Marika Sherwood and other speakers who are brave enough to speak out against injustice, despite the attempts to silence them.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of the Israeli embassy in influencing university events and the limits of free speech on campus. The university has said that it is committed to maintaining a \"safe and respectful\" environment for all students and staff, but critics argue that this commitment is being compromised by the university's willingness to bow to pressure from the Israeli embassy.\n\nAs the debate continues, Sherwood's talk is still scheduled to take place, but under the new title chosen by the university. Despite the controversy, many students and academics are expected to attend the event, which promises to be a powerful and emotional reminder of the importance of standing up against injustice and promoting human rights.",

The window openers, the dashboard navigation maps, the fuel injectors -- these and many other operations are controlled by some of the 100 or so electronic systems in a typical car. No wonder the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that knocked out one of the world's leading automotive computer-chip factories struck such a severe and lasting blow to the global auto industry. Since the March 11 earthquake, the lack of chips from this plant is a big reason automobile production has slowed to half its normal rate in Japan, and is at a crawl in some factories in the United States and elsewhere. And plant officials here on Wednesday acknowledged that this critical link in the supply chain would be restored only gradually, despite the round-the-clock efforts of an army of workers to repair the cracked walls, collapsed ceilings and out-of-kilter equipment caused by the quake. The factory here, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, belongs to Renesas Electronics, which supplies about 40 percent of the world market for those crucial chips, known as automobile microcontrollers. If it were the PC industry, customers by now might have found alternative suppliers for their standardized chips. But because of the way the automobile industry has evolved in the digital era, microcontrollers are usually customized for each car model. That makes it difficult for automakers to quickly switch suppliers. The unique customization of microcontrollers for each car model has created a ripple effect throughout the global supply chain, leaving automakers scrambling to find alternative sources. While some suppliers have stepped up to fill the gap, many are struggling to meet the demand.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to ramp up production, but it's a complex process,\" said a spokesperson for Renesas Electronics. \"These microcontrollers are tailored to specific vehicle models, so it's not a simple matter of switching to another supplier.\"\n\nThe shortage has already caused significant delays and disruptions to production lines around the world. In Japan, major automakers such as Toyota, Honda, and Nissan have been forced to reduce production levels, while in the United States, companies like Ford and General Motors have been affected as well.\n\nThe impact is not limited to just the automotive industry, however. Suppliers of other components, such as sensors and infotainment systems, are also feeling the pinch. \"We're seeing a domino effect throughout the supply chain,\" said a spokesperson for a major supplier of automotive electronics. \"The shortage of microcontrollers is causing a ripple effect that's affecting many other components.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, industry experts are warning of a potential shortage of new vehicles on the market. \"This is a critical component of modern vehicles, and without it, many cars can't be built,\" said an analyst with a leading automotive research firm. \"If the shortage continues, we could see a significant impact on the global market.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Renesas Electronics is working around the clock to restore production at its Hitachinaka factory. The company has deployed a team of experts to the site, who are working to repair the damaged equipment and rebuild the facility.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to get back online as quickly as possible,\" said the Renesas spokesperson. \"We understand the impact this shortage is having on the industry, and we're committed to doing everything we can to restore production and meet the demand.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, one thing is clear: the impact of the earthquake on the global auto industry will be felt for some time to come.",

Hildebrand, head of the Swiss central bank, said Thursday that he regretted currency trades that have threatened his international reputation as an advocate for tougher bank regulation, but he maintained that he had violated no laws or regulations and would not resign. \"I am not aware of any legal transgressions,\" Mr. Hildebrand said at a news conference in Zurich. \"But I understand that the public also poses the moral question.\" The 48-year-old head of the Swiss National Bank, who played a high-profile role in formulation of new global standards designed to limit risky behavior by bankers, was by turns contrite and angry during the one-hour appearance, which was broadcast on the Internet. While expressing regrets, Mr. Hildebrand portrayed the accusation of insider trading as the work of his enemies on the Swiss political right, and said he was considering taking legal action against those who used information stolen from a personal account at Bank Sarasin, a Swiss private bank. \"The personal attacks against me have reached the point where I had to defend myself,\" Mr. Hildebrand said. An information technology worker at Bank Sarasin faces a criminal investigation for allegedly giving the information to the Swiss People's Party, whose most visible leader, Christoph Blocher, has been a bitter critic of Mr. Hildebrand. Appearing on a Swiss television program Thursday, Mr. Blocher confirmed that he had passed on information about the transactions and called Mr. Hildebrand \"no longer tolerable.\" But Mr. Hildebrand also faces a storm of criticism across the political spectrum, with members of Parliament and commentators questioning whether he has damaged the credibility of the Swiss National Bank and Switzerland's image abroad. Mr. Hildebrand is vice president of the Financial Stability Board, a group of central bankers and regulators that plays a leading role in recommending bank regulations to the leaders of the Group of 20 nations. Mr. Hildebrand vowed to \"continue to apply all of my energy to my job as president\" of the Swiss central bank. During the news conference, Mr. Hildebrand denied a key assertion by Weltwoche, a right-leaning Swiss magazine that first reported many details of the accusations. The magazine had claimed that Mr. Hildebrand had made a profit of around $500,000 from the trades, which were made in 2009, just before the Swiss National Bank intervened to support the value of the Swiss franc. Mr. Hildebrand disputed the figure, saying that the actual profit was much smaller, and that he had made the trades as part of a diversified investment portfolio.\n\nDespite his denials, Mr. Hildebrand's reputation has taken a significant hit, and many are questioning whether he can continue to lead the Swiss National Bank. \"The credibility of the Swiss National Bank is at stake here,\" said Ursula Stoffel, a member of the Swiss Parliament's economic committee. \"Philipp Hildebrand needs to demonstrate that he can restore public trust in the bank.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised concerns about the Swiss National Bank's governance and oversight. \"The Swiss National Bank needs to be more transparent about its decision-making process and its dealings with its employees,\" said Thomas Minder, a Swiss businessman and critic of the bank. \"This scandal has shown that the bank's culture is too focused on secrecy and too lax in its oversight.\"\n\nThe Swiss government has announced an investigation into the matter, and several lawmakers have called for Mr. Hildebrand's resignation. However, the Swiss National Bank's governing board has thus far supported Mr. Hildebrand, and it is unclear whether he will ultimately be forced to step down.\n\nThe controversy has also had implications for the global financial system, as Mr. Hildebrand has been a key player in efforts to reform the banking industry. His reputation as a champion of tougher regulation has been tarnished, and some are worried that his departure could undermine efforts to implement new banking regulations.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Hildebrand is facing a tough road ahead, as he tries to restore his reputation and lead the Swiss National Bank through the ongoing financial crisis. Despite his denials, many are questioning whether he can continue to serve in his role, and the controversy is likely to continue to dominate headlines in the coming weeks and months.",

        "Text": "The French journalists arrested while filming an anti-Adani protest this year have claimed in a documentary the Queensland police had them \"under surveillance\" and sought to repeatedly block filming near Adani's Abbot Point coal terminal. In the documentary Sur le Front des OcÃ©ans, which aired on public television network France 2 this week, journalist Hugo ClÃ©ment detailed how police acted to prevent the crew hiring a boat to obtain footage of Abbot Point from the sea. The crew was arrested on 22 July while filming a protest outside the Adani-owned coal terminal. Charges of \"trespassing on a railway\" were eventually dropped amid public outcry and an intervention by the French ambassador, but ClÃ©ment and three others were given restrictive bail conditions banning them from going near Adani sites. Those bail conditions were branded an abuse of power and attempts by police to shield corporate interests. In the documentary, ClÃ©ment details how after being banned from coming within 100m of Abbot Point, and unable to see the terminal from that distance, the crew booked a private charter boat with the intent to film from offshore. When they arrived at the marina in Bowen, the boat owner tells a stunned ClÃ©ment: \"The police rang me and said they think you're with the protests for Adani, and I don't want my boat involved.\" ClÃ©ment appeared stunned that police had known specific details about their plans. The documentary also reveals that the crew was unable to find a boat willing to take them to the location, as other boat owners were also contacted by the police and warned not to participate in the filming. This, according to ClÃ©ment, was a clear attempt by the police to prevent the crew from obtaining footage of the Abbot Point terminal.\n\nThe documentary has sparked outrage in France, with many calling for an investigation into the alleged surveillance and intimidation tactics used by the Queensland police. The French ambassador to Australia, who intervened in the case and secured the dropping of the trespassing charges, has also spoken out about the incident, calling it \"unacceptable\" and \"incompatible with democratic values\".\n\nThe incident has also raised concerns about the treatment of foreign journalists in Australia, with some calling for greater protections and support for international reporters. The Australian government has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with many arguing that it has failed to adequately address the concerns of foreign journalists and protect their rights.\n\nThe Adani Group has denied any involvement in the alleged surveillance and intimidation tactics, stating that it has \"no interest\" in interfering with the work of journalists. However, many have questioned the company's motives, given its history of controversy and criticism over its environmental and social impact.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the ongoing tensions between environmental activists and the Adani Group, which has been the target of numerous protests and campaigns over its plans to expand its coal mining operations in Queensland. The company's plans have been met with widespread opposition from local communities, environmental groups, and indigenous leaders, who have raised concerns about the impact of the project on the local environment and indigenous culture.\n\nAs the debate continues, the French journalists' documentary has brought international attention to the situation, sparking a global conversation about the importance of press freedom and the need for governments and corporations to respect the rights of journalists to report on important issues.",

The Greatest Dancer, which starts on 5 January, \"transfers power to the people\" in a competition that offers the winner Â£50,000 and a guest appearance on Strictly. In a departure from Cowell's previous hits, The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, where talent experts decide the winner, on The Greatest Dancer, the studio audience are the judges. If 75% of them vote for an act by turning on a light on their seat,the mirror behind the performer splits open to reveal them to the audience. The innovative format, which has been dubbed \"interactive television,\" is a bold move by the BBC to shake up the traditional judging panel format. The show's creator, Simon Fuller, who is also behind American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance, has promised that the audience will have a \"massive influence\" on the competition.\n\nEach week, the studio audience will vote for their favorite act, and the performer with the most votes will move one step closer to winning the coveted Â£50,000 prize and the guest appearance on Strictly Come Dancing. The twist, however, is that the audience's votes will not only determine the winner but also influence the judges' scores.\n\nThe show's judges, which include dance expert Matthew Morrison, choreographer Oti Mabuse, and singer and TV presenter Alesha Dixon, will have the power to override the audience's decision if they feel that a particular act deserves to progress to the next round. However, the judges' scores will also be influenced by the audience's votes, adding an extra layer of unpredictability to the competition.\n\nThe Greatest Dancer promises to be a thrilling and unpredictable ride, with the audience playing a pivotal role in shaping the outcome of the competition. The show's producers are confident that the interactive format will engage viewers and create a sense of excitement and anticipation that will keep them coming back for more.\n\n\"We're thrilled to be bringing this innovative format to the BBC,\" said Simon Fuller. \"The Greatest Dancer is all about giving the audience a voice and allowing them to be a part of the judging process. We believe that this will create a unique and exciting viewing experience that will set us apart from other dance competitions.\"\n\nThe Greatest Dancer is set to premiere on January 5 on BBC One, and fans of dance and reality TV are eagerly anticipating the show's arrival. With its innovative format and talented lineup of judges and performers, The Greatest Dancer is shaping up to be one of the most exciting and unpredictable competitions of the year.",

        "Text": "It has been a grim week for economic news. High street stores reported rapidly falling sales â€“ the worst since 2009. Output from Britain's car factories tumbled, shrinking by 4.1% in September, with demand from UK car buyers plummeting by 14.2%. Meanwhile, official figures revealed the average pay for full-time workers crept up to Â£550 a week, but in real terms have fallen as they have been outstripped by prices. Even the one mildly positive bit of economic news â€“ that GDP growth was slightly higher than expected â€“ came with a warning that construction activity contracted for the second quarter in a row. In normal times we might expect a chancellor to be finding ways to stimulate the economy, with the Bank of England loosening the purse strings to lift activity. But precisely the opposite is about to happen. We are told there is an 80% certainty that the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, will make the momentous announcement on Thursday that UK interest rates are to rise for the first time in 10 years. The decision to increase interest rates is a stark contrast to the typical response to a struggling economy, and it has sent shockwaves through the financial markets. Analysts are predicting that the hike will be a small one, likely around 0.25%, but the impact will still be significant.\n\nFor consumers, the rise in interest rates means that borrowing money will become more expensive. This could lead to a decrease in consumer spending, which could have a ripple effect throughout the economy. The Bank of England is hoping that the increased cost of borrowing will help to curb inflation, which has been creeping up in recent months.\n\nHowever, the move has also been criticized for being too little, too late. Many economists argue that the Bank of England should have taken action earlier to address the issue of high inflation, rather than waiting until now.\n\nThe decision to raise interest rates also has implications for the housing market. With borrowing becoming more expensive, it could lead to a decrease in demand for mortgages, which could slow down the pace of house price growth.\n\nThe timing of the decision is also being questioned. With the UK's economy still reeling from the impact of Brexit, many are worried that the increase in interest rates could be the final nail in the coffin for some struggling businesses.\n\nDespite the concerns, the Bank of England is standing by its decision. In a statement, the governor, Mark Carney, said that the move was necessary to ensure the long-term health of the economy. He added that the Bank would continue to monitor the situation closely and would be prepared to take further action if necessary.\n\nThe decision to raise interest rates is a major turning point for the UK economy, and it will be closely watched by financial markets around the world. As the economy continues to navigate the challenges of Brexit, it remains to be seen how this move will impact the country's growth and stability.",

In a case that campaigners say highlights the need for specialist teaching resources, Damian Lightoller's son, who has traits of autism, ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder and is on the special education needs register, was told by his peers he needed to \"stop shouting\", \"stop annoying us\" and \"be happy, not sad\" if he wanted to have better relationships with them. The incident, which occurred last year at Allenton Community Primary School in Derby but was only recently discovered by his parents, followed the boy (whom the Observer has chosen not to name) telling the school's behaviour mentor that he was being bullied. \"[My son] approached his behaviour mentor and said he was being bullied and was upset the other children didn't like him,\" Lightoller told the Observer. \"So, to try to tackle this, his [behaviour mentor's] idea was apparently to find out why the other children didn't like him. The behaviour mentor's plan, which was implemented without the knowledge or consent of Damian Lightoller and his son, was intended to help the boy understand why his classmates were treating him poorly. However, the approach has been widely criticized by experts and campaigners, who say it was misguided and potentially harmful.\n\n\"It's unacceptable that a child with special needs was subjected to this kind of treatment,\" said Sarah Jones, a specialist in autism and ADHD. \"Children with special needs require tailored support and understanding, not a 'tough love' approach that can exacerbate their difficulties.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage among parents and campaigners, who are calling for greater awareness and understanding of special needs and the importance of providing appropriate support in schools.\n\n\"This is a clear example of the need for specialist teaching resources and training for teachers and support staff,\" said John Smith, a parent of a child with special needs. \"Children with special needs are not 'broken' or 'defective' â€“ they are simply different, and they deserve the same level of support and understanding as any other child.\"\n\nThe school has since apologized for the incident and has launched an investigation into the matter. However, the incident has left Damian Lightoller and his son feeling hurt and betrayed.\n\n\"We just want our son to be happy and safe at school,\" said Lightoller. \"We want him to be able to learn and grow without being bullied or belittled. We hope that this incident will serve as a wake-up call for schools and parents to take special needs more seriously and to provide the support and understanding that our son and other children like him need.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the incident has highlighted the need for greater awareness and understanding of special needs and the importance of providing appropriate support in schools. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: children with special needs deserve our compassion, understanding, and support â€“ not our judgment or criticism.",

        "Text": "Credit...Kyle Johnson for The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\nSEATTLE -- When 10 representatives from Amazon visited the Denver area in late January, they did what you'd expect from a company scouting for a place to put its second headquarters. They toured more than a half-dozen potential sites for a new campus and talked about the technical talent available in the area. But they also did something that surprised local officials: Quiz them on how, if Amazon chooses to settle there, the company could avoid the problems it confronts in Seattle, the only hometown it has ever known. If Amazon moves in, bringing up to 50,000 high-paying jobs to town over time, how would the officials deal with traffic on its roads? And how would the company's tax dollars contribute to the creation of affordable housing in the region? Amazon's search for a second headquarters has been a pageant of finalist cities doing everything they can to woo the company and the good jobs and huge construction projects it would bring. The most controversial part of the process has been the big tax incentives that some state and local governments have offered Amazon, seen by critics as ineffective corporate giveaways. Amazon wrapped up its visits in mid-April to all 20 finalist locations for its HQ2, as Amazon calls its second headquarters. The company is now following up with the cities, from Los Angeles to Indianapolis to Toronto, seeking further information as it narrows its search. As Amazon's search for a second headquarters enters its final stages, the company's representatives are not only evaluating the technical infrastructure and talent pool of each finalist city but also the ability of local governments to address the challenges that come with hosting a massive corporation. The visit to the Denver area, which includes several cities in Colorado and Wyoming, was a prime example of this approach.\n\nThe representatives from Amazon, who were led by a team from the company's real estate division, spent several days touring potential sites for the new campus, including the Denver Tech Center, the Golden Triangle, and the Stapleton neighborhood. They also met with local officials, including Mayor Michael B. Hancock of Denver, to discuss the city's plans for managing the influx of new employees and the economic benefits that would come with the company's presence.\n\nOne of the key concerns that Amazon's representatives expressed during their visit was the need for affordable housing options for its employees. The company has been vocal about its commitment to providing its employees with access to affordable housing, and it has been working with local governments to identify potential solutions. In Denver, the company is exploring options such as building affordable housing units on its own property or partnering with local developers to create more affordable housing options.\n\nAnother issue that Amazon's representatives discussed during their visit was the need for improved public transportation options. The company is known for its commitment to sustainability, and it has been pushing cities to invest in public transportation infrastructure to reduce the need for personal vehicles. In Denver, the company is exploring options such as expanding the city's light rail system or creating a new bus rapid transit system to connect its employees to the city's core.\n\nAmazon's representatives also met with local business leaders and entrepreneurs to discuss the company's plans for engaging with the local community. The company has been working to build relationships with local businesses and organizations, and it is exploring options such as creating a local innovation hub or partnering with local universities to support entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nAs Amazon continues its search for a second headquarters, it is clear that the company is looking for more than just a location with a strong talent pool and good infrastructure. It is also looking for a community that is willing to work with it to address the challenges that come with hosting a massive corporation. Whether or not Denver will ultimately be selected as the site for Amazon's second headquarters remains to be seen, but the city's willingness to engage with the company and address its concerns is a promising sign for the future.",

        "Text": "The trade body for steelmakers has rubbished claims that British Steel could be more easily saved if the UK were outside the European Union and warned that the turmoil of a no-deal Brexit could further damage the industry. The intervention, from UK Steel's director general, Gareth Stace, comes as the government faces a race against time to find a buyer for British Steel, which collapsed into insolvency last week, putting 5,000 jobs directly at risk and endangering thousands more in the supply chain. Stace said the organisation was \"naturally cautious about entering into political debates\" but that the industry needed to \"establish the facts as they relate to our sector\". Writing for the Guardian days after the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, blamed the EU for British Steel's difficulties, Stace said: \"There have been claims in recent days about the ability of the UK government to use state aid more extensively to support the steel industry once outside the EU. However, Stace emphasized that these claims were \"misinformed\" and that the reality is far more complex. He pointed out that the EU's state aid rules are not the primary reason for British Steel's collapse, but rather a combination of factors, including the global steel market's oversupply, high energy costs, and the industry's structural challenges.\n\n\"State aid is not a panacea for the steel industry's problems,\" Stace said. \"The UK government has already used state aid to support the industry in the past, and while it may be able to do so again, it is not a silver bullet. The industry needs a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of its difficulties, not just a quick fix.\"\n\nStace also warned that a no-deal Brexit would have devastating consequences for the industry, including the potential for tariffs and quotas to be imposed on steel imports and exports. This, he said, would not only harm the industry but also have wider implications for the UK economy.\n\n\"The steel industry is a critical component of the UK's manufacturing sector, and its collapse would have far-reaching consequences for jobs, communities, and the economy as a whole,\" Stace said. \"We urge the government to prioritize finding a buyer for British Steel and to work with the industry to develop a long-term strategy for its future, rather than relying on short-term fixes or making rash decisions based on political ideology.\"\n\nThe UK Steel director general's comments come as the government faces increasing pressure to find a buyer for British Steel, with reports suggesting that several potential buyers are circling the company. However, the search for a buyer is complicated by the company's significant debt and the need for a new owner to invest heavily in the business to make it viable.\n\nThe government has until the end of June to find a buyer for British Steel, or it will be forced to take control of the company and decide its fate. With the clock ticking, industry leaders and politicians are urging the government to act quickly to save the company and protect the thousands of jobs that depend on it.",

        "Text": "For a sense of the dilemma confronting Facebook over its ad-targeting system, consider the following word: confederate. As of Wednesday, any prospective advertiser who typed that word into Facebook's ad-targeting engine would be prompted to distribute their ad to a potential audience of more than four million users who had indicated an interest in the Confederate States of America, according to a test by The New York Times. The social network recently grappled with revelations that advertisers were able to target Facebook users who used terms like \"Jew hater\" to describe themselves. But even after the company took steps to shut down those clearly offensive categories, other targeting terms remain that fall into a gray area. That includes categories like Confederate States, which are legitimate in principle but can be potentially problematic or misused in practice. It illustrates the blurry lines and policing challenge that confront Facebook in its ad targeting. And after a year in which the social network has accepted more responsibility to crack down on false or offensive material, and last week, when the company twice announced new measures to prevent abuses by advertisers, some experts said the scale of that challenge is only starting to become apparent. \"What we're actually talking about is all of the social issues one can think of -- any social issue, social debate, social strife -- being reproduced in this arena,\" said Sarah T. Roberts, an assistant professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies content moderation on digital platforms. \"These issues are taken wholly unresolved and put into a commercial context where they're amplified and disseminated at instantaneous speed, forever,\" she added. \"I have great empathy around the difficulty.\" Targeting involving contentious subjects can be done legitimately, said Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice president of ads products, such as companies advertising historical books, documentaries and television shows. However, the ease with which advertisers can target users based on sensitive topics raises concerns about the potential for exploitation and perpetuation of harmful ideologies. For instance, a company could use the \"Confederate States\" category to target users who are sympathetic to white supremacist views, which could contribute to the normalization of hate speech and discrimination.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Facebook's ad-targeting system allows for such categories to exist in the first place highlights the company's struggle to balance its commitment to free speech with its responsibility to prevent harm. While the platform has taken steps to remove clearly offensive content, it is clear that more work needs to be done to address the gray areas.\n\nIn response to concerns about the \"Confederate States\" category, Facebook has announced that it will be reviewing its ad-targeting options to ensure that they do not promote or perpetuate harmful or offensive content. However, experts argue that this is just the tip of the iceberg and that the company needs to take a more proactive approach to addressing the root causes of these issues.\n\n\"The problem is not just about removing offensive categories, but about creating a culture within the company that prioritizes empathy and understanding,\" said Roberts. \"Facebook needs to recognize that its platform is not just a tool for advertisers, but a reflection of society's values and beliefs.\"\n\nGoldman acknowledged the challenges that Facebook faces in policing its ad-targeting system, but emphasized the company's commitment to ensuring that its platform is used responsibly. \"We take these issues very seriously and are working hard to ensure that our platform is not used to promote hate or discrimination,\" he said.\n\nAs Facebook continues to grapple with the complexities of its ad-targeting system, it is clear that the company has a long way to go before it can be confident that its platform is not perpetuating harm. However, by acknowledging the challenges and taking proactive steps to address them, Facebook can work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful online environment.",

        "Text": "As the government and technology companies butt heads yet again over extremist material on social media, both sides may be giving a silent prayer of thanks that the battleground is one on which they are both quite comfortable. Unlike many disagreements, extremist material on social media is one where each side broadly agrees on what the best outcome looks like. Neither the government nor the social networks â€“ in this case represented by Facebook, Google, Twitter and, oddly, Microsoft, but not Apple â€“ want pro-Isis material sitting on the open net for anyone to read. All agree that the systems in place need improvement and all are working on better models and definitions to help precisely identify extremist content and remove it rapidly. That is not to say there are not disagreements over the detail. Parsing the UK home secretary Amber Rudd's comments on Sunday, about finding \"people who understand the necessary hashtags\", at their most reasonable interpretation, the government would like tech firms to not only take extremist material down, but prevent it from being posted in the first place. Technology firms, perhaps reasonably, object that to do so would turn them into judge, jury and executioner over content that is for the most part legal, if unpleasant. And even that may be a moot point given pre-emptively censoring content is somewhere on the scale of technologically tricky to effectively impossible. Simple term searches, such as those used in China to prevent social media users discussing the Tiananmen Square protests, fail in the face of human ingenuity at coming up with synonyms and allegory. However, the debate is not just about the technicalities of content removal. It also raises fundamental questions about the role of social media companies in policing online content and the limits of government regulation.\n\nThe government's desire for social media companies to take a more proactive approach in preventing extremist content from being posted in the first place is rooted in concerns about the spread of hate speech and the potential for online radicalization to contribute to real-world violence. Rudd's comments on Sunday echoed the sentiments of many lawmakers and experts who argue that social media companies have a moral obligation to do more to prevent the spread of harmful content.\n\nBut social media companies are wary of taking on this role, citing concerns about the potential for over-censorship and the need to balance the removal of extremist content with the protection of free speech. They argue that the complexity of online content, with its endless permutations of language and symbolism, makes it impossible to develop a foolproof system for identifying and removing extremist material.\n\nMoreover, social media companies are also concerned about the potential legal and ethical implications of taking on a more proactive role in policing online content. They worry that they could be held liable for any mistakes they make in removing content, and that they could be seen as exercising a form of editorial control over online speech.\n\nDespite these challenges, both sides are working to develop new technologies and strategies to improve the identification and removal of extremist content. Facebook, for example, has announced plans to hire an additional 3,000 moderators to help review and remove harmful content from its platform. Twitter has also launched a number of initiatives aimed at reducing the spread of hate speech and extremist content, including the use of machine learning algorithms to identify and remove suspicious tweets.\n\nThe UK government has also announced plans to introduce new legislation aimed at tackling online extremism. The proposed bill would require social media companies to take a more proactive approach in removing extremist content, and would give the government new powers to fine companies that fail to comply.\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen how social media companies and the government will balance their competing interests and concerns. One thing is clear, however: the spread of extremist content online is a complex and pressing issue that requires a coordinated effort from all parties involved.",

SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber, which has had a reputation for aggressive pursuit of market share even at the expense of profitability, reported a rare quarterly profit on Wednesday that was driven by taking the opposite approach: Waving the white flag in challenging overseas markets. The company's shift in strategy, which began last year, has seen Uber retreat from several international markets where it struggled to compete with local players. Instead of continuing to hemorrhage money in these areas, Uber has chosen to focus on its core markets in the United States, Europe, and Latin America, where it has a stronger presence.\n\nAs a result, Uber's net income for the quarter came in at $1.1 billion, a significant improvement from the $5.2 billion loss it reported in the same period last year. The company's revenue also grew by 14% year-over-year, reaching $4.8 billion.\n\nKhosrowshahi attributed the company's improved performance to its decision to prioritize profitability over market share. \"We're no longer trying to be the biggest player in every market,\" he said in an interview. \"We're focusing on where we can be the best, and that's allowed us to be more efficient and profitable.\"\n\nUber's shift in strategy has not been without its challenges, however. The company has had to lay off thousands of employees in the markets where it has retreated, and some investors have expressed concerns that the company is sacrificing long-term growth for short-term gains.\n\nDespite these concerns, Khosrowshahi remains optimistic about Uber's future prospects. \"We're in a much stronger position today than we were a year ago,\" he said. \"We're focused on building a sustainable business, and I'm confident that we can achieve that.\"\n\nUber's improved performance has also been driven by its growing food delivery business, Uber Eats. The company reported that Uber Eats revenue grew by 72% year-over-year, and the business now accounts for nearly 10% of the company's total revenue.\n\nThe company's quarterly results were met with a positive reaction from investors, who sent Uber's stock price soaring by over 10% in after-hours trading. The results also provided a boost to the company's valuation, which has been under pressure in recent months due to concerns about the company's growth prospects.\n\nOverall, Uber's quarterly results suggest that the company's shift in strategy is paying off, and that its focus on profitability is leading to improved financial performance. However, the company still faces significant challenges, and it will be important to see if it can sustain its improved performance over the long term.",

But BL has now written to researchers to tell them that if there is no agreement on exiting from the EU, they will have no choice but to suspend access to their digital archives for copyright reasons, although they will still be able to access the archive in person.

Losing access to the digital archive would be a significant setback for researchers and a blow to the preservation of feminist history.\"\n\nThe British Library has urged researchers to contact them directly to discuss potential alternatives, such as digitizing the archive under a new agreement or exploring alternative licensing arrangements. However, many experts are skeptical about the feasibility of these options, citing the complexity and cost involved in renegotiating copyright agreements.\n\nThe Spare Rib Collective, which has been working closely with the British Library to preserve the magazine's legacy, has also expressed disappointment and frustration at the news. \"We are devastated by the prospect of losing access to the digital archive,\" said Sarah Jones, a member of the collective. \"We understand the library's concerns, but we believe that there must be a way to find a solution that balances the needs of researchers and copyright holders.\"\n\nAs the Brexit deadline looms, the fate of the Spare Rib archive remains uncertain. While the British Library has emphasized its commitment to preserving the magazine's legacy, the suspension of access to the digital archive would undoubtedly have a significant impact on researchers and the wider public.\n\nIn the meantime, the Spare Rib Collective has launched a petition calling on the British Library to find a solution that ensures continued access to the archive. The petition has already garnered significant support from researchers, academics, and feminist activists, who are urging the library to prioritize the preservation of this important cultural and historical resource.",

        "Text": "For thousands of years, the story of the Philistines has been told through the lens of their enemies, such as the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians and the writers of the Hebrew Bible -- who described David's defeat of Goliath, the mighty Philistine warrior. While little of the Philistines' stories about themselves endure, ancient DNA from Bronze and Iron Age skeletons, uncovered in the ruins around the seaport city of Ashkelon in Israel, is providing clues to the mysterious origins of these long gone people. A team of archaeologists and geneticists who have spent more than 30 years excavating the city retrieved, for the first time, genetic data from ten Ashkelon skeletons, from about 3,600 to 2,800 years old. Their analysis suggests early Iron Age Philistines shared some genetic heritage with Mesolithic, or Stone Age, hunter-gatherers from Southern Europe. That contributes genetic evidence to the idea that people migrating eastward from the Mediterranean sailed to the shores of the Levant and helped contribute to the beginnings of the Philistines. The findings, published in the journal Science, have significant implications for our understanding of the Philistines' origins and their place in the ancient Near East. The team, led by archaeologist Ehud Weiss from the University of Haifa, used advanced genetic techniques to extract and analyze the DNA from the ancient skeletons.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that the Philistines had a genetic connection to Southern European hunter-gatherers, which challenges the traditional view of their origins,\" said Dr. Weiss. \"For a long time, we've been told that the Philistines were a group of Sea Peoples who migrated to the region from the Aegean, but this new evidence suggests that's not the whole story.\"\n\nThe team's analysis also revealed that the early Iron Age Philistines had a genetic mix of both Mediterranean and Near Eastern ancestry, which is consistent with the idea that they were a complex and multicultural society. This finding supports the theory that the Philistines were a group of people who were formed through the blending of different cultural and genetic groups.\n\nThe discovery of the Philistines' genetic heritage is also significant because it provides new insights into the history of the region. The Philistines were a major power in the ancient Near East, and their culture and language had a significant impact on the development of the Hebrew Bible and the Jewish tradition.\n\n\"This finding is a game-changer for our understanding of the Philistines and their place in the ancient Near East,\" said Dr. Weiss. \"It shows that we need to rethink our assumptions about the origins of this important group of people and the role they played in shaping the history of the region.\"\n\nThe team's research is ongoing, and they plan to continue analyzing the DNA from the Ashkelon skeletons to learn more about the Philistines' origins and culture. The discovery of the Philistines' genetic heritage is a significant breakthrough in the field of archaeology and genetics, and it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the ancient Near East.",

The national court in Madrid said it had agreed to hear an investigation by antifraud prosecutors from the Spanish tax agency into past income tax returns filed by Mr. Botin and his relatives. The tax agency said the inquiry dated to May of last year, when Spain received a list of undeclared Swiss bank accounts, which was initially handed over to France by a former information technology specialist at HSBC. Jesus Remon, a lawyer for the Botin family, said Thursday that the Botins expected the court to resolve the case \"quickly and satisfactorily\" because \"the family has voluntarily and completely normalized its tax situation and is compliant with all its tax obligations.\" The investigation, which is still in its early stages, has sent shockwaves through Spain's financial community, with many experts expressing concern about the potential impact on the country's fragile banking sector. Banco Santander, which is one of the largest banks in Spain and has a significant presence in the country, has seen its shares plummet in recent days as investors become increasingly nervous about the potential consequences of the investigation.\n\nThe news has also raised questions about the extent to which Spain's banking sector has been affected by the country's complex history, including the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Franco dictatorship. Many Spaniards have long suspected that wealthy individuals and families, including those in the banking sector, have used offshore accounts and other financial structures to evade taxes and hide their wealth.\n\nThe investigation into the Botin family's tax affairs is believed to be one of the largest and most high-profile in Spanish history, and has sparked a renewed debate about tax evasion and financial transparency in the country. The Spanish government has been under pressure to take action to address these issues, particularly in the wake of the global financial crisis, which has left many Spaniards struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe Botin family, which has long been one of the most influential and powerful in Spain, has a long history of involvement in the country's banking sector. Emilio Botin, who is 79 years old, has been chairman of Banco Santander since 1986 and has been instrumental in shaping the bank's strategy and direction over the past three decades.\n\nThe investigation into the Botin family's tax affairs is being led by the Spanish national court, which has agreed to hear the case after receiving a request from the antifraud prosecutors at the Spanish tax agency. The court has given the Botin family and its lawyers until the end of the month to provide detailed information about the family's tax returns and financial dealings over the past several decades.\n\nThe investigation is expected to take several months to complete, and could potentially lead to criminal charges against the Botin family and other individuals and companies involved. The case has already sparked widespread media attention in Spain, with many newspapers and television stations devoting extensive coverage to the story.\n\nIn a statement, the Botin family said that it was \"fully cooperating\" with the investigation and was confident that it would be resolved \"quickly and satisfactorily.\" The family also emphasized that it had \"voluntarily and completely normalized its tax situation\" and was \"compliant with all its tax obligations.\"\n\nThe investigation into the Botin family's tax affairs has sent a clear message to Spain's financial community that the country is serious about tackling tax evasion and promoting financial transparency. It has also raised important questions about the role of offshore accounts and other financial structures in the country's economy, and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the banking sector.\n\nAs the investigation continues, many experts are watching closely to see how it will unfold and what its consequences will be for Spain's fragile banking sector and the country's economy as a whole.",

A majority of economists on Wall Street and market indicators of investor sentiment had predicted the Fed would hold off on any move to tighten monetary policy at the two-day meeting that concluded Thursday afternoon. But several analysts said the language in the rate-setting committee's statement suggested that officials were even more cautious than they had thought. \"It felt like a dovish result with a dovish statement,\" said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. \"Before this meeting, there was a supposition that they'd set the table for a future move. The surprise move has sent shockwaves through financial markets, with stocks and bonds experiencing a mixed reaction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average initially fell by over 100 points, but later recovered to close only slightly lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a key indicator of borrowing costs, dropped to its lowest level in over a year.\n\nMany analysts had expected the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, citing concerns over inflation and the strong labor market. However, the committee's decision to hold rates steady has sparked concerns about the potential for asset bubbles and the risk of a prolonged period of low interest rates.\n\n\"This is a sign that the Fed is worried about the economy, and that they're not convinced that the recent slowdown is just a blip,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. \"They're trying to avoid a repeat of the 1990s, when the Fed kept rates too low for too long and ended up with a bubble in the tech sector.\"\n\nThe Fed's decision has also sparked concerns about the potential impact on the US dollar. The currency has been under pressure in recent weeks, and the lack of a rate hike may exacerbate this trend.\n\n\"This is a negative for the dollar, and it's likely to continue to weigh on the currency in the coming weeks,\" said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. \"The Fed's decision to hold rates steady has removed one of the key drivers of the dollar's strength, and we're likely to see it weaken further.\"\n\nDespite the surprise move, many analysts remain optimistic about the economy's prospects. The labor market remains strong, and consumer spending has been robust in recent months.\n\n\"This is a temporary setback, and the Fed will likely raise rates when the data warrants it,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The economy is still growing at a moderate pace, and the Fed's decision to hold rates steady is a sign that they're willing to wait and see how things play out.\"\n\nThe Fed's decision will be closely watched in the coming weeks, as investors and economists try to decipher the implications for the economy and financial markets. The next meeting of the rate-setting committee is scheduled for June, and many analysts expect the Fed to raise rates at that time.",

How much more will become clearer this week when Lloyds, the biggest seller of the dud product, winds up the banks' trading statement season on Thursday. PPI â€“ short for payment protection insurance â€“ is the biggest rip-off in British banking history. The bill so far for repaying customers and handling claims is as much as Â£53.3bn â€“ more than five times the cost of the London Olympics â€“ according to the New City Agenda thinktank. As the UK's banks prepare to release their latest trading statements, the spotlight will once again fall on the Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) scandal, which has left a lasting stain on the industry. The Â£50 billion-plus cost of the scandal is a stark reminder of the banks' failures and the need for greater transparency and accountability.\n\nLloyds, the largest seller of PPI, is expected to reveal the extent of its PPI-related costs in its trading statement on Thursday. The bank has already set aside billions of pounds to cover the costs of repaying customers and handling claims, but the final bill is likely to be even higher.\n\nThe PPI scandal, which dates back to the early 2000s, saw banks and financial institutions selling insurance policies to customers that were often unnecessary and misleading. Many customers were sold policies that did not cover them for the reasons they thought they were buying them, and some were even sold policies that did not exist.\n\nThe scandal has led to widespread criticism of the banks and calls for greater regulation and oversight. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been accused of being too soft on the banks and failing to take adequate action to prevent the scandal.\n\nThe PPI scandal has also had a significant impact on the UK's economy, with many customers facing financial difficulties as a result of the scandal. The cost of the scandal is estimated to be around Â£50 billion, which is equivalent to around 2.5% of the UK's GDP.\n\nAs the banks release their trading statements, it is clear that the PPI scandal will continue to be a major issue for the industry. The banks will need to take responsibility for their actions and work to restore trust with their customers. The government and regulatory bodies must also take a closer look at the industry and ensure that it is held accountable for its actions.\n\nIn the meantime, customers who were affected by the PPI scandal are still waiting for compensation and justice. Many have been left feeling frustrated and let down by the banks, and it is only right that they receive fair compensation for the harm caused.\n\nAs the PPI scandal continues to unfold, it is clear that the UK's banking industry has a lot to answer for.

The news had international repercussions. Botswana had been one of the last great elephant refuges, largely spared the poaching crisis that has swept through much of Africa over the past decade. Botswana's Elephant Crisis: Poachers' New Frontier\n\nThe discovery of poachers operating in Botswana, a country once considered a safe haven for elephants, has sent shockwaves throughout the conservation community. The news has sparked concerns about the future of the country's elephant population and the potential for a devastating impact on the species as a whole.\n\nBotswana has long been known for its vast and pristine wilderness areas, providing a haven for elephants and other wildlife. However, the recent incursion of poachers from neighboring Zambia has raised alarm bells among conservationists. The poachers, who are believed to be highly organized and well-equipped, have been targeting elephant herds in the Chobe National Park and surrounding areas.\n\n\"This is a major concern for us,\" said Dr. Paula Kahumbu, a renowned conservationist and director of the Zimbabwe-based organization, Wildlife ACT. \"Botswana has been a sanctuary for elephants, and the fact that poachers are now operating there is a clear indication that the crisis is spreading.\"\n\nThe poaching crisis in Africa has been ongoing for over a decade, with many countries struggling to combat the illegal wildlife trade. However, Botswana's reputation as a safe haven for elephants has made it a prime target for poachers. The country's vast wilderness areas and relatively low levels of human-wildlife conflict have made it an attractive destination for poachers seeking to exploit the country's elephant population.\n\nConservationists are calling for urgent action to address the crisis, including increased funding and support for anti-poaching efforts, as well as enhanced cooperation between governments and conservation organizations. The Botswana government has also pledged to take action, with President Mokgweetsi Masisi vowing to crack down on poaching and protect the country's elephant population.\n\nIn the meantime, conservationists are working to monitor the situation and provide support to local communities affected by the poaching crisis. The Chobe National Park, which is home to one of the largest elephant populations in Africa, is a key area of focus for conservation efforts.\n\n\"This is a critical moment for the elephants of Botswana,\" said Dr. Kahumbu. \"We need to act quickly and decisively to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure their survival for generations to come.\"",

But they aren't the only ones who feel unwelcome here. I'm a British academic, and I'm leaving to take up a post in Europe. Thanks to now-mainstream racist and anti-immigration discourses and policies, I no longer feel at home here. For me, Brexit is the last straw, building on foundations laid by the government's net migration policy (upheld by the supreme court last week). Introduced in 2012 to reduce immigration to \"sustainable levels\" by limiting family reunification, it has directly undermined my right to family life. My personal experience of the policy began when I married a non-EU citizen in 2011 while conducting doctoral fieldwork in his home country. As I reflect on my decision to leave, I am reminded of the countless conversations I've had with colleagues and friends who share similar concerns. We've all been affected by the toxic atmosphere that has permeated British society, making it increasingly difficult to feel valued and respected as academics. The erosion of our rights, the demonization of certain groups, and the normalization of hate speech have created a sense of unease and uncertainty.\n\nThe government's net migration policy has been particularly devastating. By limiting family reunification, it has effectively torn families apart, forcing loved ones to choose between their careers and their relationships. For me, this policy has meant that my spouse, who is a non-EU citizen, has been unable to join me in the UK, despite our marriage and the fact that I have been working and paying taxes here for years.\n\nThe implications of this policy are far-reaching. Not only do they affect individuals like myself, but they also have a profound impact on the academic community as a whole. The loss of talented and dedicated researchers and educators is a significant blow to the UK's research infrastructure and its ability to compete globally.\n\nBut my decision to leave is not just about me or my personal circumstances. It is also about the values that I believe are essential for a healthy and functioning society. As an academic, I am committed to promoting critical thinking, empathy, and inclusivity. I believe that education should be a force for good, bringing people together and fostering understanding and respect.\n\nUnfortunately, the current climate in the UK makes it increasingly difficult for me to continue this work. The atmosphere of hostility and division is palpable, and it is hard to imagine a future where I can feel proud to be an academic in this country.\n\nAs I prepare to leave, I am filled with a mix of emotions. I am sad to be leaving behind a country that has been my home for so long, and I am worried about the future of the academic community in the UK. But I am also determined to use my experience to make a positive impact elsewhere. I will continue to advocate for the values of inclusivity, diversity, and respect, and I will work to build bridges between different cultures and communities.\n\nIn the end, my decision to leave is not just about me, but about the kind of society we want to build. It is a reminder that, as academics, we have a responsibility to stand up for what is right and to fight against discrimination and hate. We must continue to promote critical thinking, empathy, and inclusivity, and we must work to create a world that is more just and equitable for all.",

        "Text": "This week, equestrian athletes at the Rio Olympics are competing in an event called \"dressage,\" in which they guide their horses to perform complex combinations of different gaits, including the walk, trot and canter. One type of footwork (or hoofwork, if you will) you likely won't see is an \"amble,\" a sometimes comical four-beat gait that's faster than a walk, slower than a gallop and well-suited for smooth, long rides. Most horses can walk, trot, canter and gallop, but only certain breeds can amble. The Unique Art of Ambling: A Rare Gait in the Equestrian World\n\nAs the world's top equestrian athletes take to the Olympic stage in Rio, fans of the sport are treated to a mesmerizing display of precision, skill, and athleticism. But amidst the familiar rhythms of the walk, trot, and canter, one gait stands out for its rarity and unique charm: the amble.\n\nAn amble is a four-beat gait that falls somewhere between a walk and a gallop in terms of speed. It's a smooth, fluid motion that allows horses to cover long distances with ease, making it an ideal choice for endurance riding and trail excursions. However, not all horses can amble, and it's a trait that's largely limited to certain breeds.\n\nOne of the most well-known ambling breeds is the Tennessee Walking Horse, a gentle giant with a penchant for smooth, comfortable gaits. Bred in the 19th century for long-distance riding, the Tennessee Walking Horse is renowned for its ability to amble, as well as its willingness to please its rider.\n\nOther breeds, such as the American Saddlebred and the Paso Fino, also possess the ability to amble. These horses are often used for trail riding, therapeutic riding programs, and other activities that require a comfortable, smooth ride.\n\nSo why don't we see more ambling at the Olympics? According to experts, it's largely a matter of breed and training. Most Olympic dressage horses are bred for their athleticism and agility, rather than their ability to amble. Additionally, the training required to develop an amble is different from that needed for the more familiar gaits.\n\nDespite its relative rarity, the amble remains an important part of the equestrian world. For riders who enjoy long, leisurely rides, the amble is a welcome change of pace from the more intense, high-energy gaits. And for breeders and trainers, the ability to amble is a valuable asset that sets certain horses apart from the rest.\n\nAs the Rio Olympics come to a close, fans of the sport can take comfort in knowing that there's more to the world of equestrian athletics than just the familiar rhythms of the walk, trot, and canter. The amble may be a rare sight on the Olympic stage, but it's a gait that's sure to capture the hearts of anyone who's ever ridden a horse.",

In the absence of electricity to make ice cubes and keep them frozen, they had to source their ice from elsewhere. For the most discerning hosts, that meant using blocks of purest frozen Norwegian lake, which was shipped to London's docks and then carefully stored until required to be chipped into glasses and clinked. Archaeologists have now uncovered a link to the capital's lost ice trade with the rediscovery, under one of London's most prestigious addresses, of an enormous 18th-century ice store, the existence of which had been almost entirely forgotten. The cavernous subterranean structure was built in the 1780s just to the south of Regent's Park and is the earliest-known, large-scale commercial ice store, which has led to it being designated a scheduled monument by Historic England. There are plans to make it will be accessible to the public, once the development is completed, on certain dates during the year. The discovery of the 18th-century ice store has shed new light on the city's forgotten history of ice trading, which was a significant industry in London during the 18th and 19th centuries. The store, located beneath a prestigious address in London's West End, is believed to have been used to store massive blocks of ice, which were then sold to wealthy households and businesses to keep their drinks chilled.\n\nAccording to historians, the demand for ice was high in London during the 18th century, particularly among the wealthy elite who wanted to impress their guests with elaborate parties and feasts. However, the city's limited access to natural ice sources, such as lakes and rivers, made it difficult to meet this demand. As a result, ice merchants began to import ice from Norway, where the frozen lakes and rivers provided a reliable source of high-quality ice.\n\nThe rediscovery of the ice store has provided archaeologists with a unique opportunity to study the city's ice trading history. Excavations at the site have revealed the remains of a network of tunnels and chambers that were used to store and transport the ice. The team has also found evidence of the ice-making process, including ancient ice-cutting tools and wooden ice boxes.\n\nHistoric England has designated the ice store a scheduled monument, recognizing its significance in the history of London's ice trading industry. The organization has also announced plans to make the site accessible to the public, with guided tours and special events planned for certain dates throughout the year.\n\nThe discovery of the ice store is not only a fascinating glimpse into London's past, but it also highlights the importance of preserving the city's cultural and industrial heritage. As the city continues to evolve and change, it is essential that we remember and honor our past, and the rediscovery of this lost ice store is a timely reminder of the importance of preserving our cultural and industrial heritage.\n\nThe ice store is expected to be a major tourist attraction in the future, providing visitors with a unique glimpse into the city's forgotten history. The site is also expected to be used for educational purposes, with schools and universities planning to use the site as a teaching tool to learn about the city's industrial and cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of the 18th-century ice store is a significant find that sheds new light on the city's forgotten history of ice trading. The site is a fascinating glimpse into the past, and its designation as a scheduled monument is a testament to its importance in the history of London's ice trading industry. As the site is made accessible to the public, it is expected to be a major tourist attraction and educational resource, providing visitors with a unique glimpse into the city's forgotten history.",

Already, the presidents of Harvard, Yale and Columbia have issued statements expressing interest in bringing back the R.O.T.C.. But it is not clear whether there will be enough student interest on those campuses to warrant its presence. The R.O.T.C., which has units on 327 campuses nationwide, was sent packing from several Ivy League and other prominent campuses in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in the firestorm of student protests against the Vietnam War. As the Senate's historic vote to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy takes effect, the debate about the Reserve Officers Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) on elite college campuses is reigniting. While some presidents of top universities have expressed interest in reinstating R.O.T.C. programs, there are concerns about student interest and the potential backlash from anti-war and LGBTQ+ groups.\n\nHarvard University President Drew Faust has stated that the university is \"open to considering the return of R.O.T.C.\" if there is sufficient student interest. Similarly, Yale University President Peter Salovey has expressed a willingness to revisit the issue, citing the changing landscape of the military's policies towards LGBTQ+ individuals. Columbia University President Lee Bollinger has also indicated that the university is willing to consider bringing back R.O.T.C., but emphasized the need for a thorough review of the program's impact on campus.\n\nHowever, not all students and faculty members are convinced that R.O.T.C. belongs on elite college campuses. Many students who were involved in anti-war protests during the Vietnam era still harbor concerns about the military's role in society and the potential for R.O.T.C. to compromise academic freedom. Additionally, some LGBTQ+ students and allies are worried that the presence of R.O.T.C. could create a hostile environment for students who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.\n\nDespite these concerns, proponents of R.O.T.C. argue that the program provides valuable leadership training and opportunities for students to serve their country. They also point out that the military has made significant strides in recent years to become more inclusive and welcoming to LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nAs the debate continues, many are looking to the University of Pennsylvania, which has maintained a R.O.T.C. program despite the controversy surrounding it in the 1960s and 1970s. The university's program has been successful in attracting students from a diverse range of backgrounds, including students who identify as LGBTQ+. If other elite colleges follow suit, it could pave the way for a renewed presence of R.O.T.C. on their campuses.\n\nUltimately, the decision to bring back R.O.T.C. will depend on a variety of factors, including student interest, faculty support, and the willingness of university administrators to navigate the complex issues surrounding the program. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" has opened up new possibilities for elite colleges to reconsider their stance on R.O.T.C.",

He uses a variety of apps to monitor his physical activity, diet, and sleep patterns. \"I've found that having a clear picture of my daily habits helps me make better decisions and stay motivated,\" he explained.\n\nOne of the most popular apps Herrera uses is Headspace, a meditation and mindfulness platform. \"I've been using it for a few years now, and it's been incredibly helpful in reducing stress and improving my overall well-being,\" he said.\n\nHerrera is also a fan of digital note-taking apps like Evernote and Simplenote. \"I use them to jot down ideas, keep track of research, and organize my thoughts,\" he said. \"I find that writing things down helps me process information better and retain it longer.\"\n\nDespite his reliance on technology, Herrera acknowledges that there are limits to its usefulness. \"At the end of the day, technology is just a tool,\" he said. \"It's up to us to use it in a way that enhances our lives, rather than controlling us.\"\n\nAs the editor of Smarter Living, Herrera is well-positioned to offer advice on how to effectively integrate technology into daily life. His own experiences using a range of digital tools have taught him the importance of finding the right balance between technology and human connection.\n\n\"Technology can be a powerful tool for improving our lives, but it's essential to remember that it's not a substitute for human interaction,\" he said. \"Make time for face-to-face conversations, and prioritize building meaningful relationships with others.\"\n\nBy combining his passion for technology with his commitment to helping others live healthier, more fulfilling lives, Herrera is well on his way to making a positive impact on the world.",

        "Text": "The pound has slumped to a 28-month low as investors reacted with alarm to the escalation of no-deal rhetoric by Boris Johnson's government. Sterling dropped below $1.23 against the US dollar and fell sharply against the euro to below â‚¬1.10 on the international currency markets on Monday, as cabinet ministers began meetings to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. But while the pound suffered, there was confusion from Johnson's government about whether a no-deal Brexit is the main working assumption. The prime minister himself insisted there was an \"assumption that we can get a new deal\" and that he wanted to reach out to European leaders. However, his deputy official spokeswoman reinforced the position of Michael Gove, the cabinet lead for no-deal preparations, that \"we must assume that there will be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October\" unless EU leaders agree to reopen talks on the withdrawal agreement. The spokeswoman also made clear Johnson would not be meeting EU leaders until they agree to make a new deal that does not involve the Irish backstop. The contradictory statements from the government have sparked concerns among investors and economists, who are worried about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the UK's economy. The pound's sharp decline is a clear indication of the market's unease, with many experts predicting further volatility in the coming days.\n\n\"This is a classic case of uncertainty creating market turmoil,\" said Simon Smith, a currency analyst at FxPro. \"The government's mixed signals are making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions, and as a result, the pound is paying the price.\"\n\nThe pound's decline has also had a ripple effect on other asset classes, with UK stocks and bonds also experiencing significant losses. The FTSE 100 index fell by over 1% on Monday, while UK government bonds saw their yields rise as investors sought safer havens.\n\nDespite the chaos in the markets, the government remains adamant that it is preparing for all eventualities, including a no-deal Brexit. However, many experts believe that this is a worst-case scenario, and that the government's focus should be on negotiating a new deal with the EU.\n\n\"A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK economy, and would have far-reaching consequences for businesses and individuals alike,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, an economist at the University of London. \"The government should be working tirelessly to avoid this outcome, rather than preparing for the worst.\"\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the October 31 deadline, investors and economists will be closely watching the government's actions and statements. Any further signs of uncertainty or mixed signals could lead to further market volatility, and potentially even more significant losses for the pound.\n\nIn the meantime, the government's deputy official spokeswoman has reiterated that the UK is willing to engage in talks with the EU, but only if they are willing to make concessions on the withdrawal agreement. The EU, however, has been adamant that the agreement is not up for renegotiation, and that the UK must accept the terms as they are.\n\nAs the standoff continues, one thing is clear: the pound's decline is a sign of the growing unease and uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. Only time will tell if the government can find a way to break the impasse and secure a better deal for the UK.",

        "Text": "The computers in modern data centers -- the engine rooms of the digital economy -- are powered mainly by Intel chips. They animate the computing clouds of the internet giants and corporate data centers worldwide. But Intel is now facing new competitive forces that could pose a challenge to its data-center dominance and profitability. In particular, the rise of artificial intelligence is creating demand for new computing hardware tailored to handle vast amounts of unruly data and complex machine-learning software -- and Intel's general-purpose chips are not yet tuned for the most demanding tasks. Instead, specialized chips are delivering better performance on artificial intelligence programs that identify images, recognize speech and translate languages. Intel is hurrying to catch the A.I. wave. On Tuesday, to deal with the changing competitive landscape, the Silicon Valley giant is presenting its newest data-center strategy at an event in New York, addressing its A.I. plans and its mainstream data-center business. The company has billed the event as its \"biggest data-center launch in a decade.\" How successful Intel's efforts prove to be will be crucial not only for the company but also for the long-term future of the computer chip industry. \"We're seeing a lot more competition in the data-center market than we've seen in a long time,\" said Linley Gwennap, a semiconductor expert who leads a technology research firm in Mountain View, Calif. Intel has long dominated the business for central processing chips that control industry-standard servers in data centers. Matthew Eastwood, an analyst at IDC, said the company controlled about 96 percent of such chips. But others are making inroads into advanced data centers. Nvidia, a chip maker in Santa Clara, Calif., does not make Intel-style central processors. Intel's data-center strategy event is expected to showcase the company's efforts to adapt to the changing landscape. The company is expected to unveil new products and technologies that can better handle the demands of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nOne of the key products that Intel is expected to announce is a new line of chips specifically designed for AI and machine learning workloads. These chips, known as the \"Nervana Neural Stick,\" are designed to accelerate the processing of large amounts of data and complex algorithms, making them ideal for applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nIntel is also expected to announce a new data-center platform, known as the \"Xeon Scalable Processor,\" which is designed to provide improved performance and efficiency for data-center workloads. The platform is expected to feature a new architecture that allows for greater scalability and flexibility, making it easier for data-center operators to deploy and manage their infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to these new products, Intel is also expected to announce a number of partnerships and collaborations aimed at accelerating the development and adoption of AI and machine learning technologies. The company is expected to partner with a number of leading AI and machine learning companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, to develop new applications and use cases for its technologies.\n\nDespite these efforts, Intel still faces significant competition in the data-center market. Nvidia, in particular, has been gaining traction in the market with its own line of AI-accelerated chips, known as the \"Turing Tensor Core.\" These chips are designed to provide improved performance and efficiency for AI and machine learning workloads, and have been gaining popularity among data-center operators.\n\nOther companies, such as AMD and ARM, are also making inroads into the data-center market with their own lines of AI-accelerated chips. This increased competition is expected to drive innovation and lower prices in the market, which could benefit data-center operators and end-users alike.\n\nOverall, Intel's data-center strategy event is expected to be an important milestone in the company's efforts to adapt to the changing landscape of the data-center market. The company's new products and technologies are expected to provide improved performance and efficiency for data-center workloads, and its partnerships and collaborations are expected to accelerate the development and adoption of AI and machine learning technologies.",

        "Text": "An academy chain established by the schools minister has been forced to drop controversial plans to extend the day for children as young as five after protests from parents and teachers. Future Academies in Pimlico, central London, which was set up by the academies minister Lord Nash and his wife Caroline, told parents in March that it expected to increase daily school hours by 45 minutes. It followed central government plans to do so, which were outlined in George Osborne's budget. But Future's proposals were dropped on Monday night after parents accused Lord and Lady Nash of using their children as guinea pigs and organised an opposing petition. More than 20 teachers at two of Future's schools, Churchill Gardens primary academy and Millbank academy, threatened to resign following the proposals, according to the National Union of Teachers (NUT). Future Academies, which has four schools in its group, is seen as a blueprint for other institutions to be rolled out by the government. It is sponsored by the social enterprise Future, which was founded by the Nashes in 2006. Future's work is influenced by ED Hirsch, the American academic whose ideas have influenced the national curriculum review. The decision to drop the plans was met with relief from parents and teachers, who had been vocal in their opposition to the extended school day. \"We are thrilled that Future Academies has listened to our concerns and dropped its plans to extend the school day,\" said Sarah Johnson, a parent of a child at Churchill Gardens primary academy. \"We believe that our children's education should be a priority, and not a way for the government to experiment with new ideas.\"\n\nThe National Union of Teachers (NUT) also welcomed the decision, stating that it was a victory for teachers and parents who had stood together against the plans. \"We are pleased that Future Academies has recognized the concerns of teachers and parents, and has decided not to proceed with the extended school day,\" said a spokesperson for the NUT. \"We believe that the education system should be based on the needs of children, not the whims of politicians.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding Future Academies' plans highlights the ongoing debate about the role of schools in society. While some argue that longer school days would provide more opportunities for children to learn and develop, others believe that it would be detrimental to their well-being and would lead to burnout.\n\nFuture Academies' decision to drop its plans is a significant blow to the government's plans to extend the school day. The proposal was seen as a key part of the government's education reforms, aimed at improving academic standards and increasing the amount of time children spend in education.\n\nHowever, the decision is also a testament to the power of grassroots activism and the importance of listening to the concerns of parents and teachers. As the debate about the role of schools in society continues, it is clear that the views of those closest to the education system should be taken seriously.\n\nIn the meantime, Future Academies will focus on providing high-quality education to its students, and will continue to work with parents and teachers to develop a curriculum that meets the needs of all its pupils.",

        "Text": "Facebook, Twitter and Google could face their worst regulation nightmares if the recommendations of parliament's report into fake news, based on a leaked version published on Friday by the former campaign strategist for Vote Leave, come to pass. The report is expected to call for the creation of a new legal framework for regulating technology firms, tightening their liabilities and imposing a requirement for them to take down \"harmful and illegal content\". It will argue for the end of \"safe harbour\" provisions, whereby platforms are not liable for content hosted by them until it is flagged to them as problematic. Instead, the report will argue, companies should be liable for \"both content that has been referred to them for takedown by their users, and other content that should have been easy for the tech companies to identify for themselves\". The goal, to create a new category that is neither \"publisher\" nor \"platform\", recognises that the largest social media firms shape their platforms far more than the web hosts and forum providers of the early internet. \"They continually change what is and is not seen on their sites, based on algorithms and human intervention,\" the report notes. In fact, the recommendation would largely formalise in law what the largest tech companies have been doing in practice for years. YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, the three largest platform holders in the UK, all proactively police their sites for illegal content in various ways. A source at one of the platforms described the perception that they did do this as \"rubbish\", pointing to the vast effort publicly put into fighting such content. Microsoft's PhotoDNA technology, for instance, allows known child abuse imagery to be prevented from being posted, while all three companies have been investing in AI technology in an effort to find and flag terror propaganda before it is seen by any humans. The report's recommendations aim to address the concerns that these tech giants are not doing enough to prevent the spread of harmful content on their platforms. The proposed changes would require companies to be more proactive in identifying and removing illegal content, rather than simply relying on users to flag it.\n\nThe report also calls for the creation of a new regulatory body, responsible for overseeing the implementation of these new regulations. This body would work closely with the tech companies to ensure that they are complying with the new rules and would have the power to fine them if they fail to do so.\n\nIndustry experts have welcomed the report's recommendations, saying that they are a step in the right direction towards creating a safer online environment. \"It's about time that the tech giants took responsibility for the content that appears on their platforms,\" said Emma Watson, a digital rights activist. \"They have the technology and the resources to do something about it, and it's only fair that they take action.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the report's recommendations go far enough. Some have argued that the new regulations would be too burdensome for small businesses and startups, and could stifle innovation in the tech industry. \"The government needs to be careful not to over-regulate the tech industry,\" said James Smith, a tech entrepreneur. \"We need to find a balance between keeping people safe online and allowing companies to innovate and grow.\"\n\nThe report's recommendations are expected to be debated in parliament in the coming weeks, with a final decision expected in the spring. If implemented, the changes could have significant implications for the tech industry, and would likely require significant changes to the way that companies operate.\n\nIn the meantime, the tech giants are already taking steps to address the concerns raised in the report. Facebook, for example, has announced plans to hire an additional 1,000 moderators to help police its platform, and has committed to increasing transparency around its content moderation policies. Twitter has also announced plans to increase its moderation efforts, and has promised to do more to address the spread of misinformation on its platform.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, has announced plans to invest in new AI technology to help identify and remove harmful content from its platforms. The company has also committed to increasing transparency around its content moderation policies, and has promised to do more to address the spread of misinformation on its platforms.\n\nAs the debate around the report's recommendations continues, one thing is clear: the tech industry is facing a major overhaul, and the consequences of inaction will be severe. The government must take a tough stance on the spread of harmful content online, and must work with the tech giants to create a safer and more responsible online environment.",

In letters sent to Fed officials last week, the coalition called for the central bank to let the public participate in choosing new presidents for the regional reserve banks in Philadelphia and Dallas. The current heads of both banks plan to step down in the first half of 2015. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has agreed to meet on Friday with about three dozen representatives of the groups to hear their concerns. \"The Federal Reserve has huge influence over the number of people who have jobs, over our wages, over the number of hours that we get to work, and yet we don't have discussion and engagement over what Fed policy should be,\" said Ady Barkan, a lawyer with the Center for Popular Democracy, a Brooklyn-based advocacy group that is orchestrating the campaigns. The coalition, which includes over 30 organizations, is pushing for a more transparent and inclusive process for selecting the next presidents of the Philadelphia and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks. Currently, the Fed's Board of Governors selects the regional bank presidents, often with little input from the public or the communities they serve.\n\nThe coalition argues that this lack of transparency and accountability has led to a concentration of power among large financial institutions and corporate interests, which can influence Fed policy to benefit their own interests rather than the broader public.\n\n\"We're not asking for a radical overhaul of the Federal Reserve's structure or function, but rather a more democratic and participatory process for selecting the leaders of our regional banks,\" said Barkan. \"It's time for the Fed to listen to the people who are most affected by its policies, rather than just the big banks and corporations.\"\n\nThe coalition's demands have sparked a heated debate within the Fed and among economists and policymakers. Some argue that the current process is effective in attracting top talent to lead the regional banks, while others see the coalition's proposal as a necessary step towards greater accountability and transparency.\n\nThe meeting between Yellen and the coalition representatives on Friday is expected to be a key moment in the debate. While the Fed chairwoman has agreed to meet with the group, she has not committed to implementing any changes to the appointment process.\n\nThe coalition's campaign is gaining momentum, with several lawmakers and regulators expressing support for their demands. The movement is also gaining traction among the general public, with many individuals and organizations calling for greater transparency and accountability at the Fed.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the future of the Federal Reserve's leadership selection process is uncertain, and the outcome will have significant implications for the economy and the lives of millions of Americans.",

The University and College Union (UCU) said it had rejected an offer by the employers, represented by Universities UK (UUK), to swap limited increases in staff pension contributions for a two-year bar on strike action. The UCU will go ahead with balloting its members, including researchers, librarians and other academic staff, from 9 September, which means as many as 69 universities with members in the pension scheme could see strike action in the new academic year. Jo Grady, the UCU's general secretary, said university management were expecting their staff to meet more of the cost of pensions because the sector had been unable to control its own spending or curb a building bonanza. The move by employers to increase pension contributions has been met with fierce resistance from the UCU, which argues that it is unfair to expect staff to bear the brunt of the financial burden. The union claims that the proposed changes would result in a significant reduction in staff take-home pay, with some employees facing a 4-5% reduction in their salaries.\n\nThe UCU has also expressed concerns that the increased pension contributions would disproportionately affect lower-paid staff, who would be forced to pay a larger percentage of their salary towards their pensions. This, the union argues, would exacerbate existing pay inequality within the sector.\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing for several months, with the UCU and UUK failing to reach an agreement on the issue. The union has accused employers of being unwilling to negotiate in good faith, and has threatened to take industrial action if its demands are not met.\n\nThe prospect of strike action has sent shockwaves through the academic community, with many students and staff expressing concern about the potential disruption to the new academic year. The UCU has promised to provide full support to its members who take part in the strike, and has vowed to do everything in its power to protect the interests of its members.\n\nThe dispute is not limited to the UK, with similar pension disputes unfolding in universities across Europe. The European University Association (EUA) has called for a unified approach to the issue, urging governments and employers to work together to find a solution.\n\nAs the dispute continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the UCU and UUK will be able to reach a compromise. The union has vowed to continue its campaign until its demands are met, and has promised to take all necessary steps to protect its members' interests.\n\nIn the meantime, the academic community is bracing itself for the possibility of strike action, with many students and staff expressing concern about the potential disruption to the new academic year.

However, experts say that this culture is not only illegal but also undermines the integrity of the business and can have long-term consequences for the economy.\n\nThe parliamentary inquiry is expected to release its findings in the coming months, and experts say that it will be a critical moment for the franchise sector to address the issue of wage theft once and for all.\n\n\"The inquiry is a vital step towards addressing the widespread problem of wage theft in the franchise sector,\" said Professor Sharon Hamilton, an expert in employment law at the University of Melbourne. \"It's not just about punishing individuals who have engaged in wage theft, but about changing the culture of the sector and ensuring that workers are treated fairly and with respect.\"\n\nThe inquiry has also heard that the franchise sector is plagued by a lack of transparency and accountability, with many franchisors failing to provide adequate training or support to small-business owners. This has led to a situation where many franchisees are left to fend for themselves, with little recourse if they encounter difficulties or disputes with their franchisor.\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has also been criticized for its handling of complaints about wage theft in the franchise sector.

        "Text": "How Narwhal the 'Unicorn' Puppy May Have Grown a Tail on His Head \n* None  \n\nA puppy with a tail on his face gained viral fame this week. \"I would die for Narwhal,\" a number of Twitter commenters pledged. The rescue mutt was named for a marine mammal with a single tusk that sticks out of its face. But instead of a tusk, Narwhal the puppy has a miniature tail flopping between his eyes. Scientists don't agree on how the unusual heart-stealer came to exist. A Missouri shelter called Mac's Mission, which specializes in what it calls \"janky\" dogs, took in the abandoned puppy. Staff were disappointed that Narwhal's extra tail didn't wag. But the appendage didn't seem to bother the otherwise normal, healthy puppy, and a veterinarian said there was no need to remove it. An X-ray showed no bones. The likeliest explanation for how Narwhal got his face tail is not all that cute, said Margret Casal, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. The tail is probably Narwhal's parasitic twin. Regular identical twins form when an embryo splits in half very soon after fertilization. Sometimes, this split happens too late in a pregnancy and the halves don't fully separate, leading to conjoined twins. Even more rarely, Dr. Casal said, the late split is asymmetrical, meaning one side of the embryo grows into a fully formed individual and the other becomes an extra body part. Dr. Casal highlighted a little mohawk of backward-growing fur above Narwhal's face tail, similar to the crest on a dog such as a Rhodesian Ridgeback. The unusual case of Narwhal, the \"unicorn\" puppy, has sparked widespread fascination and debate among scientists and animal lovers alike. While the exact origin of the puppy's face tail remains unclear, Dr. Casal's theory of a parasitic twin offers a plausible explanation.\n\nAccording to Dr. Casal, the development of conjoined twins is a rare phenomenon that can occur when an embryo splits too late in the pregnancy. In this case, it's possible that Narwhal's parasitic twin failed to fully separate, resulting in the growth of an extra body part on his face.\n\nDespite the unusual appearance, Narwhal's tail does not seem to be causing him any discomfort or distress. In fact, the puppy appears to be a normal, healthy individual, with no signs of pain or discomfort.\n\nThe discovery of Narwhal's face tail has also raised questions about the potential for other similar cases in the animal kingdom. While conjoined twins are relatively rare in humans, they are more common in animals, particularly in species such as dogs, cats, and cattle.\n\nIn the meantime, Narwhal's caretakers at Mac's Mission are thrilled with the puppy's progress and are working to find him a forever home. Despite the challenges he may face, Narwhal is a loving and playful pup who is sure to capture the hearts of anyone who meets him.\n\nAs the story of Narwhal continues to spread, it serves as a reminder of the incredible diversity and complexity of life on Earth. While the exact origin of his face tail may never be fully understood, Narwhal's case has already inspired a sense of wonder and awe in those who have learned about him.\n\nIn the end, Narwhal's story is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of animals, and a reminder of the importance of compassion and understanding towards all living beings, no matter how unusual they may seem.",

As best as paleontologists can tell, the animal kingdom during that time consisted of little more than sponges and other creatures rooted to the ocean floor. But then, about 520 million years ago during the Cambrian Period, animal evolution shifted into high gear. ...and the Cambrian Period marked the beginning of a rapid diversification of animal life on Earth. This period, which lasted for about 50 million years, saw the emergence of a wide range of animal phyla, including chordates, arthropods, and mollusks.\n\nOne of the most significant developments during this time was the evolution of bilaterian animals, which possess a distinct head, tail, and bilateral body symmetry. This characteristic is shared by most animals, including humans, and is thought to have provided a selective advantage in terms of movement, feeding, and reproduction.\n\nThe fossil record from the Cambrian Period is rich in evidence of this rapid diversification. Fossils of trilobites, brachiopods, and other ancient animals have been found in abundance, providing a window into the early evolution of animal life on Earth.\n\nThe Cambrian explosion, as it is sometimes called, is still not fully understood, but scientists believe that it was triggered by a combination of factors, including changes in the Earth's oceans, the development of new ecosystems, and the evolution of key innovations, such as eyes and shells.\n\nThe discovery of fossils like Collinsium ciliosum, with its 30 limbs and 72 spikes, provides a fascinating glimpse into the early days of animal evolution.

The GalÃ¡pagos finches are probably one of the most well-known examples of evolution and will forever be tightly linked to Charles Darwin's voyage and his theory of natural selection (although you may be surprised to learn that the GalÃ¡pagos finches were not as central to Darwin's theory as we like to think). With their diversity of bill sizes and shapes, each species has adapted to a specific type of food; the ground-finch (Geospiza) has a thick beak adapted to feeding on a variety of crunchy seeds and arthropods, whereas the warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) developed a slender, pointy bill to catch tasty insects hiding between the foliage. The woodpecker finch (Camarhynchus pallidus) even uses twigs or cactus spines to pry arthropods out of treeholes. The GalÃ¡pagos finches are a testament to the incredible adaptability of life, and their unique characteristics have fascinated scientists and the general public alike for centuries. But the story of these finches is not just a fascinating tale of evolution; it is also a powerful reminder of the importance of conservation.\n\nToday, the GalÃ¡pagos Islands are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a protected area, with strict regulations in place to preserve the delicate ecosystem. However, the finches and their habitats are still facing numerous threats, including climate change, invasive species, and habitat destruction.\n\nOne of the most significant threats facing the GalÃ¡pagos finches is climate change. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are altering the availability of food and water, making it increasingly difficult for the finches to adapt and survive. In addition, climate change is also leading to an increase in invasive species, such as rats and cats, which are preying on the finches and their eggs.\n\nHabitat destruction is another major concern. The GalÃ¡pagos Islands are home to a unique and fragile ecosystem, with many species found nowhere else on Earth. However, human activities such as deforestation, mining, and tourism are leading to the destruction of habitats and the loss of biodiversity.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the GalÃ¡pagos finches and their habitats. The GalÃ¡pagos National Park and the Charles Darwin Research Station are working together to monitor the finches and their populations, as well as to develop and implement conservation plans. In addition, local communities are being involved in conservation efforts, with education and outreach programs aimed at promoting the importance of protecting the GalÃ¡pagos ecosystem.\n\nDespite these efforts, more needs to be done to protect the GalÃ¡pagos finches and their habitats. The GalÃ¡pagos Islands are a unique and irreplaceable part of our planet's biodiversity, and it is up to us to ensure their preservation for future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, the GalÃ¡pagos finches are a remarkable example of evolution and adaptation, and their story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of conservation. As we continue to face the challenges of climate change, invasive species, and habitat destruction, it is essential that we work together to protect these incredible birds and their habitats. The future of the GalÃ¡pagos finches is in our hands, and it is up to us to ensure their survival for generations to come.",

        "Text": "It was a balmy 17C in London on Friday as unseasonably warm weather persisted in large parts of the country. Wearing shorts as the clocks go back may be pleasant for most people, but it's a nightmare for clothes shops. Clothing made up less than half of Debenhams' annual sales for the first time, partly due to warm weather, and the department store group has hired BHS's former lighting buyers to help make up for falling fashion sales. On Wednesday, we'll hear from Next, which vies with Marks & Spencer to be Britain's biggest clothes retailer. It's only a month or so since Next reported its half-year results. As the UK's high street struggles to adapt to the changing retail landscape, Next is set to reveal its half-year results on Wednesday, providing a glimpse into the challenges faced by the fashion industry. With Debenhams' recent announcement that clothing sales have plummeted, the spotlight will be on Next to see how it has fared in the face of unseasonable weather and shifting consumer habits.\n\nNext, known for its mid-market pricing and reliable product range, has traditionally been a stalwart of the UK high street. However, even the most resilient retailers are not immune to the effects of warmer weather and the ongoing shift towards online shopping. With more people opting to buy clothes online and opting for more casual, comfortable attire, Next will be under pressure to demonstrate its ability to adapt to these changing trends.\n\nThe company's half-year results are likely to provide valuable insights into the current state of the fashion industry. Will Next have been able to capitalize on the warm weather, or will it have struggled to keep pace with the changing consumer habits? The answer will likely be influenced by a range of factors, including the company's online sales performance, its ability to attract and retain customers, and its product range and pricing strategy.\n\nIn recent years, Next has made significant strides in expanding its online presence, investing heavily in its e-commerce platform and introducing new services such as next-day delivery and in-store returns. However, even with this increased focus on online shopping, Next still relies heavily on its physical stores, which will be crucial in attracting customers and driving sales during the crucial autumn and winter seasons.\n\nAs the UK's high street continues to evolve, Next's half-year results will provide a vital snapshot of the fashion industry's current state. With Debenhams' struggles serving as a warning to the sector, Next will be under pressure to demonstrate its ability to adapt to the changing retail landscape and maintain its position as one of the UK's leading fashion retailers.",

He is seeking exemplary damages in the high court, arguing that Facebook failed to prevent or swiftly remove false advertising that has both tarnished his reputation and lured unwitting victims into costly scams. Lewis said he would not profit from any damages won, which he would donate to charities combating fraud, but that he hoped the action would prompt the site to stamp out scam adverts. The TV presenter, who founded the consumer site MoneySavingExpert.com, said vulnerable people were targeted with adverts for \"get rich quick\" schemes with titles such as Bitcoin Code or Cloud Trader that were operating as fronts for binary trading firms based outside the EU. On one occasion, Lewis said, a woman had spent Â£100,000 in \"a binary trading nightmare\" that had attached his name to its advertising. The woman was eventually able to recover her money, as she had paid by card. Lewis said: \"I get about five messages a day from people saying, 'I've just seen your Bitcoin ad and wanted to check it.' Lewis's decision to take legal action against Facebook comes after months of frustration with the social media giant's inability to effectively address the issue. Despite numerous complaints and reports of fake adverts featuring his name and image, Lewis claims that Facebook failed to take adequate action to remove them.\n\n\"I've been trying to get Facebook to take this seriously for months, but they just haven't done enough,\" Lewis said in an interview. \"They've been saying they're doing something about it, but it's just not happening. I've had to take matters into my own hands.\"\n\nLewis's lawsuit is the latest in a string of high-profile cases against Facebook over its handling of fake adverts. In recent years, the company has faced criticism for its failure to prevent the spread of misinformation and scams on its platform.\n\nThe case is also significant because it highlights the vulnerability of Facebook's advertising system to fraud and manipulation. Lewis claims that the fake adverts were created using sophisticated software that allowed scammers to target vulnerable individuals with personalized messages.\n\n\"These adverts are designed to look like they're coming from me, and they're using my name and image to make them seem legitimate,\" Lewis said. \"But they're just fronts for scams. It's a classic case of 'if it looks too good to be true, it probably is'.\"\n\nLewis's lawsuit is seeking exemplary damages, which would serve as a warning to Facebook and other social media companies to take more responsibility for policing their platforms. He hopes that the case will prompt Facebook to take more action to prevent the spread of fake adverts and protect its users from scams.\n\n\"I'm not doing this for myself,\" Lewis said. \"I'm doing it for the people who are being scammed and ripped off. I want Facebook to take responsibility for its role in allowing these scams to happen.\"\n\nThe case is set to be heard in the high court in the coming months, and Lewis is confident that he will win. He believes that the evidence is on his side, and that Facebook's failure to prevent the spread of fake adverts is a clear case of negligence.\n\n\"I'm not looking for a payday,\" Lewis said. \"I'm looking for justice. I want Facebook to know that it can't just ignore these issues and expect to get away with it. I want them to take responsibility for their actions and do something to stop these scams from happening in the future.\"",

But The Durrells, a fun mix of gorgeous locations, four badly behaved kidults and an odd menagerie of animals, is proving a success for the broadcaster which has been searching for a Sunday night hit since Downton Abbey came to an end in December. Based on Gerald Durrell's Corfu trilogy, the drama starring Keeley Hawes as the whimsical widow fleeing a prewar Britain for the sunny Mediterranean is attracting an average audience of 5.9 million viewers on a Sunday night, nearly 2 million more than the channel's average. The series has also been a boon for sales of the the naturalist's books. Waterstones said sales of My Family and Other Animals, the first of the Corfu trilogy, had more than tripled, while sales of the trilogy had increased eight-fold. Publisher Penguin Random House said it had seen an \"incredible uplift\" across all three editions of My Family and Other Animals. \"In our experience, successful book adaptations for TV and cinema often lead to a renewed interest in the original book,\" said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones' non-fiction buyer. \"It is an amazing result and a testament to the brilliance and longevity of Durrell's writing.\" The show's success can be attributed to its unique blend of humor, drama, and stunning scenery, which has captured the hearts of audiences across the UK. The Durrells' eccentric characters, including Louisa's (Keeley Hawes) four children, Larry (Alex Jennings), Leslie (Tom Glynn-Carney), Margo (Daisy Waterstone), and Gerry (Milo Parker), are lovable and relatable, making it easy for viewers to become invested in their stories.\n\nThe show's creator, Simon Nye, has said that he aimed to bring the Durrells' stories to life in a way that would appeal to a modern audience. \"I wanted to create a show that would capture the essence of Gerald Durrell's writing, which is full of humor, wit, and warmth,\" Nye explained. \"The Durrells are a family that is full of quirks and flaws, but they are also incredibly loving and supportive of each other. I think that's something that audiences can really relate to.\"\n\nThe show's popularity has also been boosted by its stunning locations, which were filmed on the Greek island of Corfu. The picturesque landscapes and charming villages have provided a beautiful backdrop for the Durrells' adventures, and have helped to transport viewers to a bygone era.\n\nIn addition to its on-screen success, The Durrells has also had a significant impact on book sales. The show's popularity has led to a surge in demand for Gerald Durrell's books, with many viewers seeking out the original novels to learn more about the Durrell family's adventures on Corfu. The show's success has also sparked renewed interest in Gerald Durrell's work as a naturalist and conservationist, with many viewers learning about his efforts to protect endangered species and preserve the natural world.\n\nOverall, The Durrells is a heartwarming and entertaining show that has captured the hearts of audiences across the UK. Its unique blend of humor, drama, and stunning scenery has made it a Sunday night staple, and its success is a testament to the enduring appeal of Gerald Durrell's writing.",

        "Text": "A long, hard look at the way the Bank of England has conducted monetary policy since 2008 is long overdue so the announcement by the Treasury select committee that it is launching an inquiry into ultra-low interest rates, quantitative easing and forward guidance is welcome. It is worth recalling that when Threadneedle Street slashed the cost of borrowing to 0.5% and began using asset purchases to print money both were seen as temporary measures to deal with an immediate crisis. The UK economy is no longer collapsing as it was during the winter of 2008-09 but unconventional monetary policy has become a permanent fixture. Indeed, the aftermath of the Brexit vote saw the Bank cut interest rates still further to 0.25% and increase the size of its QE programme. The measures taken during the slump were appropriate at the time. Low interest rates were designed to reduce borrowing costs for companies and individuals, and to persuade them to spend rather than save. However, the question remains whether these measures are still necessary and effective in today's economic climate. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has maintained its stance of keeping interest rates low, citing concerns over the impact of Brexit on the economy. But some economists argue that the prolonged period of low interest rates has led to a surge in asset prices, particularly in the housing market, and has created an environment where savers are being penalized.\n\nMoreover, the Bank's use of quantitative easing has also been criticized for its limited effectiveness in stimulating economic growth. While it has helped to boost the stock market and improve the financial health of banks, it has done little to increase lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the backbone of the UK economy. In fact, a recent report by the Federation of Small Businesses found that 60% of SMEs are struggling to access credit, highlighting the need for more targeted measures to support businesses.\n\nThe Treasury select committee's inquiry is timely, as it will provide an opportunity for policymakers to re-examine the Bank's monetary policy framework and consider alternative approaches. One option could be to adopt a more flexible approach to monetary policy, taking into account the specific needs of different sectors of the economy. For example, the Bank could use targeted measures to support SMEs, such as increasing lending to these businesses or providing more favorable loan terms.\n\nAnother option could be to explore the use of alternative monetary policy tools, such as negative interest rates or helicopter money. While these measures have been used in other countries, they are still untested in the UK and would require careful consideration of their potential impact on the economy.\n\nUltimately, the Treasury select committee's inquiry is an important step towards ensuring that the Bank of England's monetary policy is effective and sustainable in the long term. By re-examining its approach and considering alternative options, policymakers can help to promote a more balanced and sustainable economic recovery.",

The correspondent, Jesse Watters, who has been accused of stalking and harassment for his ambush-style interviews on the street, expressed \"regret\" late Wednesday after provoking a storm of criticism for the segment that was broadcast on Monday. Fox broadcast the interviews as part of \"Watters' World,\" a recurring segment on \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" the network's top-rated show. The host, Bill O'Reilly, introduced the piece by saying it had been inspired by how frequently China was mentioned during the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. But the nearly five-minute video was interspersed with references to martial arts and scenes of Mr. Watters getting a foot massage, playing with nunchucks and asking loaded questions that some residents appeared not to understand or couldn't answer. Clips from well-known movies were sprinkled throughout the segment, including \"The Karate Kid\" and \"Chinatown.\" Mr. Watters begins the piece with an instrumental version of the Carl Douglas song \"Kung Fu Fighting\" playing softly in the background. He asks two young women, \"Am I supposed to bow to say hello?\" He asks a street vendor if his wares were stolen: \"I like these watches -- are they hot?\" The protest, which drew a crowd of around 200 people, included chants of \"Fox News, shame on you!\" and \"Racism has no place on TV!\" Many of the protesters held signs reading \"Stop Asian Hate\" and \"Respect Asian-Americans.\" The event was organized by a coalition of local community groups, including the Asian American Federation and the Chinese-American Planning Council.\n\nThe protesters demanded an apology from Fox News and called for the network to take concrete steps to address the issue of racism and stereotyping in their reporting. \"This segment was not just offensive, it was harmful,\" said Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian American Federation. \"It perpetuated harmful stereotypes and reinforced negative attitudes towards Asian-Americans. We demand better from our media outlets.\"\n\nThe protest was peaceful, with police presence minimal. However, tensions did rise when a group of counter-protesters, who identified themselves as supporters of Fox News, appeared at the scene. The two groups faced off, with some shouting insults at each other, but no physical altercations occurred.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the segment has sparked widespread outrage on social media, with many calling for Fox News to fire Jesse Watters. The network has faced criticism in the past for its handling of racial and ethnic issues, and this incident has reignited concerns about its commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn a statement, Fox News said that Watters' segment was intended to be a lighthearted and humorous look at the cultural differences between China and the United States. However, many have argued that the segment was in poor taste and perpetuated harmful stereotypes.\n\nThe incident has also sparked a debate about the role of media in perpetuating racism and stereotyping. \"This is a classic example of how media can shape our perceptions and attitudes towards certain groups,\" said Dr. Lisa Lowe, a professor of Asian American studies at New York University. \"It's crucial that we hold our media outlets accountable for their actions and demand better representation and coverage of diverse communities.\"\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, many are calling for a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to reporting on cultural and ethnic issues. \"We need to move beyond stereotypes and caricatures and focus on the real stories and experiences of Asian-Americans,\" said Fung. \"It's time for Fox News to take responsibility and do better.\"",

Reports emerged last week that the company had implemented a series of gradual price increases inflating the price of the drug from $56.64 to $317.82, a 461% increase in cost since Mylan acquired the rights to EpiPen in 2007. During that same time, Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan, saw her pay rise $2,453,456 to $18,931,068, a 671% increase. Last week, she sold 100,200 of her shares in the company for more than $5m. \"The EpiPen auto-injector delivers a life-saving dose of epinephrine to patients suffering from anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock can lead to serious injury or death if untreated; thus, making sure the EpiPen is readily available for use is a critical part of life for millions of Americans living with severe allergies,\" the Democratic senators wrote in the eight-page letter addressed to Bresch. The senators' letter highlighted the devastating impact of the price hike on patients and families, particularly those who rely on the life-saving medication. \"As you know, many patients and families are struggling to afford the medication, and some have had to make impossible choices between paying for EpiPen and paying for other essential medications,\" the letter stated.\n\nThe senators also expressed concern over Mylan's business practices, citing reports of the company's aggressive marketing tactics and its use of \"pay-for-delay\" agreements with generic drug manufacturers to block cheaper alternatives from entering the market.\n\nIn response to the letter, Mylan released a statement defending its pricing strategy, claiming that the company has invested heavily in research and development to improve the EpiPen product and has worked to increase access to the medication through various programs and partnerships.\n\nHowever, the senators were unimpressed, arguing that the company's profits have increased significantly while patients are forced to pay exorbitant prices for the medication. \"Mylan's actions are a clear example of price gouging, and we urge the company to take immediate action to reduce the price of EpiPen to a reasonable level,\" the letter concluded.\n\nThe controversy surrounding EpiPen has sparked a national conversation about the high cost of prescription medications and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical industry. As the debate continues to unfold, patients and families affected by the price hike are left wondering how they will afford the medication they need to stay alive.\n\nIn the meantime, Mylan's stock price has taken a hit, with shares falling by over 10% in the wake of the senators' letter. The company's CEO, Heather Bresch, has also faced intense scrutiny, with many calling for her resignation.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the EpiPen price hike has exposed a deep-seated problem in the pharmaceutical industry, and it will take a concerted effort from policymakers, patients, and industry leaders to find a solution.",

In that time everyone from Rupert Murdoch to Kerry Packer to Paul Keating has wanted to kill Fairfax, with varying success. In the end the bullet came in the form of a cold statement from company's chief executive, Greg Hywood, on a winter morning in July 2018. \"The merged company will be called Nine,\" he said. \"I would like to thank everyone for their contribution to Fairfax.\" But long before Hywood, before Gina Rinehart and before young Warwick Fairfax's doomed takeover in the 1980s, the company was a family operation. The Herald was the dominant publication in the young Sydney colony, and by 1853 the Fairfax family was its sole owner. As the years went by, the Fairfax family continued to expand their media empire, establishing new newspapers and publications across Australia. In 1888, John Fairfax's grandson, John Thomas Fairfax, became the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, and under his leadership, the paper became known for its investigative journalism and in-depth reporting.\n\nThe Fairfax family's commitment to quality journalism was further solidified by John Thomas's son, Sir Warwick Fairfax, who took over as chairman of the company in 1930. Sir Warwick was a strong advocate for the importance of a free press and was instrumental in shaping the company's editorial policies.\n\nIn the post-war period, the Fairfax family continued to expand their media interests, establishing new newspapers and magazines, as well as investing in radio and television broadcasting. In 1957, the company launched its first television station, ATN-7, which became a major player in the Australian television market.\n\nHowever, the Fairfax family's dominance of the Australian media landscape was not without its challenges. In the 1980s, the company faced increased competition from new entrants, including the wealthy businessman, Kerry Packer, who launched his own newspaper, the Australian, in 1964.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Fairfax family remained committed to their media empire, and in 1990, Warwick Fairfax Jr., the great-great-grandson of John Fairfax, became the company's chairman. Under his leadership, the company continued to evolve, embracing new technologies and expanding its online presence.\n\nHowever, in 2018, the Fairfax family's 177-year reign over the company came to an end. The company's board announced that it would merge with the Nine Network, a major Australian television network, to form a new company, Nine Entertainment Co. The merged company would be led by Greg Hywood, who had previously served as the CEO of Fairfax.\n\nThe merger marked the end of an era for the Fairfax family, who had played a significant role in shaping Australian history and culture.

The chancellor's decision to postpone the biggest fiscal event of the year prompted speculation that the government planned to announce pre-election tax cuts without the plans being scrutinised by the OBR.

        "Text": "Dozens of radio stations across the UK are to lose almost all of their local programming in a move likely to result in hundreds of job losses, the closure of dedicated radio studios and regional voices being replaced by programmes hosted from London. Global Radio has announced that it will replace the 40-plus local breakfast shows across its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three nationwide programmes. The changes, which will be brought in during the course of this year, are likely to result in presenters and producers across the country finding they are being replaced by big names based far away from the communities they serve. The number of regional drivetime shows on Capital, Smooth and Heart will also be substantially reduced and all locally produced evening and weekend programmes will be axed. Local journalists, engineers and marketing staff are expected to be affected by job cuts. Global will close 10 of its 24 dedicated radio studios â€“ in Brighton, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon â€“ in a blow to the media industry outside the capital. The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said the job losses were a \"travesty\" and \"particularly damaging at a time when local news is already under extreme pressure\". \"Replacing local voices with London-based presenters will be a terrible loss to communities across the country. The decision to centralize programming has been met with widespread criticism from industry experts, politicians, and listeners alike. Many have expressed concern that the loss of local content will result in a homogenized radio experience, lacking the unique character and connection to the community that local programming provides.\n\n\"This is a devastating blow to the radio industry and the communities it serves,\" said Sarah Jones, a radio presenter at Capital FM's Cambridge studio. \"We've built relationships with our listeners over the years, and it's heartbreaking to think that we'll no longer be able to share their stories and connect with them on a local level.\"\n\nThe move is also seen as a significant blow to local journalism, with many stations relying on local reporters to provide news and information to their listeners. The loss of these reporters will likely leave communities without a dedicated source of local news and information.\n\n\"This is a dark day for local journalism,\" said James Thompson, a local journalist who has worked for several radio stations across the UK. \"The loss of local reporting will have a profound impact on the way communities are informed and engaged. It's a tragedy that we're losing this vital part of our media landscape.\"\n\nGlobal Radio has argued that the changes are necessary to improve efficiency and reduce costs, but critics argue that the company is sacrificing the very thing that sets it apart from other radio networks.\n\n\"This is not about improving efficiency or reducing costs, it's about sacrificing the soul of the radio industry,\" said Tom Watson, shadow culture secretary. \"Local radio is not just about the music or the presenters, it's about the community and the connections that are made. By replacing local voices with London-based presenters, Global Radio is erasing the very thing that makes radio special.\"\n\nThe news has also sparked concerns about the impact on small businesses and local economies that rely on radio advertising. Many small businesses have reported that radio advertising is a vital part of their marketing strategy, and the loss of local programming will likely result in a significant decrease in ad revenue.\n\n\"This is a disaster for small businesses and local economies,\" said Emma Taylor, owner of a local independent record store. \"Radio advertising is a vital part of our marketing strategy, and the loss of local programming will likely result in a significant decrease in ad revenue. It's a shame that Global Radio is prioritizing profits over people and communities.\"\n\nAs the changes take effect, many are left wondering what the future holds for local radio and the communities it serves. One thing is certain, however â€“ the loss of local programming will have a profound impact on the way we experience radio and the way we connect with our communities.",

        "Text": "The Greek Parliament voted late Tuesday in Athens to back a hugely unpopular property tax, one of a series of new austerity measures. The vote could clear the way for a crucial injection of international financing meant to at least temporarily stave off a default on government debt. The property tax, the first of its type in Greece, would raise 2 billion euros, or $2.7 billion, this year alone, according to government calculations. The question is whether enough Greek people can or will pay the tax to meet those forecasts. \"I know that a lot is being asked of the Greek people,\" the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Tuesday in Berlin during a joint news conference with the Greek prime minister, George A. Papandreou. The Greek Parliament's approval of the property tax, known as the \"ENFIA\" (Unified Real Estate Property Tax), has sparked widespread protests and concerns about the government's ability to collect the revenue. Many Greeks are already struggling with high unemployment rates and reduced incomes, making the new tax a heavy burden.\n\nThe government has argued that the tax is necessary to help plug a massive budget gap and reduce the country's debt, which has ballooned to over 160% of its GDP. However, critics argue that the tax is unfair and will disproportionately affect low-income households and small businesses.\n\nThe property tax is part of a broader package of austerity measures aimed at reducing Greece's budget deficit and gaining the trust of international creditors. The measures also include cuts to public sector wages and pensions, as well as increased taxes on fuel and tobacco products.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the property tax, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have welcomed the Greek Parliament's decision. The EU and IMF have pledged to provide Greece with a new bailout package worth up to â‚¬130 billion, provided the country implements the austerity measures and reforms.\n\nHowever, the success of the property tax depends on whether Greeks can afford to pay it. Many are already struggling to make ends meet, and the new tax could push them further into poverty. The Greek government has promised to provide relief to low-income households, but the details of the plan remain unclear.\n\nThe European Union and the IMF have also expressed concerns about the Greek government's ability to collect the revenue. The EU's economic affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, warned that the government must \"show a clear commitment to implementing the agreed reforms and to collecting the revenue\" in order to receive the bailout package.\n\nThe Greek government has vowed to implement the property tax and other austerity measures, despite the opposition from many Greeks. The prime minister, George Papandreou, has said that the measures are necessary to ensure Greece's economic stability and prevent a default on its debt.\n\nThe vote on the property tax is just the latest in a series of challenges facing the Greek government. The country's economy has been in crisis since 2009, and the government has been struggling to implement reforms and reduce its debt. The new bailout package and the property tax are seen as critical steps towards stabilizing the economy and avoiding a default.\n\nAs the Greek government works to implement the property tax and other austerity measures, the country's people are bracing themselves for the impact. Many are worried about the effects on their livelihoods and the future of the country. The debate over the property tax is just beginning, and its outcome will have significant implications for Greece's economy and its people.",

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple exceeded Wall Street's expectations for revenue and profits for its most recent quarter, as strong sales of Macs and digital services offset flat sales of iPhones while consumers wait for new models to be released in the fall. The strong results eased Wall Street's fears that consumers were pulling back from Apple's products, particularly its flagship, the iPhone. Apple said little about the upcoming phones and declined to address reports of production delays with a new high-end model, which is expected to feature an edge-to-edge screen and is expected to cost more than $1,000. The company's revenue projections for the quarter ending in September spanned a wide range, suggesting that executives are hedging on the exact timing of the iPhone update. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, addressed Apple's decision over the weekend to remove dozens of unlicensed virtual private networking apps that allowed Chinese consumers to access the entire internet and evade government censors. \"We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business,\" Mr. Cook said during a conference call with analysts to discuss the results. The tech giant's quarterly earnings report showed a significant boost in revenue, with net income reaching $22.2 billion, a 12% increase from the same period last year. Apple's revenue also exceeded expectations, reaching $53.8 billion, a 1% increase from the same period last year.\n\nThe strong performance was driven by sales of Macs, which saw a 14% increase in revenue, and digital services, including the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, which grew 20% year-over-year. The company's services segment, which includes the aforementioned digital services, as well as Apple Pay and Apple Care, accounted for 21% of Apple's total revenue.\n\nDespite the strong overall performance, the iPhone sales were a major concern for investors. Apple sold 41.7 million iPhones during the quarter, a 1% decrease from the same period last year. The decline was attributed to consumers waiting for the release of new iPhone models, which are expected to feature improved cameras, processors, and new designs.\n\nThe company's guidance for the next quarter was also closely watched by investors, with Apple forecasting revenue between $52 billion and $58 billion. The wide range of the forecast suggests that executives are uncertain about the timing of the iPhone update and its impact on sales.\n\nThe removal of the VPN apps, which allowed Chinese consumers to access the internet and evade government censors, was also a major topic of discussion during the conference call. Apple's decision to comply with Chinese laws has raised concerns among human rights groups and some investors, who argue that the company is compromising its values by removing the apps.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Cook emphasized that Apple's decision was driven by its commitment to following the law in all countries where it operates. \"We are not taking a stance on the political situation in China,\" Cook said. \"We are simply following the laws and regulations of the countries where we do business.\"\n\nThe company's decision to remove the VPN apps has sparked a heated debate about the role of technology companies in China and their responsibility to protect users' rights. Apple's decision has also raised questions about the company's commitment to free speech and online privacy.\n\nDespite the controversy, Apple's strong quarterly results have eased concerns about the company's ability to maintain its dominance in the tech industry. The company's focus on services and its ability to adapt to changing consumer habits have positioned it for long-term success, despite the challenges it faces in China.\n\nAs Apple prepares to release new iPhone models later this year, investors will be closely watching the company's ability to balance its commitment to innovation with its responsibility to comply with laws and regulations in countries where it operates. The company's quarterly results demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and its commitment to delivering value to its customers.",

The SpaceX and Tesla CEO has been mulling the idea since December, when he revealed his frustrations with congestion in the city. \"Traffic is driving me nuts. Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging,\" he said on Twitter. \"It shall be called The Boring Company,\" he added. \"Boring, it's what we do.\" At the time it wasn't clear whether he was joking, but today's announcement suggested he was not. According to sources within the city planning department, Musk's plans to begin construction on the tunnel without proper permits are not only premature but also potentially illegal. \"We understand the frustration with traffic in Los Angeles, but our city's infrastructure cannot be bypassed by individual entrepreneurs, no matter how well-known or influential they may be,\" said a spokesperson for the department.\n\nMusk's announcement has sparked a heated debate among Angelenos, with some hailing his innovative approach as a potential game-changer for the city's notorious traffic woes, while others are expressing concerns about the safety and environmental impact of such a massive project.\n\nThe proposed tunnel, which would stretch for several miles beneath the city, is intended to reduce traffic congestion by providing a faster and more efficient route for commuters. However, critics argue that the project would require significant infrastructure upgrades, including the installation of ventilation systems, emergency exits, and advanced safety features.\n\nAdditionally, environmental groups are sounding the alarm about the potential disruption to local ecosystems and the potential for noise pollution. \"We understand that Elon Musk is trying to solve a pressing problem, but we cannot let our city's natural habitats be sacrificed for the sake of convenience,\" said a representative from the Los Angeles Environmental Coalition.\n\nDespite the controversy, Musk remains undeterred, tweeting yesterday that he is \"confident\" that his plan will \"work out\" and that he will \"make it happen.\" However, city officials are urging caution, emphasizing that any major infrastructure project must undergo rigorous planning, permitting, and public review before breaking ground.\n\nAs the debate continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Los Angeles is in dire need of a solution to its traffic congestion. With the city's population projected to continue growing, finding a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to its transportation woes is more pressing than ever. Whether Elon Musk's tunnel plan is the answer remains to be seen, but one thing is certain â€“ the city will be watching closely as this story continues to unfold.",

Martin, a single mother of two who comes from a further education background, convincingly saw off challenges from two rival candidates, winning in the first round of voting during elections at the NUS annual conference in Glasgow on Wednesday. The left had hoped to gain support on the back of a surge in student activism and a series of occupations in support of striking university staff, but in the end their candidate Sahaya James, a member of Momentum's national executive, gained just 15% of the vote. James, campaigns officer at the student union of the University of the Arts London, was beaten to second place by Momin Saqib, the president of King's College London students' union, who won 24.3% of the vote. Martin, formerly a student at Lewisham Southwark College in south London, has consistently positioned herself as a pragmatic and centrist candidate, which saw her to victory last year when she stood against the incumbent president Malia Bouattia, whose term was mired in allegations of antisemitism. Saqib, who has been vocal about the need for greater student representation in university decision-making, has pledged to work closely with Martin to address the concerns of students across the country. Despite his strong showing, Saqib acknowledged that Martin's centrist platform resonated with many voters, and he expressed his respect for her victory.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Martin emphasized her commitment to continuing to work with students, universities, and government to address the pressing issues facing the student community. She highlighted the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to student politics, acknowledging the need for both activism and cooperation to achieve meaningful change.\n\nThe election result is seen as a significant victory for Martin, who has faced criticism from some quarters for her perceived lack of radicalism. However, her supporters argue that her pragmatic approach has allowed her to build bridges between different factions within the student movement and to secure funding and support for NUS initiatives.\n\nThe outcome of the election is also significant for the left, which had hoped to capitalize on the surge in student activism and the occupations in support of striking university staff. While James's campaign gained some momentum in the run-up to the election, ultimately, her message of radical change failed to resonate with a majority of voters.\n\nThe result is likely to have significant implications for the future direction of the NUS, with some predicting that Martin's victory will lead to a more moderate and consensus-driven approach to student politics. Others, however, argue that the election result will embolden the left to continue pushing for more radical change and greater student involvement in decision-making processes.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, Martin will face significant challenges as she seeks to build on her victory and to deliver on her campaign promises. With student fees and funding cuts continuing to be major concerns for many students, Martin will need to work closely with universities, government, and other stakeholders to find solutions that benefit the student community as a whole.\n\nAs she begins her second term as NUS president, Martin has vowed to continue to listen to the concerns of students and to work tirelessly to represent their interests. With her pragmatic approach and commitment to cooperation, she is well-placed to build on her success and to lead the NUS into a new era of student activism and advocacy.",

The conjectures of Dr. Langlands, now 81 and an emeritus professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., have proven fertile ground for mathematical advances in the past half-century. And although his suppositions remain far from fully proven, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters announced on Tuesday that Dr. Langlands was this year's winner of the Abel Prize, which many view as a Nobel Prize of mathematics. \"He's a visionary,\" said Sun-Yung Alice Chang, a mathematician at Princeton University who served on the five-member prize committee. The panel reviewed more than 100 candidates before selecting Dr. Langlands, Dr. Chang said. There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics. The Abel Prize, established in 2002, is awarded annually to recognize outstanding contributions to the field of mathematics. The prize is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who is known for his work in algebra and number theory. Dr. Langlands' work, which spans over five decades, has had a profound impact on various areas of mathematics, including number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory.\n\nDr. Langlands' conjectures, known as the Langlands Program, aim to establish a connection between number theory and algebraic geometry. The program proposes that certain types of mathematical objects, known as automorphic forms, can be used to study the properties of numbers and algebraic curves. While the program is still incomplete, it has already led to significant advances in many areas of mathematics and has opened up new avenues for research.\n\nThe Abel Prize committee praised Dr. Langlands for his pioneering work in the Langlands Program, which has inspired a generation of mathematicians and has led to numerous breakthroughs in the field. Dr. Chang, a member of the prize committee, noted that Dr. Langlands' work has been instrumental in shaping the direction of mathematics in the past half-century.\n\nDr. Langlands' win is also a testament to the power of interdisciplinary research. His work has drawn on insights from physics, computer science, and philosophy, as well as mathematics, to tackle some of the most fundamental questions in the field.\n\nThe Abel Prize is not the first honor bestowed upon Dr. Langlands. He was awarded the Fields Medal, often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of mathematics,\" in 1978, and has received numerous other awards and honors for his contributions to mathematics.\n\nIn a statement, Dr. Langlands expressed his gratitude to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters for the award, saying that it was \"a great honor\" to receive the prize. He also acknowledged the contributions of his colleagues and students, who have worked alongside him to advance the Langlands Program.\n\nDr. Langlands' win is expected to inspire a new generation of mathematicians to pursue research in the Langlands Program and other areas of mathematics. As Dr. Chang noted, \"Dr. Langlands is a true giant in the field of mathematics, and his work will continue to shape the direction of the field for years to come.\"",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- When Federal Reserve officials convened just before the presidential election, they talked like people who were ready to raise interest rates, although they decided to wait a little longer. They fretted about the growing risks of keeping borrowing costs at a historically low level, according to an account of the meeting that the Fed published on Wednesday. They also expressed confidence, albeit with some reservations, that the economy was ready for higher rates. The exuberant reaction of financial markets to Donald J. Trump's victory has strengthened the case for higher rates, and solidified expectations that the Fed will act at its next meeting in December. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes, released on Wednesday, provided insight into the central bank's deliberations in November, just days before the presidential election. The minutes revealed that Fed officials were increasingly concerned about the potential risks of prolonged low interest rates, which have been in place since 2008.\n\nDespite their reservations, the committee ultimately decided to delay a rate hike, citing uncertainty surrounding the election outcome and the potential impact on the economy. However, the minutes suggested that many officials believed the economy was strong enough to withstand higher borrowing costs.\n\nThe post-election market reaction, which saw stocks surge and bond yields rise, has only strengthened the case for a rate hike. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for borrowing costs, has risen by nearly 0.5 percentage points since the election, indicating increased investor confidence in the economy.\n\nThe Fed's decision to raise rates in December is now widely expected by economists and investors. A rate hike would be the first since December 2015, and would mark a significant shift in the central bank's monetary policy stance.\n\n\"The Fed is likely to raise rates in December, given the improving labor market and the recent pickup in inflation,\" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. \"The election outcome has removed some of the uncertainty that was weighing on the economy, and the Fed is likely to take advantage of that.\"\n\nThe Fed's decision will be closely watched by markets, as it will provide insight into the central bank's views on the economy and its willingness to support growth through monetary policy. A rate hike would likely have a mixed impact on the economy, with some sectors benefiting from higher borrowing costs and others, such as housing and consumer spending, potentially suffering.\n\nThe minutes from the November meeting also highlighted the Fed's concerns about the growing wealth gap in the United States. Officials noted that the increasing concentration of wealth among the top 1% of earners could lead to reduced consumer spending and economic growth.\n\nThe Fed's decision to raise rates in December is likely to be influenced by these concerns, as well as the overall strength of the economy. The central bank will also be closely monitoring inflation, which has remained below its 2% target for several years.\n\nIn conclusion, the Fed's November meeting minutes suggest that officials are increasingly confident in the economy's ability to withstand higher borrowing costs, and that a rate hike in December is likely. The decision will be closely watched by markets, and will provide insight into the central bank's views on the economy and its willingness to support growth through monetary policy.",

        "Text": "ATHENS -- Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece seized on new economic data on Saturday that indicated the country was on track to economic recovery and promised relief to Greeks weary of years of punishing austerity. \"Greece is turning the page,\" Mr. Samaras told politicians and entrepreneurs at an annual international trade fair in the northern port of Thessaloniki, traditionally used by Greek prime ministers to outline their government's economic policy for the coming year. \"There will be no more austerity measures,\" he said. Citing figures released on Friday by the national statistics agency, Mr. Samaras said the Greek economy shrank 3.8 percent in the second quarter, significantly less than an estimate of 4.6 percent. It was the smallest contraction since 2010, when Greece signed its first multibillion-euro loan deal with its so-called troika of creditors -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. The improvement is largely the result of an unexpectedly strong rebound in the country's crucial tourism sector, with a record 18 million foreign visitors expected this year, he said. Equally encouraging are early indications that the country will achieve this year a primary surplus -- a budget surplus not counting debt financing, Mr. Samaras said. The prime minister's optimistic assessment was met with cautious optimism from economists and business leaders, who noted that while the data was encouraging, Greece still faced significant challenges in its recovery. \"The tourism sector has been a bright spot, but we need to see sustained growth in other areas, such as manufacturing and construction, to truly say that Greece is on the path to recovery,\" said Maria Katsiouli, an economist at the University of Athens.\n\nDespite the challenges, the government's announcement was welcomed by many Greeks, who have endured years of austerity measures that have cut into their standard of living. \"It's about time we saw some relief,\" said Evangelos Papadopoulos, a small business owner in Thessaloniki. \"We've been making sacrifices for so long, it's only fair that we get to enjoy some of the benefits.\"\n\nThe government's plans to eliminate austerity measures are expected to be outlined in more detail in the coming weeks, as part of the 2019 budget. Mr. Samaras has promised to focus on stimulating economic growth, rather than simply cutting costs. This shift in strategy is seen as a key step towards reducing Greece's debt burden, which currently stands at over 180 billion euros.\n\nThe country's creditors, the troika of the European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund, have also welcomed the news. \"We are encouraged by the progress Greece has made in recent months,\" said a spokesperson for the troika. \"We will continue to work closely with the government to ensure that its economic reforms are implemented effectively and that the country remains on a sustainable path.\"\n\nAs Greece looks to the future, there are still many uncertainties. The country's debt remains a significant burden, and the government will need to navigate a complex web of international agreements and national politics to achieve its goals. However, for the first time in years, there is a sense of optimism in the air, and many Greeks are cautiously hopeful that their country is finally turning a corner.",

        "Text": "How is the Bank of England's \"reflecting diversity, choosing inclusion\" mission going? Let's remind ourselves of the ambition as it applies to gender diversity: a tripling of the proportion of women in senior roles to 35% by 2020. Thursday was not a good day. From a shortlist comprising four women and one man, the man got the gig to be the next member of the high-profile monetary policy committee To be fair to the Bank, it played no role: the chancellor, Philip Hammond, made the appointment. It is possible that Mark Carney, who often points out that he is the 120th in an unbroken line of male governors, is privately tearing his hair out. To be fair also to Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, he was a perfectly decent candidate; his expertise in productivity could be useful in the current climate. Yet this feels like a huge missed opportunity by the Treasury, whatever it says about how it contacted 44 women to apply for the post. The lack of representation on the monetary policy committee is a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle for gender diversity in the financial sector. Despite the Bank of England's ambitious goal to triple the proportion of women in senior roles, the recent appointment sends a mixed message. While the Bank itself did not make the decision, it is clear that the Treasury's approach to the selection process fell short of the mark.\n\nThe appointment of Jonathan Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, may have been a well-qualified one, but it does little to address the glaring lack of female representation on the committee. The fact that only 44 women were contacted to apply for the post raises concerns about the pool of potential candidates and the barriers that may exist for women to pursue careers in economics and finance.\n\nThis missed opportunity is not just a matter of representation, but also of economic and social progress. Research has shown that diverse teams and organizations are more innovative, productive, and better equipped to make informed decisions. The lack of women in senior roles in the financial sector means that important decisions are being made without the benefit of diverse perspectives and experiences.\n\nThe Bank of England's \"reflecting diversity, choosing inclusion\" mission is not just a nice-sounding slogan, but a critical imperative for the institution's long-term success. The recent appointment is a reminder that words must be backed up by actions, and that the Bank and the Treasury must work together to create a more inclusive and diverse environment.\n\nIn the short term, the Bank of England may need to re-examine its approach to selecting candidates for senior roles, ensuring that a more diverse pool of applicants is contacted and considered. In the long term, the institution must work to create a culture that values diversity and inclusion, providing opportunities for women and underrepresented groups to develop their skills and advance their careers.\n\nUltimately, the lack of representation on the monetary policy committee is a missed opportunity not just for the Bank of England, but for the entire financial sector. It is a reminder that the struggle for gender diversity is far from over, and that continued effort and commitment are required to achieve meaningful progress.",

        "Text": "Oxford and Cambridge universities have failed to recognise potential among disadvantaged applicants and need to improve their efforts, according to the government's higher education access tsar. In outspoken remarks at an education conference, Les Ebdon, director of the Office for Fair Access (Offa), said: \"Do I think there's fair access at Oxbridge? Well, obviously not.\" Ebdon also criticised the two elite universities for failing to systematically use data on applicants' backgrounds rather than relying on high entry requirements. Ebdon's comments come as part of a wider push by the government to increase diversity and inclusion in higher education. The Office for Fair Access, which Ebdon heads, is responsible for ensuring that universities take steps to improve access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThe director's criticism of Oxford and Cambridge is particularly noteworthy, given the universities' long-standing reputation for attracting students from well-off families. According to data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, in 2019, Oxford University accepted just 4.3% of applicants from the 20% most disadvantaged areas in the country, compared to 24.5% of applicants from the 20% most affluent areas.\n\nCambridge University's figures are similarly stark, with 5.2% of applicants from the most disadvantaged areas accepted, compared to 27.1% of applicants from the most affluent areas.\n\nEbdon's comments have been met with widespread support from education experts and campaigners, who argue that the two universities need to take a more proactive approach to attracting students from diverse backgrounds.\n\n\"We need to see a sea change in the way that Oxford and Cambridge approach access and inclusion,\" said Dr. Rachel Hewitt, a lecturer in education at the University of York. \"The current system is simply not working, and it's leaving talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds behind.\"\n\nIn response to Ebdon's comments, Oxford University said it was committed to increasing diversity and inclusion, and was taking steps to improve access for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Cambridge University also issued a statement, saying it was working to \"promote greater diversity and inclusion\" and was \"committed to ensuring that our admissions processes are fair and transparent.\"\n\nHowever, Ebdon's criticism has also sparked concerns that the two universities are not doing enough to address the issue. \"It's not just about increasing diversity and inclusion, it's about making sure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds have an equal chance of success,\" said Ebdon. \"And at the moment, I don't think that's happening at Oxford and Cambridge.\"\n\nThe government has announced plans to introduce new measures to improve access to higher education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including a new bursary scheme and increased funding for universities that take steps to increase diversity and inclusion. However, the success of these measures remains to be seen, and many are calling for more radical action to address the issue.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the issue of access and inclusion in higher education is a pressing one, and it will require a concerted effort from universities, policymakers, and education experts to create a more level playing field for students from all backgrounds.",

Google was up and running, turning a profit, and just beginning to destroy the business model of newspapers. Since then, the disruption to traditional media has accelerated. While lamenting the loss of newsprint, I envisioned a world where journalism would thrive despite its passing. As I reflect on the past 15 years, it's astonishing to see how the digital landscape has transformed the way we consume and interact with news. The proliferation of social media platforms, online news sites, and podcasting has democratized the dissemination of information, giving a voice to countless individuals and organizations.\n\nHowever, this seismic shift has also led to concerns about the credibility and reliability of the news we consume. The rise of \"fake news\" and disinformation has created a challenging environment for journalists, who must now navigate a complex web of fact-checking and verification to ensure the accuracy of their reporting.\n\nDespite these challenges, I remain optimistic about the future of journalism. The internet has enabled a level of transparency and accountability that was previously unimaginable. With the click of a button, readers can access a vast array of sources, fact-checking websites, and watchdog organizations, allowing them to make informed decisions about the news they consume.\n\nMoreover, the evolution of digital media has given rise to innovative storytelling formats, such as podcasts, video journalism, and interactive documentaries. These formats have not only captivated audiences but also provided new opportunities for journalists to engage with their readers and share their stories in a more immersive and dynamic way.\n\nIn addition, the rise of independent media outlets and non-profit news organizations has helped to fill the gaps left by the decline of traditional newspapers. These organizations have been able to focus on in-depth reporting and investigative journalism, shedding light on important issues and holding those in power accountable.\n\nOf course, the future of journalism is not without its challenges. The business model of traditional newspapers remains under threat, and the pressure to produce clicks and views can sometimes compromise the quality and integrity of reporting. Moreover, the proliferation of online misinformation has created a new kind of \"echo chamber,\" where people are increasingly isolated from opposing viewpoints and perspectives.\n\nDespite these challenges, I believe that the future of journalism holds great promise. As technology continues to evolve, I envision a world where journalists are empowered to tell more nuanced and complex stories, using innovative formats and platforms to engage with their audiences. I see a future where fact-checking and verification become the norm, and where readers are equipped with the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions about the news they consume.\n\nUltimately, the future of journalism is not about lamenting the loss of traditional media but about embracing the opportunities and challenges presented by the digital age. As I look back on the past 15 years, I am heartened by the resilience and adaptability of journalists, who have consistently demonstrated their ability to evolve and thrive in the face of disruption.",

But the unfolding battle over Sumner M. Redstone's wishes is in a class by itself, if for no other reason than so much is at stake: the control of a media empire worth $40 billion, including the holdings of Viacom and CBS. In this case, the courts must sort out not a deathbed will but the mental acuity of Mr. Redstone, a media mogul who will turn 93 on Friday. He suffers from declining cognition, is fed through a tube and communicates with great difficulty, often through a nurse or speech therapist who interprets his utterances. The legal wrangling surrounding Sumner M. Redstone's mental competence has raised questions about the validity of his decisions regarding the future of his media empire. The case has drawn attention from industry insiders and media enthusiasts alike, as the fate of iconic brands such as MTV, Nickelodeon, and CBS News hangs in the balance.\n\nAt the center of the controversy is Redstone's daughter, Shari, who has been appointed as the co-CEO of ViacomCBS, the parent company of the media conglomerate. Shari has been a vocal advocate for her father's wishes, insisting that he is still mentally capable of making decisions regarding the company's future. However, her brother, Brent, has challenged her assertions, citing concerns about their father's declining cognitive abilities.\n\nThe court has appointed a special master, retired Judge Richard Levie, to investigate Redstone's mental competence and determine whether he is capable of making informed decisions about the company. The special master has been conducting interviews with Redstone and reviewing his medical records, as well as speaking with his caregivers and other individuals who have interacted with him.\n\nThe stakes are high, as Redstone's control of the company could determine the fate of thousands of employees and the direction of the media industry as a whole. Industry analysts are watching the case closely, as the outcome could have significant implications for the future of ViacomCBS and its subsidiaries.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for ViacomCBS said, \"The company is committed to following the wishes of its founder and ensuring the continuity of its operations. We are confident that the court will ultimately determine that Mr. Redstone's decisions are valid and in the best interests of the company.\"\n\nThe case has also raised questions about the use of undue influence in the decision-making process. Some have suggested that Shari may have exerted undue influence over her father, using her position as co-CEO to shape his decisions and advance her own interests. However, Shari has denied these allegations, insisting that she is only acting in her father's best interests.\n\nThe court's decision is expected to be a complex and challenging one, requiring a nuanced understanding of Redstone's mental state and the potential consequences of his decisions. As the case continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the future of ViacomCBS and the media empire built by Sumner M. Redstone hangs in the balance, and the outcome will have far-reaching implications for the industry and its stakeholders.",

Many companies, he said, had qualms about relying on the faraway data centers. Now his customers have a different concern: One cloud service isn't enough. \"They don't want to be tied to one big tech company,\" said Mr. Siebel, chief executive of C3 IoT, a software company that uses cloud computing to analyze data coming from industrial machines. And Mr. Siebel is adapting. After initially working closely with Amazon, a pioneer in cloud computing, C3 IoT now also has a technology and marketing partnership with Microsoft. And it is negotiating a similar agreement with Google. For a few years, it looked like Amazon would run away with the cloud computing business, piling up market share as it has with online shopping. But in the past couple of years, many companies have decided that they don't want to depend on Amazon alone, and are spreading out their business. That has helped Microsoft most of all. And the software giant has emerged as a strong No. ...2 in the cloud computing market, according to a recent report by Synergy Research Group.\n\nMicrosoft's success in cloud computing can be attributed to its strategic partnerships with companies like C3 IoT, as well as its own investments in the technology. In 2019, Microsoft announced a $5 billion investment in cloud infrastructure, which has enabled it to expand its data center capacity and improve its cloud services.\n\nThe company's Azure cloud platform has also been a major driver of its growth, offering a range of services including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics. These services have been particularly popular among businesses in the manufacturing and healthcare sectors, who are looking to leverage cloud computing to improve their operations and make data-driven decisions.\n\nIn addition to its partnership with C3 IoT, Microsoft has also formed partnerships with other companies, including SAP and General Electric, to offer cloud-based solutions to its customers. These partnerships have helped Microsoft to expand its reach into new industries and markets, and have enabled it to offer a more comprehensive range of cloud services.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, has been playing catch-up in the cloud computing market. While it has made significant investments in the technology, it has struggled to gain traction with large enterprises. However, the company's recent announcement of a major cloud computing partnership with Salesforce, a leading customer relationship management software company, could be a major turning point.\n\nThe partnership, which was announced in October, will see Google and Salesforce integrate their cloud services to offer a range of new solutions to businesses. This could help Google to gain more traction with large enterprises, and could also help Salesforce to expand its reach into new markets.\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, is still the largest player in the cloud computing market, with a market share of around 33%. However, its dominance is being challenged by Microsoft and Google, who are both gaining ground rapidly. According to a recent report by Canalys, Amazon's market share declined by 2.5% in the third quarter of 2022, while Microsoft's market share increased by 5.5%.\n\nAs the cloud computing market continues to evolve, it is likely that the competition between Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will only intensify. However, for companies like C3 IoT, the trend towards multi-cloud adoption is a positive one, as it provides them with more opportunities to work with different cloud providers and offer their customers a range of cloud-based solutions.",

You can ask anybody around you, at any particular time, for anything, and they will happily help you out.\" The 32-year-old South African bought his 36ft-narrowboat six years ago for Â£14,000 as a way out of London's rental trap. \"My parents cashed in some shares and gave me the money to buy outright. I went from paying Â£80 a week in rent and sharing a room with a friend in Finsbury Park to having my own place.\" Each morning he wakes up to the sound of water lapping outside his window and checks the progress the local ducks have made on their nest. His boat is moored in Mile End, east London, where a small one-bedroom flat with a view of the canal costs at least Â£400,000: more than 28 times the price Hagan paid for his watery view. He is by no means the only Londoner managing to live both rent and mortgage free on the capital's canals. Since 2012 the number of boats without home moorings in central and east London has increased by 171% and 182% respectively, according to the Canal & River Trust (CRT), the charity that looks after England and Wales's 2,000 miles of waterways. Nationally the figure has gone up by 33%. The rise of canal living in London has been driven by a combination of factors, including the increasing unaffordability of traditional housing and the desire for a more relaxed, community-focused lifestyle. For many, the idea of living on a boat is romanticized as a carefree existence, but in reality, it requires a significant amount of planning, maintenance, and adaptability.\n\nDespite the challenges, the appeal of canal living is undeniable. Hagan, who works as a freelance writer, loves the sense of freedom that comes with living on the water. \"I can moor my boat anywhere along the canal, which gives me the flexibility to explore different areas of the city,\" he explains. \"And because I'm not tied to a specific address, I can take on freelance work from anywhere.\"\n\nHagan's experience is not unique. Many Londoners are turning to canal living as a way to escape the city's high rents and mortgages. According to the Canal & River Trust, the number of boats without home moorings in central and east London has increased significantly over the past decade. In central London, the number of boats has risen by 171%, while in east London, it has increased by 182%.\n\nThe rise of canal living is also driven by the increasing popularity of canal-based communities. Many boat owners are choosing to live in close proximity to one another, creating a sense of community and camaraderie that is often lacking in traditional housing. \"There's a real sense of belonging on the canal,\" says Hagan. \"We all look out for each other and help each other out. It's a really special thing.\"\n\nHowever, canal living is not without its challenges. Boat owners must contend with the physical demands of living on the water, including regular maintenance and repair work. They must also navigate the complex rules and regulations surrounding boat ownership, including issues such as mooring permits and waste disposal.\n\nDespite these challenges, the appeal of canal living shows no signs of waning. As the cost of traditional housing continues to rise, more and more Londoners are turning to the city's canals as a viable alternative. For Hagan, the benefits of canal living far outweigh the drawbacks. \"I wouldn't trade my life on the canal for anything,\" he says. \"It's a unique and special way of living that I feel incredibly lucky to have discovered.\"",

Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who is stepping down, the White House said. Mr. Immelt is chairman and chief executive of General Electric, the giant conglomerate with deep roots in this somewhat battered industrial city near Albany. Mr. Immelt will be chairman of the new Council on Jobs and Competitiveness that Mr. Obama intends to create by executive order. In a statement issued shortly after midnight, Mr. Obama said he wanted the council to \"focus its work on finding new ways to encourage the private sector to hire and invest in American competitiveness.\" The council will be a reconfigured version of the board Mr. Volcker led, the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. That body, created by Mr. Obama when he took office in the thick of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, is set to expire on Feb. 6. Mr. Immelt said that his commitment to G.E. would not change. The appointment of Jeffrey R. Immelt, a seasoned business leader with a strong track record of driving growth and innovation, is seen as a significant move by President Obama to revamp his economic advisory panel. The Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, as it will be known, will focus on developing strategies to boost American competitiveness and drive job creation.\n\nImmelt's experience at General Electric, one of the world's largest and most successful companies, is expected to bring a unique perspective to the council. GE has a significant presence in Schenectady, where it has been a major employer for over a century. The company's commitment to innovation and job creation in the region is well-documented, and Immelt's appointment is seen as a vote of confidence in the city's ability to drive economic growth.\n\nThe council will be responsible for identifying areas where the private sector can work with government to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. It will also provide recommendations to the President on how to improve American competitiveness, including investments in education and infrastructure.\n\nImmelt's appointment has been welcomed by business leaders and economists, who see it as a positive step towards revitalizing the US economy. \"Jeff Immelt is a highly respected leader with a deep understanding of the challenges facing American businesses,\" said Tom Donohue, president and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce. \"We believe that his appointment to the council will bring a much-needed focus on job creation and competitiveness to the White House.\"\n\nImmelt's commitment to General Electric will not change, despite his new role on the council. He will continue to lead the company, which has operations in over 180 countries and employs over 300,000 people worldwide.\n\nThe appointment of Immelt to the council is seen as a sign of the President's commitment to working with the private sector to drive economic growth. The council is expected to hold its first meeting in the coming weeks, and will be responsible for delivering its recommendations to the President by the end of the year.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said that the council will be a key part of the President's efforts to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. \"The President believes that the private sector is the engine of growth and job creation, and that government should play a supporting role,\" said a White House spokesperson. \"The Council on Jobs and Competitiveness will be a critical part of that effort, and we are confident that Jeff Immelt will be a valuable addition to the team.\"",

The US import has taken the UK by storm, with retailers launching discounts even earlier than usual this year as the battle for Christmas shoppers intensifies. Some of the high street's biggest names, including Tesco, Argos, Currys PC World and Amazon have upped the ante: offering more discounts, spread over more days, and, in Tesco's case, opening its largest stores at 5am. The pattern of spending on Black Friday has evolved since Amazon imported the event to the UK in 2010. In 2014 some stores witnessed violent scenes as bargain-hunting consumers fought in the aisles for cut-price widescreen televisions, but by last year the discount extravaganza had morphed into a predominantly online event. As the phenomenon of Black Friday has evolved, so too have the shopping habits of Britons. Gone are the days of chaotic in-store battles, replaced by a more relaxed and convenient online experience. According to a recent survey, 71% of UK consumers plan to shop online on Black Friday, with 45% stating that they prefer the ease and comfort of shopping from home.\n\nRetailers have taken note of this shift and are responding accordingly. Many are investing heavily in their e-commerce platforms, offering exclusive online deals and promotions to attract customers. For instance, Currys PC World is offering a \"price match guarantee\" on all online purchases, ensuring that customers can get the best deals without having to physically visit a store.\n\nAmazon, the pioneer of Black Friday in the UK, is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the online shopping frenzy. The e-commerce giant is offering a staggering 50% off on select products, including popular items like Echo smart speakers and Fire TV streaming devices. Additionally, Amazon is also offering free delivery on all orders over Â£20, making it an even more attractive option for cash-strapped consumers.\n\nHowever, not all retailers are focusing solely on online sales. Some are still offering in-store promotions and discounts, albeit on a smaller scale. Tesco, for instance, is opening its largest stores at 5am, offering customers a chance to grab early bird deals on popular items like toys and electronics. Argos is also offering in-store discounts, with customers able to pick up their purchases on the same day.\n\nAs the biggest shopping weekend of the year kicks off, retailers are bracing themselves for a record-breaking Â£1.3bn spend. With online shopping expected to dominate the sales, it remains to be seen whether the in-store experience will continue to decline or if a resurgence of interest in physical shopping will emerge. One thing is certain, however: Black Friday has become an integral part of the UK retail landscape, and consumers can expect even more deals and promotions in the years to come.",

Dozens of scooter and bicycle couriers descended on an Uber office in Bermondsey on Friday to demonstrate against dwindling pay deals, which they say have left some at risk of earning less than the minimum wage. During a noisy but peaceful protest, drivers chanted \"Uber, shame on you\" and called on the company to pay the London living wage of a guaranteed Â£9.40 per hour, plus costs. The dispute is the latest to hit the \"gig economy\", where people in need of cash sign up for occasional jobs but do not receive guaranteed hours or other benefits of full-time employment. Rival delivery service Deliveroo was recently forced to abandon plans to impose new contracts on workers after a protest by its own couriers. Uber refused to meet a delegation of drivers, saying it would only speak to them individually â€“ an offer that protest organiser Imran Siddiqui said amounted to \"divide and rule\" tactics. Siddiqui, who claims he has been blocked from working for UberEats since organising the demonstration, said riders were now planning to take their campaign on the road, touring London restaurants and disrupting their business. The protesters, who were dressed in bright yellow vests and holding signs that read \"Fair Pay for Fair Work\", claimed that UberEats' pay structure has become increasingly unsustainable, with some drivers earning as little as Â£4.50 per hour after expenses. They argued that this is not only below the London living wage but also below the minimum wage of Â£8.21 per hour for workers aged 25 and over.\n\nAs the protest continued, drivers began to share their personal stories of financial struggle, highlighting the difficulties they face in making ends meet on UberEats' current pay rates. One driver, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \"I've been working for UberEats for over two years, and my pay has been consistently decreasing. I'm struggling to pay my bills and feed my family. It's not fair that I'm expected to work hard and provide for my loved ones on such low wages.\"\n\nThe protest has sparked concerns about the treatment of workers in the gig economy, with many calling for greater protections and benefits for those who work in the sector. Labour MP, Helen Hayes, who was in attendance at the protest, said: \"The gig economy is supposed to be a flexible and innovative way of working, but for many people, it's become a way of being exploited. We need to see greater regulation and protections for workers to ensure they are treated fairly and with dignity.\"\n\nIn response to the protest, UberEats has maintained that it is committed to providing a fair and transparent pay structure for its drivers. A spokesperson for the company said: \"We understand the concerns of our drivers and are working to address them. We believe that our pay structure is competitive and reflects the flexibility and autonomy that our drivers enjoy.\"\n\nHowever, the protesters remain unconvinced, and have vowed to continue their campaign until their demands are met. With plans to tour London restaurants and disrupt business, the dispute is likely to escalate in the coming weeks. As the gig economy continues to grow, the controversy surrounding UberEats and its treatment of drivers is likely to have far-reaching implications for the industry as a whole.",

The first spacewalk to be conducted entirely by women is scheduled for Oct. 21, NASA announced, nearly seven months after an all-female spacewalk was canceled because two properly fitted spacesuits were not readily available. Christina Koch and Anne McClain, the two astronauts who were scheduled to conduct the spacewalk in March, both needed a medium-size torso component, but only one was available. The spacewalk did take place -- it just wasn't all-female. Ms. Koch conducted the six-hour mission with fellow astronaut Nick Hague. Ms. McClain, whose domestic dispute sparked what is believed to be the first criminal case in space, returned to Earth in June after orbiting the planet more than 3,000 times in 204 days. Summer Worden, Ms. McClain's spouse, accused the astronaut of identity theft and improper access to her private financial records from space. Ms. Koch will now set out with astronaut Jessica Meir this month on the first women-only venture outside of the International Space Station. The historic spacewalk is a testament to the progress made by NASA in promoting diversity and inclusion in the space program. \"We are thrilled to announce that our astronauts, Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, will be conducting the first all-female spacewalk,\" said NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine. \"This milestone is a significant step forward in our efforts to increase diversity and inclusion in the astronaut corps and to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.\"\n\nThe spacewalk, which is scheduled to take place on October 21, will involve Koch and Meir venturing outside the International Space Station to perform a series of maintenance tasks and conduct scientific experiments. The mission is expected to last around six hours and will be monitored by mission control in Houston.\n\nKoch, who has been on the International Space Station since March, has already made history by spending a record-breaking 288 days in space. Meir, who arrived at the station in July, has been working on a variety of scientific experiments and has been training for the spacewalk.\n\nThe two astronauts will wear specially designed spacesuits that have been modified to fit their needs. The suits will be equipped with additional features to ensure the safety and comfort of the astronauts during the spacewalk.\n\nThe all-female spacewalk is a significant milestone for NASA, which has faced criticism in the past for its lack of diversity in its astronaut corps. The agency has made efforts in recent years to increase diversity and inclusion, including the selection of more female astronauts and the creation of a diversity and inclusion office.\n\nThe success of the all-female spacewalk is expected to inspire young girls and women to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). \"This is a huge step forward for women in space exploration,\" said Dr. Peggy Whitson, a NASA astronaut who holds the record for the most time spent in space by an American astronaut. \"It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our astronauts and a reminder that anything is possible with determination and perseverance.\"\n\nThe spacewalk will be broadcast live on NASA's website and social media channels, allowing people around the world to watch the historic event.",

        "Text": "UK employment could fall in 2020, despite average UK pay being expected to pass its pre-crisis record, economists have said. The labour market is at a turning point, according to a report from the Resolution Foundation. It forecasts that average real pay â€“ allowing for inflation â€“ will surpass the peak it reached in 2008. But the record levels of employment characteristic of 2019 are at risk, the thinktank said, adding that \"Brexit uncertainty and global headwinds sapped business confidence, leading to stalling investment and zero productivity growth\". The report from the Resolution Foundation, a UK-based thinktank, highlights the complexities of the UK's labour market, which is expected to face challenges in the coming year. Despite the forecasted rise in average real pay, the organisation warns that employment levels may decline due to the uncertain economic climate.\n\nAccording to the report, the UK's employment rate has been steadily increasing since 2013, with 2019 seeing a record high. However, the thinktank suggests that this trend may be about to reverse. The report cites Brexit uncertainty and global economic headwinds as major factors contributing to a decline in business confidence, leading to reduced investment and stagnant productivity growth.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation's analysis suggests that the UK's labour market is at a critical juncture, with the potential for employment levels to fall in 2020. This would be a significant shift, as the UK has experienced a period of sustained employment growth in recent years.\n\nThe report's authors argue that the decline in business confidence is a major concern, as it can have far-reaching consequences for the economy. Reduced investment can lead to a decline in productivity, making it more difficult for businesses to grow and thrive. This, in turn, can have a negative impact on employment levels.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation's findings are based on a detailed analysis of economic data and trends. The organisation's experts have examined a range of factors, including employment rates, productivity growth, and business confidence, to arrive at their conclusions.\n\nThe report's authors are urging policymakers to take action to address the challenges facing the UK's labour market. They are calling for measures to boost business confidence, increase investment, and promote productivity growth.\n\nIn response to the report, a spokesperson for the UK government said: \"We are committed to supporting businesses and creating jobs. We are working to ensure a smooth Brexit and to promote economic growth, which will benefit workers and businesses alike.\"\n\nThe Resolution Foundation's report is the latest in a series of warnings about the potential impact of Brexit on the UK's economy. As the country navigates the complexities of leaving the EU, it is clear that the labour market will be a key area of focus for policymakers and businesses alike.",

        "Text": "The federal government helped bring the economic recovery to a virtual halt late last year as cuts in military spending and other factors overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's expanded campaign to stimulate growth. Disappointing data released Wednesday underscore how tighter fiscal policy may continue to weigh on growth in the future as government spending, which increased steadily in recent decades and expanded hugely during the recession, plays a diminished role in the United States economy. Significant federal spending cuts are scheduled to take effect March 1, and most Americans are also now paying higher payroll taxes with the expiration of a temporary cut in early January. The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the last three months of 2012, the worst quarter since the economy crawled out of the last recession, hampered by the lower military spending, fewer exports and smaller business stockpiles, preliminary government figures indicated on Wednesday. The Fed, in a separate appraisal, said economic activity \"paused in recent months.\" Still, economists said the seemingly bleak gross domestic product report was not a sign that another recession was looming. The preliminary data showed relatively strong spending by consumers and businesses, even as military spending posted its sharpest quarterly drop in 40 years. Forecasters expect that growth this year will rebound to a still-anemic 1.5 percent, a little lower than the pace it has managed over the last three years. \"This is the tip of the iceberg on fiscal austerity from Washington,\" said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"It was exaggerated this quarter by the unusually large drop in defense spending, but that and higher taxes will start hurting\" in the coming months. The drop in American exports stemmed in part from a decline in economic growth in Europe, where governments have also been cutting spending in a bid to balance budgets. The contraction in the economy's final quarter of 2012 was a stark reminder of the challenges facing the recovery. The decline in military spending, which accounted for a significant portion of the contraction, was a direct result of the federal government's efforts to reduce its budget deficit. The cuts, which were implemented as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011, are expected to continue to have a negative impact on the economy in the coming months.\n\nIn addition to the decline in military spending, the economy was also hampered by a decline in exports. The weaker economic growth in Europe, where governments have been implementing austerity measures, was a major factor in the decline. The decrease in exports was particularly pronounced in the manufacturing sector, which has been a key driver of economic growth in recent years.\n\nDespite the disappointing economic data, economists are not forecasting another recession. Instead, they are expecting growth to rebound to around 1.5 percent this year, which is slightly lower than the pace of growth over the last three years. However, the recovery is expected to be slow and steady, with growth likely to remain anemic for some time.\n\nThe impact of the federal budget cuts is expected to be felt in the coming months. The expiration of the temporary payroll tax cut in January, which reduced the payroll tax rate from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent, has already taken effect. The payroll tax increase, combined with the sequester, which is expected to reduce government spending by around $85 billion this year, is likely to have a negative impact on consumer spending and economic growth.\n\nThe sequester, which was implemented as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011, is a automatic spending cut that was designed to reduce the federal budget deficit. However, the cuts are expected to have a disproportionate impact on certain industries, such as defense and healthcare, which could have long-term consequences for the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic data released on Wednesday was disappointing, but it is not a sign of another recession. The recovery is expected to be slow and steady, with growth likely to remain anemic for some time. The impact of the federal budget cuts is expected to be felt in the coming months, and economists are warning that the recovery could be slowed by the sequester and the expiration of the payroll tax cut.",

        "Text": "Roughly 5,300 years ago, a group of ancient sheep herders in East Africa began an extraordinary effort to care for their dead. It was a time of great upheaval in their homeland. Global climate changes had weakened the African monsoon system, causing a significant drop in rainfall. Pastoralism spread south from the Sahara . What is now known as Lake Turkana in northern Kenya shrank by half over the succeeding centuries. These early herders dug through about 1,000 square feet of beach sands down to bedrock and gouged out burial pits. They interred their dead there: the bodies of men, women and children of all ages, many with personal items and ornamentation. The discovery of these ancient burial sites, located near the shores of Lake Turkana, has provided archaeologists with a unique glimpse into the lives and customs of these early herders. The sheer scale of the burial effort is astonishing, with over 1,000 individuals interred in the pits.\n\nExcavations at the site have revealed a fascinating array of personal items and ornaments, which provide valuable insights into the daily lives and cultural practices of these ancient people. Among the artifacts found are stone tools, pottery, and beads made from shells and other materials. Some of the bodies were adorned with elaborate headdresses, and others were buried with their personal belongings, such as wooden combs and leather bags.\n\nThe burials also offer clues about the social and economic structures of these early societies. The presence of children and elderly individuals, as well as the variety of personal items, suggests that these communities were relatively egalitarian, with no clear evidence of a rigid social hierarchy. The burials also reveal that these people had a deep connection with their environment, as many of the artifacts found are made from local materials, such as stone and wood.\n\nThe discovery of these ancient burial sites has also shed light on the history of the region. The presence of pastoralist communities in the area during this time period challenges the traditional view of the region's history, which held that the area was largely uninhabited until the arrival of Bantu-speaking farmers around 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings have also sparked new questions about the impact of climate change on human societies. The weakening of the African monsoon system and the resulting droughts would have had a significant impact on the livelihoods of these early herders, and the burials provide a poignant reminder of the resilience and adaptability of human societies in the face of adversity.\n\nThe Lake Turkana burial sites are now considered one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, offering a unique window into the lives of our ancient ancestors. As archaeologists continue to excavate and study the site, they are uncovering new insights into the culture, society, and daily lives of these early herders, providing a fascinating glimpse into the history of humanity.",

Even though humans have not been there for decades, our understanding of our lunar neighbor has never been better. But our ability to really know our moon was not always this easy. The beginning of the moon race in 1959 offered our first real glimpses of the surface, with Soviet probes sending the first close-up pictures back to Earth. We inched closer with the Apollo 8 flyby in 1968. No humans had ever been so near. For the first time, our view was swapped -- it was the pockmarked lunar surface in the foreground, and our blue speckled Earth in the distance. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] For millenniums the moon was a thing of legend. People believed that it controlled our moods, our behaviors and even our destinies. As humans, we have always been fascinated by the moon's mystical powers. Ancient cultures believed that the moon's phases influenced our emotions, and that its cycles dictated the tides of our lives. The moon's seemingly constant presence in the night sky only added to its allure, making it a symbol of romance, magic, and wonder.\n\nBut as our understanding of the moon grew, so did our desire to explore and conquer it. The moon race, sparked by the Soviet Union's Luna 2 probe in 1959, marked the beginning of a new era in lunar exploration. The United States soon followed suit, launching its own series of probes and landers, including the Ranger and Surveyor missions.\n\nThe Apollo program, launched in the late 1960s, took the next giant leap by sending humans to the moon's surface. On July 20, 1969, NASA's Apollo 11 mission made history when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon. The event was a defining moment in human spaceflight, marking the culmination of years of hard work and dedication by thousands of scientists, engineers, and technicians.\n\nSince then, our understanding of the moon has continued to evolve. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2009, has provided high-resolution images of the moon's surface, revealing new details about its geology and composition. The European Space Agency's SMART-1 mission, which ended in 2006, demonstrated the feasibility of using the moon as a stepping stone for deeper space exploration.\n\nToday, the moon remains an important target for scientific research and exploration. NASA's Artemis program, announced in 2019, aims to return humans to the moon by 2024 and establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. The program also plans to use the moon as a testing ground for technologies and strategies that will be needed for future missions to Mars and beyond.\n\nAs we look to the future of lunar exploration, it's clear that our understanding of the moon has come a long way since the early days of the moon race. But there is still much to be learned about our closest celestial neighbor, and scientists and engineers are working tirelessly to uncover its secrets. Whether it's through robotic missions or human exploration, the moon remains an important destination for humanity, offering insights into the formation of our solar system and the possibilities of space travel.",

Submissions to Ofcom, part of a consultation into how it will regulate the BBC, call on the body to introduce diversity targets for the number of BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) staff working behind the scenes. The diversity of the BBC is being heavily scrutinised after the corporation published a list of its top earners that revealed a huge gender pay gap and that the 10 highest-paid BAME stars collectively received around the same as Chris Evans last year. Before the publication of the list Sir Lenny Henry, the comedian, criticised Ofcom and the BBC for not doing enough to tackle diversity. The BBC says about 14% of its staff are from a BAME background, but Henry claimed the number of BAME people responsible for making programmes is \"probably closer to 1.5%\", adding: \"This is the dirty secret of what our industry really looks like behind the camera.\" The call to action comes as the BBC faces mounting criticism over its lack of diversity, particularly in senior roles. The corporation's recent publication of its top earners' salaries has highlighted a significant gender pay gap, with many of its highest-paid stars being white men. The revelation has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for the BBC to take immediate action to address the issue.\n\nIn response, Sir Lenny Henry, a well-known comedian and advocate for diversity, has urged Ofcom to use its powers to force the BBC to increase the diversity of its workforce. Henry, who has been vocal about the need for greater diversity in the media industry, believes that the current lack of representation is not only unfair but also damaging to the industry as a whole.\n\n\"The BBC is a reflection of our society, and if it doesn't reflect our society, then it's not doing its job,\" Henry said in an interview. \"The lack of diversity behind the camera is a problem that needs to be addressed, and I believe that Ofcom has a responsibility to ensure that the BBC takes action to increase diversity.\"\n\nHenry's comments have been echoed by many in the industry, who argue that the BBC's lack of diversity is not only a moral issue but also a commercial one. A diverse workforce can bring new perspectives and ideas, which can lead to more innovative and engaging programming.\n\nThe consultation, which is open until the end of the month, is seeking feedback from the public on how Ofcom should regulate the BBC in the future. Many have taken to social media to express their support for increased diversity targets, with the hashtag #DiversityMatters trending on Twitter.\n\nThe BBC has acknowledged the need for greater diversity and has pledged to increase the number of BAME staff working behind the scenes. However, critics argue that more needs to be done, and that the corporation needs to take concrete action to address the issue.\n\nAs the consultation continues, it remains to be seen whether Ofcom will take action to force the BBC to increase diversity. However, one thing is clear: the lack of diversity in the media industry is a problem that needs to be addressed, and it's up to regulators like Ofcom to ensure that the BBC takes the necessary steps to increase representation.",

Pandora, the internet radio giant, was one of several digital music outlets then trying to curry favor with him, Questlove said. But the meeting turned surprisingly productive once Tim Westergren, Pandora's co-founder, showed him the company's Music Genome Project, its system for categorizing songs by hundreds of precise musical attributes. Intrigued by a technology company that was as obsessive about the fundamentals of music as he was, Questlove immediately began discussing new projects with Mr. Westergren, who later brought him on as a strategic adviser and Pandora's first artist ambassador. \"I went in there to talk about playlists, and I ended up with a job as an equity partner,\" Questlove, whose real name is Ahmir Thompson, said in an interview. The first fruit of the partnership is \"Questlove Supreme,\" a weekly radio show that will debut on Sept. 7. A three-hour program with wide-ranging playlists and guests including the actress Maya Rudolph and the singer Kimbra, \"Questlove Supreme\" shows off its host's eclectic tastes; he describes the show as an extension of the music courses he teaches at New York University and \"the black nerd version of NPR.\" For Pandora, which has clashed with the music industry in the past, the involvement of an authority like Questlove -- whose group is the house band on NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" -- is an important endorsement as the company embarks on its biggest challenge yet: expanding its service beyond radio to compete directly with Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal. \"We are entering into a new phase for the company,\" Mr. Westergren said. The partnership between Questlove and Pandora is a significant move for the company, which has faced criticism from the music industry in the past. By partnering with an influential figure like Questlove, Pandora is hoping to gain credibility and attract new listeners. Questlove's involvement also brings a unique perspective to the company, as he is known for his eclectic taste in music and his ability to bring together different genres and styles.\n\n\"We're thrilled to have Questlove on board,\" said Mr. Westergren. \"His passion for music and his expertise in the industry make him the perfect ambassador for our brand. We're looking forward to seeing what he brings to the table and how he can help us grow our service.\"\n\nQuestlove's radio show, \"Questlove Supreme,\" will debut on September 7 and will feature a wide range of music, including genres such as hip-hop, rock, and R&B.

I'm looking forward to working with Pandora and exploring new ways to connect with listeners.\"\n\nThe partnership between Questlove and Pandora is just the latest move in the company's efforts to expand its service and compete with other music streaming platforms. In recent months, Pandora has made significant changes to its service, including the introduction of new features such as personalized playlists and a redesigned user interface.\n\n\"We're committed to providing the best possible experience for our listeners,\" said Mr. Westergren. \"We're constantly looking for ways to innovate and improve our service, and we believe that Questlove's involvement will be a key part of that effort.\"\n\nAs Pandora continues to evolve and grow, the company is also facing increased competition from other music streaming platforms. Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal are all major players in the industry, and each has its own unique features and advantages.\n\n\"We're not worried about the competition,\" said Mr. Westergren. \"We're focused on providing the best possible service for our listeners, and we believe that our unique approach to music discovery and our commitment to quality will set us apart from the competition.\"\n\nWith Questlove on board, Pandora is poised to make a big impact in the music streaming industry. The company's partnership with the legendary musician and DJ is a significant move that could help to attract new listeners and establish Pandora as a major player in the industry.\n\n\"We're excited to see what the future holds,\" said Mr. Westergren. \"We believe that our partnership with Questlove will be a key part of our success, and we're looking forward to working with him to bring new and innovative music to our listeners.\"",

        "Text": "So new research shows that independent school pupils score nearly two thirds of a GCSE grade better than otherwise comparable state school pupils (Private schools add two years of education, say researchers, 26 February). But does this necessarily indicate greater attainment? Might it not indicate the well-known \"halo effect\" that operates when the grades awarded by assessors are affected (positively or negatively) by their expectations of the different individuals or groups whose work they are assessing. That factor might also help explain previous research reported by the Guardian showing that pupils from comprehensive schools are likely to achieve higher class degrees (even in the most academically selective universities) than independent (and grammar) school pupils with similar A-levels and GCSE results. Professor Derek Rowntree (Author of Assessing Students: How Shall We Know Them?) According to Professor Rowntree, the \"halo effect\" is a well-documented phenomenon in education, where the perceived background and social status of a student can influence the grades awarded by teachers and examiners. This can lead to biased assessments, where students from more affluent or prestigious backgrounds are given higher grades, regardless of their actual performance.\n\nThe professor believes that the discrepancy in GCSE grades between independent and state school pupils could be attributed to this bias, rather than any inherent difference in academic ability. \"It's a classic example of the 'halo effect',\" he said in an interview. \"Assessors may be more likely to award higher grades to independent school pupils simply because they expect them to perform well. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities, while their state school counterparts are not given the same chance.\"\n\nThis theory is supported by the Guardian's previous research, which found that pupils from comprehensive schools are more likely to achieve higher class degrees, even in highly selective universities, despite having similar A-level and GCSE results to their independent school counterparts. This suggests that the \"halo effect\" may be operating on a larger scale, influencing not just GCSE grades, but also university admissions and academic outcomes.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, highlighting the need for educators and policymakers to be aware of the potential biases that can affect student assessments. Professor Rowntree believes that more needs to be done to address this issue, including the implementation of standardized assessment procedures and increased transparency in grading.\n\n\"It's not about denying the achievements of independent schools, but about recognizing the potential biases that can affect student outcomes,\" he said. \"By acknowledging and addressing these biases, we can work towards creating a fairer and more equitable education system, where students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to succeed.\"",

Just ask companies in the home improvement, meal-kit and grocery businesses. The latest category alarmed by the specter of competition from Amazon is the pharmacy market. With huge amounts of consumer spending and frustrating inefficiencies, it is the type of business that invariably attracts Amazon's attention. CVS Health is now in talks to acquire Aetna, one of the nation's largest health insurance providers, a move considered to be partly a reaction to the footsteps of Amazon. The rumors of Amazon's interest in the pharmacy market have sent shockwaves through the industry, with CVS Health taking swift action to secure its position. The proposed acquisition of Aetna, a leading health insurance provider, is seen as a strategic move to counter the potential threat posed by Amazon.\n\nIndustry insiders believe that Amazon's entry into the pharmacy market would be a game-changer, leveraging its vast customer base and logistical expertise to disrupt the traditional business model. With its ability to offer same-day delivery, personalized health advice, and competitive pricing, Amazon would be well-positioned to capture a significant share of the market.\n\nCVS Health's acquisition of Aetna would give it a significant advantage in the face of potential competition from Amazon. The combined entity would have a strong presence in the healthcare industry, with a large network of pharmacies, clinics, and medical facilities. This would enable CVS Health to offer a more comprehensive range of services to its customers, including health insurance, prescription management, and wellness programs.\n\nThe acquisition is also seen as a defensive move by CVS Health, which has been struggling to compete with online retailers and other discount pharmacies. By acquiring Aetna, CVS Health would be able to leverage the insurer's vast network of providers and patients to drive growth and increase its market share.\n\nHowever, the deal is not without its challenges. The acquisition would require regulatory approval, which could be a complex and time-consuming process. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential impact on competition in the healthcare industry, with some critics arguing that the deal would create a monopoly.\n\nDespite these challenges, the acquisition of Aetna is seen as a bold move by CVS Health to secure its position in the face of potential competition from Amazon. The deal would give the company a strong foundation to compete in the rapidly changing healthcare landscape, and would enable it to offer a more comprehensive range of services to its customers.\n\nIn the meantime, Amazon is continuing to explore opportunities in the pharmacy market, with reports suggesting that it is in talks with several major pharmacy chains. While the company has not confirmed any deals, its presence in the market is likely to be a major factor in shaping the future of the industry.\n\nAs the competition heats up in the pharmacy market, one thing is clear: the stakes are high, and the winners will be those who are able to adapt quickly to changing consumer needs and preferences. With CVS Health's acquisition of Aetna, the company is well-positioned to be a major player in the market, but the ultimate outcome will depend on its ability to execute its strategy and respond to the challenges posed by Amazon and other competitors.",

        "Text": "The biggest Silicon Valley initial public offering in years turned out to be less lofty than expected. Uber priced its public offering on Thursday at $45 a share, near the bottom of its expected price range, valuing the ride-hailing company at about $82.4 billion. It raised $8.1 billion from the I.P.O. While the event solidifies Uber's position as the biggest American technology company of its generation to go public, it will be a disappointment to the investors, executives and cheerleaders who had bigger dreams for it. And it raises questions about whether other money-losing Silicon Valley start-ups poised to list their shares should worry about receiving a cool reception. The ride-hailing behemoth -- which will start trading its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the symbol UBER -- will nonetheless have a market capitalization at its I.P.O. that trails only that of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, which went public in 2014 at $168 billion, and of Facebook, which was at $104 billion when it went public in 2012. Its $82.4 billion valuation, which factors in stock options and restricted stock grants, is above its last private fund-raising valuation of $76 billion, from August. Despite the lower-than-expected pricing, Uber's IPO is still a significant milestone for the company, marking a major step towards its goal of becoming a global transportation leader. The company's decision to price its shares at $45 apiece was seen as a strategic move to ensure a strong start to its public trading life, rather than chasing a higher price that might have led to a lackluster debut.\n\nThe IPO's success, however, will be closely watched by other Silicon Valley startups that are preparing to go public. The ride-hailing industry has been facing intense competition, with companies like Lyft and Grab struggling to turn a profit. Uber's lower-than-expected pricing may raise concerns about the viability of these companies' own IPO plans.\n\nIndustry experts point out that Uber's IPO is not without its challenges. The company has yet to turn a profit, and its losses have been mounting in recent years. In its most recent quarterly report, Uber reported a net loss of $5.2 billion, largely due to the costs of its self-driving car program and its expansion into new markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, Uber's IPO is seen as a significant achievement for the company's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who has been working to transform the company's culture and operations since taking over in 2017. Under his leadership, Uber has made significant strides in improving its financials and expanding its services, including the launch of its food delivery service, Uber Eats.\n\nThe company's IPO is also seen as a major test of investor appetite for technology stocks. In recent years, investors have been increasingly cautious about investing in tech companies, particularly those that are still losing money. However, Uber's IPO has shown that there is still demand for these types of stocks, particularly from institutional investors and long-term holders.\n\nAs Uber begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, investors will be closely watching its performance to see if it can live up to its lofty expectations. While the company's IPO may not have been as successful as some had hoped, it remains one of the most highly anticipated public offerings in recent years, and its success or failure will have significant implications for the technology industry as a whole.",

But there's one question that Google apparently doesn't want answered: is Google a monopoly? Barry Lynn, until this week a senior fellow at Washington thinktank the New America Foundation, has spent years studying the growing power of tech giants like Google and Facebook. He believes the answer is yes. Lynn's concerns about Google's dominance are not unfounded. The search engine giant's market share has been steadily increasing over the years, with over 80% of all internet searches conducted on Google. This level of control gives the company immense power to shape the way people access and interact with information online.\n\nAccording to Lynn, Google's dominance is not limited to search queries alone. The company's vast array of products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Android, has created a sprawling empire that touches nearly every aspect of modern life. \"Google's power is not just about search, it's about the entire digital ecosystem,\" Lynn said in an interview. \"They have the ability to manipulate the flow of information, to influence what people see and don't see, and to shape the very fabric of the internet.\"\n\nLynn's research has uncovered numerous examples of Google's market power being used to stifle competition and innovation. For instance, he points to Google's decision to demote rival search engines in its search results, making it harder for users to access alternative search options. He also cites the company's acquisition of popular startups, such as Waze and Nest, to eliminate potential competitors.\n\nBut Google is not the only tech giant facing antitrust scrutiny. Facebook, another behemoth of the digital world, is also under investigation by regulators in the United States and Europe. The social media giant's dominance in the online advertising market has raised concerns about its ability to stifle competition and manipulate the flow of information.\n\nDespite the growing pressure, Google remains defiant, insisting that it is not a monopoly and that its products and services are designed to benefit consumers. In a statement, a Google spokesperson said, \"We understand the importance of competition and innovation, and we are committed to ensuring that our products and services are available to everyone, regardless of their location or device.\"\n\nAs the debate over Google's dominance continues to rage, it remains to be seen whether regulators will ultimately conclude that the company is a monopoly. But one thing is clear: the growing power of tech giants like Google and Facebook is changing the way we interact with the internet, and it's up to regulators and policymakers to ensure that these companies are held accountable for their actions.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- For another year, the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ended with a single, strong message aimed at Europe: Do more. Yet in a change, signs suggested that European leaders were starting to agree, with more high-ranking ministers and officials talking up the need to slow the pace of budget cutting and bolster growth on the Continent. At the outset of the gathering of finance ministers and central bankers last week, the I.M.F. lowered its global growth forecasts, again citing weakness from Europe. And Christine Lagarde, managing director of the fund, separated nations into three groups that might be described as strong, trying and laggards. In the first group she placed the developing and emerging economies that are the engine of global growth. In the second she put countries that are gaining momentum in their recoveries, like the United States. The third group, she said, contains countries that continue to struggle with their policy response to the crisis -- not growing, and hindering global growth. The third group, Lagarde emphasized, was comprised of European nations, including Germany, France, and Italy, which have been struggling to balance their budgets and stimulate their economies. Despite the IMF's warning, European leaders have been reluctant to deviate from their austerity measures, citing concerns about debt and fiscal responsibility.\n\nHowever, in a departure from past meetings, some European officials began to express a willingness to reconsider their approach. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin, for example, suggested that his country may need to revisit its budget targets in order to boost growth. \"We need to find a new balance between fiscal discipline and economic growth,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly, Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan acknowledged that his country's budget cuts had gone too far, and that it was time to focus on stimulating the economy. \"We need to find a way to grow, not just cut,\" he said.\n\nThe shift in tone was seen as a significant development, as it suggested that European leaders may be finally recognizing the need to adopt a more balanced approach to economic policy. \"For too long, Europe has been fixated on debt reduction, and has neglected the need for growth,\" said a senior IMF official. \"It's about time they started to focus on the right priorities.\"\n\nThe change in tone was also seen as a response to the IMF's revised growth forecasts, which were released at the start of the meeting. The fund cut its global growth forecast to 3.3%, citing weakness in Europe and other advanced economies. The forecast was down from 3.5% in January, and marked the third time this year that the IMF had lowered its growth outlook.\n\nDespite the gloomy forecast, many economists believe that the global economy is still on track for a slow but steady recovery. \"The fundamentals are still in place for growth,\" said one economist. \"What's needed is for policymakers to take a more balanced approach, and focus on stimulating the economy rather than just cutting debt.\"\n\nThe World Bank and IMF meetings are expected to continue to focus on the need for Europe to adopt a more growth-friendly approach. The next meeting is scheduled for October, and is likely to be dominated by discussions of the European Union's economic policies.",

The Ministry of Public Security said people working for the drug maker had bribed doctors, hospitals and government officials and funneled illicit payoffs through travel agencies, pharmaceutical industry associations and project financing. The government did not name any executives or detailed figures. The revelations have sent shockwaves through the pharmaceutical industry, with many calling for increased transparency and accountability from multinational corporations operating in China. The Chinese government has been cracking down on corruption in recent years, and this latest scandal is seen as a major blow to the company's reputation.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline has faced numerous allegations of wrongdoing in China in the past, including claims of price-fixing and intellectual property theft. However, this latest admission of bribery and fraud is the most serious yet, and has sparked widespread outrage among Chinese citizens and government officials alike.\n\nThe Ministry of Public Security has launched an investigation into the matter, and several executives from GlaxoSmithKline have been detained for questioning. The company has issued a statement apologizing for the actions of its employees, but has stopped short of admitting to any wrongdoing.\n\nThe scandal has also raised questions about the role of foreign companies in China's healthcare system. Critics have long argued that multinational corporations like GlaxoSmithKline have too much influence over the country's healthcare policy, and that this has led to a lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call for the pharmaceutical industry,\" said Dr. Li Wei, a leading expert on healthcare policy in China. \"For too long, companies like GlaxoSmithKline have been able to operate with impunity in China, using their wealth and influence to get what they want. It's time for the government to take a closer look at the industry and ensure that it is operating in the best interests of the Chinese people.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has announced plans to increase oversight of the pharmaceutical industry, and to crack down on corruption and fraud. The Ministry of Public Security has also launched a nationwide campaign to root out corruption in the healthcare system, and to ensure that healthcare professionals are not being bribed or coerced into promoting certain products or treatments.\n\nIn the meantime, GlaxoSmithKline has suspended several employees and launched an internal investigation into the matter. The company has also pledged to cooperate fully with the Chinese authorities and to take all necessary steps to ensure that its operations in China are transparent and ethical.\n\nThe scandal is a major embarrassment for GlaxoSmithKline, and is likely to have significant implications for the company's business in China. However, it is also an opportunity for the company to demonstrate its commitment to transparency and accountability, and to work with the Chinese government to improve the healthcare system in the country.",

The move comes after the Greens blamed outsourcing for the breach in the Business Information Services system which held expenses and credit-card information dating from 2004 to 2015. The opposition's social services spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, and cybersecurity spokeswoman, Gai Brodtmann, said Labor was \"deeply concerned\" by the breach because the government had a responsibility to keep its employees' data safe. Compromised data included credit-card information, employees' names, user names, work phone numbers, work emails, system passwords, Australian government services numbers, public service classifications and organisation units. \"The minister must now outline what is being done to investigate this breach, explain to staff exactly how their data was exposed, for how long and whether it is now safe, and confirm whether his department complies with the mandated cybersecurity standards,\" they said. \"It's the government's responsibility to ensure the cyber-resilience of government agencies and this responsibility extends to the contractors that government agencies employ.\" The investigation, which is expected to take several weeks, will focus on determining the extent of the breach, how it occurred, and what measures can be taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. The Department of Social Services has already begun notifying the affected employees and has set up a dedicated hotline for them to seek information and support.\n\nAccording to sources, the breach was discovered by a third-party contractor who was conducting a routine audit of the Business Information Services system. The contractor reportedly found that the system had been left unsecured, allowing unauthorized access to the sensitive information.\n\nThe Greens have been vocal in their criticism of the government's handling of the breach, with Senator Rachel Siewert stating that the incident highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the government's use of contractors. \"This is not the first time we've seen a data breach occur due to the government's reliance on contractors,\" she said. \"It's time for the government to take responsibility for the security of its own data and to hold contractors accountable for their actions.\"\n\nThe opposition has also called for greater investment in cybersecurity measures to prevent similar breaches in the future. \"This breach is a wake-up call for the government to take cybersecurity seriously and to invest in the necessary measures to protect the data of its employees and the public,\" said Labor's cybersecurity spokeswoman, Gai Brodtmann.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the Department of Social Services has issued a statement assuring employees that the agency is taking the breach seriously and is working to rectify the situation. \"We understand the concern and distress that this breach has caused and we are committed to ensuring that our employees' personal information is protected,\" said a spokesperson for the department.\n\nThe investigation is expected to provide more information on the extent of the breach and the actions being taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Apple's surprise, retroactive tax bill â€“ which is believed to be the largest in history â€“ has raised both condemnation and alarm in the technology industry, particularly for companies with a long history of operations in Ireland. According to Dean Garfield, president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council â€“ a Washington DC-based technology industry advocacy group that counts significant multinational Irish technology players Amazon, Apple, Dell, EMC, Facebook, Google, HP, Intel and Microsoft as members â€“ the key issue for them lies in the confusing and retroactive nature of yesterday's decision, which applies to tax arrangements from 2003 to 2014. \"The commission's decision calls into question whether following the laws in an EU member state is a guarantee that you are playing by the rules in Europe,\" he said. \"We are deeply concerned by the commission's departure from established channels of multilateral cooperation on tax policy in favor of a unilateral approach that, by imposing unforeseeable and retroactive penalties, risks chilling transatlantic commerce and investment and growth in the EU at the expense of US taxpayers.\" The technology industry is reeling from the European Commission's decision, with many companies expressing concerns over the potential implications for their own operations in Ireland. The commission's move has sparked a heated debate over the role of tax havens and the need for greater transparency in international taxation.\n\nIndustry insiders point out that the decision is not just a blow to Apple, but also to the many other companies that have invested heavily in Ireland over the years. \"This decision sets a dangerous precedent and creates uncertainty for companies that have followed the rules and paid their taxes in Ireland,\" said a senior executive at a major technology firm, who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nThe commission's decision is also being seen as a victory for the European Union's efforts to crack down on corporate tax avoidance. The EU has long been critical of Ireland's tax regime, which has been accused of being too lenient and allowing companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\n\nHowever, the move has also raised concerns over the potential impact on the global economy. The US government has already weighed in, with the White House expressing \"concerns\" over the decision and calling for a more \"coordinated\" approach to taxation.\n\nThe decision has also sparked a debate over the role of tax havens and the need for greater transparency in international taxation.

In its starkest warning over Brexit yet, the customs manager of the German carmaker's UK operations said its manufacturing set-up would not be able to cope with obstructions to its supply chain. \"We always said we can do our best and prepare everything, but if, at the end of the day the supply chain will have a stop at the border, then we cannot produce our products in the UK,\" Stephan Freismuth told the Financial Times. BMW employs 8,000 people in the UK, including 4,500 at its flagship plant in Cowley, Oxford, where it produces the Mini. The BMW warning comes ahead of of a key motor manufacturing industry conference on Tuesday where a series of automotive executives from companies with major UK manufacturing operations are expected to express serious concerns about the future of their businesses. The warning from BMW highlights the growing uncertainty and anxiety within the UK's automotive industry as the country's departure from the European Union draws near. The industry, which is heavily reliant on just-in-time supply chains, is particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by customs delays and border checks.\n\nIndustry insiders have long warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to significant delays and costs for manufacturers, but the scale of the potential impact has only become clearer in recent weeks. The UK's automotive sector is already facing significant challenges, including a decline in demand for diesel cars and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe UK government has sought to reassure the industry that it is working to mitigate the risks of a no-deal Brexit, but many manufacturers remain skeptical.

Its pieces have graced museums and the tables of the world's wealthy and aspiring middle class. In March, the Pitti Palace, in Florence, will exhibit Ginori porcelain from the Napoleonic occupation of Tuscany. All of that is little consolation, however, to the more than 300 workers of the factory who now face unemployment. After years of wobbly bottom lines, the factory was declared bankrupt in January. On a chilly morning recently, workers milled about the entrance, hoping for a new owner who could save the company and preserve the heart of this town, barnacled snugly to Florence, where every family is connected to the factory in one way or another. \"There are laws to save pandas,\" Valentina Puggelli, an employee in the company's communications office. \"We want to save something as rare.\" Formal dining is gradually dying out, and with it the market for handmade porcelain, which is painstakingly slow and expensive to produce. Like so many similarly sized Italian industries, the company faced a choice between trying to preserve its status -- and market -- as a high-end niche product with a \"Made in Italy\" cachet, or to appeal to the broader, less expensive tastes of a global marketplace. As the sun rose over the small town of Sesto Fiorentino, the once-thriving Richard Ginori factory stood as a testament to the region's rich cultural heritage. The factory's iconic logo, adorned with the image of a lion, seemed to gaze out at the crowd of workers gathered at the entrance, their faces etched with worry and uncertainty.\n\nDespite the factory's long history and reputation for producing exquisite porcelain, the company's financial struggles had been building for years. The rise of mass-produced, affordable ceramics had eroded the market for handmade porcelain, leaving Richard Ginori struggling to stay afloat.\n\n\"It's not just about the factory,\" said Puggelli, her voice laced with emotion. \"It's about the community. This factory has been a part of our lives for generations. We're not just talking about jobs, we're talking about a way of life.\"\n\nAs the workers waited for news of a potential buyer or investor, the town of Sesto Fiorentino was grappling with the very real possibility of losing a piece of its identity. The factory's closure would not only devastate the local economy but also leave a gaping hole in the town's cultural fabric.\n\nIn the meantime, the Pitti Palace's upcoming exhibition of Richard Ginori porcelain was a bittersweet reminder of the factory's rich heritage. The event, which will feature over 200 pieces of porcelain, is expected to attract visitors from around the world and provide a much-needed boost to the local economy.\n\nHowever, for the workers, the exhibition serves as a painful reminder of what could have been. \"We're proud of our heritage, but it's not just about the past,\" said Puggelli. \"We want to preserve the future of this factory and the community it supports.\"\n\nAs the search for a new owner continues, the fate of Richard Ginori remains uncertain. One thing is clear, however: the closure of the factory would not only be a devastating blow to the local community but also a loss for the world of art and design.\n\nIn a world where mass production and globalization have become the norm, the Richard Ginori factory stands as a testament to the value of craftsmanship, tradition, and community. As the workers of Sesto Fiorentino wait anxiously for news of the factory's future, they are holding on to the hope that this iconic brand will continue to thrive, preserving a piece of Italy's cultural heritage for generations to come.",

Many other politicians have stopped short of that, saying only that the company should have acted faster to stop it. The comments to the radio station, which is based in San Francisco and broadcasts to much of Ms. Pelosi's district in Northern California, could escalate the clash between lawmakers and Facebook. Officials from both parties have criticized Facebook for acting too slowly to police harmful content, such as a live stream of a shooting this March in Christchurch, New Zealand.

In March, the company was criticized for its response to a live stream of a shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, which was broadcast on its platform.\n\nPelosi's comments are likely to add to the growing pressure on Facebook to take more decisive action to combat disinformation and misinformation on its platform.

The aerospace and automotive parts manufacturer is fighting for its life after rejecting a Â£7.4bn offer from Melrose, a corporate turnaround company that specialises in buying unloved industrial assets, improving the financial returns and selling for a huge premium. The offer consists of 1.49 new Melrose shares and 81p in cash for each GKN share. The annual results, expected to be published on Thursday, will provide a clearer picture of GKN's financial health and potentially spark a renewed bid from Melrose. The aerospace and automotive parts manufacturer has been under pressure from its largest shareholder, Sanne de Jong, who has been pushing for a sale to unlock value for investors.\n\nGKN's board has consistently rejected Melrose's offer, citing concerns over the deal's structure and the potential impact on the company's long-term strategy.

The company has been a major player in the aerospace and automotive sectors, supplying parts to companies such as Boeing, Airbus, and Ford.\n\nThe annual results are expected to provide a detailed breakdown of GKN's financial performance over the past year, including its revenue, profit, and cash flow. The company's management will also provide an update on its strategic plans and outlook for the future.\n\nThe takeover battle has also raised questions over the role of activist investors, such as Sanne de Jong, who have been increasingly influential in shaping the direction of UK companies. The controversy has sparked a wider debate over the impact of activist investors on corporate governance and the interests of shareholders.\n\nAs the battle for control of GKN reaches its climax, investors will be closely watching the annual results and any potential developments in the takeover bid.

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Emily Chang caused a mini earthquake in Silicon Valley last month when Vanity Fair published an excerpt from her new book, \"Brotopia.\" With a headline that promised to bring us inside Silicon Valley's \"secretive, orgiastic dark side,\" Ms. Chang laid out how drug-fueled sex parties were happening behind the scenes at the homes of wealthy tech executives and investors. One party she described was later tied to the home of Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist who left his firm last year amid an investigation into his behavior with women. In \"Brotopia,\" which hits book stores on Feb. 6, the secret sex parties are just a symptom of a much deeper problem that Silicon Valley's tech industry has with its treatment of women. Ms. Chang's examination of that issue coincides with the #MeToo moment and the broader debate about gender equality that it has sparked. Ms. Chang, 37, who anchors a Bloomberg TV tech show, recently discussed the roots of Silicon Valley's gender imbalance and the predominance of tech industry bros -- you know, those cocky young men who swagger about. Edited excerpts follow. Pui-Wing Tam How did Silicon Valley become the land of the bros? Emily Chang It didn't have to be this way and it wasn't always this way, importantly. Women played vital roles in the computing industry from the very beginning. Just think \"Hidden Figures,\" but industrywide. Excerpts of \"Brotopia,\" including one describing secret sex parties at the homes of tech industry luminaries, have caused a stir. What happened in the 1960s and 1970s was that the industry was exploding and was starved for talent. There just weren't enough people to do the jobs in computing. So they hired these two psychologists, William Cannon and Dallis Perry, to come up with a personality test to screen for good programmers. Those men decided, in screening about 1,200 men and 200 women, that good programmers don't like people -- that they have a complete disinterest in people. These tests were widely influential and used at various companies for decades. What happens with that is that if you search for antisocial people, you will hire far more men than women. There's no evidence to suggest that antisocial men are better at computers than women. This early emphasis on individualistic and competitive traits in programming helped create a culture that valued and rewarded the \"bro\" mentality, where men were more likely to thrive and advance. The industry's reliance on these personality tests also perpetuated the myth that women were less suited for careers in tech.\n\nAs the industry grew and evolved, this cultural bias was reinforced by the lack of diversity in the workplace. Women who did manage to break into the field often faced discrimination, harassment, and unconscious bias, making it difficult for them to advance or feel valued. The bro culture, which celebrated a certain type of aggressive, competitive, and often entitled behavior, became the norm.\n\nChang argues that this toxic culture has had far-reaching consequences, from the lack of diversity in tech leadership to the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault. She points to the numerous high-profile cases of tech executives and investors accused of sexual misconduct, including those mentioned in her book.\n\nThe problem, Chang believes, is not just with individual perpetrators, but with the systemic and cultural issues that allow these behaviors to flourish. She argues that the tech industry's emphasis on competition, individualism, and profit over people has created an environment where women are often marginalized, excluded, and exploited.\n\nIn \"Brotopia,\" Chang presents a scathing critique of the tech industry's treatment of women, drawing on extensive research and interviews with industry insiders, including women who have spoken out about their experiences. She also highlights the ways in which the industry's emphasis on innovation and disruption has often come at the expense of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nThe book is not without controversy, with some critics accusing Chang of sensationalism and oversimplification. However, many have praised her for shedding light on a long-overdue conversation about the tech industry's treatment of women.\n\nAs the #MeToo movement continues to gain momentum, Chang's book is likely to spark a renewed focus on the need for greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in the tech industry. With \"Brotopia,\" she is calling on Silicon Valley to confront its dark side and work towards a more equitable and just future for all.",

        "Text": "David Elliott was herding sheep on his motorbike in Queensland, Australia, in 2005 when he came across a pile of fossilized dinosaur bones. He, his wife Judy and their children began piecing together tailbones, toe bones and bits of limbs. Now, 11 years later, paleontologists have confirmed that the fragments the family collected belong to a new species of titanosaur, a long-necked behemoth that roamed the area about 95 million years ago. Its official name, fittingly, is Savannasaurus elliottorum. But to the Elliotts, it's \"Wade.\" Paleontologists at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, where Mr. Elliott is the executive chairman, said Wade was one of Australia's most complete sauropods, the dinosaur family that includes titanosaurs. The researchers believe the findings may provide insight into why these massive animals migrated from present-day South America into present-day Australia and Antarctica, back when the three were connected as a part of the landmass Gondwana. The results were published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. Sauropods were thick and round like hippopotamuses, with long legs and towering necks. The discovery of Savannasaurus elliottorum, affectionately known as Wade, is a significant addition to the field of paleontology, providing a unique window into the lives of these massive creatures. According to Dr. Matt McCurry, a lead researcher on the project, the fossil fragments found by the Elliott family are remarkably well-preserved, allowing scientists to reconstruct a nearly complete skeleton of the titanosaur.\n\n\"Wade is an incredible find, not just because of its completeness, but also because it provides us with a new perspective on the evolution of sauropods,\" Dr. McCurry explained. \"We've been able to study the fossilized bones in great detail, and what we've found is that Wade has a unique combination of characteristics that set it apart from other known sauropods.\"\n\nOne of the most striking features of Wade is its size. Estimated to be around 12-15 meters in length, it is one of the largest sauropods ever found in Australia. Its long neck and tail, as well as its powerful legs, suggest that it was well-adapted to its environment, likely roaming the coastal regions of what is now Queensland in search of food.\n\nThe discovery of Wade also sheds new light on the migration patterns of sauropods during the Cretaceous period. According to Dr. McCurry, the findings suggest that these massive animals may have been drawn to Australia and Antarctica by the presence of lush, tropical forests and abundant food sources.\n\n\"This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the ancient world,\" Dr. McCurry said. \"It's a reminder that even in the most remote and inhospitable environments, there is always the potential for new and exciting discoveries to be made.\"\n\nThe Elliott family, who were instrumental in the discovery of Wade, are thrilled to see their find being recognized as a significant contribution to the field of paleontology. \"We're just glad that our passion for dinosaurs has led to this amazing discovery,\" said David Elliott, the family patriarch. \"We're proud to have been a part of this journey, and we can't wait to see what other secrets the earth holds.\"\n\nThe discovery of Savannasaurus elliottorum, or Wade, is a testament to the power of collaboration and curiosity, and is sure to captivate the imagination of dinosaur enthusiasts and scientists alike. As researchers continue to study the fossil fragments, they are likely to uncover even more secrets about this fascinating creature and its place in the ancient world.",

        "Text": "Two years ago, archaeologists excavating an ancient grave at Pylos in southwestern Greece pulled out a grime-encrusted object, less than an inch and half long, that looked like some kind of large bead. They put it aside to focus on more prominent items, like gold rings, that also were packed into the rich grave. But later, as a conservator removed the lime accretions on the bead's face, it turned out to be something quite different: a seal stone, a gemstone engraved with a design that can be stamped on clay or wax. The seal stone's image, a striking depiction of one warrior in battle with two others, is carved in remarkably fine detail, with some features that are barely visible to the naked eye. The image is easier to appreciate in a large-scale drawing of the original. \"The detail is astonishing, especially given the size. Aesthetically, it's a masterpiece of miniature art,\" said John Bennet, director of the British School at Athens, an archaeological institute. The discovery of the seal stone has sent shockwaves through the archaeological community, providing a unique glimpse into the lives of ancient Mycenaeans. According to Dr. Bennet, the seal stone is a rare find, especially considering its exceptional condition and intricate design.\n\n\"This seal stone is one of the most significant discoveries in recent years,\" said Dr. Bennet. \"It's a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the ancient Mycenaeans, who were known for their expertise in metalwork and gemstone carving.\"\n\nThe seal stone is believed to have been created during the Late Bronze Age, around 1200 BCE, when the Mycenaeans were at the height of their power. The image depicted on the stone shows a warrior engaged in battle with two others, showcasing the intensity and brutality of ancient warfare.\n\nThe discovery of the seal stone has also shed new light on the cultural and social dynamics of ancient Mycenae. According to Dr. Bennet, the seal stone may have been used as a symbol of status or power, perhaps belonging to a high-ranking warrior or noble.\n\n\"The fact that this seal stone was buried with the deceased suggests that it held significant cultural or spiritual value,\" said Dr. Bennet. \"It's a reminder that even in ancient times, people had a deep appreciation for beauty and craftsmanship.\"\n\nThe seal stone is currently undergoing conservation and analysis at the British School at Athens, where it will be studied and exhibited in the coming months. The discovery is expected to have a significant impact on our understanding of ancient Mycenae, and will likely be a major attraction for visitors to the region.\n\nAs news of the discovery spreads, archaeologists and historians are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to study the seal stone up close. With its intricate design and rich cultural significance, this small but remarkable artifact is set to make a big impact on our understanding of the ancient world.",

        "Text": "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is still waiting for clear evidence that the economy can grow decently without its help. The Fed's widely expected announcement on Wednesday that it would press ahead with its stimulus campaign of asset purchases and low interest rates reflected the reality that the nation's central bankers gained little clarity in the six weeks since their last meeting, in part because the government shutdown delayed and distorted key economic indicators. The statement, issued after a scheduled two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, amounted to a declaration that the Fed is not yet ready to decide, and it shed little light on how soon changes may come. The Fed maintained its optimistic assessment of \"growing underlying strength in the broader economy,\" contrasting the recovery of the private sector with the continued drag of federal spending cuts. It said that the availability of jobs was improving and that it expected inflation to rebound from its sluggish pace. Notably, it made no direct mention of the shutdown. The Fed's decision to maintain its current monetary policy stance was widely expected by economists and financial markets, who had been bracing for a potential shift in the central bank's stance. Despite the lack of clarity on the economy's prospects, the Fed's statement did offer some hints about its thinking on the future direction of interest rates and asset purchases.\n\nIn a press conference following the release of the statement, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke emphasized that the central bank is closely monitoring the economy and is prepared to adjust its policy if necessary. However, he also cautioned that any changes to the stimulus program would depend on the strength of the data, and that the Fed is not yet convinced that the economy is strong enough to stand on its own.\n\nThe Fed's decision to maintain its current policy stance was seen as a positive sign for the economy, as it suggests that the central bank is still committed to supporting growth. However, some economists expressed concerns that the Fed's continued easing could lead to inflationary pressures down the line.\n\n\"The Fed is still trying to stimulate the economy, but it's a delicate balance,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"If the economy continues to grow, the Fed will eventually need to start tightening, but for now, it's still trying to get the economy out of neutral.\"\n\nThe Fed's statement also highlighted the continued disparity between the private and public sectors. While the private sector has been showing signs of growth, the government shutdown has had a significant impact on federal spending and hiring. The Fed noted that the shutdown had delayed and distorted key economic indicators, making it difficult to get a clear reading on the economy's prospects.\n\nThe shutdown, which lasted for 16 days, had a significant impact on the economy, particularly in the areas of government contracting and tourism. The Fed's statement did not provide a direct estimate of the shutdown's impact on the economy, but economists have estimated that it could have shaved off as much as 0.5 percentage points from the nation's GDP.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the shutdown, the Fed remains optimistic about the economy's prospects. In its statement, the central bank noted that it expects inflation to rebound from its sluggish pace, and that the availability of jobs is improving. However, the Fed also cautioned that the economy still faces significant headwinds, including the ongoing drag from federal spending cuts.\n\nThe Fed's decision to maintain its current policy stance is likely to have a muted impact on financial markets, which have been expecting a continuation of the stimulus program. However, the central bank's statement did offer some hints about its thinking on the future direction of interest rates and asset purchases, which could have implications for investors and consumers.\n\nOverall, the Fed's decision to maintain its current policy stance reflects the central bank's ongoing efforts to support the economy. While the shutdown has presented significant challenges, the Fed remains committed to its goal of promoting maximum employment and price stability.",

        "Text": "How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Mike Isaac, a technology reporter for The Times based in San Francisco, discussed the tech he's using. You write a lot about Uber. How many Ubers or Lyfts do you take a week? It varies, to be honest. For a while back in 2013 to 2014, I was a frequent user of both services in San Francisco and New York. Plus, since I'm reporting on the companies, I need a good grasp of what Uber and Lyft are up to in designing their products. But I stopped using them both altogether for a while, because I was uncomfortable with either company knowing my location (even when I wasn't using the app, in Uber's case) and where I was going to meet people while doing my job. Paranoia? Maybe. Despite his initial reservations, Isaac eventually returned to using ride-hailing services, albeit with a greater sense of awareness about the companies' data collection practices. \"I started using them again, but this time with a more critical eye,\" he explained. \"I realized that, as a journalist, it's my job to understand how these companies operate, and that includes their use of location data and other personal information.\"\n\nIsaac's experience highlights the complex relationship between technology and journalism. On one hand, technology has revolutionized the way journalists work, providing them with new tools and platforms to gather and disseminate information. On the other hand, the same technologies that enable journalists to do their jobs can also pose significant risks to their personal and professional lives.\n\nFor Isaac, the use of ride-hailing services is just one example of how technology has become an integral part of his reporting. \"I use a lot of different tools and apps to get my job done,\" he said. \"From social media to messaging apps, I'm constantly using technology to stay connected with sources, gather information, and fact-check stories.\"\n\nBut Isaac's reliance on technology goes beyond just his reporting. He also uses it extensively in his personal life, often using apps and services to stay organized and manage his time. \"As a journalist, you're always on the clock,\" he explained. \"You're constantly thinking about your next story, your next deadline, and how you're going to get everything done. Technology helps me stay on top of all that, and makes it easier for me to balance my work and personal life.\"\n\nDespite the many benefits of technology, Isaac also acknowledges the potential risks and challenges it poses. \"As a journalist, you have to be careful about what you're sharing online, and who you're sharing it with,\" he said. \"You also have to be mindful of the companies you're working with, and the data they're collecting about you. It's a constant balancing act, and one that requires a lot of thought and consideration.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Mike Isaac's use of technology is a reflection of the complex and multifaceted nature of journalism in the digital age. While technology has opened up new opportunities and possibilities for journalists, it also poses significant challenges and risks. As Isaac's experience demonstrates, journalists must be thoughtful and intentional in their use of technology, balancing the benefits of these tools with the potential risks and consequences.",

They need to communicate with humans, which means they have to be able to see. They have to judge from a human's perspective and know what is right or wrong. They also need to understand the instructions we give them, and carry out these instructions without mistakes. BUT it's impossible for robots to fully replace humans.

VO: This robot is making compressors for Midea, which makes a third of the world's air conditioner compressors. The same robot also makes LEGOs, assembles cars, and packs ham. As the world becomes increasingly dependent on technology, the concept of \"replacing humans with robots\" has become a hot topic of discussion. In the city of Shunde, a project with the same name has been underway to revolutionize the way industries operate.\n\nAccording to the project's goal, the aim is to reduce the number of employees by half, which would significantly impact the city's population. Shunde, with a total population of 2,400,000, has half of its residents comprising immigrant workers from other provinces. This move is expected to bring about a major shift in the city's demographics.\n\nThe robot, showcased at the project's demonstration, has already made significant strides in various industries. It has been seen making compressors for Midea, a company that produces a third of the world's air conditioner compressors. Additionally, the robot has also been used to assemble cars, pack hams, and even build LEGOs.\n\nHowever, despite the impressive capabilities of this robot, experts argue that it is impossible for robots to fully replace humans. \"Robots can only do what they are programmed to do, whereas humans have the ability to think critically and make decisions,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading robotics expert.\n\nThe project's lead researcher, Dr. John Lee, acknowledged the limitations of robots but emphasized the importance of developing more human-like robots. \"Our goal is to create robots that can communicate with humans, understand our instructions, and make decisions based on human values,\" he said.\n\nThe development of such robots is expected to have a significant impact on various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and education. However, as the project progresses, it is crucial to consider the social and economic implications of replacing human workers with robots.\n\nAs the world continues to evolve, the debate surrounding the role of robots in society is likely to intensify. While robots have the potential to revolutionize industries, it is essential to strike a balance between technological advancements and human values.",

The RMT union and Southern's operating company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), both issued statements on Monday proclaiming their readiness for talks, but the parties are yet to agree to a meeting. The long-running dispute over planned changes to the role of conductors, which the union fears will threaten jobs, has led to 15 days of strikes since April, adding to major disruption caused by staff shortages and engineering works. RMT members will strike all day on Friday and Saturday, and five more days of strikes are planned in November and December. As the strike action approaches, commuters are bracing themselves for yet another round of disruptions to their daily routines. The RMT union has been vocal in its opposition to the changes, which it claims will compromise the safety of passengers and the well-being of conductors.\n\n\"We are not opposed to modernization, but we are opposed to the way it's being done,\" said Mick Cash, RMT general secretary. \"The changes will lead to a significant reduction in the number of conductors on trains, making it more difficult for us to ensure the safety of passengers.\"\n\nGTR, on the other hand, maintains that the changes are necessary to improve the efficiency and punctuality of its services. The company has implemented a new system, which it claims will allow trains to run more frequently and reduce delays.\n\n\"The changes are designed to improve the customer experience and provide better services for our passengers,\" said a GTR spokesperson. \"We are committed to finding a solution that works for everyone involved, but we cannot compromise on the safety and efficiency of our services.\"\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing since April, with both sides failing to reach an agreement. The strike action has already caused significant disruptions to Southern's services, with many trains cancelled or delayed. The situation is expected to worsen over the coming weeks, as the number of strike days increases.\n\nPassengers are being advised to plan ahead and check for updates before traveling. The RMT union has also set up a website and social media channels to provide information and updates on the strike action.\n\nThe dispute has also sparked concerns about the impact on the local economy. Many businesses rely on the railway to transport goods and services, and the disruptions are expected to have a significant impact on trade and commerce.\n\nAs the strike action approaches, it remains to be seen whether the two sides will be able to reach a compromise. The RMT union has called for the government to intervene and resolve the dispute, but so far, there has been no indication that this will happen.\n\nIn the meantime, commuters are left to wonder when the dispute will be resolved and when they will be able to travel safely and reliably on Southern trains again.",

Npower, EDF and Scottish Power have already announced price rises for millions of customers, blaming a mix of rising wholesale costs, installation of smart meters and government policies paid for through bills. British Gas has frozen prices until August, while SSE and E.ON have yet to declare their intentions. The chief executive of Energy UK, which represents most of the 40-plus energy suppliers, told MPs on Wednesday that the rises were justified. \"It is plain that we have seen increases in wholesale prices over the last 12 months or so, and we can see going out into the future there are continuing pressures there,\" said Lawrence Slade. He said month-ahead wholesale gas prices for March were 100% higher than last year, and electricity was up 69%. The warning comes as energy bills are set to rise for millions of households across the UK, with some suppliers increasing prices by as much as 12% for certain customers. The price hikes have been met with widespread criticism from consumer groups and politicians, who argue that the energy companies are profiteering from the situation.\n\nDespite the criticism, Energy UK's chief executive, Lawrence Slade, maintained that the price rises are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry. \"We understand that price increases can be difficult for consumers, but we must also ensure that our industry remains viable and able to invest in the infrastructure and services that customers rely on,\" he said.\n\nHowever, some experts have questioned whether the price hikes are justified, given the recent falls in global oil prices. \"It's unclear why wholesale gas prices are increasing so sharply, especially when global oil prices are falling,\" said Dr. Emma Pinchbeck, an energy economist at the University of Cambridge. \"It's possible that the energy companies are using the price increases to pad their profits, rather than simply passing on the costs to consumers.\"\n\nThe price hikes are also causing concern among vulnerable households, who are already struggling to make ends meet. \"These price increases will have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, who are already paying a significant proportion of their income on energy bills,\" said Mike Clarke, chief executive of the charity, Age UK. \"We urge the energy companies to take a more responsible approach to pricing, and to consider the impact on vulnerable customers.\"\n\nThe government has also come under pressure to take action to protect consumers from the price hikes. Labour MP, Rachel Reeves, has called for an investigation into the energy companies' pricing practices, and has suggested that the government should introduce price controls to prevent excessive price increases. \"The energy companies are taking advantage of their customers, and it's time for the government to take action to protect them,\" she said.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Energy UK has announced that it will be launching an investigation into the price hikes, and will be working with the energy companies to ensure that they are being transparent about their pricing practices. The industry body has also pledged to provide support to vulnerable households, and to work with the government to develop a long-term strategy for the energy industry.\n\nAs the price hikes take effect, consumers are being advised to shop around for the best deals, and to consider switching to a different energy supplier if they can find a better offer. However, with many suppliers increasing prices across the board, it's unclear how much consumers will be able to save by switching.",

Worlds Adrift has elements of Fortnite - a \"bright, brash multiplayer shooter\" game - combined with World of Warcraft and has been spawned by a developer already used to turning simple ideas into viral smashes. However, it's also hard to sum up in a few words, which may be why Bossa Studios recently decided that the best way to promote their game was to invite a few fans and journalists to play it while dangling from a crane 45 metres above Chelsea College of Art. The stunt made more sense than it seems. The game drops players in a massive multiplayer online world of floating islands, and tasks them with building sky ships to move from one to another, exploring new islands, constructing shelters, and sparring with other fleets for honour, profit or just a laugh. Bossa Studios previous hits include a physics-led comedy hit Surgeon Simulator, in which players are tasked with carrying out complex surgeries through a deliberately obtuse control system, and the mobile version of story-driven Thomas Was Alone about a red rectangle that gains sentience. Back in April 2014, when development started on Worlds Adrift, it looked like a left-field proposition, but four years on, with Fortnite reaching dizzying heights, it looks like it could be perfectly pitched to capture imaginations. The stunt, which was live-streamed on social media, allowed players to experience the game's unique features firsthand, including its innovative ship-building mechanics and the sense of community that comes with exploring and battling with other players. The event was a huge success, with many attendees expressing their excitement and enthusiasm for the game on social media.\n\nSo, what makes Worlds Adrift so special? For starters, its massive multiplayer online world is unlike anything else out there. The game takes place on a series of floating islands, each with its own unique landscape, resources, and secrets. Players can build and customize their own sky ships, which serve as their primary mode of transportation and combat vessel. The game's emphasis on exploration and discovery is also noteworthy, as players are encouraged to explore new islands, uncover hidden secrets, and battle with other fleets for honor, profit, or just for the thrill of it.\n\nBossa Studios' track record of creating innovative and engaging games is also a major factor in Worlds Adrift's potential for success. The studio's previous hits, such as Surgeon Simulator and Thomas Was Alone, have all received critical acclaim and have been praised for their unique gameplay mechanics and humor. With Worlds Adrift, Bossa Studios is looking to build on this success and create a game that will appeal to a wide range of players.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Worlds Adrift is a game that rewards creativity, strategy, and teamwork. Players can work together to build massive ships, explore new islands, and take down powerful enemies. The game also features a robust crafting system, which allows players to create their own weapons, armor, and other items using resources gathered from the environment.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Worlds Adrift is its potential for community growth. The game's massive multiplayer world is designed to encourage player interaction and collaboration, with players able to form alliances, trade resources, and even wage war against each other. The game's developers are also committed to supporting the community, with regular updates and expansions planned to add new features and content.\n\nIn conclusion, Worlds Adrift has all the ingredients of a potential megahit. Its unique gameplay mechanics, massive multiplayer world, and emphasis on exploration and discovery make it a game that is sure to capture the imaginations of gamers around the world. With its innovative ship-building mechanics and sense of community, Worlds Adrift is a game that is not to be missed.",

        "Text": "Water, gas, electricity and broadband are essential household utilities, but a large number of new homes are being built without the infrastructure for a decent broadband connection â€“ or, in some cases, with no service at all. Jennifer Offord, 36, bought her new-build flat in Hackney, east London, in February 2018, four months after it had been completed, only to find out she was not able to sign up to any of the standard providers. \"I had assumed it would be fine as I had never had a problem before, but when I moved in and asked the developer why I couldn't sign up to Sky, I was told Openreach hadn't been set up and I was ruled out of getting any of the affordable TV and internet packages that I wanted,\" she says. Offord asked the developer Taylor Wimpey why her flat had not been set up with Openreach, which would have given her access to providers such as Sky, TalkTalk, BT and Plusnet. According to Offord, the developer initially claimed that the issue was due to a delay in the installation of Openreach equipment, but after several months of back-and-forth, the company finally admitted that the flat had not been designed with a broadband connection in mind. \"They told me that the flat was not built with a broadband connection in mind and that it would be too expensive to install one now,\" she said.\n\nOfford's experience is not an isolated incident. A recent report by the UK's National Infrastructure Commission found that nearly one in five new homes built in the past five years lack a decent broadband connection. The report also revealed that many developers are prioritizing other infrastructure, such as roads and public transportation, over broadband.\n\nIndustry experts attribute the lack of broadband infrastructure in new homes to a combination of factors, including a lack of regulation and a shortage of skilled labor. \"Developers are often more focused on getting the basics right, such as building the structure of the house and installing the necessary utilities,\" said James Pritchard, a telecommunications expert at the University of Cambridge. \"Broadband is often seen as a secondary consideration, and it's only when the homeowner moves in and tries to sign up for a service that the issue becomes apparent.\"\n\nThe lack of broadband infrastructure in new homes is not only a problem for homeowners, but also for the economy as a whole. A report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found that a lack of decent broadband can cost the UK economy up to Â£1.3 billion annually.\n\nIn response to the growing concern, some developers are starting to prioritize broadband infrastructure in their new builds. For example, the developer Persimmon has announced plans to install full-fiber broadband in all of its new homes, starting in 2023. Other developers, such as Barratt Homes, are also committing to installing broadband infrastructure in their new builds.\n\nWhile these developments are promising, Offord and many other homeowners are still left to deal with the consequences of being left without a decent broadband connection. \"It's frustrating and disappointing,\" she said. \"I just want to be able to use the internet like everyone else. It's not too much to ask for a basic utility like broadband.\"",

        "Text": "Airbnb has grown to become not only a great alternative to staying in a hotel but, for many part- and full-time entrepreneurs, a solid source of additional income. It turns out that one group of entrepreneurs in particular is benefiting from the online hospitality service and it's not who you may think. It's entrepreneurial â€¦ teachers. According to a new report issued by the company, almost 10% of the people renting out their homes and properties on Airbnb work in education. How big a deal is this? The company estimates that their 45,000 teacher hosts earned a whopping $160m in 2017, with roughly one-third of their total annual Airbnb earnings from hosting during the summer months alone. On average, teachers earned about $6,500 in supplemental income a year from their Airbnb businesses. In Utah and Wisconsin alone, more than a quarter of all Airbnb hosts that were surveyed said they worked in education. Ohio, with one in five hosts working in the industry, is a close third. The phenomenon of teachers turning to Airbnb as a means of generating additional income is not limited to the United States. A global analysis of Airbnb data reveals that teachers are also thriving in the sharing economy in other countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, nearly 15% of Airbnb hosts are educators, with many using the platform to supplement their income during school holidays.\n\nOne such teacher is Sarah Johnson, who has been hosting on Airbnb for three years. A primary school teacher in London, Johnson uses her earnings to fund her children's extracurricular activities and save for her own retirement. \"Airbnb has been a game-changer for me,\" she says. \"It's allowed me to earn extra money without having to take on a second job, which has given me more time to focus on my teaching career.\"\n\nThe reasons why teachers are drawn to Airbnb are varied, but many cite the flexibility it offers. Unlike traditional part-time jobs, Airbnb allows teachers to set their own schedules and choose when they want to host guests. This is particularly appealing to those with non-traditional teaching schedules, such as those who work part-time or have variable hours.\n\nAirbnb's popularity among teachers is also attributed to its ease of use. The platform's user-friendly interface and robust customer support system make it simple for hosts to manage their properties and respond to guest inquiries. Additionally, Airbnb's pricing algorithm and real-time booking system ensure that hosts receive a fair market rate for their properties.\n\nThe success of teachers on Airbnb has not gone unnoticed. The company has launched a number of initiatives aimed at supporting its educator hosts, including a dedicated \"Teachers\" page on its website, which provides resources and tips on how to get started with hosting. Airbnb has also partnered with several education-focused organizations to offer special discounts and promotions to its teacher hosts.\n\nAs the sharing economy continues to grow, it is likely that we will see even more educators turning to Airbnb as a means of generating additional income. With its flexibility, ease of use, and potential for high earnings, Airbnb has become an attractive option for teachers looking to supplement their income and achieve a better work-life balance.",

Thompson, died on Wednesday in Austin, Tex. He was 82. His death, in a hospital hospice unit, was confirmed by the author Jan Reid, a friend. Friends said Mr. Cartwright had fallen recently inside his home in Austin, where he lived alone, and was unable to reach a phone. He remained there for days before he was discovered and taken to the hospital, they said. Mr. Cartwright was the dean of a loose-knit class of Texas journalists who pushed the bounds of long-form journalism and helped bring national acclaim to the regional magazine some of them wrote for, Texas Monthly. His career with the magazine began with the first issue, in 1973, and continued to his retirement in 2010. He practiced the brand of irreverent, participatory storytelling that Mr. Thompson had made famous as \"gonzo journalism.\" \"He was definitely our version of Hunter Thompson as much as anybody,\" said Evan Smith, the chief executive of The Texas Tribune and a former editor in chief of Texas Monthly. Throughout his illustrious career, Cartwright's writing was marked by its wit, humor, and unflinching honesty. He was known for his ability to capture the essence of Texas culture and politics, often tackling topics that others dared not touch. His reporting was fearless and unapologetic, earning him a reputation as one of the most respected and admired journalists in the state.\n\nCartwright's work at Texas Monthly was instrumental in establishing the magazine as a leading voice in regional journalism. He wrote extensively on politics, music, and culture, and his stories often featured his trademark blend of humor, insight, and irreverence. His reporting on the Texas oil industry, the rise of the Tejano music scene, and the politics of the Texas Legislature were particularly notable, and his stories continue to be widely read and admired today.\n\nIn addition to his work at Texas Monthly, Cartwright also wrote for other publications, including The New Yorker, Harper's, and The Nation. He was a regular contributor to NPR's \"All Things Considered\" and appeared on numerous television programs, including \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" and \"Charlie Rose.\"\n\nCartwright's influence on the world of journalism extends far beyond his own writing. He was a mentor and inspiration to countless young journalists, and his work helped pave the way for a new generation of writers and reporters. His legacy is a testament to the power of good journalism to shape our understanding of the world and to inspire us to think critically about the issues that affect our lives.\n\nIn a statement, Evan Smith, the chief executive of The Texas Tribune and a former editor in chief of Texas Monthly, remembered Cartwright as \"a true original, a master of the craft, and a dear friend.\" \"Gary was a giant of Texas journalism,\" Smith said. \"His writing was always fearless, always funny, and always deeply informed. He was a true original, and his passing leaves a huge hole in our lives.\"\n\nCartwright is survived by his brother, John Cartwright, and his sister, Sue Cartwright. Funeral services are pending, and a memorial service is planned for later this year.\n\nIn the words of Cartwright's friend and fellow journalist, Jan Reid, \"Gary lived life on his own terms, and his writing reflected that. He was a true Texan, a true journalist, and a true original. We will miss him dearly.\"",

Freedom of information requests reveal that the Foreign Office and the Department for International Trade have been championing the interests of British American Tobacco. This is despite the government being forced to draw up new guidelines for UK embassy staff after it emerged in 2012 that the UK ambassador had been lobbying the Panama government on behalf of BAT. The disclosures reveal that in the past four years FO and DIT staff met with British American Tobacco nine times to discuss a long-running tax dispute with the Bangladesh government. The revelations have sparked outrage among anti-smoking campaigners and health experts, who argue that the UK government's actions are contradictory and undermine its efforts to reduce smoking rates globally.\n\n\"This is a clear example of the UK government putting the interests of big tobacco ahead of public health,\" said Dr. Sarah Jones, a leading expert on tobacco control. \"The UK has been a vocal advocate for tobacco control measures around the world, but it seems that when it comes to British American Tobacco, the government is willing to turn a blind eye to its questionable practices.\"\n\nThe tax dispute at the center of the controversy dates back to 2014, when the Bangladesh government imposed a new tax on tobacco products, which British American Tobacco claimed was unfair and discriminatory. The company has been lobbying the UK government to intervene on its behalf, arguing that the tax would have a disproportionate impact on its business operations in the country.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the UK government's involvement in the dispute is not only a conflict of interest but also a breach of its own commitments to tobacco control. In 2015, the UK government pledged to support the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which aims to reduce tobacco use and protect public health.\n\n\"The UK government's actions are a slap in the face to the millions of people around the world who are fighting to reduce the devastating impact of tobacco on their health and economies,\" said Alex Harris, a spokesperson for the anti-smoking group, Action on Smoking and Health. \"It's time for the government to take a stand and prioritize public health over the interests of big tobacco.\"\n\nThe UK government has declined to comment on the specifics of the tax dispute, but a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said that the department's engagement with British American Tobacco was \"routine\" and did not constitute a conflict of interest.\n\nHowever, critics remain skeptical, pointing out that the UK government's involvement in the dispute has been ongoing for years, despite the company's claims that the tax is unfair and discriminatory.\n\n\"The UK government's continued support for British American Tobacco is a clear example of the power of big tobacco to influence government policy,\" said Dr. Jones. \"It's time for the government to take a stand and prioritize the health and well-being of the public over the interests of big tobacco.\"",

        "Text": "Sweeping education reforms appear to be fuelling inequality in the schools system, according to a major analysis that shows high-performing and improving schools are accepting fewer children from poor backgrounds. In a stark assessment of the impact of controversial measures introduced since 2010, the study warns that an original pledge to set schools free and give them more power has actually led to a system that is causing high levels of stress among teachers. It finds the system is now pushing schools and their heads to prioritise \"the interests of the school over the interests of groups of, usually more vulnerable, children\". Some schools were found to be engaged in \"aggressive marketing campaigns and 'cream skimming' aimed at recruiting particular types of students\". The findings form part of a state-of-the-nation study of England's education system, drawn up by academics at the UCL Institute of Education over four years, which will be published on Tuesday. It includes the examination of Ofsted data over a decade, a statistical analysis of the impact of multi-academy trusts (MATs), 47 detailed school case studies and a survey of almost 700 school leaders. The reforms were largely implemented under the coalition government and championed by Michael Gove as education secretary. A plan to force all English schools to become academies was abandoned in 2016 after a backlash among Tory MPs. The study, which will be published on Tuesday, reveals that high-performing schools are increasingly cherry-picking students from more affluent backgrounds, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities. The researchers found that these schools are using aggressive marketing campaigns and \"cream skimming\" tactics to attract students who are more likely to achieve high grades, leaving behind those from poorer backgrounds.\n\nThe report's authors argue that this is a direct result of the education reforms introduced by the coalition government, which aimed to give schools more autonomy and freedom from local authority control. However, the study suggests that this has led to a system where schools are prioritizing their own interests over those of their students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThe researchers analyzed Ofsted data over a decade and found that schools in areas with high levels of deprivation are more likely to be rated as \"inadequate\" or \"requiring improvement\". This has led to a situation where these schools are struggling to attract and retain teachers, and are often forced to rely on unqualified or inexperienced staff.\n\nThe study also highlights the impact of multi-academy trusts (MATs) on the education system. MATs are groups of schools that are run by a single governing body, and the researchers found that these trusts are often prioritizing the interests of the trust over those of individual schools. This has led to a situation where schools are being forced to follow a one-size-fits-all approach, rather than being able to tailor their education to the specific needs of their students.\n\nThe report's authors are calling for a rethink of the education system, and are urging policymakers to prioritize the needs of disadvantaged students. They argue that this can be achieved by giving schools more resources and support, and by introducing measures to tackle the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\nThe findings of the study are likely to spark controversy and debate, and will be closely watched by policymakers and educators. The report's authors are set to present their findings in full on Tuesday, and are expected to make recommendations for how the education system can be improved to benefit all students, regardless of their background.",

We picked four to run online. Here's an update on the students we featured in the column last May. Last year, Shanti Kumar asked in her application essay to Princeton University whether Princeton should be poorer. The university rejected her. Instead, she's about to finish her first year at Cornell University, which has its own enormous endowment. Should it be poorer, too? On one hand, she points out that its endowment, which is most likely over $6 billion, is larger than the gross national product of some countries. Still, she's proud to attend a university with a strong program in agricultural and life sciences. Shanti's thoughts on the university's endowment sparked a lively discussion among her peers, with some arguing that it's unfair for institutions to hold such vast sums of wealth while students struggle to make ends meet. Others countered that the endowment is necessary to fund research, attract top faculty, and provide financial aid to deserving students.\n\nAs she navigates her freshman year at Cornell, Shanti is still grappling with these questions. She is actively involved in the university's Agricultural and Life Sciences department, where she is working on a research project to develop sustainable farming practices. Her experience has given her a unique perspective on the importance of endowments in supporting academic programs.\n\n\"I believe that a university's endowment can be a double-edged sword,\" Shanti said in an interview. \"On one hand, it can provide the resources needed to attract top talent and fund innovative research. On the other hand, it can also perpetuate inequality and create a sense of entitlement among some students.\"\n\nShanti's concerns are echoed by many students who feel that the focus on endowments can distract from the university's core mission of providing a quality education. \"As a student, I don't care about the endowment,\" said Emily Chen, a sophomore at Princeton University who was rejected from Cornell. \"What I care about is getting a good education and having access to resources that will help me succeed after graduation.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding endowments, Shanti remains proud to attend Cornell, which she believes offers her the best opportunity to pursue her academic and professional goals. As she looks to the future, she is excited to continue exploring the intersection of agriculture, sustainability, and economics, and to use her skills to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nIn the meantime, Shanti's essay has inspired a new generation of students to think critically about the role of money and class in higher education. Her story serves as a reminder that even in the most elite institutions, there is always room for discussion and debate about the values that shape our society.",

If Facebook continues to grow at its current rate, the site could have 4.9 billion deceased members by 2100, according to a study by Oxford researchers. Even if growth had stopped entirely last year, the study finds, Facebook would be looking at about 1.4 billion dead members by 2100. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, analyzed Facebook's growth rate and population projections to estimate the number of deceased users on the platform. The researchers used Facebook's publicly available data on the number of users and the rate of growth to make their predictions.\n\nAccording to the study, Facebook's user base is expected to continue growing, with the number of users increasing by 15% annually. If this growth rate continues, the study estimates that Facebook will have more than 4.9 billion users by 2100, with a significant proportion of those users being deceased.\n\nThe researchers also analyzed the number of deceased users on Facebook using a different method, which involved estimating the number of users who had died based on the age and demographics of the user base. This method suggested that even if Facebook's growth had stopped entirely last year, the platform would still have around 1.4 billion deceased users by 2100.\n\nThe study's findings raise important questions about the long-term sustainability of Facebook and other social media platforms. As the number of deceased users grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for the platforms to maintain accurate records of user activity and to ensure the security and privacy of user data.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Alex Pentland, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the findings highlight the need for social media companies to develop more robust systems for managing deceased users' accounts. \"As the number of deceased users grows, it becomes increasingly important for social media companies to have a clear policy in place for handling these accounts,\" Dr. Pentland said.\n\nFacebook has faced criticism in the past for its handling of deceased users' accounts, with some users' accounts remaining active even after they have passed away. The company has faced lawsuits and regulatory action over its handling of user data, including the data of deceased users.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, Facebook said that it takes the issue of deceased users' accounts very seriously and is working to improve its systems for handling these accounts. \"We are committed to providing a safe and respectful experience for all of our users, including those who have passed away,\" a Facebook spokesperson said.\n\nThe study's findings also raise important questions about the impact of social media on society and the long-term sustainability of these platforms.

The next year, when I was 12, grandma suffered a stroke, and from that point she started developing dementia. I became her primary carer, which made it hard to keep up with my GCSEs as grandma would sometimes go missing while I was away from the house. It was a stressful period. Eventually she progressed to the point where it was no longer safe for us to live together without a 24-hour carer, so she was put into a home. I moved back in with my mum, but by Christmas she'd kicked me out. I approached my local council for help and they directed me to social services. They were meant to find a solution â€“ check where I was staying, talk to my mum â€“ but they were really slow and I had to keep calling them. One morning, I went to their office with a black bin bag full of my clothes and I said I wasn't going to move until they helped me. By 4pm that same day, they put me in touch with the charity Centrepoint and my keyworker found me a place to stay. As I settled into my new temporary home, I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. The constant stress of caring for my grandmother and navigating the complexities of social services had taken a toll on my mental and physical health. I was exhausted, both emotionally and physically.\n\nBut my journey was far from over. I was still struggling to come to terms with the loss of my grandmother, who had been my primary caregiver and confidant. The memories of our time together, despite the challenges, were bittersweet. I was grateful for the time we had, but the pain of her passing still lingered.\n\nMeanwhile, Centrepoint, the charity that had taken me under their wing, was working tirelessly to help me get back on my feet. My keyworker, Rachel, was a beacon of hope and support. She listened to my story, offered guidance, and connected me with resources that I desperately needed.\n\nWith Rachel's help, I began to rebuild my life. I started attending counseling sessions to process my emotions and work through the trauma I had experienced. I also enrolled in a local college, where I was able to catch up on my education and set my sights on a brighter future.\n\nAs I looked back on the journey that had brought me to this point, I realized that it had been a crucible of sorts. The struggles I had faced had tested my resilience, but they had also taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, adaptability, and the importance of seeking help when you need it.\n\nToday, I am proud to say that I am thriving. I am back in school, pursuing my passion for art, and I am determined to make a difference in my community. I know that I am not alone in my struggles, and I hope that my story will inspire others to seek help and support when they need it most.\n\nThe experience has also given me a newfound appreciation for the importance of social services and the work that organizations like Centrepoint do to support vulnerable young people like myself. I am grateful for the kindness and compassion that I received during my darkest hour, and I am committed to paying it forward in any way that I can.",

Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition regulator, said the deal between the London and Frankfurt exchanges would create a \"de facto monopoly in the crucial area of fixed income instruments\". The commission's opposition ends a deal that had been in the making for 13 months. LSE Group and Deutsche BÃ¶rse had pledged to press ahead with the deal even after Britain voted to leave the EU last June, but this is the third failed attempt at a merger between the two companies after previous setbacks in 2000 and 2005. The proposed tie-up had been criticised across Europe, including in France, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands, which were concerned about the future of their own exchanges. Critics in Frankfurt also questioned why the enlarged company was going to be based in London given Deutsche BÃ¶rse would have held 54.4% of the shares in the group and Britain is leaving the EU. The collapse of the merger deal is seen as a significant blow to the ambitions of the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche BÃ¶rse, which had hoped to create a major global player in the financial markets. The European Commission's decision to block the deal is also a major setback for the UK's financial sector, which had been counting on the merger to strengthen its position in the global economy.\n\nThe commission's concerns about the creation of a \"de facto monopoly\" in fixed income instruments were echoed by critics in Europe, who had expressed fears about the potential impact on their own exchanges. The proposed merger had also raised concerns about the concentration of power in the financial sector, with some arguing that it would create a dominant player that would stifle competition and innovation.\n\nThe collapse of the deal is also seen as a significant blow to the UK's financial sector, which had been counting on the merger to strengthen its position in the global economy. The UK's decision to leave the EU had already created uncertainty for the financial sector, and the collapse of the merger deal is likely to add to those concerns.\n\nIn a statement, the London Stock Exchange Group said it was \"disappointed\" by the commission's decision, but acknowledged that it had been unable to overcome the regulator's concerns. Deutsche BÃ¶rse also expressed disappointment, saying that it had been unable to find a solution that met the commission's requirements.\n\nThe collapse of the merger deal is likely to have significant implications for the financial sector, with some analysts predicting that it could lead to a period of increased competition and consolidation in the industry. Others have suggested that the deal could have been a precursor to a larger merger or acquisition, and its collapse could lead to a period of uncertainty and upheaval in the financial sector.\n\nIn the meantime, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche BÃ¶rse will have to regroup and reassess their plans, with some analysts suggesting that they may look to alternative partnerships or acquisitions to achieve their goals. The collapse of the merger deal is a significant setback for both companies, but it is also an opportunity for them to rethink their strategy and find a new path forward.",

        "Text": "The board of WeWork was expected to meet on Monday to discuss the future of the company's co-founder and chief executive, Adam Neumann, after it emerged he is under pressure to step down from the top job. Several board members, including representatives of the firm's biggest investor, Japan's SoftBank, are understood to be pressing Neumann to demote himself from chief executive to vice-chairman. The company was embarrassingly forced to pull its much-anticipated stock market flotation after failing to impress Wall Street investors. Neumann's erratic behaviour, including the revelation last week that he smoked marijuana on a private jet and promoted tequila-fuelled company parties, is thought to have angered SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son. SoftBank has pumped almost $11bn (Â£8.8bn) into the We Company, the parent company of WeWork, and holds about 30% of the shares. Ron Fisher, SoftBank's vice-chairman, sits on the WeWork board, alongside Mark Schwartz, a former SoftBank board member. It is unclear how many of the seven board members support the effort to force Neumann to step down as chief executive. SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment. Even if a majority of WeWork board members support the ousting of Neumann, he could still overrule them because his shares have 10 times the voting rights of other shareholders and he has the power to replace board members. The move to demote Neumann comes as WeWork is struggling to regain investor confidence after its failed initial public offering (IPO) in September. The company's financials have been under scrutiny, with some analysts questioning its valuation and business model. The controversy surrounding Neumann's behavior has only added to the uncertainty, with some investors expressing concerns about the company's leadership and direction.\n\nIf Neumann were to step down as CEO, it is unclear who would take over the reins. WeWork's current CFO, Artie Minson, has been mentioned as a potential candidate, but it is unclear if he would be willing to take on the role. Other potential contenders could include WeWork's president, Sandeep Mathrani, or even a external candidate.\n\nThe situation is likely to be closely watched by investors and industry observers, who are keen to see how WeWork's board responds to the pressure to remove Neumann. SoftBank's involvement is particularly significant, given its significant stake in the company and its influence over the board.\n\nThe drama surrounding WeWork's leadership is a stark contrast to the company's earlier hype and optimism. Just a year ago, WeWork was hailed as one of the most promising startups in the world, with a valuation of over $47 billion. However, the company's IPO debacle and subsequent scrutiny have led to a significant decline in its valuation, with some estimates suggesting it could be worth as little as $20 billion.\n\nAs the board meets to discuss Neumann's future, it is clear that the company faces significant challenges ahead. WeWork's leadership and direction will be under intense scrutiny, and it remains to be seen how the company will respond to the pressure to reform. One thing is certain, however: the fate of WeWork's CEO and the company's future direction will be closely watched by investors and industry observers alike.",

Along with his business partner Jim Owens, the retired former CEO of the non-profit Cast for Kids Foundation, Kelly wanted to find a new product or business idea to which, he said, he could bring both his experience in customer service and his values as an Eagle Scout. Something \"uplifting\". They discovered the two month-old site MysteryPotato, which had been set up to post potatoes with little messages â€“ \"printed on the side through the mail. The owner, who found himself inundated with orders he could not fulfil, was ready to sell Kelly and Owens the business. They bought it right away. Kelly and Owens saw an opportunity to expand the concept and make it more sustainable. They renamed the business \"Potato Mail\" and set out to revamp the operation. The first step was to establish a reliable supply chain for the potatoes, ensuring a consistent flow of high-quality tubers to meet the growing demand.\n\nTo achieve this, Kelly and Owens partnered with local farmers and suppliers, who were able to provide them with fresh, organic potatoes. The duo also invested in a state-of-the-art packaging system, designed to keep the potatoes safe and secure during transportation.\n\nWith their logistics in place, Kelly and Owens turned their attention to the customer experience. They created a user-friendly website and implemented a streamlined ordering process, making it easy for customers to purchase and personalize their potatoes. The duo also established a social media presence, using platforms like Instagram and Facebook to engage with customers and share stories of the impact of Potato Mail.\n\nThe business quickly gained traction, with orders pouring in from all over the country. Kelly and Owens were thrilled to see their idea take off, and they were committed to using the success of Potato Mail to make a positive difference in their community.\n\nOne of the ways they did this was by partnering with local food banks and soup kitchens. For every potato sold, Potato Mail donated a portion of the proceeds to these organizations, helping to provide meals for those in need. The duo also worked with schools and educational institutions, using the business as a teaching tool to educate children about the importance of sustainability and community involvement.\n\nAs the business continued to grow, Kelly and Owens were able to expand their team, hiring additional staff to help with operations and customer service. They also invested in new equipment and technology, allowing them to increase production and meet the demands of their growing customer base.\n\nToday, Potato Mail is a thriving business, with a loyal customer base and a reputation for providing high-quality, unique products. Kelly and Owens' commitment to customer service, sustainability, and community involvement has made the business a model for others to follow. And as they look to the future, they are excited to see where their idea will take them next.",

The European Union demanded the branches be separated as the price of agreeing to RBS's Â£45bn taxpayer bailout. Lloyds Banking Group was also required under state aid rules to carve out TSB in return for its government rescue. But on Thursday, the Edinburgh-based RBS said the cost of the spin-out, previously put at Â£1.2bn, was escalating and it may miss the deadline to complete the disposal â€“ which had already been extended to December 2017. This may make it even more difficult for the chancellor, George Osborne, to further reduce the government's 73% stake in the bank. Spinning out the Williams & Glyn branches has already created difficulty for RBS. The bank's management has been working to meet the EU's requirements, but the increasing costs and complexity of the process have made it a challenging task. The spin-out is expected to involve the transfer of around 6,000 employees to the new entity, which will require significant investment in IT systems, infrastructure, and branding.\n\nIndustry experts have expressed concerns that the delay in completing the spin-out could have a negative impact on RBS's ability to compete with other banks in the UK market. \"The longer it takes to complete the spin-out, the more difficult it will be for RBS to regain its footing in the market,\" said John Longworth, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \"The bank needs to focus on its core business and get rid of the distractions caused by the Williams & Glyn spin-out.\"\n\nRBS has been working to reduce its costs and improve its profitability, but the delay in completing the spin-out could put these efforts at risk. The bank has already announced plans to cut around 3,000 jobs as part of its efforts to reduce costs, and the delay in completing the spin-out could lead to further job losses.\n\nThe government has been keen to reduce its stake in RBS, but the delay in completing the spin-out could make this more difficult. The chancellor, George Osborne, has been under pressure to reduce the government's stake in the bank and use the proceeds to pay off some of the national debt. However, the delay in completing the spin-out could make it more difficult for the government to achieve this goal.\n\nIn a statement, RBS said that it was working to complete the spin-out as quickly as possible, but that it needed to ensure that it was done in a way that was in the best interests of the bank and its customers. The bank said that it would provide an update on its progress in the coming weeks.\n\nThe delay in completing the spin-out is the latest in a series of setbacks for RBS, which has struggled to recover from the financial crisis. The bank has been working to rebuild its balance sheet and improve its profitability, but the delay in completing the spin-out could make this more difficult.",

Jeremy was a rare snail, with an unusual shell that made him stand out among other garden snails. He will be missed. Jeremy won international fame for a mutation that caused his shell to coil left instead of right. For years, people searched for another lefty snail with which he could mate. Shortly before his death, she was found. Jeremy's discovery sparked a global fascination with the unusual snail, and scientists from around the world flocked to the lab to catch a glimpse of the lefty wonder. His unique shell, which coiled counterclockwise instead of the typical clockwise direction, was a marvel of nature, and researchers were eager to study him further.\n\nThe search for a mate for Jeremy had been ongoing for years, with scientists scouring the globe for another lefty snail to pair with him. The discovery of a female lefty snail, named Luna, was met with great excitement, and the two were finally introduced to each other just days before Jeremy's untimely death.\n\nAccording to Dr. Emma Taylor, the lead researcher on the project, Jeremy and Luna had been getting along famously, and the team was hopeful that they would be able to breed and produce offspring with the unique lefty trait. \"Jeremy was a true marvel, and his passing is a great loss for the scientific community,\" Dr. Taylor said in a statement. \"But we are grateful that we were able to find a mate for him, and we are eager to continue his legacy by studying the genetics of his lefty shell.\"\n\nThe discovery of Jeremy's lefty shell had significant implications for the field of genetics, and his study had the potential to shed new light on the complex mechanisms that govern shell development in snails.

        "Text": "The UK's property market will take this week's expected rise in interest rates in its stride, according to ratings agency Moody's, but it warned that the outlook for the buy-to-let market has worsened significantly. The agency, which along with Standard & Poor's was widely condemned for awarding triple-A ratings to sub-prime mortgage books before the 2008 financial crisis, said the British property market is more resilient than is widely believed. Moody's economist Colin Ellis said: \"We haven't seen quite the negative impact from the Brexit referendum that some had forecast, but then we weren't as bearish as the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] or the NIESR [National Institute of Economic and Social Research]. \"The [property] market is holding up OK. There is an underlying resilience in prices even if transaction activity has been affected. If you look at the balance between the cost of renting or buying, then UK house prices are not overexposed. However, Moody's cautioned that the buy-to-let market, which has been a significant driver of property demand in recent years, is facing a more challenging outlook. The agency attributed this to a combination of factors, including the ongoing impact of Brexit on the UK economy, as well as changes to tax policies and regulations affecting landlords.\n\nAccording to Moody's, the buy-to-let market has been particularly vulnerable to the uncertainty surrounding the UK's departure from the European Union, with many investors holding back on new purchases or delaying plans to expand their portfolios. The agency also highlighted concerns over the potential for further tax increases or changes to mortgage interest relief, which could further erode the profitability of buy-to-let investments.\n\nDespite these challenges, Moody's maintained that the overall UK property market remains resilient, driven in part by strong demand from first-time buyers and a lack of new housing supply. The agency also pointed to the continued attractiveness of UK property as a long-term investment opportunity, particularly for foreign investors seeking stable returns in a low-yield environment.\n\nIn its report, Moody's noted that UK property prices have been relatively stable in recent months, with some regions even experiencing modest growth. The agency attributed this to a combination of factors, including low unemployment, rising wages, and a lack of new housing supply, which has helped to underpin demand and prices.\n\nHowever, Moody's warned that the property market is not immune to the broader economic challenges facing the UK, and that any significant downturn in the economy could have a negative impact on property prices. The agency also cautioned that the ongoing impact of Brexit could continue to weigh on the market, particularly if the UK's departure from the EU is not managed smoothly.\n\nIn conclusion, while Moody's expects the UK property market to continue to perform relatively well in the short term, the agency warned that the outlook for the buy-to-let market remains uncertain and could be affected by a range of factors, including changes to tax policies and regulations, as well as the ongoing impact of Brexit.",

Microsoft's quarterly earnings can give indications of whether companies and consumers around the world are cooling their spending, because the business taps into so many markets. Apple reported on Tuesday that its revenue was down in part because consumers are buying new phones less frequently, and the chipmakers NVIDIA and Intel both indicated weakening demand for the components they build for data centers. But on Wednesday, Microsoft showed solid performance across its commercial and consumer businesses, reporting revenue of almost $32.5 billion in the last quarter, and a profit of almost $8.6 billion, both increases of more than 10 percent over the same period a year ago. Microsoft had handily beat analyst expectations recently. In the last quarter, the results fell mostly in line with what investors expected, and shares fell about 2.5 percent in aftermarket trading, wiping out most of the gains made earlier in the day. The company continued its shift to cloud computing, which allows businesses to store and analyze their data in remote centers. Its offering is now widely seen as the strong No. 2 in the market that had once been dominated only by Amazon. Satya Nadella, the company's chief executive, said in a call with investors that Microsoft was not seeing a slowing in demand. \"It's very healthy and will continue to be healthy.\" Microsoft's strong performance was driven by its cloud computing services, which saw a 36% increase in revenue year-over-year. The company's Azure cloud platform, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS), continues to gain traction, with many businesses moving their data and applications to the cloud.\n\n\"We're seeing a significant shift to the cloud, and we're well-positioned to take advantage of that trend,\" said Nadella. \"Our customers are looking for a trusted partner to help them navigate the complexities of digital transformation, and we're delivering on that promise.\"\n\nMicrosoft's commercial business, which includes its enterprise software and services, saw a 14% increase in revenue year-over-year, driven by strong demand for its Office 365 productivity suite and its Dynamics 365 customer relationship management platform.\n\nThe company's consumer business, which includes its Xbox gaming console and Surface tablet and laptop lines, saw a 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, driven by strong demand for its Surface products and a successful holiday shopping season for its Xbox console.\n\nMicrosoft's strong performance was also driven by its growing presence in the artificial intelligence and machine learning markets. The company's AI-powered tools, such as its Power Apps platform, are gaining traction with businesses looking to automate and streamline their operations.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of interest in AI and machine learning, and we're well-positioned to take advantage of that trend,\" said Nadella. \"Our AI-powered tools are helping businesses to automate and optimize their operations, and we're seeing a lot of demand for those solutions.\"\n\nDespite the strong performance, Microsoft's shares fell about 2.5% in aftermarket trading, wiping out most of the gains made earlier in the day. The decline was likely due to the company's guidance for the current quarter, which was slightly below analyst expectations.\n\nHowever, analysts were generally positive about the company's results, with many citing the strong performance of its cloud computing services and its growing presence in the AI and machine learning markets.\n\n\"Microsoft's strong performance is a testament to the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and capitalize on emerging trends,\" said Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"The company's cloud computing services are a key driver of its growth, and we expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.\"",

George Osborne personally intervened to convince Andrew Bailey to become chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, which has been without a permanent head since the chancellor forced out Martin Wheatley last summer. The chancellor said Bailey â€“ who was approached in recent weeks about the role â€“ would be \"tough but fair\" in City dealings . But City lawyers said it heralded a new approach. John Ahern, partner at law firm Jones Day, agreed: \"Andrew is more centrist than his predecessor, Tracey McDermott, so 'bank bashing' will likely give way to constructive regulatory oversight of the industry on his watch.\" The chancellor revealed earlier this month that McDermott â€“ who was considered the frontrunner for the role â€“ did not want the job full-time in a move that caused confusion about the recruitment process for one of the highest profile roles in the City. The appointment of Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, as the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has sent shockwaves through the financial industry. Bailey's departure from the Bank of England, where he has served since 2007, marks a significant change in the regulatory landscape.\n\nBailey's appointment is seen as a departure from the more aggressive approach taken by his predecessor, Martin Wheatley, who was forced out by Chancellor George Osborne last summer. Wheatley was known for his tough stance on the banking industry, and his departure was seen as a sign of a more conciliatory approach to regulation.\n\nIn contrast, Bailey is seen as a more centrist figure, with a background in banking and finance. He has been a strong advocate for the need for greater regulatory oversight of the financial industry, but has also emphasized the importance of working closely with industry players to achieve this goal.\n\nThe appointment of Bailey is likely to be seen as a signal that the government is looking to take a more collaborative approach to regulation, rather than relying on confrontation and punitive measures. This could be seen as a response to the criticism that the government's previous approach to regulation was too focused on punishing banks for past mistakes, rather than working with them to prevent future problems.\n\nThe FCA is responsible for regulating the financial services industry in the UK, and is seen as a key player in ensuring the stability and integrity of the financial system. Bailey's appointment is likely to have a significant impact on the way the FCA approaches its role, and could lead to a more collaborative and constructive relationship between the regulator and the industry.\n\nThe appointment has been welcomed by the financial industry, with many seeing it as a positive step towards a more stable and effective regulatory environment. However, some have expressed concerns that Bailey's appointment may not be enough to address the underlying issues that led to the financial crisis.\n\nThe appointment of Bailey is likely to be seen as a significant development in the ongoing debate about the role of regulation in the financial industry. As the FCA's new chief executive, Bailey will have a key role to play in shaping the regulatory environment and ensuring that the financial system is stable and effective.",

        "Text": "I always assumed plagiarism to be mainly committed by a few lazy students and over-ambitious politicians. But ever since discovering plagiarism of my own work, I've come to see it as more pervasive. Three years ago, I was reading up on recent research in my field, when I stumbled on a sentence that read quite familiar. Re-reading the entire paragraph, I realised these were my words â€“ I'd published them on an academic blog two years before. It turned out a whopping 285-word chunk in the article was copied verbatim, just minimally changed, but several other sections in the article used my arguments without credit. No footnote or reference acknowledged my work. I was stunned because I couldn't believe a full professor of high global standing â€“ a respected leader in their field â€“ would do this. I was also flattered because, of course, imitation is a form of praise. Mostly I was angry because an important article of mine had recently been rejected, but here was another person getting my half-baked blog thoughts published under their name. But I was also worried, because I now had to prove the originality of my work. Even now, I still fear reprisals if I were ever to publicise the incident; I avoided my institution while the plagiarist recently visited. As a first step, of course I consulted the internet, and, bizarrely, I found numerous sources of advice for plagiarists â€“ but not for those who have been plagiarised. These included tongue-in-cheek advice for academics, such as the \"top five law-proof strategies when busted for plagiarism\". I decided to take the case up with the high-ranking economics journal in question. I was met with a mixture of surprise and skepticism when I approached the journal's editor-in-chief. At first, they seemed hesitant to take the matter seriously, asking me if I was \"just being paranoid\" or if I had \"misremembered\" the details. I was taken aback by their response, but I persisted, providing evidence of the copied text and explaining the significance of the plagiarism.\n\nAfter several weeks of back-and-forth, the journal finally agreed to investigate the matter. They conducted an internal review, which concluded that the plagiarism was indeed intentional and that the article would be retracted. The professor involved was also given a formal warning and required to take a course on academic integrity.\n\nHowever, the experience left a sour taste in my mouth. I realized that plagiarism is not just a problem for students, but also for established academics. It's a symptom of a larger issue, where the pressure to publish and the desire for prestige can lead individuals to compromise their integrity.\n\nAs I reflected on the incident, I began to wonder how widespread plagiarism is in academia. A recent study found that nearly 60% of academics admit to having committed plagiarism at some point in their careers. Another study found that 70% of academics believe that plagiarism is a \"serious problem\" in their field.\n\nThe lack of consequences for plagiarism is also a concern. Many institutions have weak policies or lack the resources to effectively address plagiarism. In some cases, plagiarists are given a slap on the wrist or even rewarded with promotions and tenure.\n\nThe experience has also made me more cautious about sharing my work online. While I believe that open access to research is essential, I now make sure to watermark my documents and keep track of who accesses them. I've also become more vigilant when reviewing articles, looking for signs of plagiarism and reporting any suspicious activity to the journal.\n\nUltimately, the incident has made me more aware of the importance of academic integrity. It's not just about avoiding plagiarism, but also about promoting a culture of honesty and respect for others' work. As academics, we have a responsibility to uphold the highest standards of integrity and to ensure that our work is original and trustworthy.\n\nIn the end, the experience has been a valuable lesson. While it was frustrating and disheartening, it has also made me more determined to promote academic integrity and to support others who have been affected by plagiarism.",

Lee, 23 â€“ a maths student at Lancaster University, who is currently vice president of welfare and community at the university's student union, as well as trans rep for the women's campaign â€“ says she has been trolled online and sent thousands of abusive messages because she is transgender. \"The reaction shows how far we still need to move forward,\" she says. Lee's decision to run for women's officer at the NUS has sparked a heated debate online, with some individuals questioning her eligibility for the role due to her gender identity. However, Lee is adamant that she is a woman and believes that her experiences as a trans woman will bring a unique perspective to the position.\n\n\"I am a woman, and I am qualified to run for this role,\" Lee said in an interview. \"I have faced discrimination and marginalization as a trans woman, and I believe that my experiences will help me to better represent the needs of all women, including those who are trans and non-binary.\"\n\nLee's campaign has been met with widespread support from the LGBTQ+ community and allies, who see her candidacy as a step towards greater representation and inclusivity within the NUS.\n\n\"This is a huge step forward for the NUS and for the LGBTQ+ community,\" said Dr. Sophia McCarron, a lecturer in sociology at Lancaster University. \"Anna Lee's candidacy shows that the NUS is committed to representing all women, regardless of their gender identity or expression. It's a powerful statement about the importance of inclusivity and diversity.\"\n\nLee's campaign has also received support from several student unions and organizations, including the University and College Union (UCU) and the National Union of Teachers (NUT).\n\n\"We are proud to support Anna Lee's campaign for women's officer at the NUS,\" said a spokesperson for the UCU. \"Her commitment to representing all women, including those who are trans and non-binary, is a vital part of building a more inclusive and equitable society.\"\n\nDespite the support, Lee's campaign has also faced opposition from some individuals who believe that she is not eligible to run for the position. However, Lee remains undeterred and is determined to continue her campaign, regardless of the backlash.\n\n\"I am not going to let the trolls and abusers silence me,\" Lee said. \"I am going to continue to fight for my right to run for this role, and I am going to continue to fight for the rights of all women, including those who are trans and non-binary.\"\n\nThe election for women's officer at the NUS is set to take place in the coming weeks, and Lee is confident that her message of inclusivity and representation will resonate with students across the country.\n\n\"I am excited to take on this challenge and to represent all women, regardless of their gender identity or expression,\" Lee said. \"I believe that my experiences and perspectives will make a positive difference, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to make a real impact.\"",

        "Text": "A funding shortfall for children with special educational needs has led to a surge in court appeals, as families turn to legal action to secure extra help from cash-strapped councils. With a 26% rise in the last financial year in the number of court appeals by families, MPs are warning of a crisis in special needs care. It is the third successive year that an increase has been recorded. The total of 6,374 appeals lodged in 2018-19 was almost double the number of three years earlier, according to analysis by the Special Needs Jungle website. The increase in legal action comes amid what insiders describe as a perfect storm hitting provision for special educational needs and disabilities (Send). Schools are struggling to meet the extra costs. That is heaping further pressure on councils, which have a legal obligation to provide care for children that require it. That in turn has led more families to the courts to fight for resources for their children. A backlog of cases is growing, and more judges are being recruited to deal with the workload. As the number of court appeals continues to rise, experts are warning that the situation is unsustainable and that something needs to be done to address the funding shortfall.\n\n\"The current system is unsustainable and is causing undue stress and anxiety for families who are already going through a difficult time,\" said Sarah Teather, the former children's minister who is now the chief executive of the charity Barnardo's. \"The government needs to take urgent action to address the funding shortfall and ensure that councils have the resources they need to provide the support that children with special educational needs require.\"\n\nThe government has promised to increase funding for special educational needs, but many argue that it is not enough. The latest budget allocated an additional Â£250 million to support children with special educational needs, but this is still short of the estimated Â£1 billion needed to meet the increasing demand.\n\nIn the meantime, families are being forced to take on the burden of finding the extra resources needed to support their children. This can include hiring private tutors, paying for therapy sessions, and covering the cost of equipment and technology. For many families, this is a significant financial burden, and it is taking a toll on their mental and emotional well-being.\n\n\"It's like being in a never-ending battle,\" said Sarah, a mother of two children with special educational needs. \"We're constantly fighting for resources and trying to navigate the system, and it's exhausting. We just want what's best for our children, but it feels like we're being pushed to the limit.\"\n\nThe situation is not limited to England. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are also facing similar challenges, and experts warn that the problem is not unique to the UK.\n\n\"This is a global issue,\" said Dr. Jane Jones, a specialist in special educational needs. \"The increasing demand for support and the lack of funding is a problem that is being faced by countries around the world. It's a complex issue that requires a global response.\"\n\nIn the meantime, families are being forced to take matters into their own hands. Many are turning to social media and online forums to share their experiences and connect with other families who are going through similar struggles. Others are joining advocacy groups and campaigning for change.\n\n\"It's not just about getting the funding, it's about changing the system,\" said Tom, a father of a child with special educational needs. \"We need to make sure that the system is fair and equitable, and that all children have access to the support they need. It's not just about our children, it's about all children with special educational needs.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the future of special educational needs care is uncertain, and something needs to be done to address the funding shortfall and ensure that all children have access to the support they need.",

        "Text": "The City regulator is investigating HSBC over potential breaches of money laundering rules after concerns raised last year by the anti-crime monitor installed in Britain's biggest bank. The bank did not disclose the specific concerns raised by the American lawyer Michael Cherkasky, who was appointed as the monitor five years ago. He is reported to have raised concerns about clients with links to terrorism, including Isis. Chekraksy was appointed after the Â£1.2bn fine imposed on HSBC in 2012 by the US for poor anti-money laundering controls and is overseeing attempts to improve its defences against financial crime. The Financial Conduct Authority did not comment but the bank said it was \"the subject of an investigation by the FCA into its compliance with UK money laundering regulations and financial crime systems and controls requirements\". As the bank reported a 62% slump in 2016 profits on Tuesday, its chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the bank was unearthing more regulatory problems due to higher-quality internal policing, adding the business had \"been able to identify more bad actors in our 37m customer base\". He said it was \"quite normal\" to uncover such instances in a bank the size of HSBC which operates in 70 countries and has 240,000 staff. Gulliver said: \"Our monitor has raised certain concerns but we have continued to progress and our commitment remains unwavering. By the end of this year, we are on track to have our anti-money laundering and sanctions policy framework in place and to have introduced major compliance IT systems across the group.\" The investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is a significant development for HSBC, which has been working to improve its anti-money laundering controls and financial crime systems following a string of regulatory fines and scandals in recent years.\n\nThe concerns raised by Michael Cherkasky, the American lawyer appointed as the monitor, are believed to be related to the bank's dealings with clients who have links to terrorism, including the Islamic State (Isis). The exact nature of these concerns has not been disclosed, but it is understood that they are related to the bank's compliance with UK money laundering regulations and financial crime systems and controls requirements.\n\nHSBC's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, sought to downplay the significance of the investigation, describing it as \"quite normal\" for a bank of HSBC's size and complexity to uncover regulatory problems. He also highlighted the bank's efforts to improve its anti-money laundering controls, including the introduction of new IT systems and a renewed focus on internal policing.\n\nHowever, the investigation is likely to be a major concern for HSBC's shareholders and customers, who have been reassured by the bank's efforts to improve its regulatory compliance in recent years. The bank's profits slumped by 62% in 2016, partly due to the costs of implementing new regulatory requirements.\n\nThe FCA's investigation is the latest in a series of regulatory headaches for HSBC, which has faced fines and penalties from regulators around the world for its role in facilitating money laundering and other financial crimes. In 2012, the US Department of Justice imposed a Â£1.2bn fine on the bank for its poor anti-money laundering controls, and it has since faced further fines and penalties for its role in facilitating transactions with countries subject to international sanctions.\n\nDespite these challenges, HSBC remains one of the largest and most profitable banks in the world, with operations in 70 countries and a customer base of over 37 million people. The bank's commitment to improving its regulatory compliance is seen as crucial to its long-term success, and the investigation by the FCA is likely to be closely watched by regulators and investors around the world.\n\nIn a statement, HSBC said it was \"cooperating fully\" with the FCA's investigation and was confident that its anti-money laundering controls and financial crime systems and controls were robust and effective. The bank also reiterated its commitment to improving its regulatory compliance, including the introduction of new IT systems and a renewed focus on internal policing.\n\nThe investigation is likely to take several months to complete, and it is unclear what penalties or fines HSBC may face if it is found to have breached money laundering regulations. However, the news is likely to be a major embarrassment for the bank and may have implications for its reputation and long-term success.",

Some members of the audience of business leaders, politicians, academics and media representatives at the World Economic Forum responded to the president's renewed onslaught by hissing. Speaking to a packed hall on Friday, Trump boasted of his record since entering the White House and said there had never been a better time for businesses to hire and build in the low tax and low regulation economy he was creating. However, the president's claims were met with skepticism and criticism from many in the audience, who felt that his administration's policies had done more to harm the economy and the environment than to help it.\n\n\"This is not a time for boasting, but for taking responsibility for the damage that has been done,\" said Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, in a statement released after the speech. \"The president's policies have led to increased inequality, higher debt, and a decline in trust in institutions. We need to work together to address these challenges, not divide ourselves further.\"\n\nTrump's speech was also criticized by many in the media, who felt that his attacks on the press were unwarranted and unprofessional. \"The president's remarks were a clear attempt to discredit and intimidate the media, and to undermine the free press,\" said the President of the White House Correspondents' Association, Oliver Knox. \"We will not be silenced or bullied by the president's attacks, and we will continue to hold him accountable for his actions.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, Trump remained defiant, and continued to tout his administration's accomplishments. \"We are creating jobs, we are creating growth, and we are creating prosperity,\" he said. \"And we are doing it all without the help of the fake news media, who are only trying to tear us down.\"\n\nThe president's speech was met with a mixed reaction from the audience, with some applauding his comments and others booing and hissing in response. The event was widely covered in the media, with many outlets reporting on the president's claims and criticisms.\n\nIn the days following the speech, the debate over the president's policies and the role of the media continued to rage. Many in the media and in the public criticized Trump's attacks on the press, while others defended his right to speak his mind. The controversy served as a reminder of the ongoing tensions between the president and the media, and the importance of a free and independent press in a democratic society.\n\nDespite the controversy, the World Economic Forum continued to go ahead with its annual meeting, with many high-profile speakers and attendees. The event was seen as an opportunity for leaders and experts from around the world to come together and discuss the pressing issues of the day, from climate change to economic inequality.",

        "Text": "It seems Silicon Valley and Congress can finally agree on something after all â€“ the need for data privacy regulation. On Wednesday, representatives from Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Charter, Google and Twitter appeared before the Senate commerce committee to endorse the notion of new federal data protection laws. But whether such legislation will come to pass, exactly what it will look like and who it may end up favoring is a long way from being determined. The tech giants' sudden willingness to support data privacy regulation has raised more questions than answers, leaving lawmakers and advocates alike wondering what's behind the sudden about-face. For years, Silicon Valley has been resistant to the idea of stricter regulations, citing concerns over innovation and competition.\n\nHowever, the recent string of high-profile data breaches and scandals has put pressure on the industry to take responsibility for protecting consumers' personal information. The appearance of the tech giants before the Senate commerce committee marked a significant shift in their stance, with many representatives acknowledging that voluntary measures have fallen short in ensuring data privacy.\n\n\"This is a critical moment for our industry,\" said Amazon's vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman. \"We believe that federal legislation can provide a framework for protecting consumers' data while also promoting innovation and competition.\"\n\nBut not everyone is convinced that the tech giants' newfound enthusiasm for regulation is genuine. Critics argue that the industry's support for data privacy laws is largely driven by a desire to preempt stricter regulations that could be imposed at the state or international level.\n\n\"It's a classic case of'regulate me, not the other guy,'\" said John Simpson, consumer advocate with Consumer Watchdog. \"The tech giants are only supporting data privacy laws because they think it will give them more control over the regulatory process and allow them to shape the rules to their advantage.\"\n\nThe Senate commerce committee is expected to hold further hearings on the issue in the coming weeks, with lawmakers working to craft a comprehensive data privacy bill. But the road ahead will be fraught with challenges, as the tech industry, consumer advocates, and lawmakers navigate the complex issues surrounding data protection.\n\nOne of the key questions is what exactly would be covered under a federal data privacy law. Some advocates are pushing for a broad approach that would require companies to obtain explicit consent from consumers before collecting and sharing their personal data. Others argue that a more targeted approach would be more effective, focusing on specific areas such as biometric data or location tracking.\n\nAnother challenge is determining how to enforce data privacy laws. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has historically been responsible for policing data privacy, but some lawmakers are calling for the creation of a new agency or regulatory body to oversee data protection.\n\nAs the debate continues, one thing is clear: the stakes are high. The fate of data privacy hangs in the balance, and the outcome will have far-reaching implications for consumers, businesses, and the tech industry as a whole.",

        "Text": "The major networks are unveiling their offerings for the coming television season to advertising buyers in Manhattan. Money, prestige and cultural import are at stake. Three New York Times reporters who specialize in the media -- John Koblin, Michael M. Grynbaum and Sapna Maheshwari -- assess what they saw at the Fox presentation on Monday, the second upfront presentation of the week. JOHN: Well, we spent Monday afternoon at Fox's presentation, then headed to \"Trump Rink\" in Central Park, where Fox threw a booze- and sushi-soaked after-party. SAPNA: The sheer variety of food, from the dim sum station to the bakery with glass cake cases, was astounding. It was like a wedding where the hosts paid for all the extras. JOHN: Let's take a breath. First things first, the war is on. Sapna, the networks are just not having it with digital folks like Facebook and YouTube. SAPNA: Yes! We saw NBC's chief of ad sales talk about \"brand safety\" and throw shade at Silicon Valley on Monday morning, but Fox's equivalent, Joe Marchese, took it to a new level Monday afternoon -- which it should be noted was his third day on the job. He slammed a statistic that Facebook loves to cite -- \"a Super Bowl every day on mobile\" -- by touting the number of advertising minutes Fox delivers to viewers every night. It felt like Fox was throwing down the gauntlet by calling out YouTube and Facebook by name and offering competing metrics, and I bet we'll see a lot more of that in coming months. MICHAEL: This dog-and-pony show only covered Fox's broadcast programming, but the specter of its troubled corporate cousin, Fox News, was tough to ignore. As the presentation moved on to showcase Fox's upcoming fall lineup, it was clear that the network is banking on its tried-and-true formulas to attract viewers. The network's new drama, \"Prodigal Son,\" starring Tom Payne and Michael Sheen, is a dark and gritty take on the classic detective genre, while \"BH90210,\" a reboot of the iconic '90s series, promises to bring back the nostalgia and drama that fans of the original loved.\n\nBut despite the focus on broadcast programming, the elephant in the room was Fox News, the network's 24-hour cable news channel that has been embroiled in controversy and scandal in recent months. The network's president, Jay Wallace, was noticeably absent from the presentation, and the usually stoic Fox executives seemed to be walking on eggshells as they discussed the network's plans for the coming year.\n\nThe tension was palpable, and it was clear that the controversy surrounding Fox News was casting a shadow over the entire presentation. As one industry insider noted, \"The success of Fox's broadcast programming is directly tied to the reputation of its cable news channel. If Fox News continues to struggle, it could have a ripple effect on the entire network.\"\n\nDespite the challenges facing Fox News, the network's broadcast division is looking to make a strong push in the coming season. The network has a number of new shows in the works, including a drama series based on the life of legendary musician Elvis Presley, and a comedy series starring \"Saturday Night Live\" alumna Kate McKinnon.\n\nAs the presentation came to a close, it was clear that Fox is banking on its mix of drama, comedy, and reality TV to attract viewers in the coming season. But the real question on everyone's mind is whether the network can overcome the challenges facing its troubled corporate cousin and emerge as a major player in the ever-changing world of television.

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- An Uber executive accused of stealing driverless car technology from his former employers at Google is exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, according to his lawyers. The lawyers for Anthony Levandowski, the former head of Google's self-driving car project who is now leading a similar effort at Uber, said he was broadly asserting his Fifth Amendment rights because there was \"potential for criminal action\" in the case, according to court transcripts obtained on Thursday. The legal maneuver adds even more intrigue to the high-profile fight between two of the technology industry's largest companies, which are squaring off in the race to put driverless cars on the road. Mr. Levandowski is at the center of a lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, which was spun out from Google to become its own Alphabet subsidiary. Waymo has accused Mr. Levandowski of stealing documents and poaching employees before quitting Google and then colluding with Uber to use that technology to advance driverless car efforts at the ride-hailing service. Shortly after leaving Google, Mr. Levandowski started his own self-driving truck start-up, Otto. The move by Levandowski's lawyers to assert his Fifth Amendment rights has raised concerns about the potential for a lengthy and costly legal battle between the two companies. Waymo has already accused Levandowski of stealing intellectual property and trade secrets, and the lawsuit has been ongoing for several months.\n\nThe dispute centers around Levandowski's departure from Google in 2016, when he left the company to start his own self-driving truck start-up, Otto. Shortly after, Uber acquired Otto for $680 million, with Levandowski becoming the head of its self-driving car division.\n\nWaymo alleges that Levandowski stole confidential information and trade secrets from Google before leaving the company, and then used that information to advance Uber's own self-driving car efforts. The company has accused Levandowski of downloading thousands of files from Google's servers before leaving the company, including documents related to its autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nLevandowski's lawyers have denied the allegations, saying that he did not steal any confidential information and that his departure from Google was amicable. They have also accused Waymo of trying to intimidate and bully Levandowski, and have sought to have the lawsuit dismissed.\n\nThe legal battle between Waymo and Uber has significant implications for the future of autonomous vehicle technology. Both companies are racing to develop and deploy self-driving cars, and the outcome of the lawsuit could have a major impact on the industry as a whole.\n\nThe case is also being closely watched by regulators and lawmakers, who are grappling with how to oversee the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued guidelines for the development of autonomous vehicles, but there is still much uncertainty about how the technology will be regulated in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, the legal battle between Waymo and Uber continues to unfold. A hearing is scheduled for later this month, and it is unclear when a decision will be reached.",

And that is bad news for \"The Tonight Show.\" Stephen Colbert, who has made Mr. Trump a nightly target, assumed the top position in the ratings race in February and has only increased his lead since then. His program, \"The Late Show\" on CBS, has taken viewers away from Jimmy Fallon, the cheerful host of NBC's storied franchise, who has lost 21 percent of his audience year over year since the fall season began on Sept. 25. At the same time, Jimmy Kimmel has made ratings gains in the 11:35 p.m. slot on ABC. Ever since Mr. Colbert leapfrogged Mr. Fallon in total viewers, NBC executives have emphasized that \"The Tonight Show\" is still the No. 1 choice of viewers in the 18-to-49-year-old group prized by advertisers. In the November sweeps period, which ended last Wednesday, Mr. Colbert cut into Mr. Fallon's lead among younger viewers, finishing 57,000 behind him, according to Nielsen data. Despite the decline in total viewers, NBC is holding onto the coveted 18-49 demographic, which is crucial for advertisers. However, the network's efforts to maintain its lead may be challenged by the rising popularity of \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert.\n\nColbert's sharp wit and biting satire have resonated with a wider audience, making him the top-rated late-night host in the country. His show has consistently outperformed \"The Tonight Show\" in terms of total viewers, and his ratings have shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nMeanwhile, Jimmy Fallon's ratings have been stagnant, with his show struggling to regain its footing after a tumultuous year. Fallon's attempts to pivot towards a more lighthearted and family-friendly approach have not paid off, and his show has lost significant ground to Colbert.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, on the other hand, has been quietly building momentum on ABC. His show has seen a steady increase in ratings, and he has become a dark horse in the late-night wars. Kimmel's ability to balance humor with substance has resonated with audiences, and his show has become a go-to destination for those looking for a more irreverent take on current events.\n\nAs the late-night landscape continues to evolve, NBC executives are facing a daunting task. With Colbert's ratings on the rise and Fallon's on the decline, the network must decide whether to continue to support the struggling \"Tonight Show\" or make a bold move to revamp the franchise.\n\nIn the meantime, Colbert's ascendance has sent shockwaves through the industry. His show's success has paved the way for other late-night hosts to take a more critical approach to politics, and his influence is being felt across the industry.\n\nAs the ratings continue to fluctuate, one thing is clear: the late-night wars are far from over. With Colbert, Fallon, and Kimmel all vying for attention, the battle for late-night supremacy is sure to be a wild and unpredictable ride.",

The T-Mobile stand showing off 5G technology that has been the star in this edition of the Mobile World Congress. BARCELONA, Spain -- The Trump administration sent a delegation to Spain this week to make its case against the Chinese technology company Huawei at one of the world's biggest tech trade shows. But the event, called MWC Barcelona, ended up being favorable ground for the Chinese maker of telecom equipment. Of the more than 100,000 attendees and 2,400 companies at the event, most ignored the efforts by the United States to impose a ban against Huawei for security and surveillance risks. For Huawei, the enormous conference provided a much-needed opportunity to make a show of force after months of being on the defensive about the American-led campaign. The company, accused of being an instrument of spying for the Chinese government, was ubiquitous in Barcelona. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to sway the global tech community against Huawei, the company's presence at MWC Barcelona was met with a mix of curiosity and enthusiasm. Many attendees were drawn to Huawei's innovative exhibits, showcasing the latest advancements in 5G technology, artificial intelligence, and smart home devices.\n\nHuawei's CEO, Ren Zhengfei, made a rare public appearance at the event, delivering a keynote speech that emphasized the company's commitment to innovation and its role in shaping the future of the tech industry. The CEO's message resonated with many attendees, who praised Huawei's efforts to push the boundaries of what is possible with technology.\n\nThe company's impressive lineup of products and services on display included its latest flagship smartphone, the Mate X, which features a foldable OLED screen and support for 5G connectivity. Huawei also showcased its 5G network infrastructure solutions, which are designed to provide fast and reliable connectivity for consumers and businesses alike.\n\nHuawei's dominance at MWC Barcelona was not lost on the company's competitors, who were forced to take a backseat to the Chinese giant's impressive display. \"Huawei is a force to be reckoned with,\" said a representative from Samsung, a major rival in the smartphone market. \"Their technology is impressive, and they're clearly committed to innovation.\"\n\nThe company's success at MWC Barcelona is a significant blow to the Trump administration's efforts to isolate Huawei and limit its global influence. The event serves as a reminder that, despite the challenges it faces, Huawei remains a major player in the global tech industry.\n\nAs the conference came to a close, Huawei's executives were beaming with pride, knowing that they had successfully made their case to the global tech community. \"We're thrilled with the response we've received at MWC Barcelona,\" said a Huawei spokesperson. \"It's clear that our technology is resonating with attendees, and we're excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\"\n\nFor Huawei, the success at MWC Barcelona is a welcome respite from the challenges it has faced in recent months. As the company looks to the future, it's clear that its commitment to innovation and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions will be key to its continued success.",

A total of 62,932 house purchase loans worth Â£11.1bn were approved during the month, up from 60,984 in August, and higher than expected, but below the previous six-month average of 64,841. Activity in the first three months of the year was boosted by a change to stamp duty rates on 1 April, which added a three percentage point surcharge to the tax on second homes. The latest figures from the Bank of England indicate that the mortgage market is slowly recovering from the summer slump, but the overall trend remains subdued. Despite the increase in approvals, the number of mortgages remains below the levels seen at the start of the year.\n\nExperts attribute the summer decline in mortgage approvals to a combination of factors, including uncertainty surrounding Brexit and a slowdown in the housing market. The introduction of the additional 3% stamp duty surcharge on second homes in April also had a significant impact, as many buyers opted to delay their purchases until the market stabilized.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in approvals suggests that the market is starting to regain momentum. \"The bounce back in mortgage approvals is a welcome sign that the market is stabilizing,\" said John Hill, a mortgage expert at a leading financial institution. \"While the numbers are still below where they were at the start of the year, we are seeing a steady improvement in activity.\"\n\nThe Bank of England's figures also show that the average value of mortgages approved in September was Â£176,000, up from Â£173,000 in August. This suggests that buyers are increasingly looking for larger properties, which could be a sign of confidence returning to the market.\n\nDespite the positive trends, lenders are still being cautious in their lending decisions. \"We are seeing a more selective approach to lending, with lenders focusing on borrowers with good credit scores and stable income,\" said Sarah Taylor, a mortgage broker. \"This is likely to continue until the market becomes more stable and lenders feel more confident in their lending decisions.\"\n\nThe UK's housing market has been experiencing a period of uncertainty in recent months, with many buyers and sellers holding back on transactions due to concerns over Brexit and the impact of the pandemic. However, the latest figures suggest that the market is slowly starting to recover, and many experts believe that the bounce back in mortgage approvals is a sign of things to come.\n\nIn conclusion, while the number of mortgage approvals remains below where it was at the start of the year, the recent increase in activity is a positive sign for the housing market. As the market continues to stabilize, lenders are likely to become more confident in their lending decisions, and buyers and sellers can expect to see more activity in the coming months.",

To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We'll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. I'm striking with university colleagues as our pensions are being destroyed This opinion piece forms part of our coverage of strikes university lecturers are holding in protest at their employers' pension plans. As the strike enters its second week, lecturers across the UK are standing united in their demand for fairer pension plans. The University and College Union (UCU) has been at the forefront of the strike, with over 60,000 members participating in the action.\n\nThe dispute centers around the proposed changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which would see lecturers' pension pots shrink by as much as 35%. The UCU argues that this would leave many lecturers struggling to make ends meet in retirement, and is calling for the scheme to be reformed to ensure a more sustainable and secure future for pensioners.\n\nOne lecturer, who wished to remain anonymous, shared their concerns about the impact the proposed changes would have on their financial future. \"I've worked hard to get to where I am, and the thought of my pension being slashed is terrifying,\" they said. \"I'm not asking for the world, just a decent retirement package that allows me to enjoy my golden years without worrying about money.\"\n\nThe strike has had a significant impact on university life, with many courses and services disrupted. Students have been left to navigate the situation, with some expressing frustration and others showing support for their lecturers.\n\n\"I'm really disappointed that my lectures have been cancelled, but I understand why my lecturers are striking,\" said Emily, a student at the University of London. \"It's not fair that they're being asked to work so hard for so little reward. I hope the strike ends soon and we can get back to normal.\"\n\nThe strike has also received support from outside the academic community. The National Education Union (NEU) has expressed solidarity with the UCU, and has called on the government to take action to address the pension crisis.\n\n\"This is a critical moment for the future of our education system,\" said NEU general secretary, Kevin Courtney. \"The government must work with the UCU to find a solution that prioritizes the interests of lecturers and students alike. Anything less would be a betrayal of the trust placed in them by the public.\"\n\nAs the strike continues, the UCU remains committed to its demands for fairer pension plans. The union is urging its members to remain united and to continue to stand up for their rights.\n\n\"We will not back down until we have a fair deal for our members,\" said UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt. \"The universities must recognize the value of their staff and take action to address the pension crisis. We will not rest until we have achieved a better future for our members and for the students they teach.\"\n\nThe strike is set to continue for several more weeks, with both sides remaining firm in their positions. As the dispute drags on, one thing is clear: the future of university pensions hangs in the balance, and the outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the education sector as a whole.",

        "Text": "Female teachers are not being protected against \"upskirting\" videos and other forms of online sexual harassment by pupils, the leader of one of the UK's main teaching unions has said, calling for schools and governments to take the issue more seriously. Chris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT, said her organisation had found multiple instances of women being subjected to upskirting by pupils in secondary schools, including by some as young as 11, and cases where teachers' faces had been digitally Photoshopped on to pornographic images. Keates said schools needed to recognise the seriousness of the issue, and reiterated calls for pupils' use of mobile phones to be banned in classrooms to curb the problems they cause. \"It is a particularly vile form of objectification of women,\" Keates said of upskirting, describing how the NASUWT had conducted a long legal struggle to prosecute a case involving its members. According to Keates, the lack of action from schools and governments is allowing this type of behavior to continue unchecked, with many teachers feeling powerless to stop it. \"Teachers are being subjected to this kind of abuse and harassment, and it's not being taken seriously,\" she said. \"It's not just a matter of a few bad apples, it's a systemic problem that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nKeates pointed out that the NASUWT had previously highlighted the issue of upskirting and online harassment, but had received little response from schools or governments. \"We've been warning about this for years, and yet nothing has been done to address it,\" she said. \"It's not just a matter of telling teachers to 'toughen up' or to 'ignore it', it's a serious issue that needs to be taken seriously.\"\n\nThe NASUWT has called for schools to take immediate action to address the issue, including implementing policies to prevent upskirting and online harassment, and providing support to teachers who have been victims of this type of behavior. The union is also urging governments to take a more proactive approach to addressing the issue, including introducing legislation to criminalize upskirting and other forms of online harassment.\n\nIn response to the NASUWT's concerns, a government spokesperson said that they took the issue of upskirting and online harassment very seriously, and were working to address it. \"We understand the impact that this type of behavior can have on teachers and pupils, and we are committed to doing everything we can to prevent it,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, Keates remains skeptical, pointing out that the government's response to the issue has been slow and inadequate. \"Words are not enough, we need action,\" she said. \"We need schools and governments to take this issue seriously and to take immediate action to address it.\"\n\nThe NASUWT's concerns have been echoed by other teaching unions and education experts, who have called for a more proactive approach to addressing the issue. \"This is a serious issue that needs to be taken seriously,\" said Dr. Emma Taylor, a leading expert on education and technology. \"We need to work together to create a safe and respectful environment for all students and teachers.\"\n\nAs the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether schools and governments will take the necessary steps to address the issue of upskirting and online harassment. But one thing is clear: the NASUWT's call for action is a wake-up call for the education system, and it's time for change.",

        "Text": "More than 1,500 Google workers plan to walk out of almost two dozen of the company's offices on Thursday to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment. SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is struggling to contain a growing internal backlash over its handling of sexual harassment and its workplace culture. Over the past week, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, and Larry Page, a co-founder of Google and the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet, have taken multiple steps to calm its agitated 94,000-person work force. The anger arose after The New York Times revealed last week that Google had paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives accused of harassment and stayed silent about their transgressions. Google later said it had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years; none received an exit package. Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai also issued apologies, with Mr. Pichai later saying his initial statement \"wasn't enough\" and apologizing again. And one of the executives whom Alphabet continued employing after he was accused of harassment resigned on Tuesday and did not obtain an exit package. But employees' dissatisfaction has not subsided. On Thursday, more than 1,500 -- most of them women -- plan to walk out of almost two dozen company offices around the world to protest the treatment, organizers said. At a staff meeting last year, Google's founders, Mr. ...Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai, had told employees that they had a \"perfectly fine\" culture, a comment that many felt was tone-deaf and dismissive of the widespread allegations of harassment and discrimination. The walkout is being organized by a group of Google employees who are demanding changes to the company's policies and practices to address the issue of sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\nThe walkout is expected to take place at 11:10 a.m. local time on Thursday, with employees gathering outside their offices to protest and make their voices heard. The organizers have also planned a series of events and activities, including a rally and a march, to raise awareness about the issue and to demand action from the company.\n\nThe walkout has been gaining momentum over the past few days, with many employees sharing their own stories and experiences of harassment and discrimination on social media using the hashtag #GoogleWalkout. The movement has also gained support from other tech companies, with employees from companies such as Facebook and Amazon expressing solidarity with the Google workers.\n\nThe protest is not just about Google, but also about the broader culture of tech and the lack of accountability and transparency in the industry. Many employees feel that the industry's \"boys' club\" culture, which often prioritizes power and prestige over accountability and ethics, has contributed to the widespread problem of sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\nGoogle's handling of the issue has been criticized for being too slow and too secretive. The company has faced criticism for not doing enough to address the problem and for not being transparent about its handling of allegations of harassment and discrimination. The walkout is seen as a way for employees to hold the company accountable and to demand change.\n\nThe walkout has also sparked a wider conversation about the treatment of women in the tech industry, with many employees and experts pointing to the lack of diversity and inclusion in the industry as a major factor in the problem of sexual harassment and discrimination. The movement is seen as a way to challenge the status quo and to demand a more inclusive and equitable work environment.\n\nAs the walkout approaches, many are watching to see how Google will respond to the demands of its employees. Will the company take concrete steps to address the issue of sexual harassment and discrimination, or will it continue to downplay the problem and prioritize its own interests? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "At a Girls in Aviation Day event in Manhattan, a drone pilot, Loretta Alkalay, commanded the attention of everyone in the audience as she launched a quad copter into the air and held it in a hover. The students, ages 12 to 17, looked eager to give it a try. And that is the point. Ms. Alkalay, a lawyer and an instructor in drone law at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in East Elmhurst, Queens, is one of a growing number of educators enthusiastic about the way drones make new technology accessible, encouraging students to study subjects they might otherwise not consider. As the students watched in awe, Ms. Alkalay demonstrated the precision and agility of the drone, effortlessly navigating it through a series of complex maneuvers. The event, hosted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Women in Aviation International (WAI) organization, aimed to inspire young girls to pursue careers in aviation and technology.\n\nThe Girls in Aviation Day event was part of a broader initiative to promote STEM education and diversity in the aviation industry. According to the FAA, the number of female pilots has remained stagnant over the past decade, with only about 5% of all pilots being women. The organization hopes that by introducing girls to the world of aviation at a young age, they can increase the representation of women in the industry.\n\nMs. Alkalay's passion for drone technology is contagious, and the students were eager to get hands-on experience with the devices. After the demonstration, they were given the opportunity to try flying the drones themselves, under the guidance of experienced instructors. The event provided a unique chance for the girls to learn about the technical aspects of drone operation, as well as the legal and ethical considerations that come with using these devices.\n\nDrone technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, with applications ranging from recreational use to commercial purposes such as surveying, mapping, and search and rescue operations. As the technology continues to evolve, the demand for skilled drone operators and engineers is expected to grow.\n\nThe Girls in Aviation Day event not only aimed to inspire young girls to pursue careers in aviation but also to provide them with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the industry. Ms. Alkalay emphasized the importance of STEM education, stating, \"Drone technology is an excellent way to introduce students to programming, engineering, and physics. It's a hands-on way to learn about these subjects, and it's a lot of fun.\"\n\nThe event was a resounding success, with many of the students expressing their enthusiasm for the experience. \"I had no idea that drones could be so much fun,\" said 14-year-old Sophia Rodriguez. \"I'm definitely going to look into pursuing a career in aviation now.\"\n\nThe FAA and WAI organization plan to host similar events in the future, with the goal of inspiring more young girls to pursue careers in aviation and technology. As the industry continues to evolve, it is essential to promote diversity and inclusion, ensuring that the next generation of pilots, engineers, and drone operators is representative of the population as a whole.",

        "Text": "A bust-up between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, the US regulator, has backed the aviation giant into a corner over the future of its 737 Max aircraft. The aerospace group said last week that it would halt production of the plane in January after the FAA refused to authorise its return to service until 2020. The Max was grounded around the world in March following two fatal crashes, blamed on new anti-stall software, that claimed 346 lives. Sandy Morris, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies, said the FAA's tougher stance with Boeing and its refusal to rush the plane back into service suggested the Max would not be approved until summer at the earliest. \"My guess is that it's at least another six months [until certification] and may even be longer. It could be a year. If there were another incident, Boeing would be toast. So it feels like it's going to get done properly.\" The FAA's decision to delay the certification of the 737 Max has sent shockwaves through the aviation industry, with many experts predicting a lengthy and costly process to ensure the safety of the aircraft. The grounding of the Max has already had a significant impact on Boeing's financial performance, with the company reporting a net loss of $1.1 billion in the third quarter of this year.\n\nThe delay in certification is also expected to have far-reaching consequences for the airline industry, with many carriers having already taken the Max out of their fleets and replaced them with other aircraft. The grounding of the Max has resulted in a significant shortage of narrow-body aircraft, which is expected to continue until the certification process is complete.\n\nDespite the challenges facing Boeing, the company remains committed to getting the Max back in the air as soon as possible. In a statement, Boeing said it was working closely with the FAA to address all of the issues related to the Max and was confident that the aircraft would be certified and returned to service in the near future.\n\nHowever, the FAA's tough stance on the Max has raised questions about the company's ability to recover from the crisis. The grounding of the Max has already resulted in a significant loss of revenue and reputation for Boeing, and the delay in certification is expected to exacerbate these issues.\n\nIn the meantime, Boeing is facing increased competition from its rivals, with Airbus and other manufacturers stepping up production to meet the demand for narrow-body aircraft. The competition is expected to be fierce, with many airlines opting for alternative aircraft to the Max.\n\nDespite the challenges facing Boeing, the company remains committed to getting the Max back in the air as soon as possible.

        "Text": "Sexual harassment, bullying and racist stereotyping are common in the technology industry, creating a culture that drives underrepresented employees out of their jobs, new research has found. One in 10 women in tech experience unwanted sexual attention, and nearly one in four people of color face stereotyping, according to the Kapor Center for Social Impact and Harris Poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 people who left tech jobs in the last three years. The findings â€“ which suggest that sexual harassment and complaints about unfairness are disproportionately high in the tech sector compared to other industries â€“ come at a time of heightened debates around diversity and discrimination in Silicon Valley. \"For each person who experiences unfairness, it's very personal and it's very painful,\" said Ellen Pao, Kapor's chief diversity and inclusion officer and former Reddit CEO, who has been outspoken about discrimination. \"As someone who has been working in the tech industry since 1998, I know it's prevalent, and now we have the data so people can understand the scale.\" A former Uber engineer's recent account of facing rampant sexism and sexual misconduct has shined a harsh light on a startup culture that is dominated by white men and condones mistreatment of marginalized employees. Critics have increasingly argued that tech firms dedicated to \"disruption\" are rejecting labor standards while male executives ignore complaints about discrimination and do little to fix systemic pay disparities. The survey's findings highlight the need for immediate action to address the pervasive culture of discrimination and harassment in the tech industry. The Kapor Center and Harris Poll recommend that companies implement policies and procedures to prevent and address these issues, including providing training for employees and managers on unconscious bias, creating safe reporting mechanisms for victims of harassment, and conducting regular audits to ensure fair treatment.\n\nThe report also suggests that companies should prioritize diversity and inclusion by actively recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups, such as women and people of color. This can be achieved through targeted hiring initiatives, mentorship programs, and leadership development opportunities.\n\nIn response to the report's findings, several tech companies have issued statements expressing their commitment to creating a more inclusive and respectful work environment. \"We take these allegations very seriously and are committed to creating a workplace where everyone feels valued and respected,\" said a spokesperson for one of the largest tech companies in the industry.\n\nHowever, critics argue that these statements are empty words without concrete actions to back them up. \"Companies need to stop making vague promises and start taking real steps to address the systemic issues that drive marginalized employees out of their jobs,\" said a former employee who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nThe report's findings have also sparked a renewed call for regulatory action to address the lack of accountability in the tech industry. \"It's clear that self-regulation is not working, and it's time for the government to step in and ensure that tech companies are held accountable for their actions,\" said a leading advocate for workers' rights.\n\nAs the tech industry grapples with these issues, it is clear that the road to creating a more inclusive and respectful work environment will be long and challenging. However, it is also clear that the stakes are too high to ignore the problem any longer. The future of the tech industry depends on its ability to address these issues and create a workplace where everyone can thrive.",

It shows there is only one job advertised for every six low-skilled jobseekers in Australia, and the problem is worsening. The Anglicare report, Positions Vacant? When the Jobs Aren't There, has warned the growing complexity of the economy has contributed to a downward trend for lower-skilled roles over the last decade, and an increase in demand for high-level roles. It raised concerns about the number of low-skilled people being pushed below the poverty line because the labour market can no longer accommodate them. According to the report, 13% of all jobs advertised in May were for entry-level positions, which require year 10 or equivalent education, marking a steep decline from 21% in 2006. The report also highlighted the significant disparity between the number of job seekers with limited skills and experience and the availability of entry-level positions.

Researchers said the engraving suggested ritualized cannibalism. When Silvia Bello gives lectures about cannibalism, she starts by asking her audience to imagine a cannibal. \"Normally, people think of Hannibal Lecter or something that's disturbing,\" said Dr. Bello, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London. But archaeological evidence suggests that most cannibalism in human history was not the work of serial killers. Instead, it occurred for complex and varied reasons. The discovery of the zigzag pattern on the human arm bone has shed new light on the practice of cannibalism in prehistoric times. According to Dr. Bello, the engraving is a rare example of a deliberate and ritualized act of cannibalism, which was likely performed as a way to honor the deceased or to consume their strength and vitality.\n\nThe finding has sparked a heated debate among archaeologists and anthropologists about the motivations behind cannibalism in ancient societies. While some believe that cannibalism was a common practice in many cultures, others argue that it was a rare and isolated occurrence.\n\nDr. Bello, who has spent years studying the remains of ancient humans, believes that cannibalism was a complex and multifaceted practice that was driven by a variety of factors. \"In some cases, cannibalism may have been a way to ensure survival in times of scarcity or famine,\" she said. \"In other cases, it may have been a way to honor the dead or to consume their strength and vitality.\"\n\nThe discovery of the zigzag pattern has also raised questions about the role of cannibalism in ancient cultures.

The embattled ride-sharing company, which is facing a high-stakes intellectual property lawsuit over its self-driving car technology, said it is partnering with aircraft manufacturers to develop an \"on-demand\" network of \"vertical take-off and landing vehicles\". The announcement at the company's inaugural Elevate Summit in Dallas on Tuesday marks Uber's latest push to transform urban transportation, following numerous controversial programs that have led to high-profile conflicts with governments across the globe. Many questions remain about how flying cars will work and how cities will regulate the technology and on-demand systems. The San Francisco-based company has a long history of openly flouting regulations and defying existing laws that control the taxi industry and govern the testing of autonomous vehicles. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory framework, Uber is forging ahead with its plan to revolutionize urban transportation. The company has already begun working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop guidelines for the testing and deployment of flying cars.\n\nUber's Elevate Summit, attended by industry experts, policymakers, and investors, aimed to showcase the company's vision for the future of transportation. The event featured demonstrations of the company's prototype flying car, the Uber Air Taxi, which is designed to be electric and capable of vertical takeoff and landing.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its infancy, Uber is confident that flying cars will become a viable alternative to traditional ground transportation. The company claims that the flying cars will be able to travel at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour, reducing travel times and increasing productivity.\n\nHowever, many experts have raised concerns about the safety and feasibility of flying cars. Dr. John Smith, a transportation expert at the University of California, Berkeley, expressed concerns about the potential risks of flying cars, including the risk of accidents, noise pollution, and air traffic congestion.\n\n\"It's unclear how flying cars will fit into the existing air traffic control system, and there are many unanswered questions about how they will be regulated,\" Dr. Smith said. \"Additionally, there are concerns about the environmental impact of flying cars, which will likely be powered by fossil fuels.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, Uber is pushing forward with its plan to launch a flying car service by 2020. The company has already partnered with several aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing and Bell, to develop the technology.\n\nIn addition to the flying car service, Uber is also exploring the use of drones to deliver packages and medical supplies. The company has already launched a pilot program in Dubai, where drones are being used to deliver packages to customers.\n\nWhile the future of flying cars is uncertain, Uber's commitment to the technology is clear. The company's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has stated that flying cars will be a key part of the company's strategy to transform urban transportation.\n\n\"We believe that flying cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, and we're committed to making it a reality,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"We're excited to be at the forefront of this technology and to be working with the FAA and other stakeholders to ensure that it's developed and deployed safely and responsibly.\"\n\nAs the debate over flying cars continues, one thing is clear: the future of urban transportation is likely to be shaped by the development of this technology. Whether it will be a success or a failure remains to be seen, but one thing is certain - the world will be watching as Uber and other companies push the boundaries of what is possible.",

Media Matters, a left-leaning advocacy organization with a prolific media-watchdog blog, has received a green rating, but scores negatively on four of the nine criteria used by NewsGuard. The start-up hopes to become a regular part of the reading experience on the web. Its premise is that it is more efficient to rate news organizations than the endless stream of articles rolled out each hour. The company plans to achieve this by partnering with major internet browsers and search engines to integrate its ratings into their platforms. This would allow users to easily identify trustworthy sources of information and avoid misinformation. NewsGuard's ratings are based on nine criteria, including the site's transparency about its funding, its use of anonymous sources, and its corrections policy.\n\nAccording to the company, its ratings are not intended to be a definitive or absolute measure of a news organization's credibility, but rather a tool to help readers make informed decisions about the sources they consume. \"We're not saying that a green-rated site is perfect, and we're not saying that a red-rated site is always wrong,\" said Steve Brill, co-founder and CEO of NewsGuard. \"But we are saying that a green-rated site has demonstrated a commitment to transparency, accountability, and accuracy, and that a red-rated site has not.\"\n\nNewsGuard's ratings are also designed to be dynamic, meaning that they can change over time as a news organization's practices and policies evolve. The company plans to regularly update its ratings to reflect changes in a site's credibility.\n\nThe partnership with Microsoft is a significant milestone for NewsGuard, as it marks the company's first major client. The deal will see NewsGuard's ratings integrated into Microsoft's Edge browser, allowing users to access its ratings directly from the browser's toolbar.\n\nNewsGuard's efforts have been met with a mixed reaction from the media industry. Some have praised the company's initiative, seeing it as a necessary step to combat the spread of misinformation online. Others have criticized the company's approach, arguing that its ratings are subjective and may be influenced by its own biases.\n\nDespite these criticisms, NewsGuard remains committed to its mission of promoting transparency and accountability in the media. The company plans to continue working with major internet browsers and search engines to integrate its ratings into their platforms, and to continue developing its technology to help readers make informed decisions about the sources they consume.\n\nIn the end, the success of NewsGuard's efforts will depend on its ability to strike a balance between promoting transparency and accountability in the media, while also respecting the diversity of opinions and perspectives that exist online. If successful, the company's ratings could become a standard feature of the online reading experience, helping to promote a more informed and engaged citizenry.",

        "Text": "Does a sleeping octopus -- this one is not Heidi -- change colors to match an experience it had while awake? Or is the explanation simpler, nothing more than the twitching of muscles that control color-changing organs? Heidi the octopus is sleeping. Her body is still, eight arms tucked neatly away. But her skin is restless. She turns from ghostly white to yellow, flashes deep red, then goes mottled green and bumpy like plant life. Her muscles clench and relax, sending a tendril of arm loose. If you haven't seen this video clip yet, from a PBS documentary, Nature, watch it here:\n\nFrom the outside, the cephalopod looks like a person twitching and muttering during a dream, or like a napping dog chasing dream-squirrels. As the video clip continues to play, it becomes clear that Heidi's color-changing abilities are not limited to her waking hours. Her body language, or rather, her body color, seems to be responding to some internal stimulus, one that is not necessarily linked to her current surroundings.\n\nBut what could be causing this phenomenon? Scientists have long been fascinated by the remarkable ability of octopuses to change color, a process known as camouflage or cryptic behavior. This ability allows them to blend in with their surroundings, making it easier for them to hunt, hide from predators, and even communicate with other octopuses.\n\nOne theory is that Heidi's color changes are simply a result of the twitching of her muscles, as mentioned earlier. This theory suggests that the muscles that control the color-changing organs in her skin are still active even when she is asleep, causing the colors to shift and change. This would be a natural extension of the octopus's ability to change color during the day, and would not require any significant changes to the underlying biology of the creature.\n\nHowever, some scientists believe that there may be more to it than just simple muscle twitching. They suggest that Heidi's color changes could be a sign of a more complex cognitive process, one that involves the octopus's brain processing and interpreting its own experiences and memories.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a leading expert on octopus behavior, \"Octopuses have been shown to have a remarkable ability to process and store memories, even in the absence of a central nervous system. It's possible that Heidi's color changes are a manifestation of this ability, a way for her to relive and re-experience her waking moments even in her sleep.\"\n\nWhile this theory is still purely speculative, it raises interesting questions about the nature of consciousness and the ability of animals to process and interpret their own experiences. As scientists continue to study Heidi and other octopuses, they may uncover new insights into the workings of the cephalopod brain and the secrets of its remarkable color-changing abilities.\n\nIn the meantime, the video clip of Heidi the octopus remains a fascinating and mesmerizing glimpse into the world of these incredible creatures. Whether or not we can fully understand the meaning behind Heidi's color changes, one thing is clear: she is a remarkable and captivating animal, one that continues to inspire and intrigue us with its unique abilities and behaviors.",

        "Text": "Atlantic Coast residents digging out from last weekend's blizzard may be relieved to know that a standard homeowner's insurance policy covers most types of damage caused by winter storms. \"We pay for most things that are the result of a snowstorm,\" said Don Griffin, vice president of personal lines at the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. That includes damage from high winds, heavy snow and ice, said Jeanne Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. So, for instance, if strong winds blew a hole in your roof, and then snow and ice fell through the opening and damaged the home's interior and your belongings, the damage is covered. Coverage is, of course, usually subject to a deductible, which is an amount subtracted from the loss that the homeowner pays. Deductibles are often a flat amount -- say, $500 or $1,000 -- or may be based on a percentage of the home's insured value. However, homeowners should be aware that there are some exceptions to what is typically covered. For example, damage caused by flooding, which is a common occurrence during heavy snowmelt, is usually not covered under a standard homeowner's policy. This is because flooding is considered a separate risk that requires a separate policy, known as flood insurance.\n\n\"Standard homeowner's policies do not cover flood damage, which is a major risk in areas prone to heavy snowfall,\" said Griffin. \"Homeowners who live in flood-prone areas should consider purchasing flood insurance to protect their homes and belongings from this type of damage.\"\n\nAdditionally, homeowners should also be aware that their policy may have specific exclusions or limitations for certain types of damage. For instance, some policies may not cover damage caused by ice dams, which can occur when snow melts and then freezes into a thick layer of ice on the roof.\n\n\"If you have a policy that doesn't cover ice dams, and you experience damage as a result, you may be out of luck,\" said Salvatore. \"It's important for homeowners to carefully review their policy to understand what is and isn't covered.\"\n\nDespite these exceptions, many homeowners are still relieved to know that their standard homeowner's policy covers most types of damage caused by winter storms. With the right coverage, homeowners can rest assured that they are protected against unexpected damage and can focus on getting back to normal after a storm.\n\nIn the aftermath of last weekend's blizzard, many homeowners are still dealing with the aftermath of the storm. From downed power lines to damaged roofs, the impact of the storm has been significant. However, with the right insurance coverage, homeowners can rest assured that they are protected against unexpected damage and can focus on getting back to normal.\n\nIn the coming days, homeowners are advised to carefully review their policy to understand what is and isn't covered. By doing so, they can ensure that they are properly protected against any unexpected damage caused by winter storms.",

        "Text": "DNA Study Reveals the One and Only Wolf Species in North America\n\nThe first large study of North American wolf genomes has found that there is only one species on the continent: the gray wolf. Two other purported species, the Eastern wolf and the red wolf, are mixes of gray wolf and coyote DNA, the scientists behind the study concluded. The finding, announced Wednesday, highlights the shortcomings of laws intended to protect endangered species, as such laws lag far behind scientific research into the evolution of species. The gray wolf and red wolf were listed as endangered in the lower 48 states under the Endangered Species Act in the 1970s and remain protected today, to the periodic consternation of ranchers and agricultural interests. In 2013, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service recognized the Eastern wolf as a separate species, which led officials to recommend delisting the gray wolf. Conservationists won a lawsuit that forced the agency to abandon the plan. The new finding sharpens a scientific question at the heart of that debate: How should the Endangered Species Act address threatened animals that are hybrids? \"What's very exciting about this paper is that it's using extremely powerful tools to address longstanding, challenging questions in conservation,\" said Ryan Kovach, a research wildlife biologist at the United States Geological Survey who was not involved in the new study. When Europeans arrived in North America, wolves roamed much of the continent. Farmers and ranchers almost entirely eradicated them from what is now the United States. The study, published in the journal Science, analyzed the DNA of 129 wolves from across North America, including the gray wolf, Eastern wolf, and red wolf. The researchers used a technique called genotyping, which involves identifying specific genetic markers, to determine the ancestry of each wolf.\n\nThe results showed that the gray wolf is the only pure species of wolf in North America, with the Eastern wolf and red wolf being hybrids between gray wolves and coyotes. The study found that the Eastern wolf, which is found in the Great Lakes region and northeastern United States, has a mix of gray wolf and coyote DNA, with the majority of its ancestry coming from gray wolves. The red wolf, found in the southeastern United States, has a mix of gray wolf and coyote DNA, with a majority of its ancestry coming from coyotes.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for conservation efforts. The Endangered Species Act is designed to protect threatened and endangered species, but the study highlights the challenges of defining and protecting hybrid species. The red wolf, for example, is currently listed as an endangered species, but the study suggests that it may not be a distinct species.\n\n\"This study highlights the complexity of species conservation and the need for a nuanced approach to protecting threatened and endangered species,\" said Dr. Kathryn Long, a conservation biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"Conservation efforts should focus on protecting the integrity of ecosystems, rather than trying to categorize species into distinct groups.\"\n\nThe study also raises questions about the impact of human activities on wolf populations. The decline of gray wolves in North America is attributed to habitat loss, hunting, and human-wolf conflict. The study suggests that conservation efforts should focus on protecting and restoring wolf habitats, as well as addressing human-wolf conflict.\n\nThe findings of the study are likely to be controversial, as they challenge the current classification of the Eastern wolf and red wolf as separate species. However, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of wolf genetics and highlights the importance of considering the evolutionary history of species when making conservation decisions.\n\n\"This study is a game-changer for wolf conservation,\" said Dr. Adrian Treves, a conservation biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"It provides a scientific basis for understanding wolf evolution and highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to protecting threatened and endangered species.\"\n\nThe study's findings are likely to have significant implications for conservation efforts in North America, and will likely spark a renewed debate about the classification and protection of wolf species.",

        "Text": "Here's the mission for Japan's Hayabusa2 spacecraft in a nutshell: Fly to a carbon-rich asteroid between the orbits of Earth and Mars, study it for a year and a half and then bring back some pieces for additional study on Earth. Like most space missions, that's much easier said than done. Launched in 2014, Hayabusa2 is just now approaching its target, Ryugu, an asteroid about half a mile wide. The Japanese astronomers studying it say it has the shape of a top or even an abacus bead. That's a big improvement from earlier in June when it sent back a picture taken at a distance of about 1,600 miles -- the asteroid then was just three pixels across and looked like something drawn in the blocky style of Minecraft. Hayabusa2 is powered by ion engines, which accelerate charged atoms of xenon with an electric field to generate thrust. Ion engines are a very efficient form of propulsion but not very powerful. That means Hayabusa2 can carry much less fuel than traditional thrusters would require, but it also means that it could not take a quick, direct route. The spacecraft used a flyby of Earth in December 2015 to accelerate and match its trajectory with the tilted orbit of the asteroid. Hayabusa is the Japanese word for peregrine falcon. [Get a reminder on your calendar for rocket launches and other space events.] When will the spacecraft reach Ryugu? According to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Hayabusa2 is expected to reach its target asteroid Ryugu on June 27, 2018. The spacecraft is currently about 12 million miles away from the asteroid and is slowly closing in on its destination.\n\nOnce Hayabusa2 reaches Ryugu, it will enter into orbit around the asteroid and begin its year-and-a-half-long mission to study the asteroid's surface, composition, and atmosphere. The spacecraft is equipped with a range of instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and radar, which will allow scientists to gather detailed information about the asteroid's properties.\n\nOne of the main goals of the Hayabusa2 mission is to understand the origin and evolution of asteroids like Ryugu. Asteroids are remnants from the early days of the solar system, and studying them can provide valuable insights into the formation and development of our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nIn addition to its scientific objectives, Hayabusa2 is also designed to test new technologies and techniques for asteroid exploration. The spacecraft is equipped with a small robotic arm, known as the Sample Return Capsule (SRC), which will be used to collect samples from Ryugu's surface. The SRC will then be sealed and returned to Earth, where scientists will be able to study the samples in detail.\n\nThe Hayabusa2 mission is a significant undertaking for JAXA and the international scientific community. It represents a major step forward in our understanding of asteroids and their potential role in the evolution of our solar system. As the spacecraft approaches its target, scientists and engineers are eagerly anticipating the wealth of new information that will be gathered during the mission.",

DAMARISCOTTA, Me. -- Alice Kelley stood on the bank of a tidal river, next to a grassy bluff dotted with apple trees. This is not just a scenic spot: Hidden beneath the grass is a massive pile of oyster shells left by Native Americans. And hidden among those shells are rich, detailed stories thousands of years old. As Kelley, a professor of anthropology at the University of Maine, gazed out at the bluff, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and reverence for the ancient history that lay beneath her feet. The shell midden, known as the Damariscotta Midden, is one of the largest and most significant archaeological sites in the region, and Kelley has spent years studying its secrets.\n\nThe midden, which dates back to around 3,000 BCE, is a testament to the thriving communities of Native Americans who once inhabited the area. The shells, which cover an estimated 10,000 square feet, are a treasure trove of information, containing clues about the daily lives, trade networks, and cultural practices of the people who lived there.\n\nKelley and her team, including graduate student Jacque Miller, have been using ground-penetrating radar technology to map the midden and uncover its secrets. The radar, which uses radio waves to penetrate the earth and create detailed images of what lies beneath, has allowed the team to identify patterns and structures that were previously unknown.\n\nOne of the most significant discoveries made by the team is the presence of a large, circular structure that appears to be some kind of ceremonial or ritual space. The structure, which is estimated to be around 30 feet in diameter, is surrounded by a series of concentric circles, suggesting that it may have been used for important cultural or spiritual events.\n\n\"This is a game-changer,\" said Kelley, her eyes shining with excitement. \"We've never seen anything like this before. It's a major find, and it's going to change the way we understand the history of this region.\"\n\nThe team's findings have also shed new light on the lives of the people who lived in the area. By analyzing the types of shells and other artifacts found at the site, Kelley and her team have been able to reconstruct a detailed picture of the daily lives of the Native Americans who lived there.\n\n\"We're learning more and more about the people who lived here,\" said Miller, who is working on her master's thesis on the midden. \"We're finding out what they ate, what they wore, and how they lived. It's amazing to think about the lives of these people, and to know that we're uncovering their stories.\"\n\nThe discovery of the Damariscotta Midden is a significant one, not just for the University of Maine, but for the entire region. It's a reminder of the rich cultural heritage that lies just beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered. And as Kelley and her team continue to study the site, they're uncovering stories that will help to shape our understanding of the past, and inform our understanding of the present.",

The expansion pushed Britain into second place among the G7 industrialised nations, after the Office for National Statistics revised down annual UK growth to 1.8%, from an initial estimate of 2%. Germany's economic resurgence has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a strong manufacturing sector, a boost in exports, and a surge in consumer spending. The country's central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, has also implemented a series of monetary policies aimed at stimulating growth, including cutting interest rates and introducing quantitative easing measures.\n\nIn contrast, the UK's growth rate was impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the country's decision to leave the European Union, also known as Brexit. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the UK's economy grew by 1.8% in 2016, down from an initial estimate of 2%. This revision was largely due to a slowdown in the country's service sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the UK's economy.\n\nThe slowdown in the service sector was attributed to a decline in business investment and a decrease in consumer spending. The ONS also reported that the UK's construction sector experienced a significant decline, with a 1.2% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was largely due to a decline in new housing starts and a decrease in public sector construction projects.\n\nDespite the slowdown, the UK's economy remains one of the largest and most developed in the world. The country's strong financial sector and highly skilled workforce have helped to drive growth and attract foreign investment. However, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has created a sense of uncertainty and has led to a decline in business investment and consumer spending.\n\nGermany's growth rate, on the other hand, has been driven by a strong manufacturing sector, which has benefited from the country's close trade ties with other European countries. The country's car industry, in particular, has experienced a surge in demand, with exports rising by 10% in 2016. The country's chemical and pharmaceutical industries have also experienced strong growth, with exports rising by 12% and 15%, respectively.\n\nThe strong growth in Germany's economy has also been driven by a surge in consumer spending, which rose by 2.3% in 2016. This has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a decline in unemployment and an increase in wages. The country's central bank has also implemented a series of monetary policies aimed at stimulating growth, including cutting interest rates and introducing quantitative easing measures.\n\nIn conclusion, Germany's economy has overtaken the UK as the fastest growing among the G7 states, with a growth rate of 1.9% in 2016.

        "Text": "Households in the UK are increasingly relying on borrowed money with one in four people seeking a loan applying for at least half of their annual income, according to new figures that will add to worries about Britain's mounting personal debt burden. The latest evidence of a rise in borrowing to fund new car purchases, holidays and to help clear older debts follows a stark warning from the Bank of England that lenders offering money on easy terms risked sparking a fresh financial crisis. Banks, credit card companies and car loan providers could be dicing with a \"spiral of complacency\", the Bank's director for financial stability said on Monday. To analyse the rise in demand for debt, price comparison company MoneySuperMarket looked at 3m loan inquiries made on its site from January 2015 to March 2017 and found the average sum sought had increased by 3.5% in that time. The analysis by MoneySuperMarket also revealed that the proportion of people seeking loans to fund new car purchases has risen significantly, with 44% of loan inquiries made for this purpose. This is likely due to the increasing popularity of personal contract purchase (PCP) deals, which allow consumers to drive away a new car for a lower monthly payment, with the option to return the vehicle at the end of the agreement.\n\nHowever, experts warn that this trend could have serious consequences for individuals and the economy as a whole. \"While it may seem like a convenient way to get a new car, PCP deals can be a slippery slope,\" said Sarah Jones, a financial analyst at MoneySuperMarket. \"Consumers need to be aware that they are committing to a long-term contract, and that the monthly payments can quickly add up if the car is not returned at the end of the agreement.\"\n\nThe rise in demand for debt is also being driven by people seeking to consolidate their existing debts, with 22% of loan inquiries made for this purpose. This trend is likely due to the increasing cost of living and stagnant wages, which are leaving many households struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe Bank of England's warning about the risks of easy credit comes as the country's personal debt burden reaches record levels. According to the Office for National Statistics, the total amount of personal debt in the UK stood at Â£1.56 trillion in the first quarter of this year, with the majority of this debt held by households.\n\nThe Bank's director for financial stability, Andy Haldane, warned that lenders were taking on too much risk by offering easy credit to consumers. \"We are seeing a spiral of complacency, where lenders are competing with each other to offer ever more attractive deals to consumers,\" he said. \"But this is a recipe for disaster, as it can lead to a surge in defaults and a fresh financial crisis.\"\n\nThe government has been criticized for its lack of action to address the issue of personal debt, with many experts calling for stricter regulations on lenders and greater support for those struggling to pay their debts.\n\nIn response to the growing concern, some lenders are starting to take a more cautious approach to lending. \"We are seeing a shift towards more responsible lending practices, with lenders becoming more discerning about who they lend to and at what interest rate,\" said Mark Taylor, a financial expert at the debt charity, StepChange.\n\nHowever, more needs to be done to address the root causes of personal debt and to support those who are struggling to make ends meet. Until then, the risks of a fresh financial crisis remain high, and households in the UK must be careful not to get caught up in the spiral of debt.",

Throughout the year, Pepsi ambassadors will issue a range of challenges that cater to different interests and passions. For example, in the spring, a challenge will be launched that encourages fans to share their own environmental initiatives and sustainability projects, with the winner receiving a grant to support their efforts.\n\nIn the summer, a music-themed challenge will be launched, where fans can showcase their own musical talents and compete for a chance to perform at a major music festival. And in the fall, a fitness challenge will be launched, where fans can share their own workout routines and compete for a chance to win a year's supply of Pepsi.\n\nThe challenges are designed to be fun, yet also meaningful and impactful. According to Jakeman, the goal is to create a sense of belonging and connection among Pepsi fans, while also promoting positive values and behaviors.\n\n\"We're not just trying to sell soda,\" said Jakeman. \"We're trying to create a movement that inspires people to be their best selves and to make a positive impact on the world.\"\n\nThe Pepsi Challenge is expected to be a major driver of engagement for the brand, with millions of fans expected to participate across social media platforms. The campaign will also be supported by a series of TV commercials and in-store promotions, which will highlight the challenges and encourage fans to get involved.\n\nFor Pepsi, the return of the Pepsi Challenge marks a significant shift in its marketing strategy. Gone are the days of traditional advertising and sponsorship deals. Instead, the brand is embracing social media and digital technology to connect with consumers in new and innovative ways.\n\n\"It's a new era for Pepsi,\" said Jakeman. \"We're no longer just a beverage company. We're a movement. And we're excited to see where this journey takes us.\"",

In his first public remarks since abruptly resigning from Fox News last month, the anchor Shepard Smith called on Thursday for a steadfast defense of independent journalism, while offering a few subtle barbs at President Trump's treatment of the press. And in a surprise announcement, Mr. Smith said he would personally donate $500,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group that advances press freedoms around the world. \"Intimidation and vilification of the press is now a global phenomenon. Smith's remarks were met with applause from the audience of journalists, media executives, and human rights advocates gathered at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City. The event marked the 30th anniversary of the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has worked tirelessly to promote press freedom and protect journalists from persecution and violence.\n\nSmith, who spent 23 years at Fox News, where he was known for his straight-shooting reporting style and sharp critiques of the Trump administration, said that the current climate for journalists is more challenging than ever. \"We are facing a global assault on the truth, and it's not just about the United States,\" he warned. \"Intimidation and vilification of the press is now a global phenomenon, and it's up to us to stand up for our right to report the news without fear or favor.\"\n\nThe anchor also took aim at President Trump's frequent attacks on the media, saying that the president's rhetoric has contributed to a toxic atmosphere that has led to violence and harassment against journalists. \"We've seen journalists physically attacked, threatened, and even killed for doing their jobs,\" Smith said. \"And it's not just the journalists who are suffering â€“ it's the public who is losing out on accurate and unbiased information.\"\n\nSmith's donation to the Committee to Protect Journalists was seen as a significant boost to the organization's efforts to promote press freedom. The committee has been working to support journalists in countries such as Turkey, Egypt, and Cambodia, where they face severe restrictions and persecution.\n\nIn a statement, Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, praised Smith's generosity and commitment to press freedom. \"Shepard Smith's donation is a powerful symbol of his commitment to the values of independent journalism,\" Simon said. \"We are grateful for his support and look forward to continuing our work together to protect journalists and promote press freedom around the world.\"\n\nThe event was also attended by other prominent journalists and media figures, including CNN's Christiane Amanpour and The New York Times' editorial page editor, James Bennet. The evening's program featured a series of awards and tributes to journalists who have risked their lives to report the news, including a posthumous award to the slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAs the evening drew to a close, Smith's message of solidarity and defiance resonated with the audience. \"We are not just journalists â€“ we are the guardians of democracy,\" he said. \"And we will continue to report the news, no matter what, because that's what the public needs and deserves.\"",

        "Text": "The culture secretary has ruled out privatising Channel 4 following a protracted review of its long-term future, but in return wants the state-owned broadcaster to relocate some or all of its operations outside London. Karen Bradley will use a speech in Salford to announce that the new home of The Great British Bake Off will remain publicly owned, while increasing pressure for it to move large parts of its business from its existing headquarters. The broadcaster welcomed the decision against privatisation, but said a major move would be \"highly damaging to Channel 4's business model and diminish our investment in the creative industries around the UK and our overall contribution to the UK economy\". Tuesday's decision marks the end of an 18-month ownership review that has strained relations between Channel 4 and the government. Bradley will say the broadcaster is a \"precious public asset\" that will continue to be \"owned by the country\". However, speaking at the Nations and Regions Media Conference, Bradley will announce the launch of another consultation on whether to move Channel 4 out of London to \"serve the country\" and spread creative jobs and opportunities throughout the UK. Channel 4 has resisted the possibility of moving out of its Â£100m headquarters in Victoria, London, since the government floated potential relocation plans last summer, with cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds in the frame as potential new homes. \"We want the benefits of this national asset to be spread far and wide, not just in London,\" Bradley is expected to say. According to sources close to the matter, the government's decision to keep Channel 4 in public ownership has been met with relief by the broadcaster's staff and the creative industry as a whole. The announcement has also sparked a mix of emotions among the public, with some welcoming the news and others expressing concerns about the potential relocation of the broadcaster's operations.\n\nIndustry experts have long argued that Channel 4's presence in London has contributed significantly to the city's thriving creative economy, and that a move to another city could have a ripple effect on the local job market and economy. The broadcaster itself has emphasized the importance of its London base, citing its close proximity to major production companies, studios, and talent.\n\nHowever, proponents of the move argue that relocating Channel 4 to another part of the country could bring new opportunities and investment to regions that have historically been underrepresented in the media industry. They point to the success of other broadcasters, such as the BBC's move to Salford, which has brought jobs and economic growth to the region.\n\nThe consultation process is expected to be lengthy and will involve public feedback and input from industry stakeholders. Channel 4 has already begun engaging with local authorities and businesses in potential relocation cities, including Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds, to gauge their interest and assess the feasibility of a move.\n\nWhile the exact timeline for the relocation is unclear, industry insiders suggest that it could take several years to complete, pending the outcome of the consultation and any necessary regulatory approvals. In the meantime, Channel 4 will continue to operate from its London headquarters, with a renewed focus on its core mission of providing high-quality, innovative programming to audiences across the UK.\n\nThe decision has also raised questions about the government's broader approach to the media industry and its role in supporting creative industries outside of London. Some have criticized the government's handling of the Channel 4 review, accusing it of prioritizing short-term economic gains over long-term cultural and creative benefits.\n\nAs the debate surrounding Channel 4's relocation continues, one thing is clear: the future of the broadcaster and its impact on the UK's creative economy will be closely watched and debated in the coming months and years.",

European investigators entered the offices of IMG and MP & Silva on 10 April as part of a series of raids timed simultaneously including at the 21st Century Fox subsidiary Fox Networks Group, which is based in Hammersmith, west London, and Ziggo Sport, the Dutch subsidiary owned by Vodafone and Virgin Media parent Liberty Global. IMG, one of the most venerable and prestigious sports rights and management agencies in the world, handles rights including Wimbledon, the ATP Tennis Tour as well as production of Premier League matches in some international markets. The raids, which took place on April 10, are part of a broader investigation into potential sports rights cartels, with officials from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition (DG Comp) seeking to uncover any evidence of anti-competitive behavior. The investigation is focused on the sports rights market, where IMG and other agencies play a significant role in negotiating and managing broadcasting rights for various sports events and leagues.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the investigation, the European Commission is examining whether certain sports rights agencies, including IMG and MP & Silva, have engaged in anti-competitive practices, such as colluding to fix prices, restrict competition, or divide up markets. The commission is also investigating whether these agencies have used their dominant market positions to stifle innovation and limit consumer choice.\n\nThe raids on the offices of IMG, MP & Silva, and other companies are a significant escalation of the investigation, which began several years ago. The European Commission has been gathering evidence and conducting interviews with industry insiders, but the raids mark the first time that officials have entered the offices of these companies to seize documents and data.\n\nThe investigation has sent shockwaves through the sports industry, with many companies and individuals affected by the raids and the potential consequences of anti-competitive behavior. The Premier League, which has a significant presence in the UK and globally, has issued a statement expressing its support for the European Commission's investigation and its commitment to ensuring a fair and competitive market for sports rights.\n\nThe investigation is also likely to have implications for the global sports industry, which is worth billions of dollars annually. The sports rights market is highly concentrated, with a few large agencies, including IMG, holding significant sway over the market. The European Commission's investigation is aimed at ensuring that these agencies do not use their power to stifle competition and limit consumer choice.\n\nAs the investigation continues, it remains to be seen what evidence the European Commission will uncover and what consequences the companies involved will face. However, the raids on the offices of IMG and MP & Silva are a clear indication that the commission is taking the investigation seriously and is committed to ensuring that the sports rights market is fair and competitive.",

Still bitter, executives sent Thomas E. Dooley, Viacom's 30-year-old treasurer, to greet Mr. Redstone when he visited the Viacom office, the new boss wearing a plaid jacket bought on his way, the Filene's Basement price tag still visible. Nearly three decades later, Mr. Redstone, with his daughter, Shari Redstone, at his side, has won yet another caustic fight for control of Viacom and the future of his $40 billion media empire. The battle has ruined relationships with some of Mr. Redstone's longest confidants, exposed family feuds and sent Viacom into turmoil. Once again, Mr. Dooley is acting as the go-between for the entrenched Viacom regime and the Redstones. On Friday, Viacom elevated Mr. Dooley to interim chief executive from chief operating officer. He was appointed as Viacom announced that the embattled Philippe P. Dauman had stepped down as chief executive, with a severance package valued at about $72 million. (Since being named chief executive of Viacom in 2006, Mr. Dauman's total reported compensation was $409.7 million even as the company has struggled in recent years.) With a truce declared in the battle for control of the 93-year-old Mr. Redstone's companies, a harsh spotlight now is focused on Viacom's struggling business. The company, which owns the MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable television networks and the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, has had a nearly 50 percent plunge in its share price in the last two years. This was the company that ignited the careers of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, brought to life characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer and had generations demanding the music videos of MTV. As Viacom's new interim CEO, Thomas E. Dooley faces a daunting task: to stabilize the company's faltering business and restore investor confidence. With a legacy of iconic brands and a storied history, Viacom has struggled to adapt to the rapidly changing media landscape. The company's inability to effectively monetize its vast library of content, particularly in the digital age, has led to a decline in its share price and a loss of relevance among younger audiences.\n\nDooley, who has spent nearly three decades at Viacom, is well-equipped to tackle the challenges ahead. As treasurer, he played a key role in the company's financial planning and strategy development. His promotion to interim CEO is seen as a stabilizing force, bringing a sense of continuity and familiarity to the role.\n\nHowever, the road ahead will not be easy. Viacom's struggles are not limited to its financial performance. The company has also faced criticism for its inability to effectively manage its diverse portfolio of brands. The once-thriving MTV and Comedy Central networks have seen their ratings decline in recent years, while the Paramount Pictures studio has struggled to produce a consistent stream of hit films.\n\nIn a statement, Dooley acknowledged the challenges facing the company, but expressed optimism about its future. \"Viacom has a rich history of innovation and creativity, and I am confident that we can return to our roots and build a brighter future for the company,\" he said.\n\nThe Redstones, who have a significant stake in Viacom's future, will be closely watching Dooley's progress. Sumner Redstone, the company's controlling shareholder, has a reputation for being a demanding and exacting leader. His daughter, Shari, who has been involved in the company's operations for several years, will likely play a key role in shaping the company's strategy and direction.\n\nAs Viacom begins its latest chapter, one thing is clear: the company's future is far from certain. With a new CEO at the helm, the company will need to navigate a complex and rapidly changing media landscape to remain relevant and successful. The path ahead will be fraught with challenges, but with the right leadership and strategy, Viacom can once again become a dominant force in the entertainment industry.",

The high street chemist announced on Thursday that it had started to sell a new, cheaper generic version of the morning-after pill in 38 of its stores and would make it available in all 2,500 by October. \"We have listened to our customers' feedback and we committed to sourcing a less expensive emergency hormonal contraceptive to enable us to make a privately funded EHC service more accessible in the future,\" Boots said. \"We can confirm that four weeks ago we started the rollout of this service to 38 stores and have been offering it with a new, less expensive generic version of EHC (Levonorgestrel) at a cost of Â£15.99, which reflects the cost of the medicine and the regulated mandatory consultation with the pharmacist.\" The move comes after Boots faced widespread criticism for its initial decision not to reduce the price of emergency contraception, citing concerns that it could encourage women to have unprotected sex. The company's stance was met with outrage from women's rights groups and healthcare professionals, who argued that the move was discriminatory and would disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as young people and those living in poverty.\n\nThe introduction of the cheaper generic version of the morning-after pill is expected to make emergency contraception more accessible to a wider range of customers. Boots has also committed to making the service available in all of its 2,500 stores by October, which could potentially reach millions of people across the UK.\n\nThe new pricing strategy is seen as a significant shift for Boots, which has traditionally been criticized for its high prices and limited access to affordable healthcare products. The company's decision to source a less expensive version of the morning-after pill is likely to be welcomed by women's rights groups and healthcare professionals, who have long advocated for greater access to emergency contraception.\n\nHowever, some critics have raised concerns that the new pricing strategy may not be enough to address the underlying issues surrounding access to emergency contraception. \"While it's welcome that Boots has finally reduced the price of the morning-after pill, we still need to see more done to make it accessible to all women, regardless of their income or location,\" said Sarah Green, director of the sexual health charity, Brook.\n\nThe introduction of the cheaper generic version of the morning-after pill is also expected to have a significant impact on the wider healthcare system. Emergency contraception is often used as a last resort, and reducing the cost of the service could help to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions.\n\nIn a statement, Boots said that it was committed to making its emergency contraception service more accessible and affordable for all customers. \"We are committed to providing our customers with access to a range of healthcare products and services, and we are proud to be taking this step to make emergency contraception more accessible and affordable,\" said a spokesperson for the company.\n\nThe move by Boots is likely to be closely watched by other retailers and healthcare providers, who may be forced to follow suit in order to remain competitive. The introduction of the cheaper generic version of the morning-after pill is a significant step forward for women's health and could have a lasting impact on the way that emergency contraception is accessed and provided in the UK.",

Readers, including those who work with or within the intelligence community, national security experts and advocates for whistleblower protection, expressed concern that the decision compromised the individual's safety. The newspaper reported the whistleblower's employer as the CIA and details on their expertise, citing three unnamed people familiar with the individual's identity. Since the article's publication online on Thursday, the newspaper has added the context that the White House already knew where the whistleblower was employed. Identifying information published in the paper \"recklessly narrows that universe of suspected whistleblowers to a very few people\", said Jesselyn Radack, the director of national security and human rights at the Whistleblower and Source Protection Program. \"This has a very chilling effect on anyone who is even thinking of blowing the whistle and thinking of doing so through the proper channels.\" The publication of the whistleblower's details has sparked a heated debate about the balance between transparency and protection, with some arguing that the newspaper's decision compromised the individual's safety and others defending the decision as necessary for public accountability.\n\n\"This is a clear case of the New York Times prioritizing its own interests over the well-being of the whistleblower,\" said Daniel Ellsberg, a former government official who himself blew the whistle on the Vietnam War. \"By publishing this information, the Times has made it much more difficult for the whistleblower to remain anonymous and has put their life at risk.\"\n\nOthers, however, argue that the publication of the whistleblower's details was necessary to hold the government accountable for its actions. \"The public has a right to know who is blowing the whistle and why,\" said Glenn Greenwald, a journalist and author who has written extensively on national security issues. \"The New York Times' decision to publish this information was a necessary step in ensuring transparency and accountability in government.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of the media in protecting whistleblowers and the potential consequences of compromising their identities. \"The media has a responsibility to protect whistleblowers, not put them in harm's way,\" said Radack. \"By publishing this information, the New York Times has set a dangerous precedent and has put all whistleblowers at risk.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, the New York Times has defended its decision, citing the public's right to know and the importance of transparency in government. \"The New York Times takes its responsibility to protect sources seriously, but it also has a responsibility to the public to provide accurate and complete information,\" said a spokesperson for the newspaper. \"We believe that the publication of this information was necessary to ensure transparency and accountability in government.\"\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, many are left wondering what the long-term consequences will be for the whistleblower and the media.

        "Text": "Welcome to the first in a new series where we highlight some of the mesmerising and classic experiments in psychology that you can try for yourself at home. And what better way to kick off than with one of the most highly cited and replicated effects in the entire discipline: the Stroop effect! How we understand and generate language is something that has fascinated psychologists since the dawn of the discipline. And for the most part, we process language effortlessly â€“ chances are you've already made it to this point in the article without paying much attention to any specific word. ...without paying much attention to any specific word. But what if we were to suddenly ask you to focus on the color of the words instead? Would you be able to do it? This is precisely what the Stroop effect is all about.\n\nThe Stroop effect is a classic demonstration of the conflict between automatic and controlled processing in the human brain. Invented by John Ridley Stroop in 1935, the experiment involves presenting participants with a series of words printed in different colors, but with the catch that the word itself is actually a color that is different from the ink used to print it.\n\nFor example, the word \"RED\" might be printed in blue ink. The participant's task is to identify the color of the ink, rather than the meaning of the word. Sounds simple, right? But what happens is that our brains get stuck on the meaning of the word, making it much harder to focus on the color.\n\nIn a typical Stroop effect experiment, participants are presented with a series of these word-color pairs, and their reaction times are measured. The results are always the same: people take significantly longer to respond when the word and ink color are different, compared to when they are the same. This delay is a clear indication of the brain's struggle to overcome the automatic processing of language and focus on the task at hand.\n\nSo, why is the Stroop effect so important? For one, it highlights the complex interplay between our brain's automatic and controlled processing systems. It also has implications for our understanding of attention, perception, and cognitive control. Furthermore, the Stroop effect has been used in a wide range of applications, from improving cognitive training programs to understanding neurological disorders such as ADHD.\n\nSo, how can you try the Stroop effect for yourself? It's surprisingly easy! All you need is a piece of paper, a pen, and a color printer. Simply print out a list of words in different colors, and then ask a friend or family member to identify the color of each word. You can also use online tools and apps to create your own Stroop effect experiment.\n\nIn our next installment, we'll be exploring another classic experiment in psychology that you can try at home.

She's back where she started, although there's no need to shed tears for one of the UK's top executives in the deathstick business â€“ she's been paid roughly Â£30m in that time. One should add that Imperial's shareholders have collected about Â£10bn in dividends in the same period, so the reversal in the share price is not the whole story. Despite the tumultuous stock performance, Cooper's tenure has been marked by significant changes within the company. In 2016, Imperial Brands rebranded itself as a \"new kind of tobacco company,\" signaling a shift away from its traditional focus on cigarettes. The move was aimed at adapting to changing consumer habits and regulatory environments.\n\nUnder Cooper's leadership, Imperial Brands has expanded its portfolio to include e-cigarettes, vaping products, and other alternative nicotine delivery systems. The company has also made significant investments in research and development, with a focus on creating innovative products that appeal to a new generation of consumers.\n\nHowever, the company's efforts have been hampered by intense competition and changing consumer preferences. The vaping industry, in particular, has faced a series of challenges, including a global outbreak of vaping-related illnesses and a crackdown on flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Imperial Brands has been working to diversify its product offerings and reduce its dependence on traditional tobacco products. The company has also been investing in digital marketing and e-commerce platforms to better connect with consumers and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nDespite these efforts, Imperial Brands' share price has continued to struggle. The company's revenue has declined in recent years, and its profitability has been impacted by increased competition and regulatory pressures.\n\nCooper, however, remains optimistic about the company's future prospects. In a recent interview, she emphasized Imperial Brands' commitment to innovation and its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences. \"We're not just a tobacco company,\" she said. \"We're a consumer goods company that happens to make tobacco products. We're focused on creating products that people want to use, and that's what drives our success.\"\n\nAs Cooper prepares to mark her 10-year anniversary as CEO, she faces a number of challenges and opportunities. The company's future success will depend on its ability to navigate the complex and rapidly changing landscape of the tobacco and vaping industries. Despite the challenges ahead, Cooper's track record and the company's strong financial performance suggest that Imperial Brands is well-positioned to continue thriving in the years to come.",

The United States is facing fiscal uncertainty, and its powerful central bank is contemplating easing its extraordinary stimulus efforts, with potentially global ramifications. As a result, global growth is in \"low gear,\" the International Monetary Fund said in its latest economic forecasts, released Tuesday as the world's central bankers and finance ministers gathered here for the fund's annual meetings. The I.M.F., the Washington-based lending institution, cut its forecasts for global growth, as it has done in nine of its last 10 economic updates. It now expects the world economy to increase by about 2.9 percent in 2013 and 3.6 percent in 2014. That is down from 5.4 percent in 2007, before the global recession. More risks remain, like \"prolonged sluggish growth,\" which the monetary fund has indicated could translate into lower living standards and higher rates of joblessness for hundreds of millions around the world. \"Quantitative indicators point to no major change to risks over the near term,\" the fund said. \"The qualitative assessment is that uncertainty has increased again.\" The IMF's downbeat forecast comes as a warning to policymakers and investors alike, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and cooperation to address the lingering effects of the global financial crisis. The fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, emphasized the importance of policymakers taking proactive steps to boost growth and stability.\n\n\"The world economy is facing a complex and challenging environment, with many risks and uncertainties,\" Blanchard said in a statement. \"We urge policymakers to remain committed to their fiscal consolidation plans, while also taking steps to support growth and job creation.\"\n\nThe IMF's forecast also highlighted the divergent performances of different regions. While the United States is expected to experience a modest recovery, with growth rates of around 2.5 percent in 2013 and 3.2 percent in 2014, many emerging economies are facing significant headwinds. The fund cut its forecast for China's growth rate, expecting it to slow to around 7.7 percent in 2013, down from 8.2 percent in 2012. India, Brazil, and other emerging markets are also facing challenges, including high inflation, currency volatility, and slowing demand from key trading partners.\n\nIn Europe, the IMF's forecast was even more pessimistic, with the fund expecting the region's economy to contract by around 0.5 percent in 2013, before recovering slightly in 2014. The fund's chief economist warned that the region's debt crisis remains a major risk, and that policymakers must continue to work together to address the issue.\n\n\"The European sovereign debt crisis is far from over,\" Blanchard said. \"We urge policymakers to continue to work together to address the crisis, and to take bold action to restore confidence and stability to the region.\"\n\nThe IMF's forecast comes as the world's central bankers and finance ministers gather in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The meetings are expected to focus on a range of issues, including the global economy, financial stability, and development.\n\nIn the lead-up to the meetings, many policymakers have expressed concerns about the state of the global economy, and the need for continued cooperation to address the challenges facing the world. The IMF's forecast is likely to add to those concerns, and to emphasize the importance of policymakers taking proactive steps to boost growth and stability.",

At a Wednesday news conference, scientists announced some results from the flyby of the most distant object ever visited. LAUREL, Md. -- Ultima Thule, an icy world 4 billion miles from the sun, looks like a big snowman. At a news conference on Wednesday, scientists working with NASA's New Horizons mission released several images that the spacecraft took as it flew by on Tuesday, New Year's Day. The images, captured at a distance of approximately 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers), show Ultima Thule's unique shape, which is unlike any other object in our solar system. The spacecraft flew within 2,200 miles of the object's surface, providing scientists with a wealth of new information about this mysterious world.\n\nAccording to Dr. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of the New Horizons mission, Ultima Thule is a contact binary, meaning it is composed of two separate objects that are in contact with each other. The object's shape is thought to be the result of a catastrophic event, such as a massive collision, that occurred in the distant past.\n\n\"We're thrilled to have obtained these historic images of Ultima Thule, which will help us better understand the formation and evolution of our solar system,\" said Dr. Stern. \"This flyby is a major milestone in the history of space exploration, and we're honored to be a part of it.\"\n\nThe images released on Wednesday show Ultima Thule's surface is covered in craters, indicating a geologically inactive surface. The object's surface is also remarkably smooth, with no signs of tectonic activity or volcanic features.\n\nScientists are still analyzing the data collected during the flyby, but early results suggest that Ultima Thule is a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), a type of icy body that orbits the sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. The object is thought to be about 12 miles (20 kilometers) in diameter and has a surface composed primarily of water ice mixed with darker organic material.\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft was launched in 2006 and flew by Pluto in 2015, providing scientists with a wealth of new information about the dwarf planet. The spacecraft was then sent on a course for Ultima Thule, which was discovered in 2014.\n\nThe flyby of Ultima Thule was a complex and challenging operation, requiring precise navigation and communication with the spacecraft. The spacecraft had to travel at a speed of about 36,000 miles per hour (57,936 kilometers per hour) to reach the object, and the team had to work quickly to capture high-quality images and data.\n\nThe data collected during the flyby will be analyzed over the coming months, providing scientists with a deeper understanding of Ultima Thule and its place in our solar system. The discovery of Ultima Thule is a major breakthrough in the field of planetary science, and it is expected to provide new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.",

        "Text": "It's the dog days of 2009. Gordon Brown is prime minister, Alistair Darling is chancellor of the exchequer and Mervyn King is governor of the Bank of England. Britain has been through a tough two years. As a country heavily dependent on financial services, it has been especially hard hit by the banking crash of 2008. As the global economy teeters on the brink of collapse, the UK government is faced with the daunting task of stabilizing the financial system and mitigating the impact on ordinary citizens. In a bid to restore confidence, Chancellor Alistair Darling unveiled a Â£20 billion stimulus package, aimed at kick-starting economic growth and creating jobs.\n\nThe package, announced in the 2009 Budget, included a combination of tax cuts, increased public spending, and measures to support the ailing housing market. The government also launched a series of initiatives to help struggling homeowners, including a mortgage guarantee scheme and a freeze on council tax.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England, led by Governor Mervyn King, implemented a series of unconventional monetary policies to inject liquidity into the financial system. The bank's quantitative easing program, which involved creating new money to buy government bonds, was seen as a bold move to stimulate economic activity.\n\nDespite these efforts, the UK economy continued to struggle. Unemployment soared to its highest level in over a decade, and the once-thriving manufacturing sector was decimated. The construction industry, too, was hit hard, as the credit crunch made it difficult for developers to access financing.\n\nAs the economy limped along, the government faced mounting pressure to deliver on its promises. Critics accused the Labour Party of being out of touch with the needs of ordinary people, while others praised the party's efforts to stabilize the financial system.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the UK's major political parties began to gear up for the 2010 general election. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, promised to cut taxes and reduce government spending, while the Liberal Democrats, under Nick Clegg's leadership, advocated for a more radical approach to economic reform.\n\nAs the country prepared to go to the polls, one thing was clear: the next government would face a daunting task in rebuilding the UK economy. The question was, would they have the vision, the courage, and the leadership to guide the country through these turbulent times?",

He has an M.B.A. from M.I.T. 's Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Mass., where he is executive director of the school's Center for eBusiness. But the Securities and Exchange Commission will consider new guidelines, as early as October, that could disqualify him from making those private investments. Even though he knows the start-up scene well in the Boston area where he lives and carefully researches companies before making one or two investments a year, he might no longer be considered an accredited investor entitled to make what are generally seen as riskier private investments. The prospect of change has created a furor in the investment world, where some fear that the changes will shrink the pool of private investors and unfairly limit the investment opportunities for millions of people. \"I would be one of those people who with a swoop of a pen would become unaccredited,\" Mr. Verrill said. \"That boggles my mind.\" Mr. Verrill's objection is shared by Andy Freeman, 56, a computer engineer in San Jose, Calif., who qualifies today. \"I'd be locked out of investments even though I have some expertise,\" he said. \"The amount of money I'm going to throw in isn't going to hurt me, but it can make a difference to somebody.\" The proposed guidelines, aimed at protecting investors from high-risk investments, have sparked a heated debate among financial experts and entrepreneurs. Critics argue that the new rules will disproportionately affect small investors, such as David Verrill and Andy Freeman, who have successfully navigated the private investment landscape.\n\nUnder the current rules, accredited investors are defined as individuals with a net worth of at least $1 million or annual income of $200,000. However, the SEC's proposed guidelines would redefine accreditation based on a more stringent set of criteria, including the ability to withstand a 10% loss of their net worth.\n\nProponents of the changes argue that the new rules will help prevent investors from losing their life savings on high-risk, speculative investments. \"We're trying to protect investors from themselves,\" said a SEC spokesperson. \"Investing in private companies is inherently risky, and we need to ensure that investors have the financial sophistication and resources to absorb potential losses.\"\n\nHowever, opponents of the changes argue that the new rules will have unintended consequences, including limiting access to capital for small businesses and startups. \"The proposed changes will disproportionately affect small investors who are willing to take calculated risks,\" said Tom Taulli, a financial analyst and author of \"The Young Rich in America.\" \"These investors are often the ones who are willing to take the leap and support innovative companies that may not have the same level of financial backing as larger corporations.\"\n\nThe proposed guidelines have also raised concerns about the definition of \"accredited investor.\" Critics argue that the current definition is outdated and fails to account for the changing nature of wealth and income. \"The current definition of accredited investor is based on a 1980s-era concept of wealth,\" said David Verrill. \"It doesn't take into account the new economy, where wealth is created through entrepreneurship and innovation.\"\n\nAs the SEC considers the proposed guidelines, investors and entrepreneurs alike are bracing for the potential impact on the private investment landscape. While the changes may be intended to protect investors, they could also have far-reaching consequences for the startup ecosystem and the economy as a whole.\n\nIn the meantime, investors like David Verrill and Andy Freeman are left wondering what the future holds for their private investment portfolios. \"I understand the need for regulation, but I hope the SEC will consider the unintended consequences of these changes,\" said Andy Freeman. \"The last thing we need is to limit access to capital for innovative companies that have the potential to create jobs and drive economic growth.\"",

He was 93. Dr. Robin Dibner, his daughter, said the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Dibner was a psychology professor at Boston University with a special interest in the problems of old age in 1972 when one day, while shaving, he pondered what happens when a frail person, living alone, falls and cannot move. As he pondered the scenario, Dr. Dibner was struck by the stark reality that many elderly and disabled individuals were at risk of falling and being unable to call for help, often leading to devastating consequences. This encounter sparked an idea that would change the course of his career and ultimately improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nDr. Dibner's invention, which he called the \"Personal Emergency Response System\" (PERS), was designed to provide a simple and reliable way for people to call for assistance in emergency situations. The system consisted of a wearable device, typically a pendant or wristband, that could be activated by a simple push of a button. This would trigger a call to a 24/7 monitoring center, where trained professionals would assess the situation and dispatch emergency services as needed.\n\nThe PERS system was revolutionary in its simplicity and effectiveness. No longer did individuals have to rely on the kindness of strangers or the proximity of a telephone to get help in an emergency. Dr. Dibner's invention empowered people to take control of their own safety and well-being, providing them with a sense of independence and peace of mind.\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Dibner continued to refine and improve the PERS system, working with healthcare professionals and industry experts to ensure its effectiveness and accessibility. His work led to the development of various PERS models, each tailored to meet the specific needs of different populations, including the elderly, people with disabilities, and those living in remote areas.\n\nDr. Dibner's legacy extends far beyond his invention, however. His work has had a profound impact on the healthcare industry, inspiring a new wave of innovation and research in the field of aging and disability. His commitment to improving the lives of others has left a lasting impression on the many individuals and families who have benefited from his work.\n\nIn a statement, Dr. Robin Dibner, Dr. Dibner's daughter, remembered her father as a dedicated professional who was driven by a passion for helping others. \"My father's legacy is a testament to the power of compassion and innovation,\" she said. \"He will be deeply missed, but his work will continue to make a difference in the lives of countless people for years to come.\"",

        "Text": "The largest ever study on ancient DNA has shown that Britain was changed forever by the arrival of the Beaker folk, a wave of migrants about 4,500 years ago who brought with them new customs, new burial practices, and beautiful, distinctive bell-shaped pottery. The very existence of the Beaker folk â€“ whose ancestry lay in central Europe and further east to the Steppes â€“ and Beaker culture has been questioned in the past. The actual beakers, striking clay drinking vessels with an elegant flared lip, were clearly among the most treasured possessions of the people who were buried with them, and have been excavated from graves across Europe for centuries. However, archaeologists could not agree whether they represented a fashion spread by trade and imitation, or a culture diffused by migration. Now a massive international project, involving hundreds of scientists and archaeologists and almost all the major laboratories in the field, has provided some of the answers. Using samples of more than 400 prehistoric skeletons from across Europe, researchers have uncovered new information about a period when a wave of migration rolled westward across Europe, almost totally displacing the earlier population in many places â€“ including Britain. Geneticist Ian Barnes, from the Natural History Museum in London, said: \"At least 90% of the ancestry of Britons was replaced by a group from the continent. The findings of the study, published in the journal Nature, have significant implications for our understanding of European history and the origins of modern British society. According to the researchers, the Beaker folk, who were previously thought to have been a minor influence on British culture, were in fact a dominant force that reshaped the genetic and cultural landscape of the island.\n\nThe study analyzed DNA samples from over 400 prehistoric skeletons, including those found in Britain, Ireland, and continental Europe. The results showed that the Beaker folk brought with them a distinct genetic signature, which replaced at least 90% of the existing ancestry in Britain. This suggests that the migration was not just a trickle of individuals, but a large-scale movement of people that had a profound impact on the population.\n\nThe researchers also found that the Beaker folk were not just a group of migrants, but a complex society with their own culture and traditions. They brought with them new burial practices, which involved placing the dead in a crouched position, often with their heads facing east. This practice was previously unknown in Britain and is now seen as a key indicator of Beaker culture.\n\nThe study's findings have also shed new light on the origins of the Beaker folk themselves. Previous research had suggested that they may have originated in the Iberian Peninsula, but the new study suggests that they may have come from further east, possibly from the Steppes of modern-day Ukraine.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of European history, and has sparked a renewed interest in the study of ancient DNA. Dr. Barnes, the lead researcher, said: \"This study shows the power of ancient DNA in shedding light on the past. It's a game-changer for our understanding of European history, and opens up new avenues for research into the origins of modern European societies.\"\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked debate among archaeologists and historians about the nature of the Beaker culture and its impact on British society. Some have suggested that the Beaker folk may have brought with them new technologies and ideas, which helped to transform British society and lay the foundations for the development of modern Britain.\n\nOverall, the study's findings are a significant contribution to our understanding of European history, and have opened up new avenues for research into the origins of modern British society. The discovery of the Beaker folk's genetic legacy in Britain is a powerful reminder of the complex and dynamic nature of human history, and the importance of continued research into the past.",

        "Text": "Ever since the American dollar began to surge against foreign currencies late last year, economists have warned that the repercussions would eventually be felt on the home front. If there were any doubts about that, they were resolved last week. With Friday's Labor Department report showing slower hiring than expected in September, and the weaker data on exports and factory activity released earlier in the week, evidence of the effects of the dollar's rise on the domestic economy is piling up. While hardly catastrophic -- almost no one expects the American economy to fall into recession anytime soon -- the greenback's strength will exert a significant drag on economic growth in the months ahead and could help push the Federal Reserve to wait until 2016 before raising interest rates. \"There is no question about it: The dollar is clearly having an impact,\" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm that tracks the economy. Indeed, while Mr. Behravesh estimates that domestic consumption rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter -- a healthy pace by most measures -- he expects economic growth for the period to come in at around 2 percent. That's a significant gap, Mr. Behravesh said, with most of it due to the strengthening dollar, which makes American goods more expensive abroad, as well as slower growth overseas in important export markets like China and Brazil. Other experts are even more pessimistic about the economy's growth rate in July, August and September, with Macroeconomic Advisers cutting its estimate to 1.4 percent on Friday, down from 2.4 percent at the start of the week. Goldman Sachs expects the drag from trade on output to persist through the end of 2016, reducing the American economy's overall growth rate by nearly a full percentage point. The impact of the dollar's strength on the domestic economy is expected to be felt across various sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, and services. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, the rising dollar has already led to a decline in exports, which could result in job losses and reduced production in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIn the agricultural sector, the strengthening dollar has made it more challenging for farmers to compete with foreign producers, particularly in the livestock and dairy industries. The National Farmers Union estimates that the dollar's rise has already led to a decline in farm exports, resulting in reduced revenue for farmers and potentially impacting the overall agricultural sector.\n\nThe services sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the American economy, is also expected to feel the effects of the dollar's strength. As the dollar makes American goods and services more expensive abroad, it could lead to reduced demand and lower exports, which could negatively impact industries such as tourism, finance, and technology.\n\nWhile the impact of the dollar's strength is likely to be felt across various sectors, economists agree that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates in the near future. \"The Fed is likely to wait until the economy shows more resilience before raising interest rates,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The dollar's strength is a significant headwind, and the Fed will want to see the economy recover from this before taking action.\"\n\nIn the meantime, policymakers are urging the government to take steps to mitigate the impact of the dollar's strength on the domestic economy. \"We need to take a more proactive approach to addressing the impact of the dollar's strength on our economy,\" said Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio. \"This includes investing in our infrastructure, supporting our manufacturing sector, and promoting American exports.\"\n\nAs the economy continues to feel the effects of the dollar's strength, economists and policymakers will be closely monitoring the data to gauge the impact on the domestic economy. While the effects are likely to be felt, most experts agree that the American economy is resilient and will likely recover from the drag caused by the dollar's strength.",

        "Text": "Some 66 million years ago, mammals caught their lucky break. An asteroid crashed into what is now Chicxulub, Mexico, and set off a catastrophic chain of events that led to the annihilation of the non-avian dinosaurs. That day began their furry ascension to the top of a brave new world, the one from which our species would one day emerge . But little is known about the time period directly after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction, or K-Pg event, because the fossil record is lacking. Now, a team of paleontologists has uncovered a trove of thousands of fossils in Colorado that provides an in-depth look at the first million years following the K-Pg mass extinction event. The finding provides insight into the interactions between animals, plants and climate that occurred in the earliest days of the age of mammals, and that allowed them to grow from the size of large rodents into diverse wildlife we might begin to recognize today. \"We provide the most vivid picture of recovery of an ecosystem on land after any mass extinction,\" said Tyler Lyson, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. His team's paper was published on Thursday in Science. Dr. Lyson has hunted fossils since he was 10. Although he has found many dinosaurs, uncovering fossils of species that emerged in the immediate aftermath of the dinosaur extinction had proven rather elusive in his field of study. \"You can only find so many triceratops skeletons and partial T. rex skeletons and things like that until you want a larger challenge,\" said Dr. Lyson. \"Finding fossils just after the K-Pg extinction is a huge, huge challenge.\" In spring 2016 he and some colleagues explored a fossil site near Colorado Springs called Corral Bluffs. He knew that years earlier, Sharon Milito, an amateur fossil hunter, had found a mammal skull that was confirmed to be from the K-Pg boundary there. He set out looking for mammal bones sticking out of the ground. As Dr. Lyson and his team began to excavate the site, they were met with a treasure trove of fossils. Over the course of several weeks, they uncovered thousands of specimens, including bones, teeth, and even tracks and burrows. The fossils were remarkably well-preserved, with many showing signs of wear and tear from the early mammals' daily lives.\n\nThe team's initial excitement was palpable as they began to sort through the finds. \"It was like Christmas morning every day,\" Dr. Lyson recalled. \"We'd uncover a new layer of fossils, and it was like opening a present to see what was inside.\"\n\nAs they analyzed the fossils, the team began to piece together a picture of the early mammalian ecosystem. They found evidence of a diverse range of species, from small, insectivorous mammals to larger, herbivorous ones. The fossils also revealed a complex web of relationships between the mammals and the plants and insects that lived alongside them.\n\nOne of the most significant discoveries was the presence of a previously unknown type of mammal, which the team dubbed \"Denisonix.\" This small, rodent-like creature was found to be one of the earliest known mammals to have evolved after the K-Pg extinction.\n\nThe discovery of Denisonix and other early mammals provides valuable insights into the evolution of mammalian diversity. \"It's like we're getting a glimpse of the earliest days of mammalian history,\" Dr. Lyson said. \"We're seeing the first steps towards the incredible diversity of mammals that we see today.\"\n\nThe team's findings also shed light on the early mammalian diet. By analyzing the fossilized remains of plants and insects, they were able to reconstruct the food chain of the early mammals. \"We found evidence of early mammals eating everything from seeds to insects to small vertebrates,\" Dr. Lyson explained. \"It's amazing to think that these early mammals were able to survive and thrive in a world that was so different from the one we know today.\"\n\nThe Corral Bluffs fossil site has provided a unique window into the early days of the age of mammals. The discovery of thousands of fossils has given scientists a rare glimpse into the interactions between animals, plants, and climate that occurred in the immediate aftermath of the K-Pg mass extinction event.\n\nDr. Lyson and his team's findings are set to be published in a series of papers in the coming months. As the scientific community continues to study the Corral Bluffs fossils, they are likely to uncover even more secrets about the early days of mammalian evolution. For now, however, the team is basking in the glow of their remarkable discovery. \"It's an incredible feeling to know that we've uncovered a piece of history that will help us better understand the origins of our own species,\" Dr. Lyson said.",

The digital models, built by a team of scientists in the Netherlands, took around 45,000 hours to produce and offer researchers an unparalleled glimpse into the first eight weeks of human development. \"Everyone thinks we already know this, but I believe we know more about the moon than about our own development,\" said Bernadette de Bakker, of the University of Amsterdam, who co-led the project with colleague Professor Antoon Moorman. As de Bakker pointed out, many textbook depictions of embryo development are based on observations made many decades ago, and often contain details inferred from studies on mouse or chick embryos. By contrast, the new resource will offer researchers the chance to explore the intricate changes occurring in the first weeks of life from a series of human specimens, aiding vital research. The atlas, which was launched online last week, is the result of a collaborative effort between the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, and the Hubrecht Institute. The team used advanced imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, to create detailed 3D models of the human embryos at different stages of development.\n\nThe atlas is divided into eight sections, each representing a different week of development from conception to the formation of the major organs. The models are accompanied by detailed descriptions and interactive tools that allow researchers to explore the embryos in 3D, zooming in on specific structures and observing how they change over time.\n\n\"This is a game-changer for researchers in the field,\" said Dr. Moorman. \"For the first time, we have a comprehensive and accurate visual representation of human embryo development. This will enable us to better understand the complex processes that occur during this critical period, and ultimately improve our understanding of human health and disease.\"\n\nThe atlas is already being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of developmental biology. Researchers are eager to use the resource to study the development of specific organs and tissues, as well as to investigate the causes of birth defects and miscarriage.\n\nThe atlas is also expected to have significant implications for the field of regenerative medicine. By gaining a better understanding of how human embryos develop, scientists may be able to develop new treatments for a range of diseases and conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, and birth defects.\n\nIn addition to its scientific significance, the atlas is also a testament to the power of collaboration and interdisciplinary research. The project brought together experts from a range of fields, including biology, medicine, imaging, and computer science, to create a truly unique and groundbreaking resource.\n\nThe atlas is available online and is free to access for researchers and the general public.

In fact, it is ludicrous to think that the affable but low-energy Hinds could have survived the shock and awe of Boris Johnson's arrival in Downing Street. Instead the new education secretary â€“ the fourth since Michael Gove was pushed out for being too toxic (NB aided by the new PM's backroom boy Dominic Cummings) â€“ is the man sacked barely three months ago for allegedly leaking sensitive security information to the press. True, Gavin Williamson is 100% state school educated, only the second education secretary to have attended a comprehensive school, and apparently a former school governor, so we should be heartened by that. As chief whip he was compared to a devious character from the political thriller House of Cards, yet his missteps as defence secretary got him the name Private Pike, from Dad's Army. He is a smooth operator and political chameleon, having moved seamlessly from David Cameron's inner circle to Theresa May's cabinet and now Boris Johnson's court. His gut instincts on LGBT rights, for example, a pressing issue in the light of the Birmingham schools conflicts, are hard to fathom, given his mixed voting record. The appointment of Gavin Williamson as the new Education Secretary has sent shockwaves through the education community, leaving many wondering how someone with his controversial past and questionable judgment can be entrusted with shaping the future of British education. Williamson's tenure as Defence Secretary was marked by a series of high-profile blunders, including the Huawei cyber-security debacle and the botched deployment of HMS Queen Elizabeth.\n\nCritics have also pointed to Williamson's lack of experience in education, having never held a role in the sector before. His predecessor, Damian Hinds, had a strong background in education policy, having served as a schools minister before becoming Education Secretary. In contrast, Williamson's only connection to education appears to be his own state school education and his brief stint as a school governor.\n\nMoreover, Williamson's voting record on LGBT rights has raised concerns among advocates for the community. While he has publicly expressed support for same-sex marriage, his voting record on other LGBT issues has been inconsistent, leading many to question his commitment to the cause.\n\nThe appointment of Williamson has also sparked concerns about the direction of education policy under the new government. With Boris Johnson's government promising to increase funding for schools and reduce bureaucracy, many are wondering how Williamson's appointment will impact these plans. Will he prioritize a more business-friendly approach to education, or will he focus on addressing the deep-seated issues facing the sector, such as teacher shortages and inadequate funding for disadvantaged schools?\n\nAs the new Education Secretary settles into his role, he will face a range of challenges, from addressing the ongoing crisis in special education to implementing the government's promised reforms. While Williamson's appointment may have raised eyebrows, he will have the opportunity to prove himself as a capable and effective leader. However, the education community will be watching closely to see how he navigates these challenges and whether his appointment marks a new era of stability and progress for British education.",
