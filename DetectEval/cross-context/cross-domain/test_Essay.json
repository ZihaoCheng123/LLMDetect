        "Text": "Contrary to popular belief, mini-golf is very challenging. The unforgiving, neon green turf and the jagged rock formations send my ball spiraling in the wrong direction and careen straight into the roaring waterfall every time. The irony of my inadequate skills, however, is not lost on my younger sister, who routinely avoids obstacles and sinks her ball straight into the hole. Her embarrassing victory dance follows soon after, much to my own dismay. Notwithstanding my mini-golf shortcomings, I am known as “golf girl” by my peers and have learned much about myself and the game as the sole girl on my high school’s golf team. Growing up hearing tales of the golf team that my father coached and watching the LPGA from my grandfather’s couch instilled me with a passion for golf. Looking up to Annika Sörenstam and other talented women who played with such grace and power ultimately gave me some dynamic, passionate role models to look up to. When the coach cut me from middle school golf tryouts, bright purple junior clubs in hand, I was determined to get better and committed to making myself and my role models proud. I began taking over 100 swings each night and spent countless hours on the putting green dreaming of that match winning putt. After being turned away, the sense of accomplishment in being one of the team’s leaders in the following season was one of the best feelings in the world. For the past six years, I have become accustomed to the mannerisms, smell, and humor of teenage golf boys. However, arriving at the first match brimming with four teams full of tall, strong boys and not another girl in sight made me gulp. The shorter bathroom line was a bonus when I first arrived at the course, but all was forgotten when I went to take my first shot from the female tee box. My teammate, James, walked up to me, noticing my apprehension, and told me the most random, bizarre joke that I had ever heard. In that moment, I knew my teammates had my back, even if I did not always completely comprehend their humor. Over time, the team grew into a tight-knit group of friends who fit together like a puzzle. James can break a bad round with a laugh, Matt gives the best pep talks, and Drew is reliable for sound shot advice, while my niche emerged as bringing positivity and optimism after a bad shot. This team dynamic continued in school as well, as James comes to me after a bad test, while I see Matt before a big presentation. Whether we are on or off the course, we help each other to succeed. As the daughter of two teachers, country club simulators and memberships to the area’s elite courses were not options for me. Two summers ago, I took matters into my own hands and got a job cleaning out dirty carts and taking out the trash at the local country club. Scrubbing the spilled adult beverages out of the cup holders and disposing of the deteriorating cigars was not how I pictured spending my summers, but was valuable for the free rounds I played. By the end of the summer, I realized my hard work leveled the playing field between myself and my more affluent opponents. This gentleman’s sport has become such a significant part of my life. The amount of joy I receive from sinking a lengthy putt or driving my ball straight down the center of the fairway reminds me just how grateful I am to play this sport. My sister might still dance in the parking lot after we play a round of mini-golf, I will join her, because I know that I will continue to play golf, and learn from the game, for the rest of my life.",

        "Text": "“How many times did I wake up at 4:15 a.m. this summer?” I found myself once again asking this question as I climbed endless stone steps with bruised shins and dirt-filled fingernails. The answer: twenty-two times. I was in a rush to finish the 48th peak before school began in order to fulfill a goal I set in fifth grade after meeting a wild pack of Appalachian Trail through-hikers. I marveled at their determination. Climbing all 48 four thousand foot peaks within New Hampshire is an ambitious goal that takes some people a lifetime to finish. There I was, at 6:15 a.m., gasping for air and wondering who I should blame for the pain. Maybe I had my parents to blame for my drive to be in the wilderness. They exposed me to the outdoors at a young age, sparking my passion for hiking and backpacking. Having lived in China for four and a half years and traveling the world, I always knew my childhood was unique. Unlike other expatriates, my family dismissed four-star resorts and instead chose to stumble through the alleyways of Hong Kong with an array of camping supplies. As a six-year-old, I was fortunate enough to find myself in Italy running from a wild herd of cattle in the Alps. During our summers in Oregon, instead of renting a car, we pedaled through the hilly streets on a three-person bike. These experiences, that made my family different, instilled in me a sense of adventure. The 48 strenuous climbs and endless miles also brought beautiful vistas. If we were lucky, we got to end the day at a high mountain hut where we drank endless cups of rich hot chocolate. I would sit in the corner of the dining room engrossed in books about rare lichen. At Mizpah hut, I had the chance to talk with a female naturalist about some of the endangered alpine flora. I sat and stared in awe. I didn't know that someone could have a job doing field studies in the mountains. I’ve spent the last six years looking at the sides of the trails for the dwarf Cinquefoil she introduced to me. That’s when I knew I wanted to become a hands-on environmentalist so I could spend more time doing the things I love. Maybe I have the naturalist to blame for all the blisters and early mornings on the trail.        Mount Isolation was my last peak. One last push. Number 48. 13.6 miles. After the first grueling thirty minutes, the path opened up and I could see all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. This is the way it always goes. First, the struggle, and then the reward. Mt. Washington glowed like amber. The wind nipped at my fingertips and shook the crooked trees. My heavy breathing competed with the sounds of the white-throated sparrows. I had the entire mountain to myself. Overwhelmed by emotion, I began to cry bittersweet tears. No more waking up at 4:15 a.m. but then again, no more celebratory Cokes at the top. I was done. I decided to let go of the blame for all the early mornings. Instead, I would love to give my fifth grade-self a big “thank you”.        The struggles only augmented the joy I felt on the car ride home with music playing and my feet wiggling in the wind. I felt that I had graduated from my childhood. Hiking over the past seventeen years with my family has created endless memories, yet it's time for me to start a new chapter of my life. Maybe I’ll hike the Adirondack 46ers, explore sections of the Appalachian Trail, or guide others through the wilderness. But I know I will always continue to look around and search for rare specimens and marvel at the ordinary.",

        "Text": "The ground beneath me began to shake as an oil truck instantly burst into flames. A massive ball of fire flared into the sky, illuminating my awestruck eyes. Suddenly, hundreds of gallons of water rushed down onto the truck, safely extinguishing the blaze. “CUT!” a director yelled. I cheered, astonished by the scene I had just witnessed.        My love for Hollywood began with moments like these from my childhood. Disney’s Hollywood Studios was home to attractions like The Great Movie Ride and The Studio Backlot Tour, both of which introduced me to the special effects, intricate illusions, and thrilling stunts seen in professional films. These two attractions were early indicators of my love for filmmaking, I just didn’t know it yet.        Years later, I am still captivated by the magic of cinema. Whether it be a summer blockbuster, an Oscar-hopeful, or a cult classic, I’ll take any opportunity I can get to experience an original film. For a few hours, I can forget about the world around me, becoming completely immersed in the universe on-screen. Characters come alive, their personalities and stories intertwining themselves with real-life experiences of my own. I’ve always been what you would call a “tomboy”, a far-from-fragile girl who loves football and loathes dresses. Having strong female characters like Hermione Granger and Princess Leia to look up to on-screen has had a profound impact on my confidence as a young woman. Seeing another woman hold her ground and stand up for herself was truly inspiring to me. I may not wield a wand or a blaster, but I’ve certainly used the strength of these characters as a personal inspiration to stay confident and secure in myself.        My passion for film does not end with characterization. I am just as invested in the technical, behind-the-scenes aspects of cinema. Cinematographers bring stunning landscapes and perfectly-framed shots to life, invoking awe and emotion in both casual moviegoers and film fanatics. Lighting designers shape a film’s mood and tone, adding flares of emotion and rich symbolism to climatic scenes.        I still have so much to learn about filmmaking, and I cannot wait to tackle the challenges that come with producing a film. When I do, I know that I’ll put my heart into it. Maybe my protagonist will defy the stereotypes that surround young women, choosing jeans over skirts and football over dance. Maybe she’ll love brisk autumn mornings, and never understand the appeal of hot, sticky, summer afternoons. Maybe she’ll discover her peculiar affinity for both science and cinema. Whichever direction I decide to take my characters and my story, my life experiences will have a huge impact on the final product. This is yet another thing that I love about movies; they are entirely unique to the individual who creates them. No two people could create the same exact film no matter how hard they tried — there’s always a little bit of a director’s soul woven into their work.        I’m still unsure whether I’ll follow my passion for film into a full-time career or a part-time hobby. If I decide to pursue filmmaking, I hope to use my platform to spread a message of hope, perseverance, and strength. Films can reach millions, possibly even billions of people, giving me the perfect opportunity to make a profound impact on someone’s life. If just one person can be inspired by one of my characters, much like I was by Hermione and Leia, I’ll be satisfied. Even if I never sell out theaters or break a box office record, I will have achieved success if I can make someone’s life just a little bit better through my work. Through filmmaking, I hope to invoke the same sense of wonder and awe that I once felt as I experienced the magic of cinema for the very first time.",

        "Text": "These days, birds are losing the battle of favored domestic animal to dogs and cats. At best, they're an easily forgotten blot in the otherwise clear sky, and at worst, they're nasty pests associated with filth and disease. But for many years, birds were something much greater, the catalyst of folklore and tales for nearly every culture around the world.         We've all heard some iteration of a bird story before: Common characters you might recall include the wise owl, mischievous raven, vain peacock, and motherly hen. I was introduced to these stories early on, first captivated by the avian parables I listened to on CDs, and they became an integral part of my early years. I can still remember proudly reciting \"The Ant and the Magpie\" word for word to my parents, an important tale reminding listeners to save resources for a time in need, represented by the winter in the animal world. As I got older, my love for birds persisted, but the influence those childlike stories had on me waned. After all, none of my classmates proclaimed their love of dogs stemmed from a Danish fairytale or Chinese folklore. I figured the reason I loved birds was shallower: I enjoyed the startling, colorful plumage and the joyous calls I heard outside my window. No longer were birds a central part of my identity; instead, they became an answer when I had to state my favorite animal during a summer camp icebreaker.        It wasn't until I was well into high school, nearly a decade after I last closed the cover, that I found one of my favorite childhood books, \"Why Snails Have Shells,\" in the depths of my closet. Rediscovering this book reminded me of the importance I placed on the lessons I learned from the cherished bird characters. Leafing through the pages and rereading the familiar stories, I realized the straightforward teachings of the birds were more relevant to my current life than they ever were in my childhood. Birds once again were not simply my favorite animal, they guided the way I reacted in challenging situations, which - like for most of my peers - came in a barrage as I got older.        The lesson that permeates my life today is from an old Chinese proverb, famously summed up by poet Maya Angelou as \"A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song.\" High school life, especially for my generation, is hyper-focused on the approval of others. Instagram is littered with polls asking if outfits are \"ok,\" popularity is measured by the average number of comments you get in response to your posts, and every joke uttered is followed by a scan of the room to make sure at least someone is laughing. Contrastingly, the bird doesn't focus on the answer it receives from its song; in fact, it doesn't even expect an answer. The bird sings because it wishes to, because of the joy it experiences when doing so.        It can be easy to get swept away in the desire to please, but the personal mantra I've adopted reminds me of the importance of doing things for the sake of making yourself happy, not others. I build relationships I genuinely value, I invest my time in activities I love to do, and I express myself in ways that bring me joy. Although the stories and proverbs I learned when I was younger originated from distant times and places, they have woven themselves into my values and shaped me into the person I am today.",

        "Text": "YouTube taught me everything, from simple tasks I was too insecure to ask about- such as how to correctly toast bread- to what defines me now, being a dancer. I remember one night, I was sitting on the guest room rug with my small Samsung phone, looking up videos. Trying to learn how to do a coffee grinder, a breakdance move. I remained there an hour, tirelessly attempting to learn this one move— that every break-dancer made seem so easy—over and over again. After the extensive and what seemed to be an infinite hour. I did one, jumping up and down in the air with jubilance. I instantly went down for a second attempt, breaking the shackles of failure with maximum momentum. I continued, proceeding counter-clockwise, moving with a kind of elegance that can only be associated with a mindset for success. The rush of excitement blinded me, ending up in smashing the leg of the table. My mom rushed in frantically; she noticed the broken table. A look of disappointment is all I took away from that night. The shackles were fastened back on.        Growing up, I did not have much to pride myself on. All I could do was dream, imagine, and fantasize. Dream of being other people. Dream of being an incredible dancer. Dream of being an astounding drummer. Dream of being an amazing computer scientist. Dream of being anything at all, but myself. I began my late passion for dancing when I was 12. There was only one thing stopping me from starting early—the shackled opportunities I was given. The opportunities for which I longed to be tangible, I could only dream of. Instead, I was left with nothing of the sort. I had to just teach myself with practice and mere experimentation. That is the root of my art. I only had YouTube to teach me the things I know today. It was a tough road. It still is a tough road. Nothing is changing.        I am faced with the challenge of competing against people from all around the world for the same position: people that have tutors, classes, workshops, equipment, and the opportunity to travel abroad to learn what they love. I stayed home and worked. I worked twice as hard to obtain only half the expertise they were able to acquire. I worked without aid, gripping onto my drive: the drive to show the world that you can make anything out of nothing.        Going into King’s as a freshman was difficult, working with my first dance teacher; Mr. Ryuji Yamaguchi, who introduced me to styles of dance that are shameful in Arab culture. He encouraged me to experiment with all elements limitlessly. Months passed by with the Annual dance concert approaching slowly; practicing until the night was upon me. It was time. Time to show the worth of working from nothing but your own passion, time to break the shackles. From contemporary duets, group pieces, hip-hop solos, and Bollywood, I danced my heart out and completed the show with immense success. In the intense moment of the final bow of the show, in which emotions were already running high, I caught a glimpse of my mother’s eyes: her hazy, teary eyes and a divine smile accompanied by the repeated motion of clapping. I came to the realization that the fight was decisively over, the shackles finally demolished. I was fazed. I still am. It is all borne in my head now. Utopia can be found in art. It is the most rewarding work anyone can do, working hours over hours to create something beautiful, something that was ceased to exist until created by you. After all the energy you have has been invested into expressing your thoughts and ideas, you have the sweet satisfaction of being able to finally take a step back, peruse, and say with pride, “I created this”.",

        "Text": "Like most teenagers, I am expected to do household chores I would rather avoid. I do my share of feeding the dogs and mowing the lawn, but growing up in a two hundred and thirty-four-year-old tavern has meant that my experiences and responsibilities go well beyond the usual fare—like when I discovered my cats meowing and leaping at two chimney swifts that had fallen down the fireplace and were frantically circling my room. Once, during a Nor’Easter, I woke up to find that snow was blowing through the seams of the house’s original window panes. I swept up the little, swirling drifts on my bedroom floor, taped up the windows, and went back to bed. It was in times like these that I was just a bit envious of my friends’ newer, weathertight homes, but deep inside, I knew I would not trade sleeping in extra layers in my quirky, old Harvard, Massachusetts home for any other place.        Since my parents bought it as a fixer-upper, I am often recruited to work on projects like glazing windows, spackling sheetrock, and painting rooms. This past summer, I begrudgingly agreed to help repair the mortar joints in the fieldstone foundation of our basement. I hauled an eighty-pound bag of cement and mixed it with water into a peanut butter-like consistency. I grabbed a gob from the wheelbarrow and got to work stuffing it into the deep crevices between the jumble of stones, troweling it smooth and brushing it to create a finished texture. The hours spent working, much of it on my hands and knees, gave me a lot of time for self-reflection. Undisturbed by text messages or buzzing FaceTime requests, I allowed my mind to wander to the far reaches of my imagination in the quiet solitude of the cellar. Sometimes I reflected on what I should have said in a conversation with a friend, thought through an argument around a current political issue, or pondered ways to frame my essays for summer reading assignments.        Working with my hands, I appreciated the art of forming and sculpting the cement into place, realizing that it was just as creative a process as writing, editing and reworking my essays and poems. It was an iterative and tiring process to get it right. Dripping with sweat, the grinding physical effort from having to work quickly before the cement hardened mirrored my exhaustion in a race I had rowed in last year— although the weather conditions had been very different. At the Head of the Fish Regatta, I had rowed for three miles through the cold, driving rain, facing a fifteen miles-per-hour headwind—feeling as if my arms and legs were on fire—in order to finish.        Good mortaring requires technical precision, speed and strength. I needed to mix the mortar in the correct proportions; work carefully so I did not miss any gaps; and most of all, I needed to persevere, working until the entire wall was repointed. Eventing requires a similar mastery of multiple skills in order to succeed in the three distinct phases of competition. In dressage, my buckskin horse Eli and I needed to work together as one, in calm precision and balance; in show jumping, we needed the focus and technical skills to count strides and launch at the right moment; and in cross-country, we needed the strength and endurance to gallop several miles over fences, across ditches, and through water obstacles.        Whether handling a bucket of wet cement or a green horse, I recognized that having the patience and determination to keep improving despite hardship, tedium or discomfort was essential to reach any mental or physical goal, be it winning a competition, writing an essay or rebuilding a wall. Standing back from the finished fieldstone wall, I basked in the accomplishment—not just of finishing the chore—but of discovering the zen in the art of mortar maintenance.",

        "Text": "The air thickened with red dust as I walked into the basement of Washington Studio School for my first sculpting class - a way to be creative after a stressful day. As I pulled back a thick curtain to enter, I looked around the room, examining the surfaces, all covered in a thin layer of that same dust. The bookshelves behind me were sporting a small collection of sculptures.        We were given a 4’ by 6’ block of clay to mold into a woman that was sitting in front of us. I stared at the block of clay, unable to imagine how to start. The woman next to me immediately started shaping her rust-colored slab. She took clumps from the bottom of the piece, adding it to the top, taking pieces away to form shoulders and arms. I spent more than an appropriate amount of time watching her work. I was amazed by the way she could see the woman inside her block of clay.                I turned back to my sculpture and gingerly shaved off a piece of clay from the top corner. I continued to work at that corner and that corner only as my instructor travelled around the room, visiting each of his students to offer tips and suggestions. When he made it to my table, he glanced at my piece. I had transformed the 4’ by 6’ rectangular prism into a pentagonal prism. He took one of my tools and started shaving away clay and suggested that I remove even more. He continued to visit the rest of his students as I continued to shave miniscule pieces of clay off of my now hexagonal prism.        I wanted to act on his advice, I wanted to take this opportunity to learn, but I did not want to do something wrong. I was afraid of the permanence of my choices. This fear continued to hold me back throughout the 3-hour lesson. By the end of the class, rather than my piece looking like the model sitting in front of me, my piece looked like Mario from the 1985 Super Mario Bros. I left the class, wondering when I started letting fear control my actions.        I remembered that I used to quite literally jump into new situations. The first time I went on a chair lift, for example, I had been so excited to “hit the slopes” that instead of waiting for the chair lift to reach the end, I leaped off 8 feet too soon. Luckily, my dad caught me and held onto me until we reached the end of the lift.        The next week, I was determined to reclaim that feeling of fearlessness to make progress on my sculpture. This time, I took out clumps, rather than slithers. When my instructor reached my table, he pointed to plenty of problems with my piece. The arm was too high, the legs looked like a yeti’s, and the head took the shape of a balloon. But I realized that at least I was doing it — and I was enjoying it, too.        My final piece was in no way a replica of the model who sat in front of me during those lessons: it was riddled with errors. But, while the person I was when I first entered the classroom may have hated the fact that she could see all the mistakes in her final structure, I now appreciate that I can see them, and that I can see how far I’ve come since making them. No matter how deep under the surface of my sculpture the mistake might be, I know it is there. Every crack, air bubble, slip and score, is a working component in my sculpture. And I know that, like my sculpture, I’ve been shaped by my mistakes, too: as long as I want to keep becoming myself, I’ll need to keep making them.",

        "Text": "Had I written this essay three years ago, I would have written with utmost passion about my desire to be a cardiologist. I would have shared that cardiology had lifted the veil placed on my eyes to blind me from my true essence - saving lives. I would have continued to share that it exhibited two of my most accented strengths: my attention to detail and my ability to value each person if though their soul was a reflection of my own. However, most importantly, I felt it was my destiny to grant others what my mother’s cardiologist had granted her: a healthier and rejuvenated life. It is three years later and I do not have a desire to be a cardiologist. The dream I had for cardiology was solely a fabrication of what I believed to be most just. I have a way with words, and I am lyrical. My sweet symphonies are the essence of my being, yet I am not an aspiring songwriter nor am I an aspiring musician. I am a writer. With each word I craft, a part of my soul lives on beyond my years. It turns out that the magic of my words was so powerful, my soul had been deceived. For years, I had been writing about cardiology and science as though the letters c-a-r-d-i-o-l-o-g-y were coursing through my blood, and were tattooed to my heart. Dreams consisted of me writing novels of my career as a cardiologist, sharing my encounters and experience of being a cardiologist. My love for writing had become so pronounced that the passion I had been composing with was mistaken as a passion for cardiology. As a child, I never acknowledged writing as anything more than a hobby. When I would put pen to paper I would solely describe it as just writing. It was never just writing. It was my life; it is who I am. Despite my undying love for this artform, I would tell myself that cardiology was what I wanted, even with the distance and disconnect I felt with cardiology. Regardless of how scholarly and recognized cardiology is, I had felt as though I was settling. However, that all changed. It was a single sentence that unlocked the volta of my life’s story: If you do something you love, you never have to work a day in your life. This sentence, which I heard from an advisor, redirected my thoughts from who I was to who I wanted to be. It was in that moment that my initial thought was not of cardiology, it was of an image of life beyond its limits and a world of wonders, pen to paper, and the flight of young Lorena’s dreams. It was an image of writing. I had always feared that no one would understand my love for writing, nor the bond I had formed with writing. When speaking with a person who does not possess my same passion, it’s as though our conversation is not a conversation at all, but rather a sharing of different languages. They cannot grasp the idea that writing is not solely descriptive language, it is not “red, yellow, blue,” as my aunt would describe it. Writing is the core of my being. It is engraved in my soul. Without it, I would not exist. Writing could never restrain me, because the one thing it offers me that nothing else in the world ever could was the ability to not only think however I wanted to think, but to also be whatever I wanted to be. I had begun a story I had praised for ten years of my life; it was a story I thought I knew the words to like the back of my hand, but the words had drifted and my dream of cardiology had become blurred by my true love and destiny - becoming a writer.",

        "Text": "Piece by Piece: Building My Reality At this point in my life, I am used to the chuckles I receive upon telling my friends that I, in fact, love Legos. Growing up in a house of four children was a hectic environment to say the least; an escape from the chaos of siblings was much needed. As a kid, sitting down and concentrating on one task was never my intention, rather I was constantly energetic, chasing and being chased by my siblings. Building Lego sets had always been a way to minimize any stressors that were going on at the time, or to simply relax and enjoy the challenge. My first Lego set was given to me at a very young age, my seventh birthday, and although excited, I was puzzled with what I was supposed to accomplish. I knew that Luke Skywalker was going to need a little more assistance than I could offer at that age, so after countless hours of struggling and persisting, I inevitably succumbed to the numerous offers of help. Each birthday and holiday moving forward, I requested Legos in order to perfect my ability, and each time I gained expertise. Finally, I encountered my own “Eureka!” moment, individually completing my first kit, a miniature replica of the Seattle Space Needle, solely on willpower and sheer excitement. My worn, but comfortable bedroom floor had become my safe haven for letting my mind wander and to create sculptures I would have never thought of if it hadn’t been for my obsession with those miniscule, plastic blocks. I hadn’t usually been the most creative, artistic person; however, when I sat down in my room next to my collection and freed my mind, I suddenly become an artist of my own definition. Soon, as I got older, more unique ideas for pieces flooded my mind rather than following strict instructions. These ideas had resulted in the possibility of designing and constructing certain buildings and entities, of course without any real-world consequences. My bedroom floor eventually turned into a skyline resembling that of New York City, skyscrapers grazing the top of my bed and Rockefeller Center spanning from my desk to my closet. Arriving home late from school or a strenuous practice, I was relieved to lay down next to my meaningful, personalized city. I rarely construct Lego structures nowadays; however, my obsession with those tiny bricks embedded a passion in me that will never cease to follow me. Arriving to a boarding school as a first-year student, I was extremely hesitant and nervous. Though I would soon be a part of a team, I sought an escape from my anxiety of being away from home and especially my bedroom. Though I hadn’t brought along any of my Legos, (I’m sure you can imagine why), I signed up for a new class which taught the basics of ceramics and sculpting figures. Ceramics was an entire new entity to me and I enjoyed every second of it. I had been constructing simple bowls and plates to ease myself into the new medium I was using. Soon, however, I became more confident and adventurous with my designs. After hours in the studio at school, I ultimately transferred my projects back to my personal studio, my bedroom, to join the company of my surrounding Lego projects. Not only providing me with entertainment, Legos left an everlasting mark on my capacity to experiment with new endeavors I would rarely attempt. Legos hold a special place in my mind and my heart due to the effect they have had on my curiosity, creativity and overall optimism. I will continue to design my sculptures, my essays, and my future, which is certainly guided by my imagination. Having constructed those guided, age appropriate sets and eventually designing unique pieces, I developed a knack for sculpting and imagining brand new ideas I transfer into my everyday life.",

        "Text": "Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and my Massachusetts city had also been torn apart. In a city where nearly half of the population is Puerto Rican, the destination of people fleeing the island had immediately come into question, “Why are they coming here? Our schools already don’t have enough books for our students, never mind Puerto Rican refugees.” These are words out of my French and Irish uncle’s mouth. As he looked in my brown eyes and proclaimed his son’s lack of an AP English book was more important than the life and well-being of a child that looks like me. It is enlightening to begin to take notice of the ignorance that surrounds your identity. It is eye-opening to hear words of hate and intolerance spew from the mouths of people you love, people who claim to love you. I have heard people express how they really feel when they forget about my dark complexion and let a joke slip, to follow up with, \"Well not you, you're not really Puerto Rican.\" To be seven years old and shrouded in a feeling of discomfort for who you are; making an effort to sound and act “white” among my white family and friends. Thanksgiving with my blue-eyed and freckled cousins was an event that displaced me. My Abuela’s house was where my Puerto Rican cousins flourished. They spoke fluent Spanish and shook their heads when I asked what they were saying. I “didn’t care” about my culture to them. It is in this limbo that I find myself more aware of the dubious eyes on me when I’m asked if I am Muslim or Italian (as if Muslim is an ethnicity). When they compliment my “different” name, their eyes widen when they learn that I am from the “whiter” side of the city, but nod in understanding when I clarify that my Mother is white. I notice that these glances are consonant with the fact that the grocery store I work at in the neighboring town made thousands of dollars in their donation cups for Hurricane Harvey victims, but not one mention of Puerto Rico’s disastrous conditions. It is from these glances that I realize both these adversities are not of equal importance to the store where I was one of four Hispanic employees. I am Puerto Rican and Irish and French and Polish and all these backgrounds have allowed me to see unique perspectives, but they are not a single definition of me. I am a daughter, a student, a friend, a sister. I am everything I love and every book I've read and all the people I've helped and all the places I've traveled. I am all of my passions and the closed minds I intend on opening and the thirst for life I intend on quenching. I have grown up with a feeling of exclusion from both sides of my heritage, yet in the process of fighting for a sense of belonging I have embraced myself for more than the color of my skin or the accent of my father. My identity is so much more than an uncomfortable glance from a person who can't place my nose with a nation. I am more than a prejudice comment. What I have truly come to understand by living at the intersection of two very different situations is how ignorance develops so easily from not being able to empathize. My white uncle will never know what it is like to be a minority. He will never feel the stares I have felt, he will never be called a spic, he will never be disadvantaged for his light complexion. It is only when people place themselves as close as possible to the reality of others do they begin to rid themselves of the subconscious prejudices our society places upon us.",

        "Text": "I began measuring my life in flipped pages, packed boxes, and school maps when I was 6. As my family and I flitted between states and coasts for my father’s job over the last decade, I shielded myself with fantasy novels. With my head propped on the baseboard near my nightlight and a book held up in front of me by aching arms, I would dance in whimsical forests, fight daring battles, and rule dangerous courts long after dark. In my fantastic universe, I could take turns being the queen, the knight, the hero, and even the villain. These books helped me express the happiness, anger, sadness, and queerness I could not have even begun to imagine alone. The characters I discovered in novels as I toured libraries and Barnes & Noble stores in strip malls around the country taught me resilience and empowered me to nourish my strengths. Mare Barrow showed me the power of determined women, and I unapologetically strove for academic excellence and obtained a GPA of 4.4. Tane, from The Priory of the Orange Tree, inspired me to push the limits of my own body, so I’ve traversed approximately 1,544 miles in cross-country races and practices. Evelyn Hugo’s unapologetic character compelled me to want to embrace and feel free with my queerness rather than shelter it away in a shameful corner. Even further, this year I am adding a third dimension to my love of fantasy by interpreting Mrs. White in my school’s production of Shuddersome and The Monkey’s Paw with assistance from Anne of Green Gables, my first fictional idol, who massively influenced my personality and tendency for dramatics. But above all, Leigh Bardugu, my favorite author, gave me permission to even dare to write and to dream that I can. What began as a safety net in my adolescence has grown to something more, a true passion for English and all that it can express. Language is power and I wish to wield it like a mighty sword. I want to be the puppetmaster, the speaker, and the leader in a world that is crafted in ink. I want to be a New York Times bestseller and to know that whatever I do is impactful and that it creates a difference, no matter how small. I want to walk down a crowded street and see “my book” spread open in a passing person’s hands, as they refuse to put it down, just like I did so many times in the hallways of my middle school. A writer, a college professor, a publishing lawyer: I want it all, the riots of failure, and the pride of success. Without the assistance of literature, I wouldn’t be who I am today. If I hadn’t grown up fueled on library hauls I wouldn’t have discovered that I love English. I wouldn’t get shivers when I fret for a favorite character or celebrate their triumphs, be as ready to face obstacles, or be as adventurous as I am. Without the moves around the country and back, I wouldn’t have become so resilient and open to change, so adaptable to life, but most importantly I wouldn’t have become so in love with language. With every move I burrowed in books, and with every book I became me. Literature has made me in every way, and the only way I can repay it is to become the penman. ",

Brood X is a cluster of cicadas that descend on Washington, D.C., every 17 years. I live in the epicenter of their swarm. Cicadas battled with mosquitoes for first place in the top tier of the human annoyance pyramid. I hate these off-brand cockroaches. For 17 years, cicadas live underground feasting off of sap, running free of danger. Then, they emerge and face the real world. That sounds familiar. I have lived in the same house, in the same town, for 17 years, with my parents feeding me pasta and keeping me safe. Is it conceivable that I have more in common with cicadas than I previously thought? Cicadas have beady, red eyes. After a year of enduring Zoom classes, attending tele-health appointments, and spending too much time on social media and video games, I too feel a little blurry-eyed and disoriented. But what about their incessant hum and perpetual noise? That is not me. OK, maybe I do make protein shakes with a noisy blender at all hours of the day. Maybe I do FaceTime vehemently with friends, blare music while I shower, and constantly kick a ball around both inside the house and out. At least I do not leave damaged wings, shedded skin, or rotting carcasses everywhere. Smelly soccer socks on the clean carpet after a long practice? Check. Pools of turf in the mudroom after sliding all over the field? You got it. Dirty dishes and trail mix stains after accidentally sitting on a mislaid M&M are hardly as abhorrent as cicada remains, right? The more I reflected, the more I realized these bugs and I are more alike than different. After 17 years of being cooped up, we are both antsy to face new experiences. Of course, cicadas want to broaden their wings, fly, and explore the world, even if it means clumsily colliding into people’s faces, telephone poles, and parked cars. Just like I want to shed my skin and escape to college, even if it means getting lost on campus or ruining a whole load of laundry. Despite all my newbie attributes, I am proceeding to the next phase of my life whether I am ready or not. Only the hardiest of cicadas survive their emergence and make it to trees to mate, lay eggs, and ensure the existence of their species. I want to be a tenacious Brood X cicada. I will know what it means to travel into the wrong classroom before getting laughed at, bump into an upperclassman before dropping textbooks everywhere, fail an exam after thinking I aced it. I may even become the cicada of the lecture hall by asking a professor for permission to go to the bathroom. Like cicadas, I will need time to learn how to learn. No matter what challenge I undergo that exposes and channels my inner-cicada, novice thought process, I will regroup and continue to soar toward the ultimate goal of thriving in college. When I look beyond our beady red eyes, round-the-clock botherment, and messy trails, I now understand there is room for all creatures to grow, both cicadas and humans. Cicadas certainly are on to something ... Seventeen years is the perfect amount of time to emerge and get ready to fly.",

        "Text": "I was born to two moms. One, my biological mom, Meredith. One, my mom who adopted me, Mary. Because they were a same-sex couple, the law required that Mary adopt me in order to be my parent. They used Sperm Donor 3311. All I know about my “father” is that he didn’t have a familial history of cancer, he has a twin brother who is 6'4\", and he studied math in school. This is all background information; I don’t even know his name. He doesn’t know mine, nor does he know that I even exist. People often ask “What does your father do for a living?” and I’m forced to respond “I actually have two moms,” triggering reactions like that of my driving instructor, “Oh, well that must be different.” I’m 17-years-old and still don’t know how to respond to these comments. When I was 5, Mary, who had been sick for a long time with leukemia, passed away, and my life was turned upside down. I was old enough to understand grief, and yet I still question why it happened. It was terrifying seeing my mom break down while saying, “Mom died last night.” I wonder what I missed out on and carry guilt that I don’t remember much about Mary, because we just didn’t have enough time together. Many say grief gets easier with time, however, I think the way you grieve just changes over time. The world kept spinning and, in 2011, my biological mom met another woman, who soon became my stepmom. However, to me, Kerry is also my mom. No longer do I reveal the fact that I have two moms; now I get reactions to the fact that I have three. Not knowing my father doesn’t leave a void in my life. “Dad” didn’t sing “there was an old lady who swallowed a fly” and tickle me when the old lady swallowed the spider, my moms did. He didn’t take me to Gunpowder Friends Meeting where I shook hands and spent time with 80-year-old friends from the retirement home, my moms did. He didn’t console me when I began crying at the dry-erase board at school because it reminded me of white boards Mom wrote on when she was unable to talk. He didn’t teach me that love is love. He didn’t teach me who I was becoming, my moms did that. I’ve never known my father or that I was supposed to have one, so why would I think my life is any different from the so-called “norm?” If there’s one thing I have learned from my parents, it’s that I have developed a love for difference. I openly accept all those around me and excitedly anticipate the relationships that I will build in my future. There is no such thing as a normal family structure, and my upbringing has given me that greater world view. My moms have raised me to believe that I can accomplish anything. There are still limits, though. My family chooses not to travel to Jamaica because we aren’t accepted there. Before each family vacation, we must research to see if it is a gay-friendly place. I don’t know the answers to questions about my dad’s side of the family. But I don’t let those kinds of things get to me because instead I can talk about the people who raised me. The world is changing as we speak. “Normal” is fading, but it has already disappeared for me. I don’t want anything different than the family I have, and I own that every day",

        "Text": "“The difference between an anti-personnel and an anti-tank mine is not that complicated,” I am told casually, in halting Russian, by a boy even younger than I am during a walk through the Chechen mountains. I am freshly 14 and visiting my father’s homeland for the first time, unfamiliar with the harsh realities that kids half my age already know ironclad. My guide points out the areas where the grass is overgrown and the fruit trees abundant. People and animals alike know to avoid them; someone has learned of landmines the hard way. It shouldn’t surprise me — the scars of war on this rugged country are omnipresent — but it is so jarringly different from my life in London that it is nevertheless hard to digest. It also differs from my father’s rosy stories about his childhood in Katyr-Yurt, stories that made me wish to swim carefree in icy rivers, devour handfuls of fresh sour cherries straight from the tree, and see nights dense with stars. I still experience these beauties of place, but my eyes are now open to the less romanticized parts, both enriching and complicating my connection to my family’s past. Suddenly, too, I am made uncomfortably aware of the conflicting layers of my familial identity. It is the Russian of my Muscovite, Jewish mother that I grew up speaking at home. Yet the Chechen children speak in broken Russian, and the grownups who are more fluent in it are not keen to communicate in the enemy’s language. Seeing the ugly scars of war, both physical and psychological, I cannot help but feel like an intruder, ashamed not only of my Russianness but also of my city-boy naivete. Despite this shame, I yearn to discover what it means to be Chechen, to see their home through their eyes, and through this desire, I begin to feel a deep connection all of my own to this beautiful, fraught land. In Moscow, my new awareness of conflicting identities only intensifies, but now on account of the maternal side of my heritage. Relatives there largely see Chechens as terrorists and raise an eyebrow when they hear where I have spent my summer. Babushka’s neighbour, a nurse who witnessed the carnage from the theatre siege in Moscow, turns away disgustedly when she overhears me relate the beauty of the mountains and the notable generosity of the people. Once again, I register the fear and distrust of “the other” that reigns in the more homogeneous cultures in Russia, making me appreciate the diversity of London all the more. When I return there, I cannot slip back into life as normal as I have done after past summers. I find myself pondering the question of identity and the way people interpret their own past, informed just as much by collective emotion and memory as by fact. The cosmopolitanism of London is just as I remembered it, but the things I loved about it I now see in a new light. I had always revelled in the fact that, despite our differences in heritage, my peers and I had seen each other as the same — bound together by being Londoners first and foremost. Now I am interested in conversations that I would never have considered previously, wanting not only to share my newfound experiences but also learn about the personal histories of my friends, many of whom, like me, are the children of immigrants to the UK. When did they come to explore and interrogate their own complicated identities? How did these discoveries make them feel? What does it mean to carry the stories, the poetry, and the pain of so many places within them? Questions like these, which were so important for me to answer about myself, also became a powerful place from which to understand more deeply the people around me and the complex world we share.",

        "Text": "I know that I had prepared well for this moment. For two arduous months, I readied my fingers for an exciting concert. No anxiety could undermine my confidence in my preparation, and my piano recital’s success was “in the bag.” I selected three pieces for my repertoire: the ambience of Erik Satie’s Gymnopedie No. 1 as the opener, a somber contemplation of Beethoven’s First Movement of the Moonlight Sonata, and Bach’s light and surreal Prelude in C Major for the conclusion. My shining moment arrived, and I strode purposefully toward the piano. The building in which my performance was held was new, but its dwellers were old. Respect and prestige permeated the atmosphere as I took each stride to my seat. As I sat down, the chair creaked and moaned as if in sympathy with the audience’s aching desire to hear me play. I prepared my sheet music and commenced my epic moment. Never was such an exhilarating performance heard. All of the little techniques and tricks that I practiced were executed perfectly. I captured the dynamics I wanted to express in Satie’s phonological experiment with each chord to which I applied varying pressure. Moving onto one of Beethoven’s most famous works, I crafted the cascading arpeggios of each new chord, which resonated unity uninterrupted in me and in the audience. When I concluded with the airy prelude from Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier, the room swelled with bliss. Having poured my heart and soul into each piece, I beamed with pride. As customary for a stellar show, I rose to bow to the audience to thank them for their eruption of applause. Flowers were thrown, cheers elicited, and standing ovations bestowed. From the subsiding din came a faint question to rain on my parade: “Could you play something more lively, darling, say, a Neil Diamond song?” I work on weekends at a long-term-care facility, and my geriatric audience, although a pleasure with whom to interact, can be brutally honest. Begrudgingly, I thanked Mrs. Hersch for her request, promised her better next time, and stewed in my own irrelevance. Going home that day, my feathers were ruffled. How could any civilized listener, after such a superb medley, disregard such time-honored compositions? The notion was absurd. Yet perhaps more outlandish, as I later acknowledged, was my visceral reaction to the events that had transpired. Why did I react hesitantly to a simple request made in earnestness? It would have been easier, in fact, to practice “Sweet Caroline” than to break my fingers over Beethoven’s work. Then, in my moments of introspection, I concluded that my choice of musical pieces mattered little as long as my audience enjoyed them. Whether it meant recreating the most tortured and heinously composed pop song or a masterfully crafted Romantic concerto, I vowed to play them all. Throughout my life, my adult mentors have succored me with platitudes when most needed, which laid the foundation for my confidence. Yet, while working with people who have lived five times longer than I have, experiencing so much more than I can imagine, I know that the world does not revolve around my tastes and interests. I’m okay with that. Thus, for a couple of hours each day in the living room, unlucky family members passing by are subjected to the torment of my tenth run-through of “Sweet Caroline” as I prepare for my next recital for an audience that has taught me more about personal preferences, and myself, than I anticipated.",

        "Text": "I have never felt such palpable emotion, such profound grief emanating from a space, as I did while hiking through the forest fire scorch in Philmont, New Mexico. A universe had once existed under the protection of these Ponderosa Pine, now black and crusted, turning brittle in the wind. It was a landscape that didn’t sing its laments, but whispered of its loss through every pile of scalded timber and skinny, wavering shadow cast by the hollow towers of ash. I felt prepared when I made the decision to become a scout. I love nature and camping. I love the Scouts BSA program. I love the people. I was definitely not prepared, however, for the numerous challenges I would face during my years as a scout. I was the first female “boy scout” in my town, which continues to be both my greatest honor and a constant reminder of the isolation and insecurity that comes with being any “first.” I became a symbol, whether for good or bad, and my actions not only spoke of me, but of the future young women in Scouts BSA. I felt like an imposter. I wasn’t a strong-willed leader like those who usually have “first” stitched into their title. My seventh-grade acting career did little to veil a shy and insecure girl who crumbled at overheard comments on how I didn’t belong or how girls like me were poisoning BSA’s spirit. As time passed, I found myself waiting to develop the toughened heart that the leaders that I knew held. As my troop and I backpacked in Philmont Scout Ranch this past summer, my doubts and insecurities seemed to echo from this inky forest. Coming from Pittsburgh, I had expected the kind of desert with raspy air and coat hanger cacti. Nothing quite shattered this expectation as much as putting on my last pair of dry socks before the fourth day of downpours. We navigated steep cliffs and vibrant meadows, and pulled ourselves up peak after peak. As the sun set on one of our final evenings, the flat, mountain-ornamented horizon gave way to a modest footpath, daring into a new forest. This forest, differing from the field of burnt pines we had seen prior, had burned several decades ago. The fire had cleared everything and had left its signature singed onto the bottom 10 feet of every tree. The forest floor was clean. Wild grasses with accents of purple and blue flowers blanketed the ground below the pines like snow, which had fallen while the world was asleep, completely untouched and extending to infinity. Above the burnt limbs of the trees, thick bundles of green needles soared into the sky. Not long after Philmont, I was awarded my Eagle Rank, the culmination of my experience as a scout. I believe that my time in Scouts BSA has been the first to the forest that is my life. Though scars remain from my experience, new change and strength have flourished out of the damage. I have come to the conclusion that it is not always the fierce leader who becomes a “first.” It is the extra hours. It is finding a way to listen to criticism and try harder, rather than feel the thorns. It is using one’s own feeling of isolation to see others who feel alone. It is the act of going through the fire and staying with it, allowing it to advance you, which changes people who dare to be a “first” into the leaders that they go down in history as being. As I think back on my experience in Philmont, the first forest we saw, this blackened graveyard, is what I picture. I remember the charcoaled ground so vividly, but more so, I remember the soft purple wildflowers hidden in the desert soil. Though few and far between, against the grieving timber, they were stars.",

Mum caught me dancing to some of her old Irish tapes — the Chieftains, Sinead O’Connor. She asked me if I wanted to do it for real. I said sure and went back to dancing. Now a freckled woman digs around in a cardboard box and pulls out a pair of dusty, worn black shoes. “Don’t worry,” she says, “you’ll learn eventually.” The shoes are too big; they sag at the toes. I approach the stage. Twenty-five pairs of eyes fix on me. In a room bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I feel like a clown in an ill-fitting costume. All that matters is the dancing. I’m 9. I sit in the hallway of the Times Square Marriott watching girls in big wigs and sparkly dresses run around, squawking like glamorous, unhinged chickens. In my tartan skirt and simple bun, I feel like an ugly duckling. The bobby pins dutifully securing my bun in place make my scalp ache. My hands slide to my shoes. They’re too tight. Mum put them on her feet to “try and stretch them out a little.” I pass some over-enthusiastic dance moms who put the “mother” in “smother.” I reach the stage. A hundred pairs of eyes fix on me. In a hotel bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I’m out of place. All that matters is the dancing. I’m 12. My brain won’t stop flipping through disastrous scenarios as I stand with my teammates in a hotel in Orlando, Florida. We’ve trained for months, sacrificed everything for this moment. I try to think of happy things: the pride on Dad’s face when he watches me dance, the freedom of flying across a stage on invisible wings. We recite our steps like a poem, the sequences like a song that carries us through an ocean of fiddles, pipes, and drums. My parents sacrificed a lot to send me here. I want to make them proud. I want to make myself proud. We approach the national stage. A thousand pairs of eyes fix on me. In a world bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I feel like a fraud. All that matters is the dancing. I’m 15. An Irish accent lilts through the ballroom of the World Championships. It sounds like mashed potatoes and Sunday bests and the green hills of home that I know so well. We mutter a prayer. I’m not sure I believe in God, though I should. I look at my partner and wish we were more than friends. She smiles. I don’t think God believes in me. We ascend the stage. A million pairs of eyes fix on me. In a universe bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I’ll never be enough. All that matters is the dancing. I’ll be 18. Murmuring voices will hover in the air of the gymnasium-turned-cafeteria-turned-auditorium. A little girl will approach me timidly, wearing a very old tartan skirt. I’ll reach out softly, adjusting her bun to soothe her aching scalp. Then, I’ll slide my hands toward her feet, toward a pair of small, dusty shoes. “You’ll learn,” I’ll say. They’ll sag at the toes, but I’ll reassure her: “Don’t worry. You’ll grow into them.” Then, she and I will look at my own beloved shoes. They’ll be worn, but I’ll tell her the creases are like a map, evidence of the places I’ve been, the heartbreaks I’ve suffered, the joy I’ve danced. My life is in these shoes. We’ll hear the music begin to play, the tide of fiddles, and pipes, and drums. I’ll take her hand and, with a deep breath, we’ll climb the stage. “Ahd mor.” It won’t matter that this is the end. All that has ever mattered is the dancing.",

The peaceful picture of the girl standing in the meadow is nowhere to be seen. Even though I successfully avoid having the spilled paint touch the dress, all I can focus on is the black smudge. The stupid black smudge. As I continue to stare at the enemy in front of me, I hear Bob Ross’s annoyingly cheerful voice in my head: “There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.” At this moment, I completely disagree. There is nothing happy about this, only frustration. Actually, there is one other emotion: excitement. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not excited about making a mistake and definitely not happy about the accident. But I am thrilled at the challenge. The black smudge is taunting me, challenging me to fix the painting that took me hours to do. It is my opponent, and I am not planning to back off, not planning to lose. Looking back at the painting, I refuse to see only the black smudge. If lacrosse has taught me one thing, it is that I will not be bested by my mistakes. I snatch my picture and run downstairs, carefully setting it against the living room window. The TV newscaster drones in the background, “California continues to be engulfed in flames as the fires continue to burn.” I slowly step back from my painting. California fires, I think, as I look up into the blood-orange sky. California Fires! I look at the painting, imagining the black smudge not as a black void, but smoke creeping up on the girl as she watches the meadow burn. I grab my painting and run back to my room. The orange sky casts eerie shadows as I throw open my blinds. My hands reach first toward the reds, oranges, and yellows: reds as rich as blood; oranges as beautiful as California poppies; yellows as bright as the sun. I splatter them on my palette, making a beautiful assortment of colors that reminds me of one thing: fire. A rich, beautiful, bright thing, but at the same time, dangerous. My hand levitates toward the white and black. White, my ally: peaceful, wonderful, simple white. Black, my enemy: annoying, frustrating, chaotic black. I splat both of them onto a different palette as I create different shades of gray. My brush first dips into red, orange, and yellow as I create the flame around the girl. The flame engulfs the meadow, each stroke of red covering the serene nature. Next is the smoke, I sponge the dull colors onto the canvas, hazing over the fire and the trees, and, most importantly, hiding the smudge. But it doesn’t work. It just looks like more blobs to cover the black smudge. What could make the gray paint turn into the hazy clouds that I have been experiencing for the past several days? I crack my knuckles in habit, and that’s when a new idea pops into my head. My calloused fingers dip into the cold, slimy gray paint, which slowly warms as I rub it between my fingers. My fingers descend onto the canvas, and as they brush against the fabric, I can feel the roughness of the dried paint as I add the new layer. As I work, the tension from my body releases. With each stroke of my fingers, I see what used to be the blobs turn into the thing that has kept me inside my house for weeks. As I lift my last finger off the canvas, I step back and gaze at my new creation. I have won. ",

        "Text": "Walking down a busy street, I see the quick glances and turned heads. The murmurs and giggles trickle toward me. I try to ignore the buzz, interspersed with, “Oh my God!” and the occasional, “Damn!” Then, a complete stranger asks for a picture, so I stand with people foreign to me and politely smile and laugh. After the click of the camera, they go on their way. Sometimes I wish I weren’t so tall. Maybe then I could take a friend to a movie and just blend into the crowd. Attention from strangers is nothing new to me. Questions about my height dominate almost every public interaction. My friends say my height is just a physical quality and not a personality trait. However, when I reflect on my life, I realize that my height has shaped my character in many ways and has helped to define the person I am. I learned how to be comfortable in my own skin. If I had the introverted personality my older brother had in high school, I’d probably be overwhelmed by the constant public attention. Even as a young child, parents at the sidelines of my baseball games, as well as the umpire, would, in front of all my teammates, demand by birth certificate to prove my age. I grew acquainted early on with the fact that I am abnormally tall and stick out about the crowd. It’s just the way it is. Being self-conscious about it would be paralyzing. I learned how to be kind. When I was younger, some parents in my neighborhood deemed me a bully because I was so much larger than children my age. I had to be extra welcoming and gentle simply to play with other children. Of course, now my coaches wish I weren’t quite so kind on the basketball court. Even More Essays That WorkdI learned humility. At 7 feet tall, everyone expects me to be an amazing basketball player. They come expecting to see Dirk Nowitzki, and instead they might see a performance more like Will Ferrell in Semi-Pro. I have learned to be humble and to work even harder than my peers to meet their (and my) expectations. I developed a sense of lightheartedness. When people playfully make fun of my height, I laugh at myself too. On my first day of high school, a girl dropped her books in a busy hallway. I crouched down to her level and gathered some of her notebooks. As we both stood up, her eyes widened as I kept rising over her. Dumbfounded, she dropped her books again. Embarrassed, we both laughed and picked up the books a second time. All of these lessons have defined me. People unfamiliar to me have always wanted to engage me in lengthy conversations, so I have had to become comfortable interacting with all kinds of people. Looking back, I realize that through years of such encounters, I have become a confident, articulate person. Being a 7-footer is both a blessing and a curse, but in the end, accepting who you are is the first step to happiness.",

        "Text": "“You should scrub off the top layer of your skin whenever you lose a round,” my debate teammate once advised me. “That’s not practical,” I replied. “Neither is your refusal to wear clothes you’ve lost important debate rounds in. Your wardrobe has very little to do with your success.” Half of me disagrees with him. I still bring three BIC Round Stic pencils with 0.7 lead to every test because my gut tells me this fastidious procedure raises my scores. I’m still convinced that labs receive better grades if written in Calibri. And I still won’t rewear clothes in which I’ve lost crucial rounds. Yet the other half of me is equally dismissive of my own superstitions. I love logic, never failing to check that steps in a proof lead to a precise conclusion without gaps in reasoning. Fortunately, I often abandon my penchant for pragmatism to accommodate for my unwarranted superstitions. And since I only feel the need to act logicalcally in selective situations, I am perfectly content with the illogical nature of my other habits: Raised with my great-grandmother, grandparents, and parents all under one roof, I never lacked a consultant to help me transcribe Korean holiday dates from the lunar calendar onto my schedule. Yet whenever all four generations of my family celebrates with a traditional meal of bulgogi, my untraceable and admittedly nonexistent Italian blood flares in protest; I rebelliously cook myself linguine con le vongole that clashes terribly with my mom’s pungent kimchi. If I plot a graph of “hours I spend in physical activity” versus “week of the year,” the result looks like an irregular cardiac cycle. The upsurges symbolize my battles with colossal walls of water in hopes of catching a smooth surf back to Mission Bay shore. The ensuing period of rest mirrors the hours I spend researching in that one spot in my debate team’s war room that isn’t covered in papers (yet), or at the piano sight-reading the newest Adele song. Then the diastolic tranquility is interrupted by the weekends when I’m sprinting through trenches to avoid paintballs swarming above my favorite arena at Paintball USA. I find comfort in the familiar. I treasure the regular midnight chats with my brother as we indulge in batter while baking cupcakes for a friend’s birthday, keeping our voices hushed to avoid waking our mom and facing her “salmonella is in your near future” lecture. Yet, some of my fondest memories involve talking to people with whom I share nothing in common. Whether my conversations are about the Qatari coach’s research on Kuwait’s female voting patterns, or about the infinite differences between the “common app” and the Oxford interviewing process, or even about my friend’s Swedish school’s peculiar policy of mandating uniforms only on Wednesdays, I love comparing cultures with debaters from different countries. My behavior is unpredictable. Yet it’s predictably unpredictable. Sure, I’ll never eat a Korean dinner like one might expect. But I’ll always be cooking linguine the moment I catch a whiff of kimchi.

        "Text": "Several years ago, my mother told me I listen to “white people music.” And I suppose that’s true—rock 'n' roll tends to spring from the middle-class basements of young, white men. Though I did point out that its origins trace back to jazz musicians of the Harlem Renaissance. Also that one of the greatest guitarists of all time—dear Mr.Hendrix; may he rest in peace—was black. My devotion to punk rock began in seventh grade, when Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” came up on my iTunes shuffle. I started to look into their other releases, eventually immersing myself into the complete punk discography. My mother, having grown up in a racially segregated New York, was more likely to listen to Stevie Wonder than Stevie Nicks. But, she must have figured, to each her own. So while my compatriots indulged in the music of Taylor Swift, One Direction, and Lady Gaga, my tacky Hot Topic headphones blasted Green Day, Ramones, and The Clash. My young adolescent ears drank in the raw, chaotic beauty, an echo of the pain of the past. The thrashing, pulsating vitality of the instruments painted a picture, connecting me to the disillusioned kids who launched an epic movement of liberation some 40 years ago. Punkers question authority. Aggressively contrarian, they advocate for the other side—the side that seemed smothered silent during the post-Vietnam era. They rejected the established norms. They spoke out and weren’t afraid. I had always felt different from my peers. In my girls’s prep school, the goal was to be blond and good at soccer. I was neither, which automatically deemed me “uncool”. I had a few close friends but never felt like I was part of a whole. Then came the punk philosophy, for the outliers, for those who were different. That was something I could be part of. Instead of trying to conform to my peers, I adopted an anti-conformist attitude. Much like the prematurely gray anti-hero of my favorite book, I sneered at all the “phonies” around me. I resented anything popular. Uggs? Wouldn’t buy them. Yoga pants? Never. Starbucks?Well, I could make a few concessions. But I felt more cynical than liberated. I wasted so much energy on being different than I lost track of what actually made me happy. I insisted I didn’t care what people thought of me, which was true. Yet if I based my actions almost solely on their behavior, how could I deny their influence? Luckily, as I transitioned from a private school to a brand new public high school, I got to clean the slate. I bought yoga pants and found they were comfortable. I listened to a wide variety of music, even the eh kind that wasn’t 100% hardcore punk. And I was happier. I revised my punk philosophy: Do as you like—whether it fits into the “system” or not. The Beatles’s “Revolution” lyrics sum it up well: You tell me it’s the institution Well, you know You’d better free your mind instead What I think Lennon was getting at is questioning everything does not entail opposing everything. Defiance for the sake of defiance is unproductive at best, destructive at worst. I believe in life’s greater Truths, like Love and Justice. These Truths are what should govern my actions—not what’s popular and what isn’t. Striving to act on these ideals has helped me stay true to myself, regardless of what’s considered \"conformist.\" Perhaps I’ve failed the punk movement. We’ll have to wait and see. In the meantime, I’ll do what makes me happy and change what doesn’t. I’ll wear Doc Martens instead of Uggs; I’ll partake in a grande pumpkin spice latte; I’ll watch Gossip Girl; I’ll blare my favorite guitar solo over the speakers in my room. And that’s as punk as it gets. ",

        "Text": "Garishly lined with a pearlescent lavender, my eyes idly scanned the haphazard desk in front of me, settling on a small kohl. I packed the ebony powder into my waterline with a shaky hand, wincing at the fine specks making their way into my eyes. The palette's colors bore in, the breadth of my imagination interwoven into now-brittle brushes. The girl in the mirror seemed sharper, older, somehow. At only 12, I was relatively new to the powders and blushes that lined my birthday makeup kit, but I was determined to decipher the deep splashes of color that had for so long been an enigma to me. After school involved self-inflicted solitary confinement, as I shut myself in my bedroom to hone my skills. The palette’s colors bore in, the breadth of my imagination interwoven into now-brittle brushes. Much to my chagrin, my mom walked in one day, amused at my smudged lipstick, which congealed on the wispy hairs that lined my upper lip. “Halloween already?” she asked playfully. I flushed in embarrassment as she got to work, smoothing my skin with a brush and filling the gaps in my squiggly liner. Becoming a makeup aficionado was going to take some help. “What’s this even made of?” I asked, transfixed by the bright powder she was smattering on my cheeks. “You know, I’m not sure,” she murmured. “Maybe you should find out.” I did. Hours down the internet rabbit hole, I learned that the shimmery powder was made of mica, a mineral commonly used in cosmetics. While the substance was dazzling, its production process was steeped in humanitarian violations and environmental damage. Determined to reconcile my burgeoning love for makeup with my core values, I flung the kit into the corner of my drawer, vowing to find a more sustainable alternative. Yes, I was every bit as dramatic as you imagine it. Now 17, I approach ethical makeup with assured deliberation. As I glance at my dusty kit, which still sits where I left it, I harken back on the journey it has taken me on. Without the reckoning that it spurred, makeup would still simply be a tool of physical transformation, rather than a catalyst of personal growth. Now, each swipe of eyeliner is a stroke of my pen across paper as I write a children’s book about conscious consumerism. My flitting fingers programmatically place sparkles, mattes, and tints across my face in the same way that they feverishly move across a keyboard, watching algorithms and graphs integrate into models of supply chain transparency. Makeup has taught me to be unflinching, both in self expression and my expectations for the future. I coat my lips with a bold sheen, preparing them to form words of unequivocal urgency at global conferences and casual discussions. I see my passion take flight, emboldening others to approach their own reckonings, uncomfortable as they may be. I embark on a two-year journey of not buying new clothes in a statement against mass consumption and rally youth into a unified organization. We stand together, picking at the gritty knots of makeup, corporate accountability, and sustainability as they slowly unravel. Deep rooted journeys of triumph and tribulation are plastered across the surface of my skin — this paradox excites me. I’m not sure why makeup transfixes me. Perhaps it’s because I enjoy seeing my reveries take shape. Yukta, the wannabe Wicked Witch of the West, has lids coated with emerald luster and lips of coal. Yukta, the Indian classical dancer, wields thick eyeliner and bright crimson lipstick that allow her expressions to be amplified across a stage. Deep rooted journeys of triumph and tribulation are plastered across the surface of my skin — this paradox excites me. Perhaps I am also drawn to makeup because as I peel back the layers, I am still wholly me. I am still the young girl staring wide-eyed at her reflection, earnestly questioning in an attempt to learn more about the world. Most importantly, I still carry an unflagging vigor to coalesce creativity and activism into palpable change, one brushstroke at a time.",

        "Text": "Finally, I had found a volunteer opportunity at the Long Marine Lab, a marine biology research facility at UC Santa Cruz! I envisioned swimming with dolphins, or perhaps studying behavioral patterns of decorator crabs. But when I discovered the nature of my work on the first day of volunteering, my excitement turned to disappointment: I’d be picking through albatross boluses, the indigestible materials they cough up before going to sea. Sure enough, after three hours of separating fishing line from brown muck, I began to dread what I was in for. At that point, I had no clue of just how interesting the opportunity would turn out to be, and it would remind me of how easily I become engrossed and fascinated by all sorts of random stuff. It didn’t take long for my boredom with the boluses to shift toward curiosity. In the first place, the project itself was fascinating. The idea was to research the behavior and diet of albatrosses at sea. These birds can fly for months without touching land! When the birds have chicks, they cough up whatever they’ve eaten at sea to feed their young. When the chicks become old enough to fly, they cough up the hard, indigestible materials left in their stomachs. These boluses contain squid beaks that can reveal the types of squid eaten and the area where the squid were caught. We volunteers would pick through the boluses, separating out anything that looked interesting. As I got better at dissecting these blobs, I started finding crazy stuff, and my colleagues and I would often discuss important findings. There was, of course, the search for the biggest squid beak, and the fish eyes were always interesting. But most shocking was the plastic. Beyond the normal Styrofoam and fishing line were plastic bottle caps, lighters, even toothbrushes. Occasionally, Asian writing revealed distant origins. Once, I picked through a bolus permeated with orange goo, eventually to discover the round mouthpiece of a balloon. The origins of these artifacts were sad, but also fascinating. I learned of the Texas-sized trash heap in the middle of the Pacific, the effects of which I was witnessing firsthand. I gained a heightened awareness of the damage inflicted on the oceans by humans, and their far-reaching impacts. Perhaps most importantly, I realized that even the most tedious things can blow my mind. If dissecting boluses can be so interesting, imagine the things I’ve yet to discover! I play piano and can see myself dedicating my life to the instrument, but I can’t bear to think of everything else I’d have to miss. I’d love to study albatrosses, but also particle physics or history, and preferably all three. At this point in my life, I can’t imagine picking just one area. At the same time, though, I love studying subjects in depth. I tend to get overwhelmed by my options, since I can’t possibly choose them all. But at least I know I’ll never be bored in life: there are just too many subjects to learn about, books to read, pieces to play, albatrosses to save, and boluses to dissect. ",

        "Text": "Gazing up at the starry sky, I see Cygnus, Hercules, and Pisces, remnants of past cultures. I listen to waves crash on the beach, the forces of nature at work. Isn’t it odd how stars are flaming spheres and electrical impulses make beings sentient? The very existence of our world is a wonder; what are the odds that this particular planet developed all the necessary components, parts that all work in unison, to support life? How do they interact? How did they come to be? I thought back to how my previously simplistic mind-set evolved this past year. The very existence of our world is a wonder; what are the odds that this particular planet developed all the necessary components, parts that all work in unison, to support life? At Balboa, juniors and seniors join one of five small learning communities, which are integrated into the curriculum. Near the end of sophomore year, I ranked my choices: Law Academy first—it seemed the most prestigious—and WALC, the Wilderness Arts and Literacy Collaborative, fourth. So when I was sorted into WALC, I felt disappointed at the inflexibility of my schedule and bitter toward my classes. However, since students are required to wait at least a semester before switching pathways, I stayed in WALC. My experiences that semester began shifting my ambition-oriented paradigm to an interest-oriented one. I didn’t switch out. Beyond its integrated classes, WALC takes its students on trips to natural areas not only to build community among its students, but also to explore complex natural processes and humanity’s role in them. Piecing these lessons together, I create an image of our universe. I can visualize the carving of glacial valleys, the creation and gradation of mountains by uplift and weathering, and the transportation of nutrients to and from ecosystems by rivers and salmon. I see these forces on the surface of a tiny planet rotating on its axis and orbiting the sun, a gem in this vast universe. Through WALC, I have gained an intimate understanding of natural systems and an addiction to understanding the deep interconnections embedded in our cosmos. Understanding a system’s complex mechanics not only satisfies my curiosity, but also adds beauty to my world; my understanding of tectonic and gradational forces allows me to appreciate mountains and coastlines beyond aesthetics. By physically going to the place described in WALC’s lessons, I have not only gained the tools to admire these systems, but have also learned to actually appreciate them. This creates a thirst to see more beauty in a world that’s filled with poverty and violence, and a hunger for knowledge to satisfy that thirst. There are so many different systems to examine and dissect—science alone has universal, planetary, molecular, atomic, and subatomic scales to investigate. I hope to be able to find my interests by taking a variety of courses in college, and further humanity’s understanding through research, so that all can derive a deeper appreciation for the complex systems that govern this universe.

        "Text": "James was not fitting in with everyone else. During lunch, he sat alone, playing with his own toys. During group activities, the other campers always complained when paired with him. What was wrong? As camp counselor, I quietly observed his behavior—nothing out of the ordinary. I just couldn’t fathom why the other campers treated him like a pariah. After three days of ostracism, James broke down during a game of soccer. Tears streaming down his cheeks, he slumped off the field, head in his hands. I jogged toward him, my forehead creased with concern. Some campers loudly remarked, “Why is that creep crying?” Furious indignation leaped into my heart. They were the ones who “accidentally” bumped into him and called him “James the Freak.” It was their cruelty that caused his meltdown, and now they were mocking him for it. I sharply told them to keep their thoughts to themselves. I squatted beside James and asked him what was wrong. Grunting, he turned his back to me. I had to stop his tears, and I had to make him feel comfortable. So for the next hour, I talked about everything a seven-year-old boy might find interesting, from sports to Transformers. “I have a question,” I asked as James began to warm to me. I took a deep breath and dove right into the problem. “Why do the other campers exclude you?” Hesitantly, he took off his shoes and socks, and pointed at his left foot. One, two, three … four. He had four toes. We had gone swimming two days before: All the campers must have noticed. I remembered my childhood, when even the smallest abnormality—a bad haircut, a missing tooth—could cause others, including myself, to shrink away. I finally understood. But what could I do to help? I scoured my mind for the words to settle his demons. But nothing came to me. Impulsively, I hugged him—a gesture of intimacy we camp leaders were encouraged not to initiate, and an act I later discovered no friend had ever offered James before. Then, I put my hand on his shoulder and looked him straight in the eyes. I assured him that external features didn’t matter, and that as long as he was friendly, people would eventually come around. I listed successful individuals who had not been hindered by their abnormalities. And finally, I told him he would always be my favorite camper, regardless of whether he had two, five, or a hundred toes. On the last day of camp, I was jubilant—James was starting to fit in. Although the teasing had not completely disappeared, James was speaking up and making friends. And when, as we were saying our good-byes, James gave me one last hug and proclaimed that I was his “bestest friend in the whole wide world,” my heart swelled up. From my campers, I learned that working with children is simply awesome. And from James, I learned that a little love truly goes a long way.",

        "Text": "My Ye-Ye always wears a red baseball cap. I think he likes the vivid color—bright and sanguine, like himself. When Ye-Ye came from China to visit us seven years ago, he brought his red cap with him and every night for six months, it sat on the stairway railing post of my house, waiting to be loyally placed back on Ye-Ye’s head the next morning. He wore the cap everywhere: around the house, where he performed magic tricks with it to make my little brother laugh; to the corner store, where he bought me popsicles before using his hat to wipe the beads of summer sweat off my neck. Today whenever I see a red hat, I think of my Ye-Ye and his baseball cap, and I smile. Ye-Ye is the Mandarin word for “grandfather.” My Ye-Ye is a simple, ordinary person—not rich, not “successful”—but he is my greatest source of inspiration and I idolize him. Of all the people I know, Ye-Ye has encountered the most hardship and of all the people I know, Ye-Ye is the most joyful. That these two aspects can coexist in one individual is, in my mind, truly remarkable. Ye-Ye was an orphan. Both his parents died before he was six years old, leaving him and his older brother with no home and no family. When other children gathered to read around stoves at school, Ye-Ye and his brother walked in the bitter cold along railroad tracks, looking for used coal to sell. When other children ran home to loving parents, Ye-Ye and his brother walked along the streets looking for somewhere to sleep. Eight years later, Ye-Ye walked alone—his brother was dead. Ye-Ye managed to survive, and in the meanwhile taught himself to read, write, and do arithmetic. Life was a blessing, he told those around him with a smile. Years later, Ye-Ye’s job sent him to the Gobi Desert, where he and his fellow workers labored for twelve hours a day. The desert wind was merciless; it would snatch their tent in the middle of the night and leave them without supply the next morning. Every year, harsh weather took the lives of some fellow workers. After eight years, Ye-Ye was transferred back to the city where his wife lay sick in bed. At the end of a twelve-hour workday, Ye-Ye took care of his sick wife and three young children. He sat with the children and told them about the wide, starry desert sky and mysterious desert lives. Life was a blessing, he told them with a smile. But life was not easy; there was barely enough money to keep the family from starving. Yet, my dad and his sisters loved going with Ye-Ye to the market. He would buy them little luxuries that their mother would never indulge them in: a small bag of sunflower seeds for two cents, a candy each for three cents. Luxuries as they were, Ye-Ye bought them without hesitation. Anything that could put a smile on the children’s faces and a skip in their steps was priceless. Ye-Ye still goes to the market today. At the age of seventy-eight, he bikes several kilometers each week to buy bags of fresh fruits and vegetables, and then bikes home to share them with his neighbors. He keeps a small patch of strawberries and an apricot tree. When the fruit is ripe, he opens his gate and invites all the children in to pick and eat. He is Ye-Ye to every child in the neighborhood. I had always thought that I was sensible and self-aware. But nothing has made me stare as hard in the mirror as I did after learning about the cruel past that Ye-Ye had suffered and the cheerful attitude he had kept throughout those years. I thought back to all the times when I had gotten upset. My mom forgot to pick me up from the bus station. My computer crashed the day before an assignment was due. They seemed so trivial and childish, and I felt deeply ashamed of myself. Now, whenever I encounter an obstacle that seems overwhelming, I think of Ye-Ye; I see him in his red baseball cap, smiling at me. Like a splash of cool water, his smile rouses me from grief, and reminds me how trivial my worries are and how generous life has been. Today I keep a red baseball cap at the railing post at home where Ye-Ye used to put his every night. Whenever I see the cap, I think of my Ye-Ye, smiling in his red baseball cap, and I smile. Yes, Ye-Ye. Life is a blessing. But what could I do to help? I scoured my mind for the words to settle his demons. But nothing came to me. Impulsively, I hugged him—a gesture of intimacy we camp leaders were encouraged not to initiate, and an act I later discovered no friend had ever offered James before.

And finally, I told him he would always be my favorite camper, regardless of whether he had two, five, or a hundred toes. On the last day of camp, I was jubilant—James was starting to fit in. Although the teasing had not completely disappeared, James was speaking up and making friends. And when, as we were saying our good-byes, James gave me one last hug and proclaimed that I was his “bestest friend in the whole wide world,” my heart swelled up. From my campers, I learned that working with children is simply awesome. And from James, I learned that a little love truly goes a long way.",

        "Text": "In hazy stillness, a sudden flurry of colored skirts, whispers of “Merde!” Sternly, my fingers smooth back my hair, although they know no loose strands will be found. My skin absorbs heat from stage lights above—if only that heat would seep into my brain, denature some proteins, and deactivate the neurons stressing me out. A warm hand, accompanied by an even warmer smile, interrupts my frenzied solitude. I glance up. My lovely teacher nods, coaxing my frozen lips into a thawed smile. A complex figure, filled in with doubt, yet finished with shades of confidence: My body takes its place and waits. One, two, three, four; two, two, three, four. On stage, the lights and music wash over me. Never having had a true ballet solo before, my lungs are one breath away from hyperventilating. Trying to achieve a Zen-like state, I imagine a field of daisies, yet my palms continue sweating disobediently. It’s not that I’ve never been on stage alone before; I’ve had plenty of piano recitals and competitions. Yet, while both performances consume my mind and soul, ballet demands complete commitment of my body. Gently slide into arabesque and lean downward; try not to fall flat on face—Mom’s videotaping. In terms of mentality, I would hardly be described as an introvert; yet, a fear of failure has still kept me from taking risks. Maybe I was scared of leaping too high, falling too far, and hitting the hard floor. As I moved up in the cutthroat world of dance, this fear only increased; the pressure of greater expectations and the specter of greater embarrassment had held me contained. Now, every single eyeball is on me. Lean extra in this pirouette; it’s more aesthetic. But is it always better to be safe than sorry? Glancing toward the wings, I see my teacher’s wild gesticulations: Stretch your arms out, she seems to mime, More! A genuine smile replaces one of forced enthusiasm; alone on the stage, this is my chance to shine. I breathe in the movements, forget each individual step. More than just imagining, but finally experiencing the jubilation of the music, I allow my splits to stretch across the stage and my steps to extend longer and longer, until I’m no longer safe and my heart is racing. Exhilarated and scared in the best way, I throw myself into my jumps. I no longer need to imagine scenes to get in the mood; the emotions are twirling and leaping within me. Reaching, stretching, grabbing, flinging ... My fear no longer shields me. I find my old passion for ballet, and remember the grace and poise that can nevertheless convey every color of emotion. Playing it safe will leave me part of the backdrop; only by taking risks can I step into the limelight. Maybe I’ll fall, but the rush is worth it. I’ll captain an all-male science bowl team, run a marathon, audition for a musical, and embrace the physical and intellectual elation of taking risks.",

        "Text": "Red, orange, purple, gold...I was caught in a riot of shifting colors. I pranced up and down the hill, my palms extended to the moving collage of butterflies that surrounded me. “Would you like to learn how to catch one?” Grandfather asked, holding out a glass jar. “Yes!” I cheered, his huge calloused fingers closing my chubby five-year-old hands around it carefully. Grandfather put his finger to his lips, and I obliged as I watched him deftly maneuver his net. He caught one marvelous butterfly perched on a flower, and I clutched the open jar in anticipation as he slid the butterfly inside. It quivered and fell to the bottom of the jar, and I gasped. It struggled until its wings, ablaze in a glory of orange and red, quivered to a stop. I watched, wide-eyed, as it stopped moving. “Grandpa! What’s happening?” My grandfather had always had a collection of butterflies, but that was the first time I saw him catch one. After witnessing the first butterfly die, I begged him to keep them alive; I even secretly let some of them go. Therefore, to compromise, he began carrying a special jar for the days I accompanied him on his outings, a jar to keep the living butterflies. But the creatures we caught always weakened and died after a few days in captivity, no matter how tenderly I fed and cared for them. Grandfather took me aside and explained that the lifespan of an adult butterfly was very short. They were not meant to live forever: their purpose was to flame brilliantly and then fade away. Thus, his art serves as a memory of their beauty, an acknowledgement of nature’s ephemeral splendor. But nothing could stay the same. I moved to America and as the weekly excursions to the mountainside ended, so did our lessons in nature and science. Although six thousand miles away, I would never forget how my grandpa’s wrinkles creased when he smiled or how he always smelled like mountain flowers. As I grew older and slowly understood how Grandfather lived his life, I began to follow in his footsteps. He protected nature’s beauty from decay with his art, and in the same way, I tried to protect my relationships, my artwork, and my memories. I surrounded myself with the journals we wrote together, but this time I recorded my own accomplishments, hoping to one day show him what I had done. I recorded everything, from the first time I spent a week away from home to the time I received a gold medal at the top of the podium at the California Tae Kwon Do Competition. I filled my new home in America with the photographs from my childhood and began to create art of my own. Instead of catching butterflies like my grandpa, I began experimenting with butterfly wing art as my way of preserving nature’s beauty. Soon my home in America became a replica of my home in China, filled from wall to wall with pictures and memories. Nine long years passed before I was reunited with him. The robust man who once chased me up the hillside had developed arthritis, and his thick black hair had turned white. The grandfather I saw now was not the one I knew; we had no hobby and no history in common, and he became another adult, distant and unapproachable. With this, I forgot all about the journals and photos that I had kept and wanted to share with him. After weeks of avoidance, I gathered my courage and sat with him once again. This time, I carried a large, leather-bound book with me. “Grandfather,” I began, and held out the first of my many journals. These were my early days in America, chronicled through pictures, art, and neatly-printed English. On the last page was a photograph of me and my grandfather, a net in his hand and a jar in mine. As I saw our faces, shining with proud smiles, I began to remember our days on the mountainside, catching butterflies and halting nature’s eventual decay. My grandfather has weakened over the years, but he is still the wise man who raised me and taught me the value of capturing the beauty of life. Although he has grown old, I have grown up. His legs are weak, but his hands are still as gentle as ever. Therefore, this time, it will be different. This time, I will no longer recollect memories, but create new ones. Lean extra in this pirouette; it’s more aesthetic. But is it always better to be safe than sorry? Glancing toward the wings, I see my teacher’s wild gesticulations: Stretch your arms out, she seems to mime, More!

        "Text": "I sat on my parents’ bed weeping with my head resting on my knees. “Why did you have to do that to me? Why did you have to show me the house and then take it away from me?” Hopelessly, I found myself praying to God realizing it was my last resort. For years, my family and I found ourselves moving from country to country in hopes of a better future. Factors, such as war and lack of academic opportunities, led my parents to pack their bags and embark on a new journey for our family around the world. Our arduous journey first began in Kuçovë, Albania, then Athens, Greece, and then eventually, Boston, Massachusetts. Throughout those years, although my family always had a roof over our heads, I never had a place I could call “home.” That night that I prayed to God, my mind raced back to the night I was clicking the delete button on my e-mails, but suddenly stopped when I came upon a listing of the house. It was September 22, 2007 —eight years exactly to the day that my family and I had moved to the United States. Instantly, I knew that it was fate that was bringing this house to me. I remembered visiting that yellow house the next day with my parents and falling in love with it. However, I also remembered the heartbreaking phone call I received later on that week saying that the owners had chosen another family’s offer. A week after I had prayed to God, I had given up any hopes of my family buying the house. One day after school, I unlocked the door to our one-bedroom apartment and walked over to the telephone only to see it flashing a red light. I clicked PLAY and unexpectedly heard the voice of our real estate agent. “Eda!” she said joyfully. “The deal fell through with the other family—the house is yours! Call me back immediately to get started on the papers.” For a moment, I stood agape and kept replaying the words in my head. Was this really happening to me? Was my dream of owning a home finally coming true? Over the month of November, I spent my days going to school and immediately rushing home to make phone calls. Although my parents were not fluent enough in English to communicate with the bank and real estate agent, I knew that I was not going to allow this obstacle to hinder my dream of helping to purchase a home for my family. Thus, unlike a typical thirteen-year-old girl’s conversations, my phone calls did not involve the mention of makeup, shoes, or boys. Instead, my conversations were composed of terms, such as “fixed-rate mortgages,” “preapprovals,” and “down payments.” Nevertheless, I was determined to help purchase this home after thirteen years of feeling embarrassed from living in a one-bedroom apartment. No longer was I going to experience feelings of humiliation from not being able to host sleepovers with my friends or from not being able to gossip with girls in school about who had the prettiest room color. I had been homeless for the first thirteen years of my life. Although I will never be able to fully repay my parents for all of their sacrifices, the least I could do was to help find them a home that they could call their own—and that year, I did. To me, a home means more than the general conception of “four walls and a roof.” A home is a place filled with memories and laughter from my family. No matter where my future may lead me, I know that if at times I feel alone, I will always have a yellow home with my family inside waiting for me.",

        "Text": "The white yarn slipped off my aluminium crochet hook, adding a single crochet to rows and rows of existing stitches, that looked to be in the form of a blob. Staring at the image of the little unicorn amigurumi lit up on the screen of my laptop, and looking back at the UMO (unidentified messy object) number five, I was extremely perplexed. This had seemed so easy. Round 1, construct a magic circle with 6 single crochets. Done. Round 2 was an increase round resulting in a total of 12 stitches. Also done. The remaining rounds were blurred into hours and minutes that should have resulted in a little white creature in the likeness of a unicorn, but sitting on my desk (much like the four days before today) was a pool of tangled white yarn. It was not until day seven that a creature with a lopsided head whose horn was the only identifier of the mythical being emerged. Very much like learning how to crochet, my journey in forging my own path and finding a passion was confusing, messy and at times infuriating. Even in primary school, I had heard all the stories of individuals finding their own route in life. I had been told stories of those who found their passion at a young age and were exceptionally proficient at their craft, of those that abandoned their interests and pursued a lucrative career, even those who chose their dreams but regretted it afterwards. This weighed heavily on me, as I was determined to have a success story as many of my other family members had. The only problem was that I did not have a direction. In the years following primary school, I stepped out of my comfort zone in a frenzy to find a passion. I joined the school orchestra where I played the violin, and a debate class to practice public speaking and become much more eloquent. At my ballet school, I branched out to contemporary and jazz dance. I stuffed myself with experience similar to an amigurumi engorged with batting. I found myself enjoying all of those activities but soon enough, I was swamped with extracurriculars. Just like the tangles of white yarn on my desk, I was pulled in all directions. I still felt lost. To make things worse, it seemed as if everyone else had found their path in life, and they had all become white unicorns while I was still doubting the stitch I just made. It was not until high school that I realised that I could view this mission to find a passion from another perspective. While successfully completing a crochet project is an accomplishment itself, the motions of making slip knots, single or double crochets takes you on an adventure as well. The knots that I had encountered in my craft were evidence of my experiences and what shaped me as an individual. My exploration of various paths through detours may have sometimes resulted in roadblocks, but I continued to persevere and learn from my experiences, applying the skills that I have gained to future knots. The mini adventures that I went on were all crucial to me in the greater journey of life. Through trial and error, the current adventure that I am on resonates the most with me, taking me down the path of service and environmental activism. However, I have learnt that no one path is static, and I can be on more than one path at a time. While I may only be halfway to the proportionate unicorn amigurumi that some others may have already achieved, I still have so much to learn and so much that I want to learn, and so my journey to grow continues.",

        "Text": "If you told me I would be playing a sport called squash at 11 years old, I would call you crazy. But in seventh grade, I was at a new school 10 times bigger than my last one. I felt like a little fish in a big pond. I was quiet, withdrawn, and very introverted. A lot of the time, I stayed where I was comfortable. During the first week of school, a group of people visited the school and they introduced themselves as Squashbusters. At that time, I’d only heard of Squash once before, but I didn’t really know what it was. Because the program combined the sport of squash with academic support, mentoring, and service opportunities, I decided to sign up. It’s been six years and this program has made a monumental difference in my life. Being a part of SquashBusters is a program that really pushed me out of my shell to the point where I’ve grown accustomed to challenging myself. In SquashBusters, they tell us to push ourselves past our limits on the squash courts, but that mindset has transferred to other areas of my life as well. From team trips and tournaments to cringy karaoke moments and participating in eccentric traditions like our annual SquashBusters Olympics, my comfort zone has steadily grown larger. My peers brought out a side of me I didn’t even know existed. I haven’t transformed completely from introvert to extrovert, but I’ve become more social as the years go by. At Hopkins, I want to do something similar. I want to try new things and embrace the campus traditions. Even though I will develop intellectually from the many academic classes and clubs/activities offered on campus, I feel as though a true community is birthed from exploring beyond what one’s used to. From traditions like Blue Jay Opening Day and the Spring Fair to the many world-changing clubs like the Amnesty International club and the Foreign Affairs Symposium, the different ways to be involved in the Hopkins community is limitless and invigorating and I can’t wait to be a part of the Hopkins family.",

        "Text": "“Bring the ace of spades up,” my Grandmother said as we started our first game of solitaire after I got home from school. “Now, put the black eight onto the red nine.” We played solitaire often, working together to reorganize the cards most efficiently. While it was meant to be a single-player game, solitaire was the one thing we did together, moving and dealing the cards in a symphony of order: red to black, red to black. Pulling the pattern out of the random array of cards. For hours, we sat at our glossy kitchen table, playing game after game. If there were no more moves to make, I would always sneak a card from below a column without my grandma seeing. She always did. I couldn’t understand- What was the big deal of revealing the cards? We might win one out of ten games played. But if we just ‘helped ourselves,’ as I liked to call it, we could win them all. I didn’t understand her adherence to the “Turn Three” rule. Why not just turn the cards one by one? It was too frustrating to see the cards go by, but turn exactly three and not be able to pick them up! After one game we lost, I asked my grandma, “Why do we play this way? There’s a much better way to play.” In response, she quickly explained her adamancy to the rules, what before had made no sense to me. Her polished fingernails scratched against the cards as she shuffled them and told me. “Solitaire isn’t just a game for one person.” Her deep brown eyes sharply glanced at me, “No.” It wasn’t just a game for one person, but rather for two sides of a person. It was an internal battle, a strengthening of the mind. One playing against oneself. “If one side of you cheats, how would either side get better?” Red lipsticked lips slightly grinned as my grandma saw me trying to understand, but I didn’t agree with this thought at once. The cards rhythmically slapped down onto the table as my grandmother, small yet stoic, effortlessly moved the cards with frail hands. I watched her. I thought about any other way to understand this idea. I desperately wanted to. Trying to think, I couldn’t imagine another instance where this sense of tranquility, bringing the melody of organization out of a cacophony of random cards, came from such intense competition. The slow manipulation of life around her precedent made me think back to my grandma, to what she told me, and made me understand. Two years later, pushing myself harder than I ever had before in a field hockey match, I realized how much I had been cheating myself and my team by not putting this effort in before. Four years later, I was helping my parents clean after dinner when I saw the value in not taking the easy way out. Five years later, I found once again the difficult ease in pottery. Lifting the pot off the wheel, I found satisfaction. Looking back, I hadn’t realized that this notion of self-accountability appears in almost every aspect of my life. Seven columns. Four aces. Fifty-two cards. Laying these down, I’m brought back to playing solitaire with my grandmother. Through time, her inner spirit never crumbled as her body began to deteriorate. Her mind stayed strong and proud. I admired her for that more than she could’ve imagined. Each challenge I face, or will face, in life, I think back to her lesson one inconspicuous afternoon. Never let myself cheat. Always hold myself accountable. Work hard in every competition, especially the ones against myself, as those are the ones that better me the most. I did not understand what my grandmother meant that day. Now, with each day, I do more.",

        "Text": "No, Dante. Stop, think, and look at the entire board. I was thoroughly confused. I thought I had procured the complete solution to this elaborate chess puzzle. What am I missing? A knight fork, a bishop move? Am I in check? After a quick glance at the left side of the board, I slapped my hand on my head as I suddenly realized what my chess coach was telling me. My queen was sitting unused, positioned all the way on the other side of the board, and I had no idea. If I were to sacrifice my queen, the opposing rook would be forced to capture it, allowing me to finish the game in style with the illustrious “smothered mate.” If you begin to look at the whole chessboard, then these puzzles will become a breeze for you. Ever since that chess lesson, those words have stuck. Indeed, my chess skills improved swiftly as my rating flew over the 1000 Elo threshold in a matter of months. However, those words did not merely pertain to chess. Looking at the whole picture became a foundational skill that I have utilized throughout my life in school and other endeavors. I particularly remember making use of it on the soccer field. Now, I’m no Arnold Schwarzenegger. Weighing in at a monstrous 125 pounds and standing 5 foot 8 inches, my opponents made it a habit to tackle me to the ground. Once again, I found myself face to face with the defender, and before I knew it, I crumbled to the ground, left isolated and dispossessed. Laying dazed on the pitch, my mind flashed back to the chessboard. It occurred to me that soccer, much like chess, relies on the proper position of the many pieces that combine to create a finished strategy. The “whole picture” of soccer is not just how fast or strong one is or how many tackles you put in; that is only one element of the puzzle. The intelligence and creativity needed in a playmaker is also an essential part of a well-rounded soccer team. I realized that my most significant advantage would always be my in-depth understanding of the game of soccer—where to pass the ball, when to make a run, if the ball should be in the air or driven. I picked myself off the ground, and when that same defender came barreling towards me again, I was zoned in, oblivious to the noise around me. I chipped the ball into the open space right behind him, knowing my teammate would run into the space without even looking. From then on, I continued to hone my skills through intense practice to become the best playmaker I could be, working in conjunction with my faster and stronger teammates to become a well-balanced, unified team. Through chess and soccer, I have discovered that every piece in a puzzle has a purpose. This new perspective has enhanced my ability to stop, stand back, and analyze the whole picture in the many dimensions of my life. In my scientific studies, it was not enough to examine just one C. reinhardtii cell, but it was necessary to zoom out the microscope to capture all of the thousand cells to truly understand quorum sensing and its consequences. In my studies of music, it was not enough to listen to the melody of the finale of Beethoven’s 9th symphony, but one must realize that the true beauty of the composition lies in the whole orchestra handing off this simple melody to every instrument. All these facets—music, research, soccer, chess—are not only completed puzzles but also parts of a greater whole: my life. Every aspect of myself matters as much as the other. As high school comes to an end, the pieces on my board are set, and I only have success in mind. Your move.",

        "Text": "The first lesson I learned as a student pilot is that left and right don’t exist. Maybe driving on a highway or in a parking lot, left and right is precise enough to describe the location and movements of slow-moving bikers, pedestrians, and cars. But at 36,000 feet in the air in a steel tube hurdling almost 200 miles an hour? Left and right just don’t cut it. During one of my first flights in a small Cessna-182, my flight instructor ordered me to scan the horizon for approaching aircrafts. To my right, I caught a glimpse of one: another Cessna with maroon stripes, the sun’s reflection glinting off its windows. Gesturing vaguely to my two o’clock, I informed my flying instructor, “There’s a plane to the right.” “No, to your right. From his position, what direction does he see you?” From his angle, I was to his left. In that moment, I realized that perspective and precision of language is everything. The radio chirped: “Cessna One-Eight-Two Sandra, heading north to John Wayne Airport. Over.” I navigate using my compass’s north, east, south, and west directions because every pilot’s vantage point differs from each other both vertically and horizontally, creating opposite perspectives. My right was that pilot’s left. Through flying, I began to consider all points of view, regardless of my personal perspective. Perhaps it was my ability to scan the horizon to communicate a single story, uniting contrasting outlooks, that drew me to my love for journalism and the diverse melting pot that was my community. To me, journalism modernizes the ancient power of storytelling, filled with imperfect characters and intricate conflicts to which I am the narrator. As editor-in-chief for my school newspaper, The Wildcat’s Tale, I aim to share the uncensored perspective of all students and encourage my editorial groups to talk — and listen — to those with whom they disagree. Starting each newspaper edition with a socratic, round-table discussion, I ask the other journalists to pursue stories that answer the questions: why did this happen and where will it lead? Expanding beyond the perspectives of my classmates, I began writing articles for the Korea Daily, and later, the Los Angeles Times High School Insider. I schedule interviews with city council candidates, young and old voters, and mayors of my town, obtaining quotes and anecdotes to weave into my writing. My interviews with both Democratic and Republican voters have taught me to thoroughly report polarizing-opposite opinions through an unbiased lens. As a journalist, I realized I cannot presume the opinions of the reader, but instead simply provide them with the tools necessary to formulate their own conclusions. However, differences in perspective in my articles are not solely limited to politics. I found that in my suburban community, people love to read about the small-town hospitality of their own friends and neighbors. Quirky traditions, like our Fourth of July carnival clown and local elementary school’s Thanksgiving talent show, are equally as important to me as national headlines are. My favorite stories to publish are the ones taped onto fridges, proudly framed on the mom-and-pop downtown diner, or pinned into the corkboard in my teacher’s classroom. I discovered the size of my story does not matter, but the impact I leave on the reader does. In my time as both a student pilot and journalist, I grew to love these stories, the ones that showed me that living life with blinders, can not only be boring, but dangerous. Whether I was 36,000 feet in the air or on ground level, by flying and writing, I realized that the most interesting stories of life come straight from the people most different from me.",

        "Text": "I cannot dance. This is not something I often admit willingly; in fact, it is quite baffling to me how horribly incapable I am at performing even the most basic movements on command. My grandmother often describes it as “a tragedy” as she is forced to watch her grandchild absolutely butcher our country’s cultural dances, beautiful expressions of our unique West African roots turned into poor facsimiles by my robotic movements. And yet, year after year, I find myself taking the dance floor at my family’s events, seemingly unaware of my objective lack of skill. Eventually, my display proves to be so amazingly unbearable that I am removed from the floor and shown the correct movements over and over again until I am able to replicate them well enough to come back. Bizarrely, despite my previous declaration that I cannot dance, for the past three years, I have found myself performing an entire choreographed routine at my school’s yearly pep rallies. It is through looking back at these events that I realize that I have created a mischaracterization of my dancing abilities through my decisive first sentence. I can dance and am, in fact, very capable of doing so, but not when I act insularly. My ability to dance correlates directly with how willing I am to collaborate, the input and support of others turning the uncoordinated and unwieldy into the near-graceful. My attempts at dancing have led me to value community and collaboration greatly, and I find myself seeking and being drawn towards environments that will allow me to continue to develop both of these values as I learn and grow. Through my internship with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, I was exposed to and became fascinated by the collaborative spirit that lies at the heart of Johns Hopkins. The idea that one cannot discover or innovate when working alone was affirmed during my research, and I have come to see that mutual collaboration and community are integral aspects of Johns Hopkins’ unique culture. From the research initiatives that breach the boundaries between class levels, to the many organizations such as the Tutorial Project, relying on the shared initiatives of different students to directly make an impact on Baltimore and its many communities, and the distinctive access to especially interdisciplinary topics such as neuromorphic systems, I view that Johns Hopkins exemplifies the peak of collaborative achievement in education.

        "Text": "Whether I was blowing out candles, writing a letter to santa, or waiting for the clock to turn 11:11, my one wish growing up was not for something, but for someone. I wanted a sibling. I would always look to my friends and think how lucky they were to have brothers and sisters to play with, while I was stuck at home alone with my parents. However, these sentiments soon changed and my life was transformed, when my parents came home with my new sister, Mia. And while Mia was a furry, Lhasa Apso dog, rather than the human baby sister or brother I dreamed of, she helped me accept and even cherish my life as an only child. I came to realize, however, that it would take much longer for me, and much more than a dog, to accept the other ways I felt alone within my group of friends and my community as a whole. Living in a predominantly white town and attending a school with a population of about 75% white students has had a huge impact on the way I view my Filipino self. While my friends ate turkey and cheese sandwiches at lunch, I would secretly pick at the traditional adobo chicken my mom had sent me that day. I stood by as my classmates made jokes stereotyping and generalizing Asians into one category, even though I knew there were vast differences in our cultures. During social studies classes, I noticed that I learned more about the ancestry of my friends, rather than my own. Consequently, I began to accept the notion that my heritage was of less importance and something to be ashamed of. I masked the pungent aromas of the Filipino delicacies my immigrant parents made with pasta and hamburgers when my friends came over, I laughed off incidents when parents or teachers would mistake me for the only other Filipino girl in my grade, and I recognized that learning solely about European and East Asian history in world history classes was the norm. I started to believe that assimilation was the only pathway to acceptance, along with the only way I could feel less alone within my community. It was not until I entered high school that I realized how wrong I was. Although I did not encounter an increase in diversity in terms of ethnicity, I saw an increase in the spectrum of perspectives around me. Through electives, clubs, and activities, the student body I was met with since my freshman year was open-minded, as well as politically and culturally active and engaged, and I immediately joined in. At speech and debate tournaments, I talked with students from across the globe, while at discussions between the High School Democrats Club and Young Conservatives Club at my school, I enjoyed listening and being exposed to different viewpoints. Suddenly, I was no longer willing to feel defeated and instead began to feel confident in displaying my Filipino pride. I introduced my friends to an array of Filipino dishes from lumpia to toron, I asked my social studies teachers questions about the history and current state of the Philippines, and I no longer saw myself and my background as what differentiated me from others and caused my feelings of aloneness, but as something that I should embrace. I changed my narrative from “alone” to “unique,” and I strive to spread the message that being different can and should be the norm to my peers. I would not be who I am without my Filipino background, and although the community I live in is what previously made me feel alone, it is also what gave me the potential to learn, grow, and broadened my appreciation for what made me unique.

        "Text": "out my tough transition. But instead of an answer, Ms. McVaugh offered me to join a girls’ field hockey practice. I felt thrown off by the unusual opportunity at first, yet I quickly relished a warm rush of excitement surging through my veins as I imagined putting on field hockey cleats again. When I set foot on the turf the following day, however, my initial anxiety rejoined my exuberance. I felt more eyes turning towards me with each step I made. “Boys do not play field hockey,” I could hear the girls think. As I trailed behind the girls during the warm-up, the thought of quitting seemed more tempting with each second of silence that passed. But when the whistle blew and the ball was finally in play, I was surprised to see how quickly the gender barrier vanished. Where there was silence and separation at first, I could now see the shared fanaticism through our red faces and hear the emotion in our clamor. At the end of practice, I felt a burning glow of joy overtake my body as I caught my breath on the bench. In that moment, I gradually realized how I should not let obstacles, like gender boundaries in field hockey, hold me back from exploring new opportunities. Realizing the joy I had found in trying the unconventional, I took this experience to the soccer field to take on its new athletic challenges once again. Rather than agonizing over playing time or titles, I simply redirected my focus on the joy and beauty of the sport. Within days, I noticed the same atmosphere of sweat and screams from the turf take hold of the soccer field. Over time, this helped me take in feedback more readily, ask questions about tactics, and try out new skills. With each new improvement I made through this, I slowly began to grasp the value of my new approach to the sport. As a result, I decided to bring the same open, curious, and risk-taking mindset with me to the other opportunities that boarding school holds. In the classroom, I began asking deeper questions to fully comprehend new material. Back in the dorm, I turned the cultural differences between my peers into opportunities to learn from and contribute back to. From truly grasping nucleophile-electrophile reactions in organic chemistry to sharing Dutch ‘stroopwafels’ with my hall, such moments remind me of why I sacrificed my field hockey gear to go to Deerfield; even as my new mindset gradually led to the grades, friendships, and even athletic achievements I sought before, I realized that I value the exploration, growth and joy behind such successes far more. Now, before I put on my cleats, walk into the classroom or enter my dorm, I do not worry about the successes I might fail to reach or the obstacles that might hold me back. Rather, I pour my heart into such opportunities and take their experiences with me.",

        "Text": "Oreos. On the exterior, a firm chocolate crust; however, when opened, a creamy white center awaits. Unbeknownst to me, a social meaning awaited behind an Oreo that left a lingering poor taste in my mouth. From the seductive, powerful attacks within a tango melody to the upbeat, peppy nature of Top 40 hits, I find myself within a new story with each note. Ballroom and pop music, while vastly different styles, have been interconnected since I was a little girl listening to both Hans Zimmer’s ‘Discombobulate and One Direction’s Kiss You. In high school, when I shared my musical taste with my black peers, I received confused stares back. “Faith, that is the whitest thing. You are such an Oreo!” a friend exclaimed. I didn’t recognize the connection between two seemingly different commodities until I later learned that an Oreo means a black person who displays characteristics typically associated with white people, therefore betraying their black roots. I never saw ballroom and pop music belonging to a certain race, but the negatively charged implications behind ‘betraying’ introduced new guilty sensations. Should I embrace my musical interests and face social alienation from those who share my skin tone? Or set aside my so-called white core and conform to the expectations of an African-American woman that have been placed upon me? I didn’t cut music completely out of my life. Being a clarinet player in my band meant being exposed to various musical styles each day. During my freshman year, I decided to challenge myself and perform a solo for the county solo & ensemble festival. Lyrical Composition No. 6 was a piece for which I could play the notes, the rhythms, and everything else on the page. To me, that was all I needed to do, but my band director thought otherwise. “You’re great at playing the right note at the right time. But where is your interpretation? What can you do to add to this piece?” At first glance, all I saw were measures of black ink permanently etched into the sheet – resistant to change. How do I add to a composition that exudes such a definitive nature? Then at second glance, I looked below the measures. Beyond the notes, beyond the rhythms, I noticed white space – unblemished and waiting for me to create my own contribution. Once I stopped and determined what I wanted someone to feel from this composition, I picked up my pencil and wrote in crescendos, decrescendos, breath marks, and other musical markings that I felt needed to be included. I didn’t want to simply regurgitate the black ink, but rather take the audience on a dynamic journey that reaches a climactic precipice. This realization made the distinction between style and stereotype clear. Being categorized as an Oreo was jarring because the documented definition couldn’t simply be erased. Most stereotypes are never fully expunged because they are deeply ingrained in how society views certain races. While I cannot easily change the minds of the many, I can change the mind of my own. I am my own music maker. I will celebrate the intricacies of ballroom music and belt out a One Direction tune as a proud black woman. That is my style. That is my choice of expression. If allowed, stereotypes can snowball until I am completely consumed by my desire to become the black woman society expects. But I refuse to be held down by its grip because I decide my definition of the black experience. My musical interests are not a betrayal that isolates me from my roots, but rather a beautiful addition that enhances my ever-evolving character. Am I an Oreo? Yes, but by my own design. The creamy white center does not represent a betrayal, but rather a blank canvas patiently waiting for my own input. With pencil in hand, I will not hesitate to make my mark. ",

        "Text": "I could still hear her words, the words my teacher said as she handed me the packet, “This is a challenge. But I think you’re up for it.” I held the math packet in my hand. On the cover, the title ‘Mission Possible!’ screamed at me. I could feel my fingers tingling, and the goosebumps rolling up my arms. I stared at the black italicized letters of the title as I walked home. They seemed to stare back, alluding to the mysteries that lay underneath them. As soon as I got home, I ran to the top bunk where I slept, grabbed a pencil, and signed a mental contract with the packet: “I, Zerubabel, promise to prioritize you, put you above all else in my life, not rest, and not eat until all the problems that lay in your pages are solved.” I was a pretty dramatic 11-year-old. This is but one example of the many challenges I’ve faced throughout my life. My love for challenges and the tenacity with which I approach them was instilled in me through observing my family and through my own experiences. Ten years ago, my family and I packed our belongings, sold everything we had, and flew across the Atlantic to our new home in America. During our first year in Minnesota, we were faced with the omnipresent challenge of money. My sister, rather than having the comfort of her crib, was forced to share a bed with my mom and I. My dad was forced to sleep on a makeshift bed my mom made for him every night, using cushions from a torn and scratchy old sofa. My mom was forced to wake up early and stay up late working, at home, and her minimum wage job. My parents never complained. To them, this was just another stage of life, another challenge to overcome. They worked tirelessly-my mom providing stability by maintaining one job while my dad, the creative one, was always switching between multiple in his pursuit for better pay. With each day, the consequences of their hard work showed; one bed became two, the second bed split into a bunk, and within that little room, each of us had a bed to sleep on. I now reflect on this, and many other challenges my family and I have faced during our ten years in America. I realize that it is through observing how my parents never slowed down that I learned the value of perseverance, through watching my mom’s devotion to a single job that I learned the value of commitment, through my dad’s consistent job switches that I learned the value of ambition, and through observing my sisters willingness to live with less that I learned the value of sacrifice. Through my own experiences, I learned I can apply these values and overcome any challenge that comes my way. My 11-year-old self figured this out after a grueling two months of working on the packet, finishing with all the questions answered. Throughout my time in middle and high school, my value of ambition has led me to take the most challenging courses available at my school. In my community, my value of commitment has allowed me to serve at my church for the past five years. These learned values have molded me into the person I am today and will continue to guide me as I pursue my goals in life. It is because of these values and the way they were instilled in me that I have decided to pursue a career as a surgeon; I know it is through the guidance of these values and the people who first showed them to me that I will be able to achieve this goal.",

        "Text": "M7652-000. Or at least that's how my bike-tire-greased, highlight-yellow, heel-cap-ripping-at-the-seams Chuck-Taylors are supposed to be colored. Freshman year, I tried so hard to keep them that pristine, popular M7652-000 color. Time progressed, however, and dirt, guitar chords, and conversations eventually covered the canvas of the shoes. When I first moved to Houston in eighth grade, I tried to follow the status quo and keep my shoes white. But as various conflicting influences crept into my life--Liberal vs. Conservative; Portland, OR vs. Houston, TX; LCD Sound system vs. Ed Sheeran--I began to realize how important it is to listen to the other side and to maintain the confidence to pursue my passions while inspiring others to do the same. I needed to appreciate Houston's voice and learn from its stories as much as it needed to hear mine, and my shoes grew dirtier every day as each person's testimony helped solidify and expand my own. As I walk, one can first make out \"Cheyenne yo yo\" engulfing the right inner canvas, weaving through clasps and eventually boarding \"PORTLAND!!!\" I met Cheyenne through Freshman year volleyball and we were friends because I tried; I borrowed cowboy boots for football games, didn't discuss my quirky music, and washed my shoes. As I grew, however, it was our differences that brought us together. She forced me to see the other side, forced me to make my own conclusions without the influence of my background or parents. In Portland, opinions are liberally voiced, and it's similar in my community in Houston, except rather than an abundance of Lizzie Fletcher stickers it's \"Come and Take It\". When I moved, I was bombarded by a completely foreign culture. By sophomore year, however, I realized that compromising myself in order to fit in was a mistake. I began vocally expressing my sentiments towards the world to my friends as I learned from theirs. While I introduced my friends to thrift-shopping and wrote articles about more environmentally friendly methods of transportation, they took me to my first line-dance and helped me examine the other side of gun-control in `Agora Coffee House'. As I grew more comfortable with expressing my beliefs, I began heading projects to install a bike rack around campus and took to writing more iconoclastic political pieces in English class. My left shoe houses various meme references, chords from songs I have written, sketches of the latest NASA star cluster discoveries, practice lines of Italian greetings from when I was set on learning it, and \"Lorrie Lake Ln.\" in small cursive letters. Sandalwood, my friends and I call it--a late-night, post-fast food, teen-angst polluted lake. Sandalwood is the cosmos and the meaning of God and the Sisyphus-like emotions that we discuss there. I never knew that Mormons couldn't drink coffee or that Romanians gut an entire pig to feast on for all of winter. Their philosophies, although often dissonating from my own, taught me that it's often beneficial to disagree. When I was hurled into Texas, I was miserable when I didn't express myself within the Kinkaid-bubble. However, I quickly began to realize that I didn't have to like Ed Sheeran or keep my shoes M7652-000 to enjoy life. Learning to embrace and assess so many dissonating ideas has enabled to grow more into myself--it makes me more nonpartisan and has educated me on what it truly means to listen to the other side. Now, whether it's Texas or Oregon, Republican or Democrat, my life is a playlist of contradictions. In college, where everyone works on discovering \"who they are\" or what their place is in the world, I know I can provide not only diversity of thought, but can educate people through my own stories on how crucial it is to maintain an open-minded ideology towards the world and an individual's power to change it.",

        "Text": "On one hot night in a dark room at the heart of Boston, I became friends with 19,580 people in one single moment. We had all journeyed to the TD Garden from wherever we were in our lives to see Tom Petty perform. I knew his music because my mother had shared it with me. It meant something to her and it meant something to me. His music meant something different to every person in that room and all those meanings, all infinite number of them, wrapped around the music notes and existed in harmony on that July night. I had to close my eyes. It was as if I could hear the heartbeats of every person in that room, pulsing along with the rhythm of the music. By sharing his music, Tom Petty gave me a striking awareness of 19,580 people that live and feel alongside each other. Tom Petty will live as long as people feel. Lights flashing beyond my eyelids, I could feel what it was like to live more lives than just my own. Tom Petty's art described his life, but it has weaved its way into those of so many others. My own, my mother's then and when she was my age, and all the strangers around me who didn't seem so strange anymore. We all have to go through our own lives and our own challenges, but just because we have our own lessons to learn doesn't mean we are alone. I looked into the smiles of the crowd, the dancing arms and carefree yes, and realised we were all feeling something of our own. But we were feeling it all together. With the shared heart of others, I can travel vertically through time and horizontally through space. I long to make connections and there are no boundaries that limit how this can be done, not even time and not even space. Imagine trying to count how many people have ever been inspired by the Beatles! Music is an honesty that you embrace more than escape. I sit in front of my piano for hours, copying the rhythm of until it feels right. I'll never tire of hearing another tell me how they're feeling without using any words at all and letting it become part of me. You can't hide from your feelings when someone else is telling them to you. And so I have become a curator of feeling. I am always listening, collecting the art of others. I have stared at paintings until they stared back at me. I cry while I watch almost every film, sometimes just because the characters are nice to each other. I'm as moved by the narrative of my old American Girl Doll books as I am by Dickens. It's all swirls of feelings, of lessons from others that mirror those you need to learn yourself. Art embodies empathy and empathy has become too easy to lose touch with. Art is the same world seen from a different heart. I look at characters or creators and think, \"How did you become the way you are?\" I can look at others and think the same thing. And I have the chance the ask them. Tom Petty did not write \"Breakdown\" just for me. Hard Promises comforts more than just me. I cannot live life from just my own perspective. Art exists in everyone. I embrace my hour-long commute to school as a chance to start conversations through the life that flows from my speakers, using old tunes to understand the world through my neighbors as we talk of our favourite colours or the abstract nature of time. My dad doesn't seem so distant when we talk about our mutual love for The Band. This is how our moments are made. This is how we find the music that surrounds all of us, all in each other.",

        "Text": "My first dream job was to be a pickle truck driver. I saw it in my favorite book, Richard Scarry's \"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go,\" and for some reason, I was absolutely obsessed with the idea of driving a giant pickle. Much to the discontent of my younger sister, I insisted that my parents read us that book as many nights as possible so we could find goldbug, a small little golden bug, on every page. I would imagine the wonderful life I would have: being a pig driving a giant pickle truck across the country, chasing and finding goldbug. I then moved on to wanting to be a Lego Master. Then an architect. Then a surgeon. Then I discovered a real goldbug: gold nanoparticles that can reprogram macrophages to assist in killing tumors,produce clear images of them without sacrificing the subject, and heat them to obliteration. Suddenly the destination of my pickle was clear. I quickly became enveloped by the world of nanomedicine; I scoured articles about liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, targeting ligands, and self-assembling nanoparticles, all conquering cancer in some exotic way. Completely absorbed, I set out to find a mentor to dive even deeper into these topics. After several rejections, I was immensely grateful to receive an invitation to work alongside Dr. Sangeeta Ray at Johns Hopkins. In the lab, Dr. Ray encouraged a great amount of autonomy to design and implement my own procedures. I chose to attack a problem that affects the entire field of nanomedicine: nanoparticles consistently fail to translate from animal studies into clinical trials. Jumping off recent literature, I set out to see if a pre-dose of a common chemotherapeutic could enhance nanoparticle delivery in aggressive prostate cancer, creating three novel constructs based on three different linear polymers, each using fluorescent dye (although no gold, sorry goldbug!). Though using radioactive isotopes like Gallium and Yttrium would have been incredible, as a 17-year-old, I unfortunately wasn't allowed in the same room as these radioactive materials (even though I took a Geiger counter to a pair of shoes and found them to be slightly dangerous). I hadn't expected my hypothesis to work, as the research project would have ideally been led across two full years. Yet while there are still many optimizations and revisions to be done, I was thrilled to find -- with completely new nanoparticles that may one day mean future trials will use particles with the initials \"RK-1\" -- thatcyclophosphamide did indeed increase nanoparticle delivery to the tumor in a statistically significant way. A secondary, unexpected research project was living alone in Baltimore, a new city to me, surrounded by people much older than I. Even with moving frequently between hotels, AirBnB's, and students' apartments, I strangely reveled in the freedom I had to enjoy my surroundings and form new friendships with graduate school students from the lab. We explored The Inner Harbor at night, attended a concert together one weekend, and even got to watch the Orioles lose (to nobody's surprise). Ironically, it's through these new friendships I discovered something unexpected: what I truly love is sharing research. Whether in a presentation or in a casual conversation, making others interested in science is perhaps more exciting to me than the research itself. This solidified a new pursuit to angle my love for writing towards illuminating science in ways people can understand, adding value to a society that can certainly benefit from more scientific literacy. It seems fitting that my goals are still transforming: in Scarry's book, there is not just one goldbug, there is one on every page. With each new experience, I'm learning that it isn't the goldbug itself, but rather the act of searching for the goldbugs that will encourage, shape, and refine my ever-evolving passions. Regardless of the goldbug I seek -- I know my pickle truck has just begun its journey.",

        "Text": "On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I sit in soil pulling crab grass and borage. I've been a farmer since sophomore year. The farm--managed by my school--is a one-acre plot more accurately described as a garden with chickens. My task today is to pick cherry tomatoes, most of which have ripened. I grab a tray from the shed and walk across pathways to the vine. I created these pathways during junior year, shoveling large heaps of wood-chips into a wheelbarrow, then raking these chips onto the pathways between beds. Our two tomato vines stand three feet tall and extend horizontally at least six feet; they are heavy with small red and orange glistening spheres. I fall into a rhythm, plucking and setting tomatoes in the container, eating several here and there. I recall when I was six, my Mom would send my twin brother and me to the backyard to weed dandelions. We would get distracted and play with our dog or climb the dogwood tree. I recall the awe I felt last week when I harvested a giant sunflower, discovering at least ten potatoes growing in its roots, or when I found a sweet potato the size of a football. I had planted the seed potato pieces last year. I think about jalapenos, how scratches on their skin indicate spiciness level. The satisfaction I felt the first time I ate a piece of food I grew at the farm, a raw green-bean. The pleasure I feel knowing friends and teachers also eat the food I grow; we donate the farm's produce to our school's dining hall and sell it at the weekly farmer's market in the parking lot. After farm, I will work a shift at the Farmer's Market. I will sit, perhaps eating Thai iced-tea-flavored ice cream from another stand, ready to explain where the farm is located, who works it, what we do with unsold food, and, finally, whether the price for a head of lettuce is negotiable (it is). Sometimes, I remember farmers I met during an exchange trip to Yangshuo, China, who were selling pomelos and bamboo shoots. I think about how to me, the difference between one-versus-two dollars for pomelos seems miniscule, but for those farmers, it means a lot. They rely solely on farming to feed their families; I farm for the pleasure of learning what they do out of necessity. As I carry my share of tomatoes to the shed - tomatoes I nurtured from seeds into sprouts into fruits – I contemplate how much farm has done for me. I can't sit down to a meal without imagining the plants on my plate as seeds and then sprouts, without wondering about the many hands that brought them to my table. Education, to me, means understanding the hidden processes that make up daily life. Playing with the farm chickens - Pablo, Claude, Vincent, Leonardo - and knowing how the coating around an egg works as a natural preservative makes me appreciate my omelet a tad more. Watching weeds that I pulled from various beds slowly decompose into fertilizer in the compost pile makes me consider the roles carbon and nitrogen cycles play in that process. Although I initially joined farm because I wanted to try something new, I quickly found that the work offers a balance with the intellectual work of the rest of my day. The farm connects education with experience; teaching me to see the application of my classroom learning in a real setting. Being able to see the relevance of what I am studying piques my curiosity. I aspire to maintain this connection between education and experience throughout my life, and will always find ways to contribute to my community, locally or globally. I will look for soil to cultivate, using my learning to see and understand more of the world, whether it be the natural environment or the way people live.",

A Starbucks barista hands me my drink with a hand adorned by a small music note. Where I work, a customer hands me her credit card wearing a permanent flower bracelet. Every day, I am on a scavenger hunt to find women with this kind of permanent art. I'm intrigued by the quotes, dates, symbols, and abstract shapes I see on people that I interact with daily. I've started to ask them questions, an informal interview, as an excuse to talk with these diverse women whose individuality continually inspires me. You can't usually ask the sorts of questions I have been asking and have the sorts of conversations I have been having, so I've created this project to make these kinds of encounters a bit more possible and acceptable. There is no school assignment, no teacher to give me a grade, and no deadline. I don't have a concrete outcome in mind besides talking with a mix of interesting women with interesting tattoos. So far I've conducted fifteen interviews with a range of women from my hometown to Hawaii, teenagers to senior citizens, teachers to spiritual healers. The same set of questions has prompted interviews lasting less than twenty minutes and over two hours. I'm being told stories about deaths of a parent, struggles with cancer, coming out experiences, sexual assaults, and mental illnesses. All of these things that may be taboo in today's society, these women are quite literally wearing on their sleeves. I'm eager to continue these interviews in college and use all of the material I've gathered to show the world the strength and creativity of these wonderful women I've encountered. I want to explore the art and stories behind the permanent transformations of personal landscapes. I attempt this by asking questions about why they decided to get their tattoos, how they were received in the workplace, the reactions from family and friends, and the tattoo's impact on their own femininity. Through these simple questions, I happened upon much greater lessons regarding human interaction, diversity, and connectedness. In my first interview, a local businesswoman told me about her rocky relationship with her mother, her struggles with mental illness, and her friend in jail, within 45 minutes of meeting her and in the middle of a busy Starbucks. An artist educator I worked with told me that getting a tattoo \"was like claiming a part of yourself and making it more visible and unavoidable.\" A model/homeopath said that having a tattoo is like \"giving people a little clue about you.\" A psychologist shared how she wishes that she could turn her tattoos \"on or off like a light switch to match different outfits and occasions.\" I've realized that tattoos show the complex relationship between the personal and the public (and how funny that can be when a Matisse cutout is thought to be phallic, or how a social worker's abstract doodle is interpreted as a tsunami of sticks, alien spaceship, and a billion other things by the children she works with). I've learned so much about the art of storytelling and storytelling through art. I've strengthened relationships with people that had conventional roles in my life and created friendships with some unconventional characters. Most importantly, I've realized that with the willingness to explore a topic and the willingness to accept not knowing where it will go, an idea can become a substantive reality.",

        "Text": "“Biogeochemical. It's a word, I promise!” There are shrieks and shouts in protest and support. Unacceptable insults are thrown, degrees and qualifications are questioned, I think even a piece of my grandmother's famously flakey parantha whizzes past my ear. Everyone is too lazy to take out a dictionary (or even their phones) to look it up, so we just hash it out. And then, I am crowned the victor, a true success in the Merchant household. But it is fleeting, as the small, glossy, plastic tiles, perfectly connected to form my winning word, are snatched out from under me and thrown in a pile with all the disgraced, “unwinning” tiles as we mix for our next game of Bananagrams. It's a similar donnybrook, this time ending with my father arguing that it is okay to use “Rambo” as a word (it totally is not). Words and communicating have always been of tremendous importance in my life: from silly games like Bananagrams and our road-trip favorite “word game,” to stunted communication between opposing grandparents, each speaking a different Indian language; from trying to understand the cheesemonger behind the counter with a deep southern drawl (I just want some Camembert!), to shaping a script to make people laugh. Words are moving and changing; they have influence and substance. Words, as I like them, create powerful flavor combinations in a recipe or (hopefully) powerful guffaws from a stand-up joke. They make people laugh with unexpected storylines at an improv show and make people cry with mouthwatering descriptions of crisp green beans lathered with potently salty and delightfully creamy fish sauce vinaigrette at Girl and the Goat. Words create everything I love (except maybe my dog and my mom, but you know, the ideas). The thought that something this small, a word, can combine to create a huge concept, just like each small reaction that makes up different biogeochemical cycles (it's a stretch, I know), is truly amazing. After those aggressive games, my family is quickly able to, in the words of a fellow Nashvillian, “shake it off.” We gather around bowls of my grandmother's steaming rice and cumin-spiced chicken (food is always, always at the center of it), and enjoy. By the end of the meal, our words have changed, changed from the belligerent razzle dazzle of moments before to fart jokes and grandparental concern over the state of our bowels.",

        "Text": "“You’re such a hipster.” It’s a phrase heard everyday in school hallways across America, and its usage often operates as a conundrum that obscures teenagers’ perceptions of themselves and who they want to be. I, in turn, have struggled immensely with the paradoxical use of this label. Since the onset of my tween years and perhaps even before that, I have constantly carried with me an insistent urge for nonconformity; it has never sat well with me to be like everyone else. Throughout my middle school years, this natural instinct of mine manifested itself in many different ways: jeans tucked into knee-high socks, anything from punk to Harlem renaissance jazz bellowing from my headphones, Palahniuk novels peeking out of my backpack. As my identity shifted, my career as a social renegade flourished, and I found in myself a certain pride in being different and a passion for seeking out eccentric new ways to express myself. With the realization of my newfound passion, my nonconformist qualities were locked in, and I began high school without the usual freshman trepidation about getting labeled or branded. Thereby, I continued my habitual antics, rebelling against the social norm and doing what I could to think freely. In doing so, however, I encountered a particular subculture defined by certain fashion trends and, to some extent, genres of music. This subculture was and still is often associated with the term “hipster” and regarded as having a correspondence with the “hipster lifestyle.” Moreover, so-called “hipsters” are known to have particularly poignant tendencies towards nonconformity. Thus, my rise to the hipster ideal began. I was enamored with various aspects of this subculture, so I enthusiastically donned a beanie and cardigan and crammed every Bon Iver and The Smiths album I could find on to my iPod. Such new developments in my identity perfectly suited my singularity as a nonconformist; no one I knew had adopted this flair. Admittedly, my new garb was somewhat funky, and thus the new look evoked, in both positive and negative renditions, choruses of “You’re such a hipster!” The attention was extraordinarily gratifying, and I consequently plunged into obsession with my new label, consumed in an effort to sustain my “hipster” reputation. Much of my mental vitality was spent on keeping my appearance and status up to a sufficiently “hipster” standard. The questions I asked myself about who I wanted to be quickly evolved into “How can I fit the ideal?” and “How can I conform?” Herein lies the continual paradox for people who identify themselves as “hipsters” and the contradiction that brought me much confusion and uncertainty for parts of my high school career: implicit in the definition of the term “hipster” is the prominence of nonconformity in all aspects of a “hipster’s” lifestyle. Individualist ideals permeate his clothes, his music, his social behavior, even his politics. Simultaneously, however, one who seeks to identify himself and be identified by others as a “hipster” undoubtably strives to conform to the “hipster” construct; he tries to fit himself inside an inflexible “hipster” box. Nevertheless, as with most paradoxes, the problem at hand does not imply a real contradiction. I found the solution after many months of personal struggle with my own identity. It is not that there is something inherently wrong with the qualities of a “hipster.” I have come to understand that a label such as “hipster” must never precede my own actual characteristics, and I can never let such a notion inform my identity by itself. Before I ever begin to set words to my character, I have to figure out who I am free from outside influence. The adjectives come much later.",

        "Text": "I had never broken into a car before. We were in Laredo, having just finished our first day at a Habitat for Humanity work site. The Hotchkiss volunteers had already left, off to enjoy some Texas BBQ, leaving me behind with the college kids to clean up. Not until we were stranded did we realize we were locked out of the van. Someone picked a coat hanger out of the dumpster, handed it to me, and took a few steps back. \"Can you do that thing with a coat hanger to unlock it?\" \"Why me?\" I thought. More out of amusement than optimism, I gave it a try. I slid the hanger into the window's seal like I'd seen on crime shows, and spent a few minutes jiggling the apparatus around the inside of the frame. Suddenly, two things simultaneously clicked. One was the lock on the door. (I actually succeeded in springing it.) The other was the realization that I'd been in this type of situation before. In fact, I'd been born into this type of situation. My upbringing has numbed me to unpredictability and chaos. With a family of seven, my home was loud, messy, and spottily supervised. My siblings arguing, the dog barking, the phone ringing—all meant my house was functioning normally. My Dad, a retired Navy pilot, was away half the time. When he was home, he had a parenting style something like a drill sergeant. At the age of nine, I learned how to clear burning oil from the surface of water. My Dad considered this a critical life skill—you know, in case my aircraft carrier should ever get torpedoed. \"The water's on fire! Clear a hole!\" he shouted, tossing me in the lake without warning. While I'm still unconvinced about that particular lesson's practicality, my Dad's overarching message is unequivocally true: much of life is unexpected, and you have to deal with the twists and turns. Living in my family, days rarely unfolded as planned. A bit overlooked, a little pushed around, I learned to roll with reality, negotiate a quick deal, and give the improbable a try. I don't sweat the small stuff, and I definitely don't expect perfect fairness. So what if our dining room table only has six chairs for seven people? Someone learns the importance of punctuality every night. But more than punctuality and a special affinity for musical chairs, my family life has taught me to thrive in situations over which I have no power. Growing up, I never controlled my older siblings, but I learned how to thwart their attempts to control me. I forged alliances, and realigned them as necessary. Sometimes, I was the poor, defenseless little brother; sometimes I was the omniscient elder. Different things to different people, as the situation demanded. I learned to adapt. Back then, these techniques were merely reactions undertaken to ensure my survival. But one day this fall, Dr. Hicks, our Head of School, asked me a question that he hoped all seniors would reflect on throughout the year: \"How can I participate in a thing I do not govern, in the company of people I did not choose?\" The question caught me off guard, much like the question posed to me in Laredo. Then, I realized I knew the answer. I knew why the coat hanger had been handed to me. Growing up as the middle child in my family, I was a vital participant in a thing I did not govern, in the company of people I did not choose. It's family. It's society. And often, it's chaos. You participate by letting go of the small stuff, not expecting order and perfection, and facing the unexpected with confidence, optimism, and preparedness. My family experience taught me to face a serendipitous world with confidence.",

        "Text": "I have a fetish for writing. I’m not talking about crafting prose or verses, or even sentences out of words. But simply constructing letters and characters from strokes of ink gives me immense satisfaction. It’s not quite calligraphy, as I don’t use calligraphic pens or Chinese writing brushes; I prefer it simple, spontaneous, and subconscious. I often find myself crafting characters in the margins of notebooks with a fifty-cent pencil, or tracing letters out of thin air with anything from chopsticks to fingertips. The art of handwriting is a relic in the information era. Why write when one can type? Perhaps the Chinese had an answer before the advent of keyboards. “One’s handwriting,” said the ancient Chinese, “is a painting of one’s mind.” After all, when I practice my handwriting, I am crafting characters. My character. I particularly enjoy meticulously designing a character, stroke by stroke, and eventually building up, letter by letter, to a quote person­alized in my own voice. Every movement of the pen and every drop­let of ink all lead to something profound, as if the arches of every \"m\" are doorways to revelations. After all, characters are the build­ing blocks of language, and language is the only vehicle through which knowledge unfolds. Thus, in a way, these letters under my pen are themselves representations of knowledge, and the delicate beauty of every letter proves, visually, the intrinsic beauty of know­ing. I suppose handwriting reminds me of my conviction in this vi­sual manner: through learning answers are found, lives enriched, and societies bettered. Moreover, perhaps this strange passion in polishing every single character of a word delineates my dedication to learning, testifies my zeal for my conviction, and sketches a crucial stroke of my character. \"We--must--know ... \" the mathematician David Hilbert's voice echoes in resolute cursive at the tip of my pen, as he, addressing German scientists in 1930, propounds the goal of modern intellectu­als. My pen firmly nods in agreement with Hilbert, while my mind again fumbles for the path to knowledge. The versatility of handwriting enthralls me. The Chinese devel­oped many styles -- called hands -- of writing. Fittingly, each hand seems to parallel one of my many academic interests. Characters of the Regular Hand (kai shu), a legible script, serve me well during many long hours when I scratch my head and try to prove a mathematical statement rigorously, as the legibility illuminates my logic on paper. Words of the Running Hand (xing shu), a semi-cursive script, are like the passionate words that I speak before a committee of Model United Nations delegates, propounding a decisive course of action: the words, both spoken and written, are swift and coherent but resolute and emphatic. And strokes of the Cursive Hand (cao shu) resemble those sudden artistic sparks when I deliver a line on stage: free spontaneous, but emphatic syllables travel through the lights like rivers of ink flowing on the page. Yet the fact that the three distinctive hands cooperate so seamlessly, fusing together the glorious culture of writing, is perhaps a fable of learning, a testament that the many talents of the Renaissance Man could all be worthwhile for enriching human society. Such is my methodology: just like I organize my different hands into a neat personal style with my fetish for writing, I can unify my broad interests with my passion for learning. “...We -- will -- know!” Hilbert finishes his adage, as I frantically slice an exclamation mark as the final stroke of this painting of my mind. I must know: for knowing, like well-crafted letters, has an inherent beauty and an intrinsic value. I will know: for my versatile interests in academics will flow like my versatile styles of writing. I must know and I will know: for my fetish for writing is a fetish for learning.",

        "Text": "When I failed math in my sophomore year of high school, a bitter dispute engulfed my household -- “Nicolas Yan vs. Mathematics.” I was the plaintiff, appearing pro se, while my father represented the defendant (inanimate as it was). My brother and sister constituted a rather understaffed jury, and my mother presided over the case as judge. In a frightening departure from racial stereotype, I charged Mathematics with the capital offences of being “too difficult” and “irrelevant to my aspirations,” citing my recent shortcomings in the subject as evi. dence. My father entered a not guilty plea on the defendant's behalf, for he had always harbored hopes that I would follow in his entrepreneurial footsteps -- and who ever heard of a businessman who wasn't an accomplished mathematician? He argued that because I had fallen sick before my examination and had been unable to sit one of the papers, it would be a travesty of justice to blame my “Ungraded” mark on his client. The judge nodded sagely. With heartrending pathos, I recalled how I had studied A-Level Mathematics with calculus a year before the rest of my cohort, bravely grappling with such perverse concepts as the poisson distribution to no avail. I decried the subject's lack of real-life utility and lamented my inability to reconcile further effort with any plausible success; so that to persist with Mathematics would be a Sisyphean endeavor. Since I had no interest in becoming the entrepreneur that my father envisioned, I petitioned the court for academic refuge in the humanities. The members of the jury exchanged sympathetic glances and put their heads together to deliberate. In hushed tones, they weighed the particulars of the case. Then, my sister announced their unanimous decision with magisterial gravity: \"Nicolas shouldn't have to do math if he doesn't want to!\" I was ecstatic; my father distraught. With a bang of her metaphorical gavel, the judge sentenced the defendant to \"Death by Omission\"-- and so I chose my subjects for 11th Grade sans Mathematics. To my father's disappointment, a future in business for me now seemed implausible. Over the next year, however, new evidence that threw the court's initial verdict into question surfaced. Languishing on death row, Mathematics exercised its right to appeal, and so our quasi-court reconvened in the living room. My father reiterated his client's innocence, maintaining that Mathematics was neither \"irrelevant\" nor \"too difficult.\" He proudly recounted how just two months earlier, when my friends had convinced me to join them in creating a business case competition for high school students (clerical note: the loftily-titled New Zealand Secondary Schools Case Competition), I stood in front of the Board of a company and successfully pitched them to sponsor us-- was this not evidence that l could succeed in business? I think I saw a tear roll down his cheek as he implored me to give Mathematics another chance. I considered the truth of his words. While writing a real-world business case for NZSSCC, l had been struck by how mathematical processes actually made sense when deployed in a practical context, and how numbers could tell a story just as vividly as words can. By reviewing business models and comparing financial projections to actual returns, one can read a company's story and identify areas of potential growth; whether the company then took advantage of these opportunities determined its success. It wasn't that my role in organizing NZSSCC had magically taught me to embrace all things mathematical or commercial -- I was still the same person -- but I recognized that no intellectual constraints prevented me from succeeding in Mathematics; I needed only the courage to seize an opportunity for personal growth. I stood up and addressed my family: “I’ll do it.” Then, without waiting for the court’s final verdict, I crossed the room to embrace my father: and the rest, as they (seldom) say, was Mathematics.",

        "Text": "I learned the definition of cancer at the age of fourteen. I was taking my chapter 7 biology test when I came upon the last question, “What is cancer?”, to which I answered: “The abnormal, unrestricted growth of cells.” After handing in the test, I moved on to chapter 8, oblivious then to how earth-shattering such a disease could be. I learned the meaning of cancer two years later. A girl named Kiersten came into my family by way of my oldest brother who had fallen in love with her. I distinctly recall her hair catching the sea breeze as she walked with us along the Jersey shore, a blonde wave in my surrounding family's sea of brunette. Physically, she may have been different, but she redefined what family meant to me. She attended my concerts, went to my award ceremonies, and helped me study for tests. Whenever I needed support, she was there. Little did I know that our roles would be reversed, forever changing my outlook on life. Kiersten was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of 22. Tears and hair fell alike after each of her 20 rounds of chemotherapy as we feared the worst. It was an unbearable tragedy watching someone so vivacious skirt the line between life and death. Her cancer was later classified as refractory, or resistant to treatment. Frustration and despair flooded my mind as I heard this news. And so I prayed. In what universe did this dynamic make any sense? I prayed to God and to even her cancer itself to just leave her alone. Eventually, Kiersten was able to leave the hospital to stay for six weeks at my home. My family and I transformed the house into an antimicrobial sanctuary, protecting Kiersten from any outside illness. I watched TV with her, baked cookies for her, and observed her persistence as she regained strength and achieved remission. We beat biology, time, and death, all at the same time, with cookies, TV, and friendship. Yet I was so concerned with helping Kiersten that I had not realized how she helped me during her battle with cancer. I had been so used to solving my problems intellectually that when it came time to emotionally support someone, I was afraid. I could define cancer, but what do I say to someone with it? There were days where I did not think I could be optimistic in the face of such adversity. But the beauty that resulted from sympathizing as opposed to analyzing and putting aside my own worries and troubles for someone else was an enormous epiphany for me. My problems dissipated into thin air the moment I came home and dropped my books and bags to talk with Kiersten. The more I talked, laughed, smiled, and shared memories with her, the more I began to realize all that she taught me. She influenced me in the fact that she demonstrated the power of loyalty, companionship, and optimism in the face of desperate, life-threatening situations. She showed me the importance of loving to live and living to love. Most of all, she gave me the insight necessary to fully help others not just with intellect and preparation, but with solidarity and compassion. In this way, I became able to help myself and others with not only my brain, but with my heart. And that, in the words of Robert Frost, “has made all the difference.”",

It was my turn to take the shovel, but I felt too ashamed to dutifully send her off when I had not properly said goodbye. I refused to throw dirt on her. I refused to let go of my grandmother, to accept a death I had not seen coming, to believe that an illness could not only interrupt, but steal a beloved life. When my parents finally revealed to me that my grandmother had been battling liver cancer, I was twelve and I was angry--mostly with myself. They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the complex and morose concept of death. However, when the end inevitably arrived, I wasn’t trying to comprehend what dying was; I was trying to understand how I had been able to abandon my sick grandmother in favor of playing with friends and watching TV. Hurt that my parents had deceived me and resentful of my own oblivion, I committed myself to preventing such blindness from resurfacing. I became desperately devoted to my education because I saw knowledge as the key to freeing myself from the chains of ignorance. While learning about cancer in school I promised myself that I would memorize every fact and absorb every detail in textbooks and online medical journals. And as I began to consider my future, I realized that what I learned in school would allow me to silence that which had silenced my grandmother. However, I was focused not with learning itself, but with good grades and high test scores. I started to believe that academic perfection would be the only way to redeem myself in her eyes--to make up for what I had not done as a granddaughter. However, a simple walk on a hiking trail behind my house made me open my own eyes to the truth. Over the years, everything--even honoring my grandmother--had become second to school and grades. As my shoes humbly tapped against the Earth, the towering trees blackened by the forest fire a few years ago, the faintly colorful pebbles embedded in the sidewalk, and the wispy white clouds hanging in the sky reminded me of my small though nonetheless significant part in a larger whole that is humankind and this Earth. Before I could resolve my guilt, I had to broaden my perspective of the world as well as my responsibilities to my fellow humans. Volunteering at a cancer treatment center has helped me discover my path. When I see patients trapped in not only the hospital but also a moment in time by their diseases, I talk to them. For six hours a day, three times a week, Ivana is surrounded by IV stands, empty walls, and busy nurses that quietly yet constantly remind her of her breast cancer. Her face is pale and tired, yet kind--not unlike my grandmother’s. I need only to smile and say hello to see her brighten up as life returns to her face. Upon our first meeting, she opened up about her two sons, her hometown, and her knitting group--no mention of her disease. Without even standing up, the three of us—Ivana, me, and my grandmother--had taken a walk together. Cancer, as powerful and invincible as it may seem, is a mere fraction of a person’s life. It’s easy to forget when one’s mind and body are so weak and vulnerable. I want to be there as an oncologist to remind them to take a walk once in a while, to remember that there’s so much more to life than a disease. While I physically treat their cancer, I want to lend patients emotional support and mental strength to escape the interruption and continue living. Through my work, I can accept the shovel without burying my grandmother’s memory.",

        "Text": "Every Saturday morning, I’d awaken to the smell of crushed garlic and piquant pepper. I would stumble into the kitchen to find my grandma squatting over a large silver bowl, mixing fat lips of fresh cabbages with garlic, salt, and red pepper. That was how the delectable Korean dish, kimchi, was born every weekend at my home. My grandma’s specialty always dominated the dinner table as kimchi filled every plate. And like my grandma who had always been living with us, it seemed as though the luscious smell of garlic would never leave our home. But even the prided recipe was defenseless against the ravages of Alzheimer’s that inflicted my grandma’s mind. Dementia slowly fed on her memories until she became as blank as a brand-new notebook. The ritualistic rigor of Saturday mornings came to a pause, and during dinner, the artificial taste of vacuum-packaged factory kimchi only emphasized the absence of the family tradition. I would look at her and ask, “Grandma, what’s my name?” But she would stare back at me with a clueless expression. Within a year of diagnosis, she lived with us like a total stranger. One day, my mom brought home fresh cabbages and red pepper sauce. She brought out the old silver bowl and poured out the cabbages, smothering them with garlic and salt and pepper. The familiar tangy smell tingled my nose. Gingerly, my grandma stood up from the couch in the living room, and as if lured by the smell, sat by the silver bowl and dug her hands into the spiced cabbages. As her bony hands shredded the green lips, a look of determination grew on her face. Though her withered hands no longer displayed the swiftness and precision they once did, her face showed the aged rigor of a professional. For the first time in years, the smell of garlic filled the air and the rattling of the silver bowl resonated throughout the house. That night, we ate kimchi. It wasn’t perfect; the cabbages were clumsily cut and the garlic was a little too strong. But kimchi had never tasted better. I still remember my grandma putting a piece in my mouth and saying, “Here, Dong Jin. Try it, my boy.” Seeing grandma again this summer, that moment of clarity seemed ephemeral. Her disheveled hair and expressionless face told of the aggressive development of her illness. But holding her hands, looking into her eyes, I could still smell that garlic. The moments of Saturday mornings remain ingrained in my mind. Grandma was an artist who painted the cabbages with strokes of red pepper. Like the sweet taste of kimchi, I hope to capture those memories in my keystrokes as I type away these words. A piece of writing is more than just a piece of writing. It evokes. It inspires. It captures what time takes away. My grandma used to say: “Tigers leave furs when they die, humans leave their names.” Her legacy was the smell of garlic that lingered around my house. Mine will be these words.",

        "Text": "When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience. At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place. It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language. It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered. In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them. Interestingly, after studying foreign languages, I was further intrigued by my native tongue. Through my love of books and fascination with developing a sesquipedalian lexicon (learning big words), I began to expand my English vocabulary. Studying the definitions prompted me to inquire about their origins, and suddenly I wanted to know all about etymology, the history of words. My freshman year I took a world history class and my love for history grew exponentially. To me, history is like a great novel, and it is especially fascinating because it took place in my own world. But the best dimension that language brought to my life is interpersonal connection. When I speak with people in their native language, I find I can connect with them on a more intimate level. I’ve connected with people in the most unlikely places, finding a Bulgarian painter to use my few Bulgarian words with in the streets of Paris, striking up a conversation in Spanish with an Indian woman who used to work at the Argentinian embassy in Mumbai, and surprising a library worker by asking her a question in her native Mandarin. I want to study foreign language and linguistics in college because, in short, it is something that I know I will use and develop for the rest of my life. I will never stop traveling, so attaining fluency in foreign languages will only benefit me. In the future, I hope to use these skills as the foundation of my work, whether it is in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation. I think of my journey as best expressed through a Chinese proverb that my teacher taught me, “I am like a chicken eating at a mountain of rice.” Each grain is another word for me to learn as I strive to satisfy my unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Today, I still have the travel bug, and now, it seems, I am addicted to language too.",

        "Text": "This was written for a Common App college application essay prompt that no longer exists, which read: Evaluate a significant experience, risk, achievement, ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you. Smeared blood, shredded feathers. Clearly, the bird was dead. But wait, the slight fluctuation of its chest, the slow blinking of its shiny black eyes. No, it was alive. I had been typing an English essay when I heard my cat's loud meows and the flutter of wings. I had turned slightly at the noise and had found the barely breathing bird in front of me. The shock came first. Mind racing, heart beating faster, blood draining from my face. I instinctively reached out my hand to hold it, like a long-lost keepsake from my youth. But then I remembered that birds had life, flesh, blood. Death. Dare I say it out loud? Here, in my own home? Within seconds, my reflexes kicked in. Get over the shock. Gloves, napkins, towels. Band-aid? How does one heal a bird? I rummaged through the house, keeping a wary eye on my cat. Donning yellow rubber gloves, I tentatively picked up the bird. Never mind the cat's hissing and protesting scratches, you need to save the bird. You need to ease its pain. But my mind was blank. I stroked the bird with a paper towel to clear away the blood, see the wound. The wings were crumpled, the feet mangled. A large gash extended close to its jugular rendering its breathing shallow, unsteady. The rising and falling of its small breast slowed. Was the bird dying? No, please, not yet. Why was this feeling so familiar, so tangible? Oh. Yes. The long drive, the green hills, the white church, the funeral. The Chinese mass, the resounding amens, the flower arrangements. Me, crying silently, huddled in the corner. The Hsieh family huddled around the casket. Apologies. So many apologies. Finally, the body lowered to rest. The body. Kari Hsieh. Still familiar, still tangible. Hugging Mrs. Hsieh, I was a ghost, a statue. My brain and my body competed. Emotion wrestled with fact. Kari Hsieh, aged 17, my friend of four years, had died in the Chatsworth Metrolink Crash on Sep. 12, 2008. Kari was dead, I thought. Dead. But I could still save the bird. My frantic actions heightened my senses, mobilized my spirit. Cupping the bird, I ran outside, hoping the cool air outdoors would suture every wound, cause the bird to miraculously fly away. Yet there lay the bird in my hands, still gasping, still dying. Bird, human, human, bird. What was the difference? Both were the same. Mortal. But couldn't I do something? Hold the bird longer, de-claw the cat? I wanted to go to my bedroom, confine myself to tears, replay my memories, never come out. The bird's warmth faded away. Its heartbeat slowed along with its breath. For a long time, I stared thoughtlessly at it, so still in my hands. Slowly, I dug a small hole in the black earth. As it disappeared under handfuls of dirt, my own heart grew stronger, my own breath more steady. The wind, the sky, the dampness of the soil on my hands whispered to me, “The bird is dead. Kari has passed. But you are alive.” My breath, my heartbeat, my sweat sighed back, “I am alive. I am alive. I am alive.”",

        "Text": "Bowing down to the porcelain god, I emptied the contents of my stomach. Foaming at the mouth, I was ready to pass out. My body couldn’t stop shaking as I gasped for air, and the room started spinning. Ten minutes prior, I had been eating dinner with my family at a Chinese restaurant, drinking chicken-feet soup. My mom had specifically asked the waitress if there were peanuts in it, because when I was two we found out that I am deathly allergic to them. When the waitress replied no, I went for it. Suddenly I started scratching my neck, feeling the hives that had started to form. I rushed to the restroom to throw up because my throat was itchy and I felt a weight on my chest. I was experiencing anaphylactic shock, which prevented me from taking anything but shallow breaths. I was fighting the one thing that is meant to protect me and keep me alive – my own body. At five years old, I couldn’t comprehend what had happened. All I knew was that I felt sick, and I was waiting for my mom to give me something to make it better. I thought my parents were superheroes; surely they would be able to make well again. But I became scared when I heard the fear in their voices as they rushed me to the ER. After that incident, I began to fear. I became scared of death, eating, and even my own body. As I grew older, I became paranoid about checking food labels and I avoided eating if I didn’t know what was in the food. I knew what could happen if I ate one wrong thing, and I wasn’t willing to risk it for a snack. Ultimately, that fear turned into resentment; I resented my body for making me an outsider. In the years that followed, this experience and my regular visits to my allergy specialist inspired me to become an allergy specialist. Even though I was probably only ten at the time, I wanted to find a way to help kids like me. I wanted to find a solution so that nobody would have to feel the way I did; nobody deserved to feel that pain, fear, and resentment. As I learned more about the medical world, I became more fascinated with the body’s immune responses, specifically, how a body reacts to allergens. This past summer, I took a month-long course on human immunology at Stanford University. I learned about the different mechanisms and cells that our bodies use in order to fight off pathogens. My desire to major in biology in college has been stimulated by my fascination with the human body, its processes, and the desire to find a way to help people with allergies. I hope that one day I can find a way to stop allergic reactions or at least lessen the symptoms, so that children and adults don’t have to feel the same fear and bitterness that I felt.",

        "Text": "When I was 16, I lived with the Watkins family in Wichita, Kansas. Mrs. Watkins was the coordinator of the foreign exchange student program I was enrolled in. She had a nine year old son named Cody. I would babysit Cody every day after school for at least two to three hours. We would play Scrabble or he would read to me from Charlotte’s Web or The Ugly Duckling. He would talk a lot about his friends and school life, and I would listen to him and ask him the meanings of certain words. He was my first friend in the New World. My second family was the Martinez family, who were friends of the Watkins’s. The host dad Michael was a high school English teacher and the host mom Jennifer (who had me call her “Jen”) taught elementary school. She had recently delivered a baby, so she was still in the hospital when I moved into their house. The Martinez family did almost everything together. We made pizza together, watched Shrek on their cozy couch together, and went fishing on Sunday together. On rainy days, Michael, Jen and I would sit on the porch and listen to the rain, talking about our dreams and thoughts. Within two months I was calling them mom and dad. After I finished the exchange student program, I had the option of returning to Korea but I decided to stay in America. I wanted to see new places and meet different people. Since I wasn’t an exchange student anymore, I had the freedom--and burden--of finding a new school and host family on my own. After a few days of thorough investigation, I found the Struiksma family in California. They were a unique group. The host mom Shellie was a single mom who had two of her own sons and two Russian daughters that she had adopted. The kids always had something warm to eat, and were always on their best behavior at home and in school. It would be fair to say that this was all due to Shellie’s upbringing. My room was on the first floor, right in front of Shellie’s hair salon, a small business that she ran out of her home. In the living room were six or seven huge amplifiers and a gigantic chandelier hung from the high ceiling. The kitchen had a bar. At first, the non-stop visits from strangers made me nervous, but soon I got used to them. I remember one night, a couple barged into my room while I was sleeping. It was awkward. After a few months I realized we weren’t the best fit. In the nicest way possible, I told them I had to leave. They understood. The Ortiz family was my fourth family. Kimberly, the host mom, treated me the same way she treated her own son. She made me do chores: I fixed dinner, fed their two dogs Sassy and Lady, and once a week I cleaned the bathroom. I also had to follow some rules: No food in my room, no using the family computer, no lights on after midnight, and no ride unless it was an emergency. The first couple of months were really hard to get used to, but eventually I adjusted. I lived with the Ortiz family for seven months like a monk in the deep forest. However, the host dad Greg’s asthma got worse after winter, so he wanted to move to the countryside. It was unexpected and I only had a week to find a new host family. I asked my friend Danielle if I could live with her until I found a new home. That’s how I met the Dirksen family, my fifth family. The Dirksen family had three kids. They were all different. Danielle liked bitter black coffee, Christian liked energy drinks, and Becca liked sweet lemon tea. Dawn, the host mom didn’t like winter, and Mark, the host dad, didn’t like summer. After dinner, we would all play Wii Sports together. I was the king of bowling, and Dawn was the queen of tennis. I don’t remember a single time that they argued about the games. Afterward, we would gather in the living room and Danielle would play the piano while the rest of us sang hymns. Of course, those 28 months were too short to fully understand all five families, but I learned from and was shaped by each of them. By teaching me English, nine year-old Cody taught me the importance of being able to learn from anyone; the Martinez family showed me the value of spending time together as a family; the Struiksma family taught me to reserve judgment about divorced women and adopted children; Mrs. Ortiz taught me the value of discipline and the Dirksen family taught me the importance of appreciating one another’s different qualities. Getting along with other people is necessary for anyone and living with five families has made me more sensitive to others’ needs: I have learned how to recognize when someone needs to talk, when I should give advice and when to simply listen, and when someone needs to be left alone; in the process, I have become much more adaptable. I’m ready to change, learn, and be shaped by my future families.",

        "Text": "I’ve spent most of my life as an anti-vegetable carboholic. For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. My transformation began with my mom’s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole “vegan” thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as “What the Health” and “Forks Over Knives”. We read all the books by the featured doctors like “The China Study” and “How Not To Die”. I became entranced by the world of nutritional science and how certain foods could help prevent cancer or boost metabolism. Each new food I discovered gave me an education on the role diet plays on health. I learned that, by eating sweet potatoes and brown rice, you could cure acne and heart disease. I discovered eating leafy greens with citrus fruits could boost iron absorption rates. I loved pairing my foods to create the perfect macronutrient balance. Did you know beans and rice make a complete protein? Food has also turned me into a sustainability nut. Living plant-based also saves the planet from the impact of animal agriculture. For the same amount of land space, a farmer can produce 200 kilograms of soybeans versus 16 kilograms of beef. I do my part to have as small of an ecological footprint as I can. I stopped using plastic snack bags and instead turned to reusable beeswax wraps. My favorite reusable appliance is my foldable straw. If I am going to nourish my body, shouldn’t I also want to nourish the earth? My journey toward healthy living led me to becoming co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, “Biggest Little Plant Pod”, a group dedicated to spreading the message about the whole food plant-based lifestyle. We are currently working on a restaurant campaign to encourage local eateries to create a plant-based, oil-free menu option and become PlantPure certified. After discovering how many restaurants use oil in their cooking, I decided I needed to open a plant-based oil free cafe to make up for this gap. My dream is to open up my very own affordable oatmeal cafe based on my Instagram page, morning_mOATivations. And I know that oatmeal isn’t the sexiest superfood out there, so here’s my sales pitch: I’m going to make oatmeal the Beyonce of the breakfast world- sweet, sassy, and power packed. This allows me to educate people about nutritional science through the stomach. Finally, I am a strong proponent of hands-on experience for learning what good food looks and tastes like, so cooking is one of my favorite ways to teach the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Using my taste buds as my textbook to learn which flavors work together and which ones don’t helps me educate, as I’ve found that information tends to stick in a person’s mind once they’ve experienced healthy, delicious foods with their own senses. Our society has taught us that delicious food has to make us feel guilty, when that is simply not the case. The best feeling in the world is falling in love with a dish and then learning all the health benefits that it provides the body. While my classmates complain about being tired, I have more energy because my body is finally getting the right macros, vitamins, and minerals it needs. This has allowed me to push myself harder physically, excelling in running and earning my high school Cross Country team’s Most Improved award. I’m still a picky eater. But the foods I am particular about have changed. Rather than a carboholic, I choose to call myself a vegeholic.",

        "Text": "Meditation over a flaxen sunset with a friend and parmesan-topped spaghetti for dinner — “14.” Assignments piling up on my desk as a high fever keeps me sick at home — “3.” Taking a photo excursion through downtown Seattle for a Spanish project — “15.” For the past 700 days and counting, the Happiness Spreadsheet has been my digital collection for documenting numerical, descriptive, and graphical representations of my happiness. Its instructions are simple: Open the Google Sheet, enter a number between 1 and 20 that best represents my level of happiness, and write a short comment describing the day. But the practical aspect of the spreadsheet is only a piece of what it has represented in my life. A “14” etched on November 15, 2018, marked the first Lakeside Cooking on the Stove Club meeting. What had started as a farcical proposition of mine transformed into a playground where high school classmates and I convene every two weeks to prepare a savory afternoon snack for ourselves. A few months later, a “16” scribbled on February 27, 2019, marked the completion of a fence my Spanish class and I constructed for the dusty soccer field at a small Colombian village. Hard-fought days of mixing cement and transporting supplies had paid off for the affectionate community we had immediately come to love. The Happiness Spreadsheet doesn’t only reflect my own thoughts and emotions; it is an illustration of the fulfillment I get from gifting happiness to others. If happiness paves the roads of my life, my family is the city intertwined by those roads — each member a distinct neighborhood, a distinct story. In times of stress, whether it be studying for an upcoming derivatives test or presenting my research at an international conference, I dash to my father for help. Coming from the dusty, people-packed backstreets of Thiruvananthapuram, India, he guides me in looking past the chaos and noticing the hidden accomplishments that lie in the corners. When in need of confidence, I find my mother, who taps her experiences living in her tranquil and sturdy tatami-covered home in Hiroshima, Japan, helping me prepare for my first high school dance or my final match in a tennis tournament. Whenever my Happiness Spreadsheet numbers touch lows, my family is always there to level me out to “10.” The Happiness Spreadsheet is also a battery monitor for enthusiasm. On occasion, it is on full charge, like when I touched the last chord on the piano for my composition's winner recital or when, one frosty Friday morning, I convinced a teacher to play over the school speakers a holiday medley I’d recorded with a friend. Other times, the battery is depleted, and I am frustrated by writer's block, when not a single melody, chord, or musical construct crosses my mind. The Happiness Spreadsheet can be a hall of fame, but it can likewise be a catalog of mistakes, burdens, and grueling challenges. The spreadsheet began on a typical school day when I left my physics class following the most confusing test I’d taken. The idea was born spontaneously at lunch, and I asked two of my friends if they were interested in pursuing this exercise with me. We thought the practice would last only a couple of weeks or months at most, but after reaching 700 days, we now wonder if we’ll ever stop. To this day, I ponder its full importance in my life. With every new number I enter, I recognize that each entry is not what defines me; rather, it is the ever-growing line connecting all the data points that reflects who I am today. With every valley, I force myself onward and with every mountain's peak, I recognize the valleys I’ve crossed to reach the summit. Where will the Happiness Spreadsheet take me next?",

        "Text": "I sit, cradled by the two largest branches of the Newton Pippin Tree, watching the ether. The Green Mountains of Vermont stretch out indefinitely, and from my elevated vantage point, I feel as though we are peers, motionless in solidarity. I’ve lost my corporeal form and instead, while watching invisible currents drive white leviathans across the sky, have drifted up into the epistemological stream; completely alone with my questions, diving for answers. But a few months ago, I would have considered this an utter waste of time. Prior to attending Mountain School, my paradigm was substantially limited; opinions, prejudices, and ideas shaped by the testosterone-rich environment of Landon School. I was herded by result-oriented, fast-paced, technologically-reliant parameters towards psychology and neuroscience (the NIH, a mere 2.11 mile run from my school, is like a beacon on a hill). I was taught that one’s paramount accomplishment should be specialization. Subconsciously I knew this was not who I wanted to be and seized the chance to apply to the Mountain School. Upon my arrival, though, I immediately felt I did not belong. I found the general atmosphere of hunky-dory acceptance foreign and incredibly unnerving. So, rather than engage, I retreated to what was most comfortable: sports and work. In the second week, the perfect aggregate of the two, a Broomball tournament, was set to occur. Though I had never played before, I had a distinct vision for it, so decided to organize it. That night, the glow-in-the-dark ball skittered across the ice. My opponent and I, brooms in hand, charged forward. We collided and I banana-peeled, my head taking the brunt of the impact. Stubborn as I was, even with a concussion, I wanted to remain in class and do everything my peers did, but my healing brain protested. My teachers didn’t quite know what to do with me, so, no longer confined to a classroom if I didn’t want to be, I was in limbo. I began wandering around campus with no company except my thoughts. Occasionally, Zora, my English teacher’s dog, would tag along and we’d walk for miles in each other's silent company. Other times, I found myself pruning the orchard, feeding the school’s wood furnaces, or my new favorite activity, splitting wood. Throughout those days, I created a new-found sense of home in my head. However, thinking on my own wasn’t enough; I needed more perspectives. I organized raucous late-night discussions about everything from medieval war machines to political theory and randomly challenged my friends to “say something outrageous and defend it.” And whether we achieve profundity or not, I find myself enjoying the act of discourse itself. As Thoreau writes, “Let the daily tide leave some deposit on these pages, as it leaves, the waves may cast up pearls.” I have always loved ideas, but now understand what it means to ride their waves, to let them breathe and become something other than just answers to immediate problems. I am most enamored by ideas that cultivate ingenious and practical enrichments for humanity. I enjoy picking some conundrum, large or small, and puzzling out a solution. Returning from a cross country meet recently, my friend and I, serendipitously, designed a socially responsible disposable water bottle completely on accident. Now we hope to create it. I am still interested in psychology and neuroscience, but also desire to incorporate contemplative thought into this work, analyzing enigmas from many different perspectives. My internships at the NIH and the National Hospital for Neuroscience and Neurosurgery in London have offered me valuable exposure to research and medicine. But I have come to realize that neither of my previous intended professions allow me to expand consciousness in the way I would prefer. After much soul-searching, I have landed on behavioral economics as the perfect synergy of the fields I love. All it took was a knock on the head.",

        "Text": "Before I came to America, I drank Puer Tea with my father every morning in my bedroom, sitting cross-legged on Suzhou-silk mats beside a view of the Lakeside reservoir. Beside a dark end table, we picked up teacups as the mild aroma greeted our noses. As we faced the French window, my father would share the news he read in China Daily: the Syrian civil war, climate change, and gender equality in Hollywood. Most of the time, I only listened. With each piece of news, my curiosity piqued. Secretly, I made a decision that I wanted to be the one to discuss the news with him from my perspective. So, I decided to study in America to learn more about the world. After one year’s extensive research and hours of interviews, I came to America for 9th grade and moved in with a host family. But, my new room lacked stories and cups of tea. Fortunately, I found Blue House Cafe on my walk home from church, and started studying there. With white walls, comfortable sofas, and high stools, Blue House is spacious and bright. Hearing people’s stories and looking at their warm smiles when they taste various pastries as I sat by the window, I watched as a production designer scouted locations for his film, or a painter took notes while brainstorming for his freehand brushwork of Blue House. With a cup of coffee, I dig into differential and parametric equations for my upcoming AP Calculus test, learn the nuances of public speaking by watching Michael Sandel’s Justice lectures on my laptop, and plan fundraising events for my non-profit. I’ve also learned by watching leaders host meetings at the rectangle conference table at the back of the cafe and I learn from the leaders of meetings, watching as they hold the edge of the table and express their ideas. Similarly, as president of the International Students Club, I invited my teammates to have meetings with me at the cafe. Coordinating the schedule with other members in Blue House has become a frequent event. Consuming several cups of coffee, my team and I have planned Lunar New Year events, field trip to the Golden Gate Bridge, and Chinese lunch in school to help international students feel more at home. Straightening my back and bracing my shoulders, I stood up behind the conference table and expressed my creative ideas passionately. After each meeting, we shared buttermilk coffee-cake. In my spot next to the window, I also witnessed different kinds of people. I viewed visitors dragging their luggage, women carrying shopping bags, and people wandering in tattered clothes --the diversity of San Francisco. Two years ago I saw volunteers wearing City Impact shirts offering sandwiches and hot chocolate to homeless people outside of the cafe. I investigated more about City Impact and eventually signed up to volunteer. No longer was I a bystander. At holiday outreach events, I prepared and delivered food to homeless people. While sharing my coffee, I listened to a story from an older Chinese man who told me, in Mandarin, how he had been abandoned by his children and felt lonely. Last summer, I returned to Xiamen, China, and taught my father how to drink coffee. Now, a Chemex and teapot are both on the end table. Instead of simply listening, I shared my experiences as a club president, a community leader, and a volunteer. I showed him my business plan and prototypes. My father raised his cup of coffee and made a toast to me, “Good girl! I am so proud of you.” Then, he patted my head as before. Together, we emptied our cups while the smell of coffee lingered.",

        "Text": "I am a dancer. It’s something I’ve only learned recently, but it’s my reality. My story is not one of the typical dancer: I was not the student who couldn’t sit still or pay attention in class, only to find focus and expression through movement. That just isn’t my story. I’ve always been able to sit still, stay engaged, and absorb what my teachers threw at me: I was a “good student”. I would sit at my desk, listen and learn, then go home and do my homework. But, the entire time I embodied that “good student”, I felt like something was missing. It wasn’t physical health—I stayed active and had a healthy diet. But, there was a disconnect between my mind and body. For the longest time, I felt like I lived from the neck up. I love to learn —I always have—but before dance, I was only focused on learning with my head. At the beginning of my junior year I picked up dance. It started on a bit of a whim: I liked watching and I thought learning some moves would help me impress girls. So, I grabbed a like-minded friend and started attending classes. Once I began, I was surprised by how much I liked it. I had discovered something in it that I hadn’t been expecting; I found that I was learning with my entire body. Not to mention that at the same time, I was learning about my body itself—how it worked and moved, every little muscle and bone. My friend eventually quit, but I kept attending class, and began to add more and more classes to my schedule. I dove deep into dance and took every opportunity that I could find to learn. Dancing was like returning to my childhood, like learning to take those first steps. I was learning how my body moved, how to challenge and develop it, and how to interact with other people through a new language. It challenged me in a completely new way and I’ve loved every second of it. Dance has changed my life. Through it, I’ve met people who challenge my beliefs about how the world works and how we all learn. It’s shown me many different paths and ways to navigate through life. I’ve found role models in my teachers who engage me mentally and physically and push me to grow; teachers who I am lucky enough to also call my friends. I’ve found a global and local community of hardworking, intelligent, and skilled people who are always hungry to learn; a community where everyone is accepted, because dance transcends everything—race, class, gender, religion, even language. And for the first time, I’ve found a community where I am fully supported and accepted; a feeling, it seems, that I had never experienced before. Through all of this, I have found a part of my identity and I am proud to call myself a dancer because of it.",

Lovesick teenagers armed with cheesy posters and grocery store flowers. Because at my school, winter is the harbinger of the Winter Formal Dance. But as girls secretly gossip as to who they wish to ask them and guys muster up the courage to do so, I spend another year resigning myself to not going. Whenever someone finds out that I’m skipping it, they never assume that it’s because I can’t afford to. Which is why I am always asked this same question: “Why not? What are you too poor? Hahaha!” The only way I can respond is to laugh it off and to make up an excuse. At times like these, however, living in a homogenously wealthy community can get disheartening because of how indelicate the kids here can be. But they aren’t simply mean for the sake of being petty, they just don’t realize how tactless they are being. Especially since the few less fortunate members of my community hide their situation for fear of being labelled as different. And though hiding the fact that we are poor may seem to work, we’re really just avoiding the problem. The problem being that we shouldn’t be made to feel ashamed of being poor. And the only way to fix this problem is to better inform our community about our struggles. If we want change, it has to start with us. We have to stop hiding the fact that we are poor because it isn’t something to be ashamed of. And by learning our stories and our situations, my community will strive for better understanding and work to be more considerate towards those less fortunate than they are. How do I know this? Because it’s already begun. There has been effort by the less fortunate members of my community to share their stories in person and on social media. I was inspired by this movement and confessed to my own friends about why I never got to the dance. And through this process, I found out how wonderful my community is. Because my friends are all so well-off, they’ve never seen money to be important. Something that I myself am guilty of. Since I never had enough, I’d always viewed money as something sacred. Which is why I never learned to be generous. But my friends, after I told them my reason, offered my $60 each so that I could go. As one of my friends put it: “I’d rather spend money on letting you have a good time rather than spending it on myself.” Despite my intention to teach my community, it was I who was humbled. I had never realized how stingy I had been until I was shown generosity. I hope to never again be as unaware as I had thought my community to be. I must be better, because I too am part of my community.",

        "Text": "I was immensely disappointed when I didn’t hear my name as the winners were being announced. A few seconds before, I was so excited that it might have seemed as if I was waiting to win the Nobel Prize, instead of an award for my project in mathematics at the Scientific and Research Council of Turkey National Projects Competition. Throughout the 4 days of the Project Fair, I presented my project to over 100 visitors. I was even offered a mentorship by an accomplished mathematics professor, who also visited the fair and seemed very interested in my project, in which I had developed two alternative approaches to methods for expressing power sums in a formula, a complex topic in mathematics previously worked on but that could not be simplified. I was confident, because everyone, including the other contestants, thought that my project would win. Overconfidence, as it turns out, can sometimes lead to great disappointments. I was not sure why I actually wanted to win this contest: to be giving the honor of winning the contest or to have my mathematical findings recognized nationally? When they were announcing the winners, I realized that having my work appreciated was what mattered the most. Some of the projects that Turkish scientific institutions overlooked went on to later win recognition internationally; so my project might not have actually been insufficient, but it just did not win. The fact that this competition was the only place in Turkey where I could truly demonstrate my competence and skills in mathematics on such a stage was the reason why I so badly wanted to excel at it. However, failing to get my project recognized showed me that there will be times in life when I will lose, just like there will be times when I win. Fortunately, I was raised in a family where I was taught that I should not be discouraged by failure; rather I should learn lessons and build myself up through them. Further, my failure made me more sensitive to the current conditions in Turkey, in terms of the political difficulties, threats of terror and unrest, and constraints on scientific development. The current atmosphere in the country is in many ways quite opposite from the view of the world that I have learned as an IB student. So how can I, as an international-mind and creative thinker, reach my true potential in an environment that is in many unsuitable at present, and how can I be useful in the future to help us overcome the challenges we currently face? Answer: by carrying out my studies in a place where science and development are put above all else. This would allow me to pursue my passions without the current limitations of the Turkish system, in which I must, for example, choose between biology and mathematics, instead of being able to study both, which study abroad will allow me to do. Something one hears less every day in Turkey is “I want to make a difference,” due to those constant distractions that people here have to deal with daily, and which make it much more difficult to focus on progressing. I do, however, want to make a difference as a woman and an aspiring scientist, two parts of my identity that unfortunately are not allowed their full expression in my country. Because I love my community and the many remarkable people in it, and because I have gained so much from them, I want to give back by contributing to science, being a force for positive change in my homeland, and inspiring Turkish women to take part in the scientific world. Long story short, I interpreted the outcome of this competition as a failure before, but I have come to realize more each day that the broader perspective in this incident inspired in me has put me on the road to success.",

        "Text": "Growing up with a stutter was difficult. My thoughts were always fully formed, but the words would get stuck. The harder I tried to force them out, the more they would jam up, like train cars going off a track. Sometimes kids would laugh or make fun of my stutter, but mostly they just ignored me. They had better things to do than wait to hear my ideas, so they assumed I had none worth hearing. Eventually, I gave up talking to people entirely. They thought I was stupid, and, soon enough, I thought so too. My parents signed me up to play soccer in the hopes that being part of a team would help me make friends. I wasn’t particularly athletic, and I could barely kick a ball. But soccer is a game anyone can play. On the field, my stutter didn’t matter. I discovered that I could lead, quietly, through action, rather than words. Eventually, speech therapy resolved by stutter, but it was on the soccer field that I learned how to be me. One of my teammates had a brother with Down Syndrome. Every season, he came to our games to watch from the sidelines. He had cleats and a ball that he kicked around by himself, but because he also had an intellectual disability, there was no room for him on our team or anywhere else. I realized that although soccer is a sport for everyone, not everyone is included in the sport. I understood the pain of being excluded simply because of an inability to communicate. So, in February of 2015, I launched GOALS (Giving Opportunities to All who Love Soccer), a unified soccer program for kids with and without special needs. GOALS partners youth athletes who have intellectual disabilities with neurotypical peer buddies. The athletes and buddies play together, as unified pairs, in small-sided, non-competitive scrimmages. The first GOALS program had just nine participants. Today, we hold GOALS events twice a month for fifty players of all abilities. GOALS has impacted over 400 kids and is now an official partner of Special Olympics Arizona. But I don’t measure the success of GOALS by the numbers. Success comes in the form of an athlete like Josh*, who came reluctantly to his first GOALS event, having never tried sports before, preferring instead to play video games by himself. Josh was surprised to find that he loves soccer, and he looks forward to playing with his friends at every GOALS event, where his diagnosis of autism doesn’t define him. What makes GOALS special is that it is not a community service program for kids with intellectual disabilities. GOALS is a program that serves the entire community, understanding that our community includes people of all abilities. GOALS champions people for what they bring to the community, rather than defining them by what they take. GOALS breaks down the barriers that separate kids with special needs from their neurotypical peers, creating intentional connections that allow true friendships to develop. For many kids, GOALS is the first time they experience genuine acceptance. Through sports, we have the capacity to create something better than tolerance. Tolerance is for summer heat, visits to the doctor’s office, and lines at the bank. People, though, deserve more than tolerance. People deserve acceptance. So often, kids with intellectual disabilities are isolated socially, for no other reason than that kids pass them by. But special needs kids can be incredibly smart and talented. We just need to slow down long enough to get to know them. Some need more time to turn their ideas into words, but we can afford to have those slower conversations. That is why, for me, unified sports will be a lifelong passion. Through sports, anyone can communicate that each of us is valued, each of us is a part of the time, and each of us is a friend worth having.",

        "Text": "Ocean waves of panic perspired in my palms and a 6.3 magnitude earthquake trembled in my hands. I was afraid but spoke deliberately; fear would not stop me from sharing my first vulnerable poem: …I want my insides—dry, dead wood—to be lit with a match, and no water could ever put me out, no hurricane of sadness, no gentle rainstorm of doubt could stop the heat inside… When finished, I looked up to see unblinking eyes and tears running down my teacher’s face. In that moment, I became a writer. I recited the poem near the end of my creative writing class my sophomore year. Throughout the class, students focused on one genre, and choosing to stay on the safe path, I focused on fiction, which I had written since I could hold a pencil. Although I admired poetry and the way a poet in a few lines could convey the feelings expressed in 300 pages of a novel, it intimidated me. I feared I did not have the skill to craft with such imagery, detail, and purpose. When a poet in my class shared her work, I was taken aback by her striking metaphors and cryptic imagery. But what shocked me most was that she got her message across. Suddenly, I had an epiphany: writing didn’t have to follow all the rules. A writer could take a feeling and express it through unique images. It’s not about the picture on the page, but what the picture makes the reader feel. With zeal and inspiration, I began to use literary devices and images with purpose. I aimed to convey emotion through images. Most of my writing before told the stories of fictional characters, but in my poem, I channeled all my confusion and stress. I poured my soul onto the page. When I read my poem out load, several changes occurred in me. I freed myself from the fear of taking risks. My poem gave me the courage to transfer to a new school, a decision which continued to build my confidence and creativity. Before, I had always written as a means of escape, as a way to create distractions by hiding in a world that was not my own. But in writing the poem, I confronted my problems and answered questions. Poetry taught me how to be brave, how to get right up to the edge of a cliff and embrace vulnerability and the fear of the fall. I also realized the impact my writing could have on others. Before, I did not enjoy sharing my writing because I created stories for my own amusement and pleasure. Now my eyes are open to the power of words. I do not view a story or poem as an individual experience, but as a unifying tie amongst people. Writing is about observing the world and using my life stories and emotions to help listeners and readers feel less lost and alone. The tears which fell down my teacher’s face and the wide eyes of my peers were not because they had the same experience as me, but because they paralleled the feeling I created with their own life stories. In revealing the deepest parts of myself, the class contemplated their own deeper thoughts. Now I write to examine; now I write to understand; now I write to comfort the chaos. Etching pieces of myself into the grooves and curves of each sentence. I do not expect others to connect with the story but rather connect with the emotion. I now know each story or poem is a heart, beating and alive, raw and utterly vulnerable, but also stretching out in a network of veins drawing readers back to the center, unifying one another. ",

        "Text": "“How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!” -Homer “D’oh!” -Homer Simpson I’m not a philosopher; eloquence eludes me, the meaning of life is unquestioned, and thinking, beyond what is required to carry out a potential, is postponed to a more leisurely time. I’ve experienced doubt, and proceeded with caution; and in my experience, I’ve learned to discard unnecessary thought and conventional wisdom in favor of progress. Philosophy amounts to nothing unless it results in action. “You’re kidding.” Scanning my schedule, my classmate shakes her head. “Why didn’t you take Dual Credit?” During Junior year, my high school began to incentivize Dual Credit courses with a GPA multiplier. Advertised to be less demanding than an AP class, Dual Credit was extolled as the wise man’s curriculum. So, mustering all the wisdom I had, I took 6 AP classes, and frankly, I enjoyed their depth. When it comes to education, I’m not cautious – and I’m prone to doubt. I just act. If I want chemistry, then I get chemistry; if I’m intrigued by psychology, then I pursue psychology. There is no point in pondering the inevitable; I am determined to take educational opportunities. I’ll judge the difficulty for myself after I complete it. The practice of prioritizing action has proved useful in my pursuits. In ninth grade, I could have doubted my capability; instead I ran for office in the school’s health club and earned a position in the eleventh grade. That year, there was a debate amongst the members over meeting schedules: if the Technology Students Association meeting coincided with ours, how would we attract new members? As the club officers weighed the costs and benefits amongst themselves, I left the meeting and signed up for the technology club, discussed an agreement, and voted for the technology club to move its meetings to the second half of lunch before scheduling the Health club meetings for the first half. Did it require thinking? No. Eloquence? Hardly. Contrary to the anticipated speeches and club-based patriotism, it only took clear action and a request to solve the conflict. Attendance increased, and as a bonus, I enjoyed a continued membership with both organizations. Beyond the sphere of public education, doubt-free determination facilitated my impact in the community. I am seventeen; I cannot vote in the upcoming elections. However, that does not mean I will hesitate to make a mark with my city. Small actions, from teaching addition to a church member’s kindergartener to tutoring three classmates for the SAT, matter in the long run. Can a teenage end world hunger? Doubtful; but by pulling weeds from the community garden, I can further progress one step at a time. Not all actions end successfully. However, between cautious wisdom and failure, I choose action. I don’t fancy myself as wise; I’m not prone to doubt, nor am I perpetually cautious. I simply pursue my goal. As the wiser Homer has taught America, when torn between success and potential peril, one must simply “D’oh.”",

        "Text": "Most airplanes are constructed with seats in rows of two or three. Mathematically, that means no matter the configuration, someone in my family of five has to sit by a stranger. Ever since I was little, I always asked to be that person. Perhaps it’s the optimistic middle child in me, but I always considered the greatest possibility was that I could meet someone remarkable, and that the conversation could be anything on the spectrum from slightly interesting to life-changing. From the time I could speak, I began to realize that overcoming communication barriers was an integral key to unlocking the enormous potential in constructing meaningful relationships with others. My father is a successful scientist, but he has also been profoundly deaf since birth. My childhood was spent understanding his intelligence while still struggling at times to convey basic needs because I was choosing words that were too difficult to lipread and that I couldn’t yet write. As a kid, I learned how to continually recalibrate my own approach to overcome the challenge of constantly being misunderstood. My ability to build a relationship with my father was contingent on spending a lifetime navigating around the communication barriers that exist for someone who cannot hear. At the time I didn’t foresee I was developing an aptitude for communication skills that would be critical for succeeding in so many other important areas. Since kindergarten, I have loved Chinese culture. My mom got tired of me requesting panda birthday cakes year after year and seeing me dressed as a panda each Halloween until I grew out of every costume. In second grade, I convinced the owner of a noodle house to give me two Chinese lanterns that still hang in my room today. In my junior year of high school, I earned a competitive scholarship from the U.S. State Department to study abroad for the summer learning Mandarin and immersing myself in eastern culture. Being dropped into Chengdu, China when you don’t speak the language fluently and being cut off from all communication back home was not all the cuddly pandas and Tai chi in the park that I had fantasized. Once again, I found myself a toddler, unable to communicate basic needs. I wondered, “Are humans really supposed to eat all the foods you’re giving me?” I quickly learned the Chinese education system is one of unparalleled expectations, not for the meek. With every grade a student receives, they can see their successes or failures broadcasted on a board in front of the class. Each new day tested my adaptability, my resilience, and my digestive system. I, for the first time, realized what it must feel like to be my father on the other side of the communication barrier, not just trying to express my needs, but trying to really understand what others are saying. At the end of the program I was told I had been unanimously voted by my school administration in China to represent the scholarship recipients and deliver a speech on their behalf to over 500 people… in Chinese. The flight was now descending after so many remarkable experiences and conversations with strangers. Throughout my life, I have learned that the path to overcoming communication barriers is to will oneself through them. One must embrace it all and say “yes” to every new and uncomfortable experience. In the end, I returned home with a cultural awareness beyond expectation, possessing lifelong friendships with former strangers whom I now communicate with in their native language, and surprisingly loving the taste of rabbit eyeballs and cow intestines. I am so grateful to have learned and confirmed in my life that stepping out of my comfort zone can, in fact, lead to experiences anywhere on the spectrum from slightly interesting to life-changing. On the flight home from China I, of course, chose to sit next to a stranger… and it didn’t disappoint.",

        "Text": "When we are small, the world seems infinite. Personally, I believed that Germany was adjacent to Wisconsin until I was 8. But eventually, physical growth lends itself to a greater understanding of the world around us as we become exposed to truths of society. It was easy for me to justify my mom’s long work hours and our pocket-sized apartment filled with black mold when I did not know that everyone else had something “better”—and for me, it never felt like I was worse off, it just felt different. My friend had blue eyes and a house. I had brown eyes and I got free lunch. But as I learned more about the world, I found that those differences became difficult to overlook as people grew up and closed their minds in order to conform to their roles in society. My mom’s young age, financial status, and lack of a degree, as well as my lack of a second parent were all characteristics I saw in people who were portrayed to me as failures. It was a harsh reality to accept, because my mom was anything but a failure; she worked tirelessly, prioritizing my needs over hers and resigning herself to fast food jobs because she could not go to college while supporting a newborn. She grew up much faster than any 20-year-old should have to. And yet, for all her strength, we received looks of pity and degradation. But for all the vitriol, we steadfastly refused to let the judgments of other ruin us. When my mother worked late, she left me with her oldest friends, Brian and Eric. They discussed everything—politics, philosophy, physics, beer; and for every question I had, they had insightful and honest responses, even when I demanded to know what was so special about Indiana Pale Ale when I was five. They inspired my passion for learning and taught me about the world while my mom worked to make sure we still had a home. Brian was a chef. Most conversations happened while he sautéed mushrooms or julienned peppers. Years passed, and on the night he made risotto, I stood in the kitchen and asked about welfare. I knew my mom and I had it, but I failed to understand the negative connotation surrounding it. They explained that people often have misconstrued ideas about welfare; they become close-minded to the lifestyles and perspectives of others as they adhere to their own confining positions as members of society. This made sense, but it did not seem fair, particularly after school that day. “Today a girl laughed at me because we have welfare,” I mumbled, shifting uncomfortably. “She said her mom said my mom shouldn’t be in the PTA if she can’t even come to meetings because she’s working.” Brian and Eric exchanged heavy glances, but I rambled on, voice shaking as I realized at the same time as everyone else in the room that this incident had affected me more than I initially thought it had. “My mom works really hard. For us. To keep us safe and fed and okay. They don’t get to say she isn’t doing enough when she’s trying her best.” They hesitated the way adults do before having serious conversations. “Kiddo—there are a lot of things about the world that aren’t fair. This is one of them,” Brian started. “That girl and her mom try to tear down people like you and your mom because they have no perception of how hard you two work to be where you are. They won’t try to understand because they don’t want to. And that’s not on you, that’s on them.” And I understood. I knew that my mom and I worked hard. Welfare did not make me anyone’s inferior; instead, it taught me about perspective. People are quick to judge what they do not know or understand, because empathy is not indoctrinated in people as well as derision and hatred are. Empathy and morality are traits that I believe take priority over any other; I care about how people treat each other, because I have seen the damage that results when people become too self-involved to care about how their words affect others. The best way for me to inspire that empathy is through arts and humanities. Brian and Eric helped cultivate my passion for learning about people and for evoking emotion within them to form meaningful connections, and whether it is through art, literature, or human sciences, I want to be someone who can open people up to different perspectives, and I want to do it by learning as much as I can so that I have something to give back. on the spectrum from slightly interesting to life-changing.

        "Text": "In Fyodor Dostoevsky’s, “Crime and Punishment”, the character Sonia is metaphorically linked to Christ. After prostituting herself to feed her family, she covers her head and face in shawls, before lying on her bed face down and sobbing– through this, she is linked to the death of Jesus. Her mother, Katarina, kisses her feet while she sobs, the same way people in the churches of that time wept and kissed at the feet of idols to Christ. In this situation, Dostoevsky is implying that even something such as prostitution that might be deemed a sin can instead be that which allows one to be a Saint. As my mother choked up while I described the above anecdote, I was filled with confusion. What could lead her to be so upset over this philosophical question? I asked if there was something she wanted to talk about and to say there was would be an understatement. She described to me the process by which my Father, in pursuit of a sexual relationship with a young woman, had demolished our family’s house, and all of my Mom’s identifying documents, before successfully taking away both me and my brother. While my father wasn’t on my birth certificate for a Welfare bid, and my mother regained custody of me, my brother had to remain in the care of a man who put little emphasis on caring for his sons at that point in his life. My mother was left with no money, no place to live, and no friends who would lend their support. She turned to her sister for guidance and instead of love and compassion was met with cruelty, deceit, and greed. My mother found a parallel between herself and Sonia. Both were faced with a problem the likes of which seems unsolvable and were thrust into a patriarchal system that far too often values little of women beyond the most primitive desires. Despite constant attempts to get herself onto a more admirable path, the system resisted her. She could not afford to purchase new identifying documents without missing rent, and I couldn’t handle being paraded through 105-degree weather. She was stuck. My dad came back and offered to continue their relationship after more than a year of abject poverty and lack of bodily autonomy. And she accepted the invitation into the man who had ruined her life for me. After going through a phase of alcoholism and an instance of domestic violence against my Father, I viewed my mother as immoral, or misguided at the least. I was wrong. Despite experiencing some of the worst things a human can experience, and being able to tell nobody about it, she remained in a household with a man who intentionally hurt her beyond belief, for my well being. If there is a God above us, he views Sonia and my Mother not as sinners, but as Saints, and in that conviction, I could not be more absolute.",

        "Text": "The craft of storytelling, for me, is holy. Looking back on my life, I don’t see one defining moment where I realized that my purpose is to study, compose, and teach story. It’s more like a collection of snapshots whipping by, each one yellowed with age and fingerprints. I remember reading The Empty Space by Peter Brook on theatre theory long into the night, encountering the line, “Drama was exposure, it was confrontation… it led to… an awakening of understanding.” These words were what led me to the discovery of how storytelling is an emotional confrontation between the author and the writing and between the writing and the audience. It’s collision. It’s catharsis. Catharsis defines me as a playwright. The first play I wrote, The Rocket Man, adapted from a short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury, follows a teenage boy whose astronaut father spends much of his time in space. It’s uncanny – that’s my entire life. My own father travels from Denver to Los Angeles four days a week on business, and my family isn’t whole unless he’s with us. Drafting a scene of The Rocket Man, where the boy confronts his father before he leaves again, changed my life: Stay with me, the boy begged in the original scene I added. Please. I immediately began to cry, praying that my own father, a thousand miles away, was listening. I learned that day that catharsis is releasing my own story within a story. When the line between my soul and the soul of my story blurs, that’s when the real work happens. The construct of The Rocket Man was like a cathedral, with my own emotion as stained glass and my memories as arches, but I realized after sharing it with my cast and crew for the first time that a cathedral is nothing without people to experience it. My 18-year-old male lead, Pierce, cried when he first read the script. So did my light designer and sound designer. What I want is to recreate this experience for an audience as a playwright with the intention of establishing the theatre as a safe place. You can grieve here. You can be seen here. You can hope here. This goal starts not just with craft, but with overwhelming love for that audience. At its core, storytelling is service. One of the defining challenges of my life presented itself as the opportunity to create and execute a free playwriting course for middle-school girls. When the pandemic hit, it forced me to reimagine my course for a virtual setting offered through the local school district; I realigned everything – my three-week curriculum, my downloadable course exercises, and my teaching strategies. Teaching playwriting to middle-school girls over Zoom meant listening to their struggle to make friends at school and their desire to participate in protest marches against the will of their parents. With each lesson, they experienced the transcendence of having their lives and emotions reflected through story, and they loved it. One student, Isabel, told me with ten exclamation points about how excited she was for class. She even filmed a one-woman version of a play she wrote, complete with costumes and accents. I came out of class every night feeling like I might burst from joy. Showing students how to release their own story within a story is the most purposeful thing I have ever done. Sitting in a theatre as the overture starts, hearing a thousand conversations stop in the span of a single heartbeat. A hand over my mouth in awe as I watch the finale and wonder at how a two-hour show can contain all the nuances of life. That’s why I exist – to offer story. To teach it. That’s my mission and my ministry. ",

Students are likely to be honest in their reviews, so the professor can also learn from their mistakes. However, I believe that there are disadvantages as well. If a student knows that they will receive a failing grade, they may be dishonest in their review just to spite the professor. They may say that the professor wasn’t fair, even if that isn’t true. This can be hurtful to the professor and detrimental to their career.

We don't know if her face is beaming in the next moment or will it lose all traces of smile. It certainly builds a complicated connection between us and Mona Lisa.",

        "Text": "As I stepped onto the lush green course for the first time, clutching my golf clubs and trying to exude confidence, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. I was the sole girl on my high school golf team, surrounded by seasoned players who seemed to have been born with a golf swing. My initial attempts at driving, chipping, and putting were laughable, and I wondered if I had made a huge mistake by joining the team. But as I looked around at my teammates, who were all cheering me on and offering words of encouragement, I knew I had to persevere.  Golf, I soon discovered, was not just about hitting a little ball into a hole. It was about teamwork, optimism, and hard work. As I struggled to find my footing on the course, my teammates took me under their wing, offering tips and advice that helped me improve with each passing day. They never made me feel like I was holding them back, even when I was the weakest link on the team. Instead, they celebrated my small victories, and their collective enthusiasm was infectious.  As the weeks turned into months, I began to find my niche on the team. I realized that I didn't have to be the best golfer to contribute to our success. I could be a source of positivity, a cheerleader who kept everyone's spirits high even when the going got tough. I learned to focus on the process, not just the outcome, and to appreciate the little things – a beautiful sunset on the course, a well-executed shot, or a teammate's triumph.  One of the most valuable lessons I learned from golf was the importance of teamwork. In a sport often perceived as individualistic, I discovered that success was not just about personal achievement, but about working together towards a common goal. We were a team, united in our quest for victory, and every player had a crucial role to play. I learned to communicate effectively, to support my teammates, and to trust in their abilities.  Golf also taught me to be optimistic, even in the face of adversity. There were times when I felt like giving up, when my shots were consistently wayward and my scores were dismal. But my teammates and coaches never let me lose faith. They reminded me that every golfer, regardless of skill level, has bad days, and that the key to success lies in perseverance and resilience. I learned to focus on the present moment, to let go of mistakes, and to move forward with a positive attitude.  Perhaps the most surprising lesson I learned from golf was its ability to level the playing field and bring people together. On the course, social hierarchies and cliques dissolved, and we were all equal – struggling to navigate the challenges of the game. I formed strong bonds with my teammates, bonds that transcended our differences and created a sense of community. We were a diverse group, united by our passion for golf, and our shared experiences on the course forged unbreakable bonds.  As I look back on my journey, I realize that golf has given me so much more than I ever could have imagined. It has taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, optimism, and hard work, lessons that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I may not have become a golf prodigy, but I have become a better person, more confident, more resilient, and more appreciative of the beauty of the game. As I walk off the course for the final time, I know that I will always cherish the memories and lessons of my time on the green.",

        "Text": "As I stood at the summit of Mount Washington, the highest peak in New Hampshire, I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and gratitude. It was a moment I had been working towards for years, ever since I set the goal in fifth grade to climb all 48 four-thousand-foot peaks in the state. But as I looked out at the breathtaking view, I realized that this journey had given me so much more than just a sense of pride. It had given me a sense of purpose, a passion for environmentalism, and a newfound appreciation for the natural world.  Growing up, my parents encouraged my siblings and me to explore the outdoors. We spent countless weekends hiking, camping, and traveling to national parks. These experiences instilled in me a love for nature and a sense of wonder at its beauty. But it wasn't until I started tackling the four-thousand-foot peaks that I began to develop a deeper connection with the environment.  The journey was not easy. There were days when the weather was brutal, and I had to push through rain, snow, and wind to reach the summit. There were days when my body ached from the physical exertion, and I doubted my ability to complete the goal. But with each peak I conquered, I felt a growing sense of confidence and determination. I began to realize that the journey was not just about reaching the summit, but about the experiences and lessons I gained along the way.  As I hiked, I started to notice the subtle changes in the environment. I saw the impact of climate change on the trees, the effects of pollution on the waterways, and the devastating consequences of human neglect on the natural world. These observations sparked a passion within me to make a difference, to be a part of the solution rather than the problem. I began to read about environmental issues, attend seminars, and volunteer for local conservation efforts.  The more I learned, the more I realized that my goal to climb the four-thousand-foot peaks was not just a personal challenge, but a way to connect with the natural world and make a positive impact. I started to see the beauty of the environment not just as a backdrop for my adventures, but as a delicate ecosystem that required protection and preservation.  As I completed my final peak, I felt a sense of sadness wash over me. I had grown to love the routine of hiking, the sense of accomplishment, and the connection with nature. But I knew that this journey was not the end, but rather the beginning of a new chapter in my life.  I emerged from this experience with a newfound appreciation for the natural world and a desire to pursue a career as a hands-on environmentalist. I want to work in conservation, to be part of the effort to protect and preserve our planet's natural beauty. I want to inspire others to care for the environment, to take action, and to make a difference.  As I looked out at the breathtaking view from the summit of Mount Washington, I knew that I had found my true calling. I had found a sense of purpose that went beyond personal achievement and into the realm of making a positive impact on the world. And for that, I will be forever grateful for the journey that began with a simple goal to climb all 48 four-thousand-foot peaks in New Hampshire.",

        "Text": "As I stood in the midst of Disney's Hollywood Studios, surrounded by the magic of movie-making, I knew that my life's purpose was inextricably linked to the world of cinema. It was a childhood experience that sparked a passion within me, a flame that has continued to burn bright to this day. The allure of filmmaking, with its unique blend of technical wizardry and emotional resonance, captivated me in a way that nothing else ever has. As I reflect on my journey, I am reminded of the profound impact that cinema has had on my life, shaping not only my passion but also my sense of purpose.  Growing up, I was fascinated by the technical aspects of filmmaking. I would spend hours poring over behind-the-scenes books and documentaries, marveling at the intricate processes involved in bringing a story to life. The way that cinematographers could manipulate light and shadow to evoke emotions, the precision of editors in crafting a narrative, and the transformative power of costume design all captivated me. As I delved deeper into the world of cinema, I began to appreciate the meticulous attention to detail required to create a cohesive and compelling film. This fascination with the technical aspects of filmmaking instilled in me a strong work ethic and an appreciation for the importance of collaboration.  However, it was not just the technical aspects of cinema that resonated with me. The strong female characters that I encountered on screen had a profound impact on my confidence and self-perception. Seeing women like Ellen Ripley, Princess Leia, and Wonder Woman – characters who embodied strength, courage, and determination – made me realize that I too could be a force to be reckoned with. These characters inspired me to be more confident, to take risks, and to pursue my dreams with unwavering determination. They showed me that I did not have to conform to traditional gender roles, that I could forge my own path and create my own destiny.  As I grew older, my passion for filmmaking only intensified. I began to appreciate the unique, personal nature of the medium, the way that a filmmaker's vision and experiences could be distilled into a work of art that could touch the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide. I realized that filmmaking was not just about telling stories, but about sharing a piece of oneself with the world. This understanding deepened my respect for the craft, and I became determined to use my platform to spread messages of hope, perseverance, and strength.  Through my work, I hope to inspire others, to empower them to pursue their passions and to never give up on their dreams. I want to create films that challenge, that provoke, and that inspire – films that leave a lasting impact on those who experience them. I want to be a role model, to show young women and girls that they too can succeed in the film industry, that they too can create works of art that resonate with audiences worldwide.  As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the profound impact that cinema has had on my life. It has shaped my passion, my purpose, and my sense of self. It has given me a voice, a platform, and a sense of direction. As I move forward, I am excited to see where this journey will take me, to see how I can use my passion for filmmaking to make a positive impact on the world. I am grateful for the magic of cinema, for the way it has touched my heart and shaped my soul. I am proud to be a part of this world, and I am excited to see what the future holds.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on my childhood, I am reminded of the countless hours I spent enthralled by stories of birds. From the majestic eagle to the cunning crow, these creatures fascinated me with their beauty, intelligence, and mystique. My parents would regale me with tales of their symbolism in various cultures, and I would listen with wide eyes, feeling an inexplicable connection to these winged wonders. As I grew older, however, my fascination with birds began to wane, relegated to a mere fondness for a favorite animal. It wasn't until high school that I rediscovered the significance of birds in folklore and the profound impact they had on my life.  One of the most influential stories from my childhood was that of the phoenix, a bird that rises from its own ashes, reborn and rejuvenated. This mythological creature taught me about resilience, perseverance, and the cyclical nature of life. As I navigated the challenges of adolescence, I found myself drawing upon the phoenix's wisdom, reminding myself that setbacks were opportunities for growth and transformation. The pressure to conform to societal norms and seek approval from others was overwhelming at times, but the phoenix's story encouraged me to stay true to myself, even in the face of adversity.  Another bird that has had a profound impact on my life is the hummingbird. In many indigenous cultures, the hummingbird is seen as a symbol of joy, beauty, and simplicity. Its iridescent feathers and rapid wingbeats remind us to appreciate the beauty in life's fleeting moments and to find joy in the everyday. As I struggled to balance academic pressures with personal relationships and extracurricular activities, the hummingbird's lesson was a timely reminder to slow down, appreciate the present, and find happiness in the simple things.  Maya Angelou's poignant quote, \"A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song,\" resonated deeply with me during this period. It was a powerful reminder that my worth and identity were not defined by external validation or achievements, but by my unique voice and perspective. I began to embrace my individuality, expressing myself through creative writing, art, and music. The freedom to be myself, without apology or pretension, was liberating, and I attribute this newfound confidence to the timeless wisdom of birds.  As I look back on my journey, I realize that the lessons I learned from birds have shaped my values and inform my approach to relationships, personal growth, and self-expression. The eagle's strength and courage inspire me to take risks and pursue my passions, while the owl's wisdom and intuition remind me to trust my instincts and listen to my inner voice. The peacock's vibrant plumage and proud strut teach me to embrace my uniqueness and celebrate my differences.  In an age where technology and social media dominate our lives, it's easy to forget the ancient wisdom of folklore and the timeless lessons of birds. Yet, as I reflect on my own experiences, I am reminded of the profound impact these creatures have had on my life. They have taught me to be resilient, to appreciate beauty, to find joy in simplicity, and to express myself authentically. As I navigate the complexities of adulthood, I will continue to draw upon the forgotten wisdom of birds, carrying their lessons with me like a beacon of hope and inspiration.",

        "Text": "I still remember the day I decided to take my first dance class. I was nervous, intimidated, and unsure if I was even worthy of stepping into a dance studio. Growing up, I never had the opportunity to take dance classes like many of my peers. My parents couldn't afford it, and I was left to watch music videos and try to mimic the moves in front of my bedroom mirror. But as I grew older, my passion for dance only intensified, and I knew I had to take a chance.  That's when I discovered YouTube tutorials. I spent hours upon hours watching videos, practicing in front of my TV, and perfecting my technique. It wasn't easy, of course. There were times when I felt like giving up, when my body just couldn't seem to do what my mind wanted it to do. But I persisted, driven by a fire that burned deep within me.  As I continued to dance, I began to realize that my self-taught journey was not without its challenges. I would watch videos of professional dancers, comparing my skills to theirs, and feeling inadequate. I would attend dance classes, surrounded by people who had been dancing since they were children, and feel like an imposter. It was hard not to get caught up in the idea that I was somehow less worthy because I hadn't had the same opportunities as others.  But despite these doubts, I refused to let them hold me back. I practiced every day, pouring my heart and soul into my craft. I watched videos of dancers who inspired me, studied their movements, and worked tirelessly to perfect my own technique. And slowly but surely, I began to see progress. My body began to move in ways I never thought possible, and my confidence grew with each passing day.  The breakthrough came when I decided to perform in a local dance competition. I was terrified, of course. What if I messed up? What if I wasn't good enough? But as I stepped onto that stage, something shifted inside of me. I forgot about the audience, forgot about the judges, and forgot about my doubts. All that mattered was the music, the movement, and the freedom I felt in that moment.  When the results were announced, and I found out I had won first place, I was overwhelmed with emotion. It wasn't just the validation of winning that moved me to tears; it was the sense of pride and fulfillment that came from creating something beautiful from scratch. I had taken a passion that was once just a dream, and turned it into a reality.  Looking back, I realize that my journey was never just about learning to dance. It was about breaking free from the shackles of self-doubt and insecurity. It was about proving to myself that I was capable of achieving anything I set my mind to, no matter how impossible it may seem. And it was about celebrating the rewards of creative expression, and the sense of joy and fulfillment that comes from pursuing one's passion.  In the end, my self-taught journey taught me a valuable lesson: that success is not about the resources you have, but about the drive and dedication you bring to the table. It's about believing in yourself, even when no one else does. And it's about having the courage to take that first step, even when the journey ahead seems uncertain.  As I look to the future, I know that I will continue to face challenges and obstacles. But I also know that I have the power to overcome them, one step at a time. And that's the greatest reward of all – the knowledge that I am capable of breaking free, and creating a life that is truly my own.",

        "Text": "Growing up in a historic tavern in Harvard, Massachusetts, has been a unique experience, to say the least. Our 234-year-old home has been a constant presence in my life, and its quirks and demands have taught me valuable lessons that extend far beyond the realm of household maintenance. From a young age, I've been involved in the upkeep of our old fieldstone foundation, where the art of mortar maintenance has become an unlikely source of wisdom.  One of my earliest memories is of helping my parents repair the mortar joints in our foundation. The process was laborious, requiring technical precision, speed, and strength. My parents would mix the mortar, and I would help apply it to the gaps between the stones, carefully smoothing it out to ensure a seamless finish. As I grew older, I took on more responsibility, learning to mix the mortar myself and tackling larger sections of the foundation. The work was physically demanding, but I found a sense of satisfaction in seeing the fruits of my labor.  Beyond the tangible results, however, I began to appreciate the intangible benefits of mortar maintenance. The repetitive motion of applying and smoothing the mortar was meditative, allowing me to clear my mind and focus on the task at hand. It was a rare moment of calm in an otherwise chaotic world. As I worked, I realized that the skills required to succeed in mortaring – technical precision, speed, and strength – were also essential for achieving goals in other areas of my life.  Competitive eventing, for example, requires a similar combination of technical skill, physical strength, and mental focus. As I navigated the complex courses and precision jumps, I drew on the same patience, determination, and perseverance that had served me so well in mortaring. The iterative process of improving my riding skills, much like the iterative process of repairing the mortar joints, taught me to appreciate the value of hard work and self-reflection.  Writing, too, has benefited from the lessons I've learned through mortar maintenance. The process of crafting a well-written essay or story requires a similar attention to detail, a willingness to revise and refine, and a patience with the iterative process of improvement. Just as a single misplaced stone can compromise the integrity of the entire foundation, a single misplaced word or phrase can undermine the impact of a piece of writing.  As I look back on my experiences, I realize that the skills I've developed through mortar maintenance have been instrumental in helping me achieve success in other areas of my life. But more than that, I've come to appreciate the value of the process itself. The act of repairing the mortar joints is not just about achieving a tangible goal; it's about embracing the journey, with all its frustrations and setbacks.  In a world that often prioritizes speed and efficiency, the slow, deliberate process of mortar maintenance is a refreshing anomaly. It reminds us that success is not solely about achieving a specific outcome, but about the journey we take to get there. It reminds us that patience, determination, and perseverance are key to overcoming obstacles and reaching success.  As I prepare to leave my childhood home behind, I know that the lessons I've learned through mortar maintenance will stay with me. They will inform my approach to challenges in all areas of my life, from competitive eventing to writing, and beyond. And as I look to the future, I'm grateful for the unlikely wisdom of our 234-year-old home, which has taught me to find zen in the art of mortar maintenance.",

        "Text": "As I stood in front of the lump of clay, my heart raced with anxiety. I had never taken a sculpting class before, and the thought of creating something from scratch terrified me. What if I failed? What if my sculpture turned out to be a disaster? These questions swirled in my mind, making my hands tremble as I hesitantly began to shape the clay.  The first few classes were a struggle. I was determined to create a perfect piece, one that would impress my instructor and classmates. But every time I thought I was making progress, I would make a mistake, and my entire sculpture would come crashing down. Literally. I would get frustrated, feel like a failure, and want to give up. My fear of imperfection was suffocating me, preventing me from fully embracing the creative process.  But something shifted in me during the fourth class. I was working on a new piece, trying to create a delicate flower out of clay. As I was shaping the petals, I accidentally pressed too hard, and the entire flower collapsed. I felt the familiar pang of frustration, but this time, I decided to take a step back and observe my reaction. Why was I so afraid of making mistakes? What was the worst that could happen? The answer was simple: nothing. The worst that could happen was that I would learn from my mistake and try again.  In that moment, I made a conscious decision to let go of my fear of imperfection. I began to see mistakes as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as a source of shame. I started to experiment with different techniques, taking risks and trying new things. And you know what? My sculpture still didn't turn out as planned. But that was okay. In fact, it was more than okay – it was liberating.  As I continued to work on my sculpture, I began to notice the beauty in its imperfections. The lopsided shape, the uneven texture, the accidental holes – all of these \"mistakes\" added character to my piece. They made it unique, imperfect, and mine. I realized that perfection was not the goal; the goal was to create something that was true to myself, flaws and all.  Through this journey of sculpting, I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of taking risks and embracing imperfection. I learned that mistakes are not failures, but rather stepping stones to growth and self-discovery. I learned that creativity is not about producing a perfect product, but about the process of creation itself. And I learned that imperfection is not something to be feared, but something to be celebrated.  As I looked at my finished sculpture, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. It was not perfect, but it was mine, and it told a story of my journey towards self-acceptance. I realized that this journey was not just about sculpting, but about life itself. It was about embracing the imperfections and uncertainties of life, and finding beauty in the messiness.  In the end, my sculpture may not have been perfect, but it was a reflection of my true self – imperfect, flawed, and beautifully human. And that, I realized, was the greatest masterpiece of all.",

I was on the cusp of embarking on a journey to become a cardiologist, a dream I had nurtured for years. But as I delved deeper into my studies, a nagging voice within me began to whisper doubts. It was as if my heart was trying to tell me something, but I wasn't listening.  Growing up, I had always been fascinated by the human body and its intricate mechanisms. The idea of saving lives and making a difference in people's well-being resonated deeply with me. So, when I declared my intention to pursue a career in cardiology, my family and friends were overjoyed. They saw it as a noble pursuit, a testament to my compassion and dedication. But as I delved deeper into my studies, I began to feel suffocated by the sheer volume of information, the endless memorization, and the pressure to perform.  It wasn't until I stumbled upon a creative writing course in college that I felt a spark of excitement. The words flowed effortlessly, like a river breaking free from its dam. I wrote about the world around me, about the people I met, and about the emotions that swirled within me. For the first time, I felt alive, connected to something deeper and more meaningful. But I brushed it off as a mere hobby, a distraction from my \"real\" pursuit of becoming a cardiologist.  The disconnect between my passion for cardiology and my love for writing continued to gnaw at me. I felt like I was living a double life, torn between two opposing desires. It wasn't until I stumbled upon a pivotal sentence in a book that everything clicked into place. The author wrote, \"The things that make me different are the things that make me.\" In that moment, something shifted within me. I realized that my love for writing wasn't just a hobby, but an integral part of my being.  I began to explore this newfound awareness, pouring my heart and soul into my writing. The words flowed effortlessly, like a dam had burst open. I wrote about my struggles, my fears, and my dreams. I wrote about the world around me, about the people I met, and about the emotions that swirled within me. For the first time, I felt like I was being true to myself, like I was unveiling my true essence.  As I looked back on my journey, I realized that my passion for cardiology had been a mere disguise, a way to prove to myself and others that I was worthy. But writing was different. It was a reflection of my soul, a way to express the deepest, most intimate parts of myself. I realized that I didn't have to choose between being a cardiologist and a writer; I could be both, and more.  This journey of self-discovery has been a transformative one, a journey that has allowed me to tap into my true passion and destiny. It's a journey that has taught me to listen to my heart, to trust my instincts, and to embrace my uniqueness. As I look to the future, I know that I will continue to write, to explore, and to uncover the depths of my being. I will continue to unveil my true essence, and in doing so, I will find my true purpose.  In the end, I came to understand that my true calling wasn't to save lives as a cardiologist, but to touch hearts and minds through my writing. It's a realization that has brought me a sense of peace, a sense of purpose, and a sense of passion. I am no longer torn between two opposing desires; I am whole, complete, and free to be myself.",

        "Text": "As I sit amidst the scattered Lego bricks on my desk, I am transported back to a time when my world was a mere collection of blocks, waiting to be assembled into something magnificent. My lifelong passion for Legos has been more than just a childhood hobby – it has been a source of comfort, confidence, and self-expression. Through the ups and downs of life, Legos have remained a constant, a reminder of the transformative power of creativity and imagination in shaping one's identity and outlook.  I still vividly remember the struggle to complete my first Lego set, a simple police car with flashing lights. The instruction manual seemed like a foreign language, and the pieces refused to fit together as seamlessly as they did in the pictures. Frustration and disappointment were my constant companions, but I refused to give up. With each failed attempt, I learned to persevere, to adapt, and to think outside the box. The sense of accomplishment when I finally completed the set was exhilarating, and it marked the beginning of a lifelong journey of creativity and self-discovery.  As I grew older, my Lego creations became more intricate, more complex, and more reflective of my personality. I began to design unique pieces, combining disparate elements to create something entirely new. This process of experimentation and innovation taught me valuable skills – problem-solving, critical thinking, and risk-taking. I learned to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and improve, rather than as a source of fear and anxiety.  But Legos were more than just a creative outlet; they were also a source of comfort during times of uncertainty. When I started at a new boarding school, I was overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and the pressure to fit in. My Lego sets became a reminder of home, of familiarity, and of the comfort of routine. As I built, I felt a sense of calm wash over me, a sense of control in a world that seemed to be spinning out of control.  However, as I navigated the challenges of boarding school, I began to discover new passions and interests. I stumbled upon a ceramics class, and the tactile sensation of shaping clay into something beautiful and functional was intoxicating. The process of creating with ceramics was different from building with Legos – it was more fluid, more unpredictable, and more forgiving. As I worked with clay, I began to see the world in a new light, to appreciate the beauty of imperfection, and to understand the value of taking risks.  Through my experiences with Legos and ceramics, I have come to realize the enduring impact of childhood passions on personal growth. These creative outlets have shaped me into the person I am today – confident, resilient, and open to new experiences. They have taught me to embrace uncertainty, to adapt to change, and to pursue my passions with reckless abandon.  As I look to the future, I know that my love for Legos and ceramics will continue to play a significant role in shaping my reality. They will remain a source of comfort, a reminder of the power of creativity and imagination to transform and uplift. As I build and create, I am reminded that life is a journey, not a destination – a journey of self-discovery, growth, and transformation.

        "Text": "Growing up, I often felt like a puzzle with missing pieces. My heritage was a mix of Puerto Rican, Irish, French, and Polish, a blend that seemed to confuse everyone, including myself. My family gatherings were a cultural smorgasbord, with arroz con gandules and shepherd's pie served side by side. Yet, amidst the festive atmosphere, I couldn't help but feel like an outsider, caught between the different cultural expectations of my ancestors.  As a child, I struggled to reconcile my multiple identities. My Puerto Rican grandmother would lovingly correct my pronunciation of Spanish words, while my Irish grandfather would tease me about my \"mixed-up\" heritage. These encounters left me feeling like I didn't quite belong to any one group. I was a perpetual outsider, stuck in a liminal space between cultures.  The feelings of exclusion and discomfort intensified as I grew older. I faced prejudice and intolerance within my own family, with some relatives questioning my \"authenticity\" as a Puerto Rican or Irish person. These microaggressions were subtle but piercing, making me wonder if I was somehow less worthy because of my mixed heritage.  The aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 was a turning point for me. Watching the devastation unfold, I felt a deep sense of anger and sadness. The disparate treatment of Puerto Rican victims, the lack of urgency and resources from the US government, was a stark reminder of the systemic inequalities that exist. I realized that my heritage was not just a personal quirk, but a reflection of the broader social and political landscape.  As I navigated these complex emotions, I began to understand the importance of empathy and understanding in breaking down ignorance and biases. I started to engage in conversations with my family members, gently challenging their assumptions and stereotypes. I also began to explore my heritage more deeply, reading about the history and culture of each of my ancestral groups.  This journey of self-discovery was not without its challenges. There were times when I felt like I was betraying one part of my heritage by embracing another. But as I delved deeper into my roots, I realized that my identity was not a zero-sum game. Embracing my Puerto Rican side did not mean rejecting my Irish heritage, and vice versa.  Ultimately, I came to understand that my identity is more than the sum of my heritage. It is a multifaceted, ever-evolving entity that defies categorization. I am not just Puerto Rican, Irish, French, and Polish – I am a unique individual, shaped by my experiences, values, and beliefs.  This realization was liberating. I no longer felt the need to conform to societal expectations or justify my existence to others. I was free to embrace my complexity, to celebrate the beauty of my mixed heritage.  As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the power of empathy and understanding. By embracing our differences, we can break down the barriers that divide us. We can create a world where individuals like me, with their messy, complicated identities, can thrive.  In the end, my heritage is not a puzzle to be solved, but a rich tapestry to be celebrated. And I am proud to be a part of it, in all its multifaceted glory.",

        "Text": "As I sit in my cozy bedroom, surrounded by stacks of dog-eared novels and scribbled-in journals, I am reminded of the profound impact literature has had on my life. Growing up, I moved from place to place, never staying in one location for more than a few years. The constant flux was disorienting, leaving me feeling like a puzzle piece that never quite fit. But amidst the chaos, I found solace in the pages of fantasy novels. Those fictional worlds became my sanctuary, a place where I could escape the uncertainty of my reality.  The characters I encountered in those books were more than just fictional friends – they were role models, confidants, and inspirations. They showed me that it was okay to be different, to be quirky and flawed and still be worthy of love and respect. As I delved deeper into the world of fantasy, I began to discover my own strengths and passions. I realized that I was not just a shy, awkward kid, but a brave and resilient individual capable of overcoming any obstacle.  One of the most significant ways literature shaped my identity was by empowering me to express my emotions. Growing up, I struggled to articulate my feelings, often bottling them up inside. But as I read about characters who were unafraid to show their emotions, I began to do the same. I started writing poetry and short stories, using words to process my emotions and gain a deeper understanding of myself. This newfound ability to express myself gave me a sense of freedom and confidence, allowing me to embrace my queerness and celebrate my individuality.  Literature also inspired me to strive for academic excellence. I was fascinated by the intricate world-building and clever plot twists that authors crafted, and I became determined to develop my own writing skills. I devoured books on grammar and syntax, practiced writing in different styles, and even started a writing club at school. As I honed my writing abilities, I began to excel in English class, earning top grades and recognition from my teachers. This newfound passion for English sparked a desire to pursue a career in writing, teaching, and publishing law.  But literature's impact on my life extends beyond my academic pursuits. It has also influenced my physical ambitions. As I read about characters who pushed their bodies to the limit, I became inspired to do the same. I started training in martial arts, testing my physical endurance and mental toughness. This newfound passion for physical activity has not only improved my overall health but also given me a sense of discipline and focus.  As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the transformative power of literature. It has shaped my identity, fueled my resilience, and inspired my ambitions. My love for literature has evolved into a desire to wield language as a powerful tool, to become a writer, professor, and publishing lawyer who can create stories that inspire and make a difference. This essay is a testament to the profound impact of literature on my life, and my commitment to repaying that debt by crafting stories that will leave a lasting legacy.  In the end, literature has taught me that I am not just a product of my circumstances, but a creator of my own destiny. It has given me the courage to embrace my quirks, celebrate my individuality, and strive for excellence in all aspects of my life. As I continue on this journey of self-discovery, I know that literature will remain a constant companion, guiding me towards a future filled with purpose, passion, and creativity.",

        "Text": "As I stood in my backyard, surrounded by the cacophony of cicadas, I couldn't help but feel a sense of annoyance. The constant buzzing, the shedding of their skin, and the sheer number of them seemed like an invasion. But as I watched them emerge from the earth, I began to see them in a different light. Specifically, I saw myself in them.  Brood X, the 17-year cicadas, had been underground for nearly two decades, living in darkness and silence. It was a sheltered existence, protected from the dangers and uncertainties of the world above. Similarly, I had grown up in a sheltered environment, protected from the harsh realities of life by my loving parents. My childhood was idyllic, with every need met and every problem solved by someone else. I was, in many ways, like the cicadas - unaware of the world beyond my narrow scope.  But as the cicadas emerged into the bright sunlight, they were forced to confront a new reality. The world was different from the one they had left behind. The trees were taller, the air was warmer, and the predators were more numerous. They had to adapt quickly to survive. And so did I.  As I entered adulthood, I was thrust into a world that was vastly different from the one I had grown up in. The rules had changed, the expectations were higher, and the stakes were greater. I was no longer protected by the umbrella of my parents' love and care. I had to fend for myself, make my own decisions, and face my own challenges.  The cicadas, too, had to navigate this new world. They had to find food, avoid predators, and mate to ensure the survival of their species. It was a daunting task, but they persevered. They adapted to their new environment, using their unique characteristics to overcome the obstacles in their path.  As I watched them, I realized that I, too, had to adapt to my new environment. I had to develop new skills, form new relationships, and find new sources of sustenance. I had to be willing to take risks, to venture out of my comfort zone, and to face my fears. The cicadas were teaching me a valuable lesson - that growth and transformation are necessary for survival.  But the most striking similarity between the cicadas and me was our shared experience of self-awareness. As the cicadas emerged from their underground existence, they began to realize their own identity. They discovered their unique characteristics, their strengths and weaknesses, and their place in the world. Similarly, as I navigated the challenges of adulthood, I began to discover my own identity. I realized my values, my passions, and my purpose.  This unlikely kinship with the cicadas has taught me a valuable lesson. It has shown me that even the most disparate creatures can learn from each other. It has reminded me that growth, perseverance, and self-awareness are essential for survival. And it has encouraged me to appreciate the beauty of transformation, whether it occurs in the natural world or in the human experience.  As I stood in my backyard, surrounded by the cicadas, I felt a sense of gratitude towards these unlikely teachers. They had shown me that even in the most unexpected places, we can find common ground and learn from each other. And as I looked up at the sky, I knew that I would carry this lesson with me for the rest of my life.",

        "Text": "Growing up, I often found myself caught in the midst of a societal tug-of-war. On one end, there were the traditional family structures, with a mother and a father, and on the other end, there was my family – two moms, no dad. As a child, I struggled to reconcile these two vastly different realities, and it wasn't until much later that I came to realize the beauty and strength that lay in my non-traditional family.  One of the most significant challenges I faced was the absence of a father figure in my life. I would watch as my friends' dads played catch with them, attended school events, and provided a sense of masculine guidance. Meanwhile, I had two moms who, although loving and supportive, couldn't fill the void left by the lack of a father. I often felt like I was missing out on a fundamental aspect of childhood, and this feeling of inadequacy lingered for years.  However, as I grew older, I began to appreciate the unique advantages of having two moms. My mothers' love and influence shaped me in ways that I am still discovering today. They instilled in me a sense of empathy, compassion, and acceptance that I believe is rare in many traditional families. They taught me that family is not just about biology, but about the love and commitment that binds people together.  Despite the love and support of my mothers, I still faced challenges as I navigated the complexities of societal expectations. I was often asked about my \"real\" parents, or if I was \"missing\" a father figure in my life. These questions, although well-intentioned, were hurtful and made me feel like my family was somehow less legitimate than others. It wasn't until I reached adulthood that I realized the importance of embracing diversity and rejecting the notion that there is only one \"right\" way to form a family.  Through my experiences, I have come to understand that family is not about traditional structures or societal norms, but about the love, acceptance, and support that we give to one another. My mothers' love has been a constant source of strength and inspiration in my life, and I am grateful for the lessons they have taught me about the importance of embracing difference.  In a world where diversity is often met with resistance and fear, I believe that it is more important than ever to celebrate and embrace non-traditional family structures. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and accepting society, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.  As I look back on my childhood, I am grateful for the challenges that I faced. They have shaped me into the person I am today, and have given me a unique perspective on the importance of acceptance, love, and self-empowerment. My story is a testament to the beauty of non-traditional family structures, and I hope that it will inspire others to embrace difference and celebrate the diversity that makes us all unique.",

        "Text": "As I stepped off the plane in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, I was hit with a mix of emotions. Excitement to finally set foot in my father's homeland, anxiety about the unknown, and a sense of disconnection from the war-torn region that was so different from my life in London. My parents had always spoken about Chechnya with a sense of nostalgia and longing, but I had never truly understood the complexity of their emotions until I saw it for myself.  Growing up in London, I had always felt like an outsider looking in. My Russian and Chechen roots were a part of me, but they were also something I didn't fully understand. My parents had left Chechnya in the midst of war, seeking refuge in the UK, and I had grown up with a sense of detachment from my cultural heritage. But as I walked through the streets of Grozny, I felt a deep sense of connection to the land and the people. It was as if I had finally found a missing piece of myself.  However, this sense of connection was also accompanied by a sense of dissonance. I was struck by the stark contrast between the war-torn region and my life in London. The bombed-out buildings, the bullet-ridden walls, and the sense of trauma that hung in the air were a far cry from the comfort and security of my life in the UK. I felt like I was living two separate lives, one in London and one in Chechnya, and I wasn't sure how to reconcile the two.  As I spent more time in Chechnya, I began to grapple with my own identity. I had always thought of myself as Russian and Chechen, but what did that really mean? I didn't speak the language fluently, I didn't know the customs and traditions, and I didn't feel like I fully belonged. I felt like an imposter, pretending to be something I wasn't. But at the same time, I felt a deep sense of connection to my family's past, to the stories my parents had told me, and to the land that had been a part of my family's history for generations.  My encounters with the people of Chechnya were a turning point in my journey of self-discovery. I met people who had lived through the war, who had lost loved ones, and who had been displaced from their homes. I heard their stories, their struggles, and their triumphs, and I was struck by the collective emotions that tied us all together. I realized that my identity was not just about me, it was about my family, my community, and my cultural heritage.  As I returned to London, I felt a sense of introspection wash over me. I realized that my journey of self-discovery was not just about understanding my Russian and Chechen roots, but about understanding the complex identities of those around me. I saw the diversity of London in a new light, as a tapestry of cultures, languages, and experiences that were all intertwined. I saw the beauty in the complexity, the beauty in the differences, and the beauty in the shared human experiences that tied us all together.  My journey to Chechnya was a journey of self-discovery, but it was also a journey of understanding. It was a journey that taught me to appreciate the diversity of London, to celebrate the complexity of identities, and to embrace the beauty of our differences. As I look back on my experiences, I am reminded that identity is not something that is fixed or static, but something that is fluid and ever-changing. It is a journey, not a destination, and it is a journey that requires patience, empathy, and understanding.",

        "Text": "As I sat at the piano, poised to begin my recital at the long-term-care facility, I felt a sense of confidence and pride. I had spent hours perfecting my classical pieces, and I was eager to share them with the residents. The room was filled with expectant faces, and I launched into my first piece, a beautiful Chopin nocturne. The music flowed from my fingers, and I could feel the audience's appreciation.  But just as I was about to begin my next piece, a resident called out, \"Hey, can you play 'Sweet Caroline'?\" I was taken aback. Neil Diamond's classic hit was not exactly the kind of music I had prepared, and I felt a pang of disappointment. I had envisioned a sophisticated, cultured performance, not a sing-along to a popular tune.  At first, I hesitated. I didn't want to deviate from my carefully crafted set list, and I wasn't sure I even knew the chords to \"Sweet Caroline.\" But as I looked out at the expectant faces, I realized that this was not about me or my ego. It was about bringing joy to the people in front of me.  So, I took a deep breath and began to play. The residents clapped and sang along, their faces lighting up with delight. As I played, I felt a shift in my perspective. I realized that music is not just about showcasing one's technical skill or artistic vision, but about connecting with others and bringing them joy.  As I reflected on my initial reaction, I realized that I had been guilty of a kind of arrogance. I had assumed that my audience would appreciate my music simply because it was \"good\" or \"cultured.\" But music is subjective, and what brings joy to one person may not be the same for another.  Through this experience, I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of humility at the piano. It's not about me or my music; it's about the people I'm playing for. As a musician, my role is not to impose my own tastes or preferences on my audience, but to adapt to theirs.  From now on, I vow to play a wide range of music, from classical to popular, from jazz to rock. I want to be able to connect with my audience on their own terms, to bring them joy and comfort through music. I want to be able to say, with confidence and humility, \"Yes, I can play 'Sweet Caroline' for you.\"  As I packed up my piano and said goodbye to the residents, I felt a sense of gratitude and humility. I had learned a valuable lesson, one that would stay with me for the rest of my musical journey. And as I walked out of the facility, I couldn't help but hum the tune of \"Sweet Caroline,\" a reminder of the power of music to bring people together.",

        "Text": "As I stepped onto the charred forest floor, the crunch of burnt wood beneath my boots echoed through the stillness of the Philmont wilderness. The scent of smoke and ash hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the devastating forest fire that had ravaged this land just months prior. I was a trailblazing female scout in the Scouts BSA program, and this journey was meant to be a test of my leadership skills, a chance to prove myself among my peers. But as I gazed out at the desolate landscape, I couldn't shake the feeling of inadequacy that had been gnawing at me since the start of this trek.  The weight of being a \"first\" bore down on me like a physical force. I was the first female scout in my troop to take on this challenge, and the pressure to succeed was suffocating. What if I failed? What if I wasn't good enough? The doubts swirled in my mind like a vortex, threatening to consume me. I felt like I was walking through a minefield, every step a potential misstep.  As we hiked deeper into the scarred forest, the silence between my fellow scouts and me grew thicker. We were all struggling, each of us lost in our own thoughts. The only sound was the rustling of leaves and the creaking of trees, a haunting reminder that even in devastation, there is still beauty to be found.  It was then that I saw them – wildflowers, blooming defiantly in the desert soil. Their delicate petals danced in the breeze, a vibrant splash of color against the blackened backdrop. In that moment, something shifted inside of me. I realized that these flowers were not just a symbol of resilience, but a testament to the transformative power of adversity.  As we continued on our journey, I began to confront my own insecurities, to peel back the layers of self-doubt that had been holding me back. I started to see that leadership wasn't about being perfect, but about persevering in the face of uncertainty. It was about empathy, about understanding that my fellow scouts were struggling just as I was. And it was about self-reflection, about acknowledging my own weaknesses and using them as an opportunity for growth.  The hike was grueling, the terrain unforgiving. But with each step, I felt myself growing stronger, more confident. I began to see that the scars of the forest fire were not just a reminder of destruction, but a testament to the beauty that could emerge from the ashes.  As we reached the summit, the wildflowers blooming around us like a riotous celebration, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over me. I had faced my fears, and I had emerged victorious. I had discovered a deeper understanding of leadership, one that was rooted in empathy, perseverance, and self-awareness.  The journey back down the mountain was different, the silence between us now a comfortable companionship. We had all been transformed by our experience, our scars and insecurities replaced by a newfound appreciation for the beauty of resilience.  As I looked out at the forest, now teeming with life, I knew that I would carry the lessons of this journey with me for the rest of my life. The wildflowers would always be a reminder of the transformative power of adversity, a symbol of the beauty that can emerge from the darkest of places. And I would always be grateful for the scars that had led me to this moment of self-discovery, for the journey that had taught me to lead with empathy, perseverance, and courage.",

        "Text": "I still remember the first time I stepped onto the Irish dance floor, my tiny feet clad in soft leather shoes, my curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail. I was six years old, and my parents had enrolled me in a local Irish dance school, hoping to channel my boundless energy into something productive. Little did they know that this decision would set me on a lifelong journey of self-discovery, perseverance, and passion.  As I grew older, Irish dance became an integral part of my identity. I practiced tirelessly, perfecting my footwork, posture, and arm movements. The rhythmic beats of the bodhran and the lilting melodies of the fiddle transported me to a world of magic and wonder. I loved everything about Irish dance – the sparkly costumes, the thrill of competition, and the sense of community that came with being part of a tight-knit dance troupe.  But as I entered my pre-teen years, self-doubt began to creep in. I struggled to master the complex steps and rhythms, feeling like I was the only one who didn't get it. I remember standing in the wings, watching my friends take the stage with confidence, while I trembled with fear, my heart racing like a drumline. My parents and teachers reassured me, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I wasn't good enough.  The pressure to perform was intense. My parents had invested countless hours and dollars into my dance education, and I felt like I owed it to them to succeed. But with each competition, I felt like I was failing them, and myself. I began to question whether all the hard work was worth it. Maybe I should just quit and focus on something else.  But then I'd step onto the stage, and something miraculous would happen. The music would start, and my feet would take over, moving in perfect sync with the rhythm. The doubts and fears would melt away, replaced by a sense of freedom and joy. I was no longer just a awkward, gangly teenager – I was a dancer, a storyteller, a keeper of a centuries-old tradition.  As I navigated the challenges of adolescence, Irish dance became my solace, my sanctuary. When school got tough, or friendships got complicated, I could always count on the familiarity of the dance floor. The rhythmic movements became a form of meditation, calming my nerves and clearing my mind.  My family made sacrifices for me to pursue my passion. My parents drove me to countless competitions and performances, often sacrificing their own weekends and vacations. My siblings had to share me with the dance world, sometimes feeling like they came second to my dance commitments. But they never complained, never made me feel guilty for pursuing my dreams.  Looking back, I realize that Irish dance taught me so much more than just steps and rhythms. It taught me perseverance, discipline, and the value of hard work. It taught me to take risks, to push past my comfort zone, and to trust in myself. And it taught me that passion can shape one's life in profound ways, giving us a sense of purpose and direction.  As I stand on the threshold of adulthood, I know that Irish dance will always be a part of me. It's woven into the fabric of my being, a thread that connects me to my heritage, my family, and myself. I may not always be a competitive dancer, but I'll always be a dancer at heart, finding solace and identity in the rhythmic movements that have shaped my life.",

        "Text": "As I stood before my canvas, gazing at the serene landscape I had so carefully crafted, my heart sank. A careless swipe of black paint had marred the tranquility of the scene, leaving an unsightly blotch that seemed to mock me. My initial frustration quickly gave way to disappointment and self-doubt. How could I have been so careless? The painting, which had been progressing so smoothly, was now ruined.  But as I stood there, frozen in dismay, a competitive spirit began to stir within me. I couldn't just let this mistake defeat me. I had to rectify it, to prove to myself that I was capable of overcoming even the most frustrating setbacks. And so, I set out on a creative journey, driven by a determination to transform this mistake into something beautiful and meaningful.  As I pondered how to approach the task, my thoughts turned to the California wildfires that had been ravaging the state. The devastating images of flames and smoke had left an indelible mark on my mind, and I began to see the mistake on my canvas as an opportunity to capture the essence of those fires. I remembered the words of a lacrosse coach I had once heard, who had spoken about the importance of adaptability and resilience in the face of adversity. \"You can't control the game,\" he had said, \"but you can control how you respond to it.\"  With these words ringing in my ears, I set out to experiment with color and technique, determined to salvage the painting. I began by applying bold, expressive brushstrokes, using vibrant oranges and yellows to evoke the intense heat of the flames. As I worked, I felt my frustration and disappointment giving way to a sense of excitement and possibility. The mistake, which had initially seemed like a disaster, was slowly transforming into an opportunity for growth and innovation.  As the hours passed, my canvas began to take on a life of its own. The black blotch, which had once seemed so unsightly, was now a dynamic, swirling vortex of color and energy. I added wispy tendrils of smoke, curling and twisting across the canvas like ethereal fingers. The painting was no longer just a representation of a landscape; it was a powerful, emotive portrayal of fire and smoke.  Through this process, I came to realize that mistakes are not failures, but rather opportunities for growth and creative innovation. By embracing the uncertainty and unpredictability of the artistic process, I was able to tap into a deep well of inspiration and imagination. The mistake, which had initially seemed like a setback, had ultimately become a catalyst for something new and beautiful.  As I stepped back from the canvas, gazing at the stunning representation of fire and smoke that now stood before me, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had taken a mistake and transformed it into a masterpiece, a testament to the power of perseverance and creativity. The journey had been long and arduous, but it had been worth it. For in the end, I had discovered that even the most frustrating setbacks can be turned into something beautiful and meaningful, if we only have the courage to try.",

        "Text": "As a 7-foot tall individual, I have grown accustomed to the constant attention and scrutiny that comes with standing out in a crowd. While it may seem like a curse to some, I have learned to navigate these challenges and, in the process, developed essential character traits that have led me to a profound sense of self-acceptance and happiness.  One of the most significant benefits of being tall is the comfort it has brought me in my own skin. I have learned to embrace my uniqueness and reject the notion that I must conform to societal norms. This comfort has translated into confidence, allowing me to interact with people from all walks of life without feeling self-conscious or apologetic about my height. I have come to realize that my tall stature is not something to be ashamed of, but rather something that sets me apart and makes me special.  In addition to confidence, my height has also taught me the importance of kindness and empathy. I have encountered countless individuals who are curious or even intimidated by my stature, and I have learned to approach these interactions with kindness and understanding. By doing so, I have been able to put others at ease and foster meaningful connections with those around me. This kindness has not only benefited others but has also had a profound impact on my own sense of self-worth, allowing me to feel more connected and valued as a member of society.  Humility is another essential trait that I have developed as a result of my height. While it may be tempting to let my stature go to my head, I have learned to remain humble and grounded, recognizing that my height is just one aspect of who I am as a person. This humility has allowed me to stay focused on what truly matters in life, such as building meaningful relationships and pursuing my passions, rather than getting caught up in superficial concerns.  Finally, my height has taught me the importance of lightheartedness and humor. I have learned to laugh at myself and the absurdities that come with being tall, rather than taking myself too seriously. This lightheartedness has not only helped me to navigate the challenges of being tall but has also allowed me to connect with others on a deeper level, as people are drawn to my positive energy and outlook.  In conclusion, my height has been a transformative force in my life, shaping my character and ultimately leading me to a profound sense of self-acceptance and happiness. By embracing my uniqueness and developing essential traits such as comfort, kindness, humility, and lightheartedness, I have become a confident and articulate person, able to interact with people from all walks of life. As I continue on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of embracing our differences and celebrating what makes us unique, for it is in these differences that we find true strength and beauty.",

        "Text": "I still remember the first time I realized that my life was a paradox. I was sitting in a university lecture hall, surrounded by fellow students who were all scribbling notes with their favorite pens. But not me. I was clutching a specific pencil, one that I had used for every exam since high school. It was a habit that I couldn't explain, a superstition that I couldn't shake. As I looked around at my peers, I felt a pang of embarrassment. What was I doing, carrying around a \"lucky\" pencil like some kind of talisman?  But as I delved deeper into my own psyche, I realized that this was just the tip of the iceberg. I was a debater, a champion of logic and reason, and yet I had a plethora of illogical habits. I would cook Italian food on Korean holidays, not because I particularly liked the cuisine, but because my grandmother used to make it for me when I was a child. I would wear a specific pair of socks on competition days, not because they were particularly comfortable, but because I had worn them during a winning tournament.  As I looked back on my life, I saw a pattern emerging. I was a person of contradictions, a rational thinker with a penchant for superstition. My debate team friends would often tease me about my quirks, but they were also fascinated by them. How could someone so logical be so illogical at the same time?  The answer, I think, lies in the power of tradition and culture. My family was a melting pot of different cultures, and with that came a plethora of superstitions and habits. My Korean grandmother would make me wear a specific amulet to ward off evil spirits, while my Italian grandfather would insist that I eat a certain type of pasta for good luck. As a child, I didn't question these habits; I just accepted them as part of who I was.  But as I grew older, I began to see the contradictions in my life more clearly. I was a champion of reason, and yet I was still carrying around these illogical habits. It was a paradox, one that I couldn't reconcile.  Or could I?  As I looked deeper into my own psyche, I realized that the paradox was not a weakness, but a strength. My ability to navigate between logic and superstition was a reflection of my adaptability, my ability to navigate different cultures and traditions. It was a reflection of my personality, one that was both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  In the end, I came to embrace the paradox of my life. I realized that logic and superstition were not mutually exclusive, but complementary aspects of who I was. And as I looked around at my fellow humans, I saw that I was not alone. We are all paradoxes, living lives that defy categorization.  So I'll continue to carry my lucky pencil with me, even as I champion the power of reason. I'll continue to cook Italian food on Korean holidays, even as I celebrate the diversity of human culture. And I'll continue to embrace the paradox of my life, knowing that it is what makes me unique.",

        "Text": "Growing up, I always felt like an outsider. As a student in a prep school, I was surrounded by peers who seemed to effortlessly fit into the mold of conformity. I, on the other hand, struggled to find my place. That was until I discovered punk rock music. The raw energy, the rebellious spirit, and the anti-conformist attitude resonated deeply with me. I finally felt like I had found a community that understood me, a community that rejected the mainstream culture that I felt suffocated by.  At first, punk's philosophy of rejecting societal norms and embracing individuality spoke to me on a deep level. I began to adopt the punk aesthetic, donning ripped jeans and black leather jackets, and I started to question authority in every aspect of my life. I saw myself as a rebel, a nonconformist who refused to be bound by the rules and expectations of others. But as I delved deeper into the punk scene, I began to realize that my rejection of mainstream culture was rooted in a desire to be different, rather than a genuine pursuit of happiness.  I was more concerned with being seen as a rebel than with actually being true to myself. I was rebelling for the sake of rebelling, rather than because I had a genuine desire to challenge the status quo. This realization hit me hard, and I began to question whether my punk philosophy was truly about individuality, or just about being contrarian.  When I transitioned to a new high school, I had the opportunity to re-evaluate my beliefs and values. I started to explore new interests and hobbies, and I began to surround myself with people who accepted me for who I was, rather than trying to fit into a particular mold. I started to realize that true individuality wasn't about rejecting mainstream culture, but about doing what made me happy, regardless of what others thought.  This shift in perspective was liberating. I no longer felt the need to conform to a particular image or ideology, and I was free to explore and express myself in ways that felt authentic to me. I started to see that punk's ethos of questioning authority and challenging the status quo was important, but it was equally important to recognize that defiance for its own sake can be unproductive.  As I looked back on my journey, I realized that punk had been a catalyst for my growth, but it was only one part of my evolution. I had to move beyond the simplistic rebellion of my early punk days and develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be an individual. I had to learn to prioritize my own happiness and personal truth over conformity or rebellion.  In the end, my journey taught me that embracing individuality is not about rejecting mainstream culture, but about being true to oneself. It's about finding what makes you happy and fulfilled, even if that means going against the grain. It's about recognizing that authority should be questioned, but not for its own sake. And it's about understanding that true rebellion is not about being different, but about being authentic.  As I look to the future, I know that I will continue to evolve and grow. I will continue to question authority and challenge the status quo, but I will do so with a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be an individual. I will prioritize my own happiness and personal truth, and I will strive to be authentic, even if that means going against the grain.",

        "Text": "As I rummage through my childhood memories, one vivid image stands out - me, a 12-year-old, mesmerized by the vibrant colors and endless possibilities of my mother's makeup collection. That moment marked the beginning of my fascination with the world of beauty. For years, I indulged in the fantasy of makeup, experimenting with different looks, and devoting hours to YouTube tutorials. However, as I delved deeper into the industry, my passion was met with a harsh reality - the darker side of beauty.  Behind the glamorous façade of beauty products lay a trail of humanitarian violations, environmental damage, and unsustainable practices. The more I learned, the more I felt a growing sense of discomfort. How could an industry that brought me so much joy be responsible for such harm? The realization sparked a transformation within me, as I began to reconcile my love for makeup with my core values. This journey of self-discovery led me to a profound understanding - that my passion for beauty could be a catalyst for positive change.  One of the most striking revelations was the industry's environmental impact. The beauty sector generates over 120 billion units of packaging waste annually, with the majority being non-recyclable. The production process itself is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with many companies relying on unsustainable sources of energy. As someone who had always been passionate about the environment, I felt a deep sense of hypocrisy. How could I advocate for sustainability in one breath and support an industry that was actively harming the planet in the next?  Another disturbing aspect of the industry was its humanitarian violations. Many beauty companies have been accused of exploiting workers, particularly in developing countries, where labor laws are often lax or poorly enforced. The use of child labor, unsafe working conditions, and meager wages are just a few examples of the injustices that plague the industry. As I learned more about these issues, I felt a growing sense of responsibility. How could I, in good conscience, continue to support companies that prioritized profits over people?  This newfound awareness sparked a shift in my behavior. I began to make conscious choices about the products I used, opting for brands that prioritized sustainability and ethical practices. I started to reduce my waste, using reusable makeup remover pads and recycling my packaging. However, I soon realized that individual actions, although important, were only a small part of the solution. To create meaningful change, I needed to use my voice to advocate for systemic reform.  I started writing about sustainable beauty practices, using my blog as a platform to raise awareness about the industry's shortcomings. I wrote about the importance of recycling, the benefits of using eco-friendly products, and the need for greater transparency in supply chains. As my writing gained traction, I began to receive messages from like-minded individuals who shared my passion for creating change. Together, we formed a community that supported and encouraged one another.  My journey from a 12-year-old makeup enthusiast to a 17-year-old advocate for sustainable and ethical beauty practices has been transformative. Makeup, once a source of joy and self-expression, became a catalyst for personal growth and activism. Through this experience, I learned that even the most seemingly trivial passions can be harnessed to create positive change. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue using my voice to promote sustainability and corporate accountability in the beauty industry. The art of activism is not about abandoning our passions, but about using them as a force for good.",

        "Text": "As I stepped into the Long Marine Lab, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment wash over me. I had volunteered to help with a project, expecting to be involved in something exciting and groundbreaking. Instead, I was tasked with dissecting albatross boluses, a seemingly mundane and unglamorous task. The boluses, essentially the stomach contents of the birds, were a jumbled mess of fish bones, feathers, and other unidentifiable bits. I couldn't fathom why anyone would dedicate their time to studying these strange, smelly things.  At first, I went through the motions, mechanically sorting and categorizing the contents of each bolus. But as the days passed, something unexpected happened. I began to notice the tiny treasures hidden within the boluses. A piece of plastic from a distant land, a fragment of a fishing net, a shiny piece of metal that had been ingested by the bird. Each discovery sparked a sense of wonder and curiosity within me. I started to see the boluses not just as a collection of random objects, but as a window into the lives of these magnificent creatures.  As I delved deeper into the project, I realized that the albatrosses were not just eating fish and squid, but also ingesting plastic waste that had originated from far-off lands. The impact of human activities on the oceans was starkly evident in the boluses. I felt a pang of guilt and responsibility, knowing that my own actions, however small, contributed to the problem. But I also felt a sense of hope, knowing that by studying these boluses, we could raise awareness about the issue and work towards a solution.  My experience at the Long Marine Lab taught me a valuable lesson. I had always thought that fascination and excitement could only be found in grand, dramatic pursuits. But I discovered that sometimes, it's the smallest, most unexpected things that can spark the greatest sense of wonder. The albatross boluses, once a source of disappointment, had become a source of fascination and inspiration.  As I reflect on my diverse interests and pursuits, I realize that I often struggle to balance breadth and depth. I want to explore everything, from the intricacies of marine biology to the world of literature and art. But in trying to do so, I risk spreading myself too thin, never truly delving into any one subject. My experience at the lab reminded me that it's okay to slow down, to focus on the small things, and to find fascination in the unlikely.  In the end, I came to realize that the abundance of subjects to explore ensures a life of endless discovery and wonder. There will always be new boluses to dissect, new treasures to uncover, and new lessons to learn. And as I continue on my journey, I know that I will always be drawn to the unlikely, the unexpected, and the fascinating.",

What began as a simplistic mindset transformed into a curiosity-driven perspective, inspired by the integrated classes and outdoor trips that WALC offered. Through this program, I developed a deeper understanding of natural systems and an appreciation for the intricate mechanisms governing the universe.  My journey began with a sense of wonder, sparked by the vastness and complexity of the natural world. As I delved deeper into the program, I became fascinated by the interconnectedness of living systems and the intricate web of relationships that sustain life on Earth. The outdoor trips, in particular, allowed me to experience the beauty and majesty of nature firsthand, from the towering trees of the forest to the majestic peaks of the mountains. These experiences awakened a sense of awe and curiosity within me, prompting me to ask questions about the workings of the universe.  As I explored the natural world, I began to realize the significance of human existence within the grand scheme of the cosmos. I became fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, from the molecular to the universal scales. I devoured books on astrophysics, cosmology, and biology, seeking to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the universe. The more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew, and this realization sparked a desire to contribute to humanity's understanding through research.  Through WALC, I discovered the power of embracing wonder and curiosity in shaping one's worldview and aspirations. By embracing the unknown, I was able to tap into a sense of purpose and meaning that I had not previously experienced. I began to see the world as a complex, interconnected system, and I felt a sense of responsibility to contribute to its understanding and preservation.  My journey through WALC has been a transformative experience, one that has shaped my perspective and aspirations in profound ways. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue exploring the wonders of the universe, to contribute to humanity's understanding through research, and to inspire others to embark on their own journeys of self-discovery and curiosity. In embracing the wonder of the universe, I have discovered a sense of purpose and meaning that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.",

        "Text": "As a camp counselor, I have had the privilege of working with children from diverse backgrounds and abilities. One summer, I had a camper named James who stood out from the rest, not because of his exceptional skills or talents, but because of his physical abnormality. James had four toes on one foot, a condition that made him the subject of whispers and stares from his peers. At first, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but as the days went by, I began to realize that James was eating lunch alone, playing by himself during recess, and avoiding group activities. It was as if he had become invisible to the other campers.  One day, while supervising a game of capture the flag, I noticed James sitting on the sidelines, watching the other kids with a mix of longing and sadness in his eyes. I decided to take a closer look and approached him. As I sat down beside him, he looked up at me with tears welling up in his eyes. \"Why do they hate me?\" he asked, his voice trembling. I took a deep breath and asked him what he meant. He hesitated at first, but then pointed to his foot. I felt a pang of sadness and regret for not noticing sooner.  In that moment, I knew I had to do something to help James feel seen and accepted. I gave him a heartfelt hug and told him that he was an amazing kid, and that his foot did not define his worth. I explained to him that everyone has something that makes them different, and that it's what makes us unique and special. I encouraged him to join the game, and with some hesitation, he agreed.  As the days went by, I made a conscious effort to include James in group activities and to praise him for his efforts and accomplishments. I also encouraged the other campers to do the same. Slowly but surely, James began to fit in with the group. He started to make friends, and his confidence grew. He even began to joke about his foot, calling it his \"superpower.\"  This experience taught me a valuable lesson about the power of acceptance and empathy. It showed me that small acts of kindness and understanding can have a profound impact on a child's life. As a counselor, I realized that my role went beyond just supervising activities and ensuring safety; it was also about creating an environment where every child felt valued and accepted.  James's story has stayed with me long after that summer. It has reminded me of the importance of looking beyond physical appearances and abilities, and of treating every individual with kindness and respect. As I reflect on my experience, I am reminded of the wise words of Maya Angelou, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\" James may have forgotten the specifics of that summer, but he will never forget how I made him feel – seen, heard, and accepted.",

His life was a testament to the transformative power of joy and resilience, and I feel privileged to have had him as a guiding light in my life. Despite facing unimaginable hardships, Ye-Ye remained an oasis of positivity, spreading happiness and kindness to all those around him. His remarkable story has taught me invaluable lessons that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.  Growing up, I was fascinated by Ye-Ye's stories of overcoming adversity. Orphaned at a young age, he was forced to fend for himself, working multiple jobs to make ends meet. Yet, despite the poverty and hardship, he never lost his optimism. He would often tell me, \"Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.\" These words of wisdom stuck with me, and I began to realize that our attitudes and reactions have the power to shape our experiences.  One of the most significant lessons I learned from Ye-Ye was the importance of gratitude. In a world that often focuses on what's lacking, he taught me to appreciate the blessings in my life. No matter how small or insignificant they may seem, he believed that every day was a gift, and every moment was an opportunity to express gratitude. I remember him saying, \"When you focus on what you have, you'll always find joy.\" This simple yet profound wisdom has helped me shift my perspective, and I now make it a point to reflect on the good things in my life every day.  Ye-Ye's resilience was another quality that inspired me. He faced numerous challenges, from poverty to illness, but he never gave up. He would often say, \"Fall seven times, stand up eight.\" This Japanese proverb became his mantra, and he lived by it. He taught me that setbacks are an inevitable part of life, but it's how we respond to them that matters. We can choose to let difficulties break us, or we can use them as opportunities to grow and learn. Ye-Ye's unwavering determination to overcome obstacles has instilled in me a similar resolve to persevere in the face of adversity.  One of the most remarkable aspects of Ye-Ye's life was his generosity. Despite having very little, he always found ways to give to others. He would often invite strangers into our home for meals, sharing what little food we had. He believed that small acts of kindness could change lives, and he lived by this principle. I remember him saying, \"When you give from the heart, you receive so much more in return.\" His selflessness has inspired me to look for opportunities to make a positive impact in my own community.  As I reflect on Ye-Ye's life, I am struck by the realization that his legacy extends far beyond his own story. He has inspired me to become a better person, to appreciate the beauty in life's simple moments, and to spread joy and kindness to those around me. His unwavering optimism has taught me to approach life with a sense of wonder and gratitude, even in the darkest of times.  In many ways, writing this essay has been a journey of self-discovery for me. As I reflect on Ye-Ye's life, I am forced to confront my own shortcomings and areas for growth. I realize that I often take things for granted, that I get caught up in my own worries and forget to appreciate the blessings in my life. Ye-Ye's story has reminded me of the importance of living in the present, of finding joy in the everyday moments, and of spreading kindness and positivity to those around me.  As I conclude this essay, I am filled with a sense of gratitude and love for my grandfather. His life was a testament to the power of joy and resilience, and I feel privileged to have had him as a guiding light in my life. I know that his legacy will continue to inspire me, and I hope that his story will touch the hearts of others as well. Ye-Ye may be gone, but his spirit lives on in me, and I will carry his lessons with me for the rest of my life.",

I was about to perform a ballet solo in front of a packed auditorium, and the thought of it was terrifying. The fear of failure, of not meeting expectations, of embarrassing myself, was suffocating. But as I took my first step onto the stage, something shifted inside of me.  I had always been afraid of taking risks, of stepping out of my comfort zone. I played it safe, stuck to what I knew, and avoided anything that might make me look foolish. But as I began to dance, I realized that playing it safe was not only boring, but it was also holding me back. I was not truly living, not truly expressing myself, when I was stuck in a cycle of fear and caution.  My teacher, a wise and kind woman who had guided me through my journey as a dancer, had always encouraged me to take risks, to push myself beyond what I thought was possible. She would say, \"The only way to truly grow is to be willing to fail.\" But it wasn't until I was standing on that stage, with the spotlight shining down on me, that I truly understood what she meant.  As I danced, I felt my fears and doubts melting away, replaced by a sense of freedom and exhilaration. I was no longer thinking about the steps, no longer worrying about making mistakes. I was fully present, fully committed to the performance. And in that moment, I felt alive.  Looking back, I realize that the experience of performing that solo was a turning point for me. It taught me that the only way to truly shine is to be willing to take risks, to step out of my comfort zone and embrace uncertainty. It taught me that playing it safe can lead to mediocrity, but taking risks can bring a sense of fulfillment and joy that is hard to find elsewhere.  As I reflect on that experience, I am reminded of the importance of embracing risk-taking in all areas of life. Whether it's trying a new hobby, speaking up in a meeting, or pursuing a dream, taking risks is essential to growth and development. It's easy to get stuck in a routine, to play it safe, but it's only by taking risks that we can truly discover our potential.  In the end, performing that solo was not just about overcoming my fear of failure, but about discovering a sense of courage and confidence that I never knew I had. It was about learning to trust myself, to trust the process, and to trust that even in the midst of uncertainty, I would emerge stronger and more resilient. And it's a lesson that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.",

        "Text": "As I sit here, reflecting on the journey of my life, I am reminded of the countless moments that have shaped me into the person I am today. From childhood memories of catching butterflies with my grandfather to embracing the beauty of life through art, relationships, and taking risks, my path has been a winding one, filled with twists and turns that have led me to where I am now. This personal narrative is a testament to the power of self-discovery, and the lessons I've learned along the way.  One of my earliest memories is of catching butterflies with my grandfather in our backyard. He would show me how to gently cup my hands around the delicate creatures, and we would watch in awe as they fluttered their colorful wings. Those moments with my grandfather taught me the importance of preserving nature's beauty, and the interconnectedness of all living things. He would often tell me, \"The beauty of life is in the little things, child. Don't forget to stop and smell the flowers.\" Those words have stuck with me throughout the years, and have influenced the way I approach life.  As I grew older, I began to explore my creative side through ballet. The discipline and precision required to master the art form taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. But it was also during this time that I faced my first major challenge: finding my own path. My parents, though well-intentioned, had always envisioned a certain future for me, one that didn't necessarily align with my own desires. I struggled to reconcile their expectations with my own dreams, and it was a difficult and confusing time.  It wasn't until I stumbled upon a science class in high school that I began to find my footing. The logic and reason of science appealed to me, and I threw myself into the subject, eventually deciding to pursue it as a career. But even as I excelled in science, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to life than just formulas and equations. I felt unfulfilled, like I was missing out on some essential part of the human experience.  It was during this time that I met someone who would change the course of my life. Her name was Sophia, and she was a free spirit, always chasing her dreams and living life on her own terms. She introduced me to the world of art, and I was immediately drawn to its beauty and expressiveness. Through Sophia, I began to see the world in a new light, one that was full of color and possibility.  But our relationship was not without its challenges. Sophia was a risk-taker, always pushing me to step outside my comfort zone and try new things. At first, I was hesitant, afraid of failure and uncertainty. But Sophia showed me that it was in those moments of uncertainty that we grow the most. She taught me that taking risks and embracing the unknown is essential to living a fulfilling life.  As I look back on my journey, I realize that it has been a winding path, filled with twists and turns. There have been moments of joy and sorrow, of triumph and defeat. But through it all, I have learned to embrace the beauty of life, to find the lessons in every experience, and to take risks when necessary. My grandfather's wisdom has stayed with me, and I have come to understand the importance of preserving nature's beauty, not just in the natural world, but in our own lives as well.  In the end, my journey of self-discovery has taught me that life is a journey, not a destination. It is in the moments of uncertainty, of risk-taking, and of embracing the unknown that we find our true selves. And it is in those moments that we come to realize the beauty of life, in all its messy, imperfect glory.",

From Albania to Greece and finally to the United States, each new destination brought with it a sense of excitement and uncertainty. But as the years went by, I began to feel a growing sense of restlessness, a deep-seated longing for a place to belong.  The concept of home is a complex one, often romanticized in literature and media as a warm and welcoming space where one can find comfort and security. But for me, home was a fleeting idea, a notion that I couldn't quite grasp. I had lived in so many different places, each with its own unique culture and rhythm, that I began to feel like a nomad, never quite fitting in.  But everything changed when my family and I arrived in Boston. There was something about the city that felt different, something that made me feel like I could finally put down roots. And then, one day, we stumbled upon a small, charming house in a quiet neighborhood. It was love at first sight. I knew, in that moment, that I had found my home.  The process of purchasing the house was not an easy one. As a non-native English speaker, I struggled to navigate the complex world of real estate, from understanding the nuances of the contract to communicating with the seller. But I was determined to make it happen. I spent hours poring over documents, practicing my English, and seeking advice from anyone who would listen.  Looking back, I realize that the journey of finding home was not just about finding a physical structure, but about discovering a sense of self. As I navigated the ups and downs of the home-buying process, I was forced to confront my own strengths and weaknesses, my own fears and doubts. I learned to persevere, to push through the challenges and setbacks, and to believe in myself.  When we finally received the keys to our new home, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that I had never felt before. It was as if I had finally found a piece of myself, a sense of belonging that I had been searching for my entire life.  As I look around my living room, I am reminded of the true meaning of home. It is not just a physical structure, but a place filled with memories, laughter, and love. It is a place where I can be myself, where I can feel safe and secure. And it is a place that I will always cherish, a reminder of the journey that brought me here.  In the end, finding home was not just about finding a place to live, but about finding a sense of purpose and belonging. It was about discovering who I am and where I belong in the world. And as I sit in my cozy living room, surrounded by the people and things I love, I know that I am finally home.",

        "Text": "As I sat amidst a tangled mess of yarn, crochet hook in hand, I couldn't help but reflect on the parallels between creating an amigurumi unicorn and my own journey of self-discovery. The process of crafting this whimsical creature was a metaphor for the twists and turns I had taken in search of my passion and purpose.  At first, I had approached self-discovery with the same enthusiasm and optimism as I had when I first picked up a crochet hook. I was determined to find my \"thing,\" the activity that would bring me joy and fulfillment. I tried my hand at various extracurriculars, from painting to playing the guitar, but each new pursuit left me feeling lost and uncertain. It was as if I was holding a ball of yarn, but instead of creating a beautiful, intricate pattern, I was only managing to knot it further.  As I struggled to find my footing, I began to feel like I was stuck in a never-ending cycle of trial and error. I would start something new, only to lose interest or feel overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of it all. It was as if I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole, and the result was a sense of frustration and disillusionment.  But as I continued to crochet, I began to realize that the journey itself, with all its knots and detours, was what was shaping me as an individual. The mistakes, the false starts, and the moments of uncertainty were all a part of the process. They were the very threads that were weaving together to form the tapestry of my life.  It wasn't until I took a step back and looked at the bigger picture that I began to see the beauty in the mess. I realized that I didn't have to have it all figured out, that I didn't have to be perfect. The journey of self-discovery was not about arriving at a destination; it was about embracing the process, with all its twists and turns.  As I looked at the amigurumi unicorn taking shape in my hands, I saw a reflection of my own growth. The yarn, once a tangled mess, was now a beautiful, intricate pattern. The unicorn's imperfections, the slight wonkiness of its horn or the unevenness of its stitches, were what made it unique and beautiful.  In the same way, my own imperfections, the mistakes and missteps I had made along the way, were what had shaped me into the person I am today. They had led me to where I am now, pursuing a path in service and environmental activism. It was not a destination, but a journey, one that was still unfolding and evolving.  As I finished the last stitch on the unicorn's ear, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had created something beautiful, not despite the mistakes and imperfections, but because of them. And in that moment, I knew that I had found my stitch, my own unique rhythm and pace.  The journey of self-discovery is a messy, winding path, full of twists and turns. But it is in embracing the mess, in acknowledging the imperfections and uncertainties, that we can find our true selves. We are all works in progress, constantly evolving and growing. And it is in the journey, not the destination, that we find our true beauty and purpose.",

        "Text": "I still remember the day I first stepped onto a squash court at the age of 11. It was a transformative experience that marked the beginning of a journey of self-discovery and growth. Through the SquashBusters program, I discovered not only a new passion but also a new side of myself. As an introverted kid, I was hesitant to try new things, fearing failure and embarrassment. But squash was different. The fast-paced and demanding nature of the sport forced me to push past my comfort zone and develop a mindset of challenging myself, both on and off the court.  As I progressed through the program, I began to notice changes in myself that extended far beyond my squash game. I became more confident, more resilient, and more open to new experiences. I started to take on leadership roles, volunteering to help with younger players and participating in community service projects. Squash had become more than just a sport – it was a catalyst for personal growth.  Looking back, I realize that embracing new opportunities and traditions has been instrumental in shaping me into the person I am today. Whether it was trying new foods, attending cultural events, or simply stepping out of my comfort zone, I learned that growth and self-discovery often lie just beyond our comfort zones. As I prepare to embark on my next journey at Hopkins, I am excited to continue exploring new interests, engaging with the campus community, and becoming an active contributor to the Hopkins family. I know that the lessons I learned on the squash court – perseverance, resilience, and a willingness to take risks – will serve me well as I navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.",

        "Text": "I still remember the countless hours I spent playing solitaire with my grandmother during summer vacations. Those lazy afternoons, surrounded by the warm glow of the sun and the soft rustle of cards, are etched in my memory like a treasured family heirloom. But what I didn't realize back then was that my grandmother was imparting a valuable lesson, one that would stay with me for the rest of my life – the importance of self-accountability.  My grandmother was a stickler for rules, and solitaire was no exception. She would meticulously lay out the cards, ensuring that each move was made with precision and care. If I accidentally drew an extra card or forgot to move a stack, she would gently correct me, reminding me that cheating was not an option. At first, I found her strictness frustrating, but as the games went on, I began to appreciate her unwavering commitment to fair play.  As I grew older, I started to realize that my grandmother's lesson extended far beyond the confines of the solitaire game. She was teaching me the value of internal competition, of pushing myself to be better, and of taking responsibility for my actions. In sports, I learned to compete with myself, striving to improve my skills and set personal bests. In academics, I developed a strong work ethic, recognizing that the only way to truly succeed was to hold myself accountable for my own learning.  But the solitaire lesson also influenced my personal relationships. I learned to be honest with myself and others, to admit when I was wrong, and to make amends when necessary. I understood that true friendship and love were built on a foundation of trust, respect, and accountability. In romantic relationships, I recognized that I couldn't blame my partner for my own shortcomings, and that taking responsibility for my actions was essential to building a healthy and strong bond.  As I reflect on my life, I am struck by the profound impact my grandmother's wisdom has had on me. Her lesson has permeated every aspect of my existence, guiding me towards a path of self-awareness, personal growth, and responsibility. I have come to realize that self-accountability is not about being perfect; it's about being honest with oneself, acknowledging mistakes, and making amends.  My grandmother's passing left a void in my life, but her legacy lives on through the lessons she taught me. Whenever I find myself struggling with self-doubt or procrastination, I remember those lazy afternoons playing solitaire, and the gentle yet firm way she would correct me. I am reminded that I am capable of so much more, that I have the power to hold myself accountable, and that I owe it to myself to strive for excellence.  In the end, the solitaire lesson is not just about a game; it's about the importance of living a life of integrity, honesty, and self-awareness. It's about recognizing that true freedom and empowerment come from taking responsibility for our actions, and that self-accountability is the key to unlocking our full potential. As I look back on those cherished memories with my grandmother, I am grateful for the wisdom she imparted, and I hope to pass it on to future generations, so that they too can benefit from the solitaire lesson.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on the journey of my life, I am reminded of a crucial lesson I learned from playing chess: to consider the entire board. This simple yet profound principle has had a profound impact on various aspects of my life, from soccer to scientific research and even music. By recognizing the importance of each piece in a puzzle, I have developed a foundational skill of analyzing the whole picture, leading to improved performance and a deeper understanding of complex systems.  Growing up, I was an avid chess player. My father, a chess enthusiast himself, taught me the game when I was just eight years old. As I progressed from novice to intermediate, I began to appreciate the intricacies of the game. I learned that each piece, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, played a vital role in the overall strategy. A pawn, often overlooked, could be the difference between checkmate and defeat. This realization sparked a profound shift in my approach to the game. I began to study the entire board, anticipating my opponent's moves and adjusting my strategy accordingly.  This lesson soon transcended the chessboard and seeped into other areas of my life. On the soccer field, I found myself adopting a similar approach. Rather than focusing solely on my own performance, I began to analyze the entire team's dynamics. I recognized how each player's strengths and weaknesses influenced the game's outcome. By understanding the interconnectedness of our positions, I improved my communication with teammates and made more informed decisions during games. This newfound awareness led to a significant improvement in our team's performance, and we went on to win several local tournaments.  The value of considering the whole picture became even more apparent during my undergraduate studies in biology. As I delved into the world of scientific research, I realized that each experiment, each data point, and each observation were interconnected pieces of a larger puzzle. By analyzing the entire research landscape, I was able to identify patterns and connections that others may have overlooked. This led to a deeper understanding of complex biological systems and ultimately contributed to several publications in reputable scientific journals.  Music, an activity I had always considered a hobby, also benefited from this strategic approach. As I began to compose my own pieces, I realized that each note, each melody, and each harmony were essential components of a larger work. By considering the entire composition, I was able to craft music that was more cohesive, more meaningful, and more impactful. This newfound understanding of music's intricate structures led to several performances at local concerts and even a few commissions.  As I look back on these experiences, I am struck by the interconnectedness of life's facets. The lesson I learned from chess – to consider the entire board – has been applied to various aspects of my life, leading to improved performance and a deeper understanding of complex systems. This reflective essay highlights the value of strategic thinking in achieving success. By recognizing the importance of each piece in a puzzle, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of the world around us. We can identify patterns, connections, and opportunities that others may overlook.  In conclusion, the whole picture is more than just the sum of its parts. It is a rich tapestry of interconnected pieces, each playing a vital role in the larger narrative. By adopting a strategic approach to life, we can unlock new levels of performance, understanding, and success. As I continue on my journey, I am reminded of the wisdom of that initial chess lesson: to consider the entire board, and in doing so, to unify life's puzzles.",

        "Text": "As I soared through the skies, the landscape below a patchwork of fields and forests, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between flying and journalism. Both require a keen sense of perspective, a ability to navigate contrasting outlooks, and a commitment to precision. My experiences as a student pilot and journalist have taught me that the most compelling stories come from embracing diverse perspectives, and that empathy and nuance are essential in storytelling.  In the cockpit, perspective is everything. A slight shift in altitude or direction can completely alter one's view of the landscape. Similarly, in journalism, perspective is crucial in shaping the narrative. As a journalist, I've learned to consider multiple viewpoints, to navigate the complexities of human experience, and to strive for objectivity. But it's not just about presenting different sides of the story; it's about actively seeking out diverse perspectives, even when they challenge our own.  During my flight training, I was often reminded of the importance of situational awareness. This meant being acutely aware of my surroundings, including other aircraft, weather conditions, and air traffic control instructions. In journalism, situational awareness translates to being attuned to the nuances of the story, to the power dynamics at play, and to the potential biases that can influence our reporting. By being mindful of these factors, I've been able to craft more nuanced and empathetic stories that capture the complexity of the human experience.  One of the most significant lessons I've learned from flying is the importance of precision. In the air, small mistakes can have devastating consequences. Similarly, in journalism, precision is crucial in conveying accurate information and avoiding harm. As a journalist, I've learned to fact-check rigorously, to verify sources, and to be transparent about my methods. This commitment to precision has earned me the trust of my sources and readers, and has allowed me to build a reputation for fairness and accuracy.  But perhaps the most valuable lesson I've learned from flying is the importance of empathy. When I'm in the cockpit, I'm acutely aware of the lives of my passengers, of the families waiting for them on the ground, and of the communities that rely on air travel. This sense of responsibility and empathy has translated to my journalism, where I strive to tell stories that capture the humanity of my subjects. By putting myself in their shoes, I've been able to craft more compassionate and nuanced stories that resonate with readers.  In an era of increasing polarization and division, the importance of empathy and nuance in storytelling cannot be overstated. By embracing diverse perspectives, journalists can help bridge the gaps between communities, foster greater understanding, and encourage dialogue among those with differing opinions. As I continue to navigate the intersection of flight and journalism, I'm reminded of the power of storytelling to bring people together, to challenge our assumptions, and to inspire empathy and compassion.  Ultimately, the most compelling stories come from those who are different from ourselves, from those who challenge our perspectives and push us out of our comfort zones. By embracing these diverse perspectives, we can create a more inclusive and nuanced narrative, one that reflects the complexity and beauty of the human experience. As I soar through the skies, I'm reminded of the importance of perspective, precision, and empathy in storytelling, and I'm inspired to continue navigating the intersection of flight and journalism, where the most compelling stories await.",

        "Text": "As I stood on the dance floor, my feet trembling with uncertainty, I never thought I'd find myself transformed into a confident performer. Yet, through a journey of struggles and triumphs, I came to realize the profound impact of collaboration on personal growth and self-discovery. Embracing the input and support of others not only helped me overcome my individual limitations but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the power of community and collaborative environments.  My struggles with dancing began with feelings of inadequacy and frustration. I was convinced that I was not cut out for dance, that my body was not flexible or coordinated enough. However, with the encouragement of my instructor and fellow dancers, I began to see that my limitations were not insurmountable. Through their guidance and feedback, I learned to listen to my body, to trust my instincts, and to move with confidence. As I improved, I realized that my growth was not solely attributed to my individual efforts, but to the collective support and motivation of my dance community.  This experience has had a profound impact on my perspective on collaboration. I have come to understand that embracing the input and support of others is essential for growth and innovation. When individuals come together, sharing their unique skills and perspectives, they create a collective strength that far surpasses individual capabilities. This realization has been reinforced through my internship at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, where I have witnessed firsthand the power of collaboration in driving innovation and progress.  The culture at Johns Hopkins, which thrives on mutual collaboration and community, resonates deeply with me. The university's commitment to interdisciplinary learning, student-led initiatives, and making a positive impact on the community aligns with my values and aspirations. I am drawn to the idea that education should be a collaborative endeavor, where students, faculty, and community members come together to share knowledge, ideas, and experiences.  As I reflect on my journey, I am reminded that growth and self-discovery are not solitary pursuits. Rather, they are facilitated by the support, guidance, and collaboration of others. Embracing collaboration has allowed me to transcend my individual limitations, to discover new strengths and abilities, and to develop a deeper appreciation for the power of community. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue dancing, learning, and growing alongside others, knowing that together, we can achieve far more than we could alone.",

        "Text": "Growing up as a Filipino in a predominantly white community, I often felt like an outsider. As an only child, I struggled to find my place in a sea of unfamiliar faces and cultural norms. My parents, who immigrated to the United States in search of a better life, did their best to instill in me a sense of pride in my heritage. However, as a child, I couldn't help but feel ashamed of my cultural identity. I longed to fit in, to be like everyone else.  I remember vividly the first time I felt embarrassed about my Filipino heritage. I was in elementary school, and my mom had packed me a lunch of adobo, a traditional Filipino dish made with chicken, vinegar, and soy sauce. As I opened my lunchbox, the pungent aroma wafted out, and my classmates began to stare. I felt my face flush with shame, and I quickly hid my lunch, pretending it was something else. From that day on, I made a conscious effort to hide my cultural identity, to assimilate into the dominant culture.  As I entered high school, however, everything changed. I was exposed to a diverse group of students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. For the first time, I saw people who looked like me, who shared my experiences and my struggles. I began to feel a sense of belonging, of being part of a community that understood me.  It was during this time that I started to get involved in extracurricular activities that celebrated diversity and cultural heritage. I joined the Asian American Student Union, where I met other students who shared my passion for cultural pride and social justice. We organized cultural events, such as the annual Lunar New Year celebration, and participated in discussions about race and identity.  Through these experiences, I began to see my cultural identity as a source of strength, rather than shame. I realized that my uniqueness was not something to be hidden, but something to be celebrated. I started to embrace my Filipino heritage, to learn more about my history and culture. I began to speak proudly about my parents' immigration story, about the struggles they faced and the sacrifices they made for me.  As I looked around at my peers, I saw that they too were struggling to find their place in the world. They too were grappling with their identities, trying to figure out where they fit in. And I realized that our uniqueness, our differences, were not weaknesses, but strengths. They were what made us special, what made us human.  My journey of self-acceptance and cultural pride has not been easy. There have been times when I felt like giving up, when I felt like I didn't belong. But through it all, I have learned that embracing my uniqueness is the key to true happiness and fulfillment. It is the key to empowering individuals to take pride in their differences, to celebrate their cultural heritage.  As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of diversity and inclusivity. I am reminded that our differences are what make us strong, what make us beautiful. And I am reminded that embracing our uniqueness is the first step towards creating a more just and equitable society, where everyone can thrive.  In the end, my journey of self-acceptance and cultural pride has taught me that being different is not something to be ashamed of, but something to be celebrated. It has taught me that embracing my uniqueness is the key to true happiness and fulfillment. And it has taught me that our differences are what make us strong, what make us human.",

        "Text": "I still remember the day I decided to join a girls' field hockey practice. It was an unconventional decision, to say the least. I had never held a hockey stick before, and the thought of running around a field with a group of strangers made my stomach turn. But something about the idea resonated with me. Perhaps it was the thrill of trying something new, or the desire to push past my comfort zone. Whatever the reason, I laced up my sneakers and took a deep breath, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery.  As I stepped onto the field, I was hit with a wave of anxiety. The other girls seemed to know exactly what they were doing, effortlessly swinging their sticks and chasing after the ball. I, on the other hand, felt like a clumsy outsider, struggling to even hold my stick correctly. But as the practice progressed, something shifted inside of me. I began to focus less on my mistakes and more on the joy of learning something new. I started to laugh at my own clumsiness, and to appreciate the camaraderie of my teammates.  As I continued to attend practices, I noticed a change within myself. I was becoming more confident, more willing to take risks and try new things. This mindset began to seep into other areas of my life, too. I started to explore new interests, like playing soccer and taking art classes. I approached academics with a newfound sense of curiosity, eager to delve deeper into subjects that had previously intimidated me. And in social interactions, I found myself being more outgoing and open, forming new friendships and connections with people from all walks of life.  The most significant realization I had, however, was that it was okay to not be good at something. In fact, it was more than okay – it was necessary. By embracing the unconventional and trying new things, I was able to discover a sense of joy and fulfillment that I had never experienced before. I learned that success wasn't about achieving perfection, but about embracing the process of learning and growing.  Looking back, I am grateful for that initial spark of curiosity that led me to join the field hockey practice. It was a small act of bravery that set off a chain reaction of self-discovery and growth. I learned that embracing the unconventional is not just about trying new things, but about adopting a mindset of curiosity and risk-taking. It's about being open to new experiences, and to the possibility of failure. And it's about discovering the joy and fulfillment that comes from exploring new possibilities, and from being true to oneself.",

        "Text": "As a black woman, I've always been drawn to the world of music, where rhythm and melody have the power to transcend boundaries and defy expectations. Growing up, I found solace in the sounds of ballroom and pop music, genres that spoke to my soul and ignited a passion within me. However, my love for these genres was met with confusion and criticism from my peers, who saw my musical tastes as a betrayal of my black roots. They labeled me an \"Oreo,\" a term that implied I was somehow less black because of my musical preferences.  At first, I was taken aback by these criticisms. I didn't understand why my love for ballroom and pop music was seen as a rejection of my cultural heritage. I felt like I was being forced to choose between my passion for music and my identity as a black woman. But as I delved deeper into the world of music, I began to realize that style and stereotype are two very different things.  As a clarinet player, I learned to appreciate the nuances of different genres and the ways in which they could be blended and reinterpreted. I discovered that ballroom and pop music, often seen as antithetical to traditional black music, were actually rooted in the same African diasporic traditions that had given birth to jazz, blues, and funk. I realized that my love for these genres was not a rejection of my blackness, but rather an extension of it – a celebration of the diversity and complexity of black cultural expression.  Through my journey as a musician, I learned to distinguish between style and stereotype, embracing my unique expression and refusing to be defined by societal expectations. I took ownership of my musical interests, reclaiming the term \"Oreo\" and redefining what it means to be a black woman. I realized that being an \"Oreo\" wasn't about betraying my black roots, but about embracing the multiplicity of my identity and celebrating my individuality.  As I looked around at my peers, I saw that we were all struggling to define ourselves in the face of societal expectations. We were all trying to navigate the complex web of identity, culture, and stereotype, searching for a sense of belonging and authenticity. And I realized that the only way to truly find ourselves was to defy the expectations of others and embrace our own unique rhythms.  For me, music became a powerful tool for self-expression and empowerment. It allowed me to tap into my creativity, to explore the depths of my identity, and to find my own voice. Through music, I was able to reclaim my sense of self, to redefine what it means to be a black woman, and to celebrate my individuality.  In the end, embracing my rhythm was not just about embracing my love for ballroom and pop music – it was about embracing my entire self. It was about refusing to be bound by societal expectations and stereotypes, and instead, forging my own path and creating my own identity. As I look back on my journey, I am reminded that true freedom and empowerment come from embracing our uniqueness, celebrating our individuality, and defying the expectations of others.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on my life's journey, I am reminded of the numerous challenges that have shaped me into the person I am today. From struggling with a childhood math packet to immigrating to America with my family, I have learned valuable lessons about perseverance, commitment, and ambition. These values, instilled in me by my parents, have been instrumental in helping me navigate academic and personal obstacles, ultimately leading to my career aspiration in surgery.  Growing up, I was not naturally inclined towards math. In fact, I would often struggle to complete my math homework, and my parents would have to sit with me for hours to ensure I understood the concepts. However, my parents' perseverance and commitment to my education never wavered. They would patiently explain the problems, encouraging me to keep trying until I got it right. Their unwavering support taught me that with persistence and hard work, I could overcome any obstacle.  When my family immigrated to America, we faced a new set of challenges. My parents had to start from scratch, learning a new language and adapting to a new culture. Despite the difficulties, they remained committed to providing a better life for our family. Their ambition inspired me to work hard and pursue my dreams, even when the journey seemed uncertain.  As I entered high school, I began to face new challenges. I struggled to balance my academic workload with extracurricular activities, and at times, felt overwhelmed. However, I drew on the lessons I had learned from my parents. I persevered, committing to my studies and seeking help when needed. I also discovered my passion for the medical field, which further motivated me to work hard and pursue my goals.

        "Text": "My Chuck Taylor shoes, once pristine and spotless, now tell a story of transformation, reflecting the journey of self-discovery and growth I've undergone. From the bustling streets of Houston to the eclectic vibe of Portland, my experiences have shaped me into a unique individual, confident in expressing my passions and beliefs. This journey has taught me to appreciate diverse perspectives, embracing contradictions and recognizing the importance of listening to the other side.  Growing up in Houston, I was surrounded by a predominantly conservative community. My family and friends held strong opinions, and I often found myself conforming to their views, afraid to rock the boat. However, as I began to explore the city, I stumbled upon pockets of liberalism, from street art to underground music scenes. These encounters sparked a curiosity within me, and I started to engage with individuals from different walks of life. I learned to listen, to ask questions, and to understand the reasoning behind their beliefs.  One particular encounter stands out – a conversation with a local artist who had transformed a abandoned building into a vibrant mural. We discussed everything from politics to social justice, and I was struck by the passion and conviction in his voice. Though our views differed, I found myself drawn to his energy and creativity. This interaction marked a turning point; I realized that there was beauty in diversity, and that embracing contradictions could lead to growth and understanding.  When I moved to Portland, I was immersed in a liberal community, where activism and social awareness were woven into everyday life. I was initially intimidated, feeling like an outsider in a sea of like-minded individuals. However, as I explored the city, I discovered a thriving conservative community, hidden beneath the surface. I attended rallies, listened to speeches, and engaged in debates, determined to understand the perspectives of those who differed from me.  Through these experiences, I developed a nonpartisan and open-minded ideology, recognizing that the truth often lies in the gray area between extremes. I learned to appreciate the nuances of each perspective, rather than simply adopting a label or ideology. My Chuck Taylor shoes, once a symbol of conformity, now reflected my eclectic nature – a mishmash of liberal and conservative views, with a dash of creativity and curiosity.  As I prepare to enter college, I'm aware that my journey is far from over. I'm eager to engage with individuals from diverse backgrounds, to listen to their stories, and to share my own. I believe that embracing contradictions is essential in today's polarized world, where echo chambers and social media bubbles often dictate our interactions. By doing so, we can break down barriers, foster empathy, and inspire others to do the same.  My worn and eclectic Chuck Taylor shoes will accompany me on this journey, a reminder of the power of open-mindedness and the importance of listening to the other side. As I walk through the doors of my college campus, I'm ready to bring diversity of thought, to educate others on the value of embracing contradictions, and to continue growing into a unique individual, unafraid to express my passions and beliefs.",

        "Text": "I still remember the night I attended a Tom Petty concert at a crowded hall in Los Angeles. As the lights dimmed, and the iconic American rocker took the stage, the energy in the room was palpable. The audience, a diverse mix of young and old, was united in their enthusiasm for the music. As Petty launched into his hit single \"Free Fallin',\" the crowd erupted into a collective sing-along, their voices blending together in perfect harmony. In that moment, I felt a deep sense of connection to the strangers around me, a sense of community that transcended our individual experiences.  As I reflected on that concert, I began to realize that the power of art to connect people across time and space is a profound and universal force. Through music, literature, and other forms of creative expression, we can tap into the emotions and lessons of others, empathize with one another, and find common ground. By embracing the art of others, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, ultimately revealing the interconnectedness of human experience.  One of the most significant ways that art connects us is by providing a shared emotional experience. When we engage with a work of art, whether it's a song, a novel, or a painting, we are able to tap into the emotions and experiences of the creator. This emotional resonance allows us to connect with others who have had similar experiences, creating a sense of community and understanding. For example, a song like Petty's \"Refugee\" speaks to the universal human desire for freedom and escape, allowing listeners to connect with the emotions and struggles of others.  Art also has the power to break down boundaries and challenge our assumptions. By exposing us to different perspectives and experiences, art can help us to see the world in a new light, fostering empathy and understanding. For instance, literature has the ability to transport us to different cultures and time periods, allowing us to walk in the shoes of others and gain a deeper understanding of their experiences. Works like Toni Morrison's \"Beloved\" or James Baldwin's \"Giovanni's Room\" offer powerful explorations of the African American experience, challenging readers to confront their own biases and assumptions.  Furthermore, art has the ability to preserve and transmit cultural heritage across time and space. From the ancient Greek tragedies of Sophocles to the jazz standards of Louis Armstrong, art has played a crucial role in capturing the essence of human experience and passing it down to future generations. By engaging with these works, we can gain a deeper understanding of our shared cultural history, connecting us to those who came before us.  In addition, art has the power to inspire and motivate us, driving us to make positive change in the world. From the protest songs of Bob Dylan to the activist art of Ai Weiwei, creative expression has long been a powerful tool for social commentary and critique. By engaging with art that challenges the status quo, we can be inspired to take action, working towards a more just and equitable society.  Finally, art has the ability to provide solace and comfort in times of hardship and uncertainty. In the aftermath of tragedy or loss, art can offer a sense of hope and renewal, reminding us of our shared humanity and the beauty of the world around us. From the elegiac poetry of W.H. Auden to the soaring melodies of Beethoven's symphonies, art has the power to console and uplift us, reminding us that we are not alone in our struggles.  In conclusion, the harmony of human experience is a profound and beautiful thing, and art plays a crucial role in connecting us across time and space. By embracing the creative expressions of others, we can tap into the emotions and lessons of others, empathize with one another, and find common ground. Through art, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, ultimately revealing the interconnectedness of human experience. As I looked around that crowded concert hall, I knew that I was not alone in my appreciation for Tom Petty's music, and that in that moment, we were all connected in a shared experience of joy and community.",

        "Text": "As a child, I was fascinated by the colorful illustrations in Richard Scarry's \"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go.\" Among the busy scenes of vehicles and machinery, one peculiar image caught my attention: a pickle truck. I was enamored with the idea of driving a giant pickle on wheels, delivering tangy treats to people everywhere. It was a whimsical dream, but it sparked a sense of adventure and curiosity that would stay with me for years to come.  As I grew older, my interests began to shift. I became fascinated with the natural world and the intricate mechanisms that governed it. I devoured books on science and history, marveling at the wonders of the human body and the mysteries of the universe. But it wasn't until I stumbled upon an article about gold nanoparticles that my true passion was ignited.  The concept of tiny, shimmering particles that could be used to combat cancer was nothing short of miraculous. I was captivated by the potential of nanomedicine to revolutionize healthcare and improve lives. I spent hours poring over research papers and articles, teaching myself about the properties of gold nanoparticles and their applications in medicine.  My newfound passion led me to pursue a research experience at Johns Hopkins University, where I was immersed in a world of cutting-edge science and innovation. Working alongside talented researchers and scientists, I contributed to projects that explored the use of nanoparticles in cancer treatment. It was an exhilarating experience, but it also revealed a new passion within me: scientific communication.  As I delved deeper into the world of nanomedicine, I realized that the most groundbreaking discoveries were often inaccessible to the general public. Scientific jargon and complex concepts created a barrier between researchers and the people who needed their work the most. I became determined to bridge this gap, to share the wonders of science with others in a way that was engaging and easy to understand.  Through my research experience, I discovered the joy of writing about science in an accessible way. I crafted articles and blog posts that explained complex concepts in simple terms, using anecdotes and analogies to make the subject matter more relatable. It was a challenging but rewarding task, and I soon found myself drawn to the world of science writing.  Looking back on my journey, I am struck by the winding path that led me from pickle trucks to nanomedicine. It was a journey of self-discovery, marked by twists and turns that ultimately revealed my true passions. I learned that embracing the process of searching for one's passions is just as important as the destination itself.  In a world where scientific literacy is increasingly crucial, I believe that sharing scientific knowledge with others is a vital pursuit. By making science accessible and engaging, we can empower people to make informed decisions about their health, their environment, and their communities. As I continue on my path, I am committed to using my skills to promote scientific understanding and inspire others to explore the wonders of the natural world.  In the end, my childhood dream of driving a pickle truck may seem far removed from my current passion for nanomedicine and scientific communication. But it was that initial spark of curiosity that set me on a journey of discovery, a journey that continues to this day.",

        "Text": "As I walked through the gates of our one-acre farm, managed by my school, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and responsibility. The farm, which was an integral part of our educational curriculum, was more than just a plot of land – it was a living, breathing classroom where theory met practice. Through my experiences as a farmer, I have come to understand the importance of connecting education with real-world experience, and how this intersection can shape our perspectives, foster curiosity, and inspire meaningful contributions to our communities.  From planting seeds to harvesting crops, I have learned to appreciate the hidden processes that make up daily life. The farm has taught me that education is not just about intellectual pursuits, but also about understanding the world around us and our place within it. As I worked alongside my peers, we were not just learning about photosynthesis, soil composition, and crop rotation – we were experiencing the tangible results of our labor. We were witnessing the transformation of seeds into fruits and vegetables, and understanding the intricate web of relationships between the natural world and human society.  One of the most significant lessons I learned on the farm was the value of patience and persistence. Planting seeds, nurturing them, and waiting for them to grow was a slow and deliberate process that required dedication and attention to detail. It was not unlike the learning process itself, where knowledge and skills are cultivated over time through effort and perseverance. The farm taught me that education is not a quick fix or a one-time achievement, but rather a lifelong journey of growth and discovery.  Moreover, the farm has helped me to see the application of my classroom learning in a tangible setting. I was no longer just memorizing formulas and equations; I was using them to calculate the optimal irrigation system for our crops. I was no longer just reading about the importance of biodiversity; I was witnessing it firsthand as we planted a variety of crops to attract beneficial insects and pollinators. The farm has piqued my curiosity, inspiring me to explore the connections between seemingly disparate subjects and to seek out new knowledge and experiences.  As I reflect on my journey, I realize that the intersection of education and experience is not limited to the farm. It is a fundamental principle that can be applied to all aspects of life. Whether it is through internships, volunteer work, or simply exploring our own communities, we can cultivate connections between what we learn in the classroom and the world around us. By doing so, we can develop a deeper appreciation for the complexities and challenges of real-world problems, and we can become more informed, engaged, and empathetic citizens.  In conclusion, my experiences as a farmer on our school's one-acre plot have taught me the importance of cultivating connection between education and experience. The farm has shown me that learning is not just about intellectual pursuits, but also about understanding the world around us and contributing to our communities in meaningful ways. As I move forward in my academic and professional journey, I am committed to maintaining this connection, seeking out new experiences and knowledge that will allow me to make a positive impact on the world.",

        "Text": "The art of storytelling is a powerful tool that allows individuals to share their experiences, emotions, and perspectives with others. Through the act of storytelling, people can connect with one another, build relationships, and foster empathy and understanding. In my project, I explored the stories and art behind the permanent transformations of personal landscapes of women with tattoos. Through informal interviews, I had the opportunity to engage with a diverse range of women, from teenagers to senior citizens, and uncover the complex relationships between their personal and public identities.  As I sat down with each woman, I asked them to share the stories behind their tattoos. At first, some were hesitant, unsure of how to articulate the emotions and experiences that had led them to get inked. But as they began to speak, their words flowed like rivers, carrying with them tales of struggle, triumph, and transformation. I listened as they shared stories of cancer, of coming out, of sexual assault, and of mental illness. I listened as they spoke of their perceptions of femininity and human interaction.  One woman, a survivor of breast cancer, showed me her tattoo of a phoenix rising from the ashes. She told me of the fear and uncertainty that had gripped her during her diagnosis and treatment, but also of the strength and resilience that had emerged as she battled the disease. Another woman, a young lesbian, shared with me her tattoo of a rainbow-colored heart, symbolizing her journey of self-acceptance and love. A senior citizen, who had lived through the trauma of sexual assault, showed me her tattoo of a lotus flower, representing her growth and healing.  As I listened to these stories, I was struck by the complexity and richness of the women's experiences. Their tattoos were not just mere decorations on their bodies; they were testaments to their strength, courage, and creativity. They were symbols of their struggles and triumphs, of their vulnerabilities and resilience. Through their stories, I gained insight into the intricate web of relationships between their personal and public identities.  But this project was not just about uncovering the stories behind the tattoos; it was also about the art of storytelling itself. I learned that storytelling is not just about conveying information, but about creating a connection with the listener. It is about empathy, understanding, and compassion. As I listened to the women's stories, I felt a deep sense of connection with them, a sense of understanding that went beyond words.  Through this project, I also learned about the power of relationships and community. As I shared the stories of the women with others, I saw how they resonated with people, how they sparked conversations and connections. I saw how the art of storytelling could bring people together, creating a sense of belonging and understanding.  In the end, this project was not just about the women with tattoos; it was about the art of storytelling itself. It was about the power of stories to connect us, to inspire us, and to transform us. As I reflect on this project, I am reminded of the strength and creativity of the women I met, and of the importance of embracing the unknown. By turning an idea into a substantive reality, I was able to showcase the remarkable stories of these women, and to learn about the art of storytelling in the process.",

        "Text": "The Power of Words: Flavor, Laughter, and Connection  Words have a profound impact on our lives, often in ways we don't even realize. They have the power to evoke emotions, create meaning, and bring people together. In my life, words have been a source of comfort, connection, and joy. From lively games of Bananagrams with my family to poignant moments of cultural and linguistic connection, I have come to appreciate the versatility and transformative potential of language.  Growing up, our family game nights were always filled with laughter and excitement, thanks to our love of words. Bananagrams, a fast-paced word game, was a staple in our household. My siblings and I would spend hours competing against each other, our minds racing to come up with the perfect words to outdo our opponents. These games not only brought us closer together but also instilled in me a love for language and its ability to bring people together.  Beyond the realm of games, words have also played a significant role in shaping my cultural identity. As a child of immigrant parents, I have often found myself navigating the complexities of cultural and linguistic differences. However, it was through words that I was able to connect with my heritage and forge a deeper understanding of my parents' experiences. The smell of my mother's cooking, the sound of my father's laughter, and the taste of traditional dishes all evoke powerful emotions and memories, which I have learned to describe and share with others through the power of words.  Furthermore, words have allowed me to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. Whether it's through sharing stories, exchanging recipes, or simply engaging in conversations, language has facilitated understanding and fostered meaningful relationships in my life. The ability to communicate across cultural divides has been a source of comfort and empowerment, enabling me to build bridges and forge connections that transcend borders and boundaries.  In conclusion, words have the power to shape our relationships, our world, and our very selves. They have the ability to evoke emotions, create meaning, and bring people together. Through my experiences, I have come to appreciate the transformative potential of language and its ability to craft humor, describe sensory experiences, and facilitate understanding across cultural divides. As I continue to navigate the complexities of life, I am reminded of the significance of words and the impact they can have on our lives.",

        "Text": "The Hipster Paradox: Unpacking the Contradictions of Nonconformity  In the midst of a cultural landscape where individuality is touted as the ultimate virtue, I found myself entangled in a web of contradictions. As a self-proclaimed nonconformist, I sought to stand out from the crowd, to reject the mainstream and forge my own path. Yet, in doing so, I unwittingly conformed to a predetermined ideal – the \"hipster\" subculture. This paradox has haunted me, prompting a journey of introspection and self-discovery.  Growing up, I was drawn to the allure of nonconformity. I devoured books on counterculture, attended underground music festivals, and sported thrift store attire. I wanted to be seen as different, as someone who refused to be bound by societal norms. The \"hipster\" label seemed like the perfect fit – a badge of honor that signified my rejection of the mainstream. I eagerly adopted the aesthetic, the music, and the attitude, convinced that I was part of a movement that valued individuality above all else.  However, as I delved deeper into the world of hipsterdom, I began to notice a disturbing trend. Everyone looked the same – skinny jeans, cardigans, and perfectly imperfect haircuts. The music was the same – indie folk and electro-pop. The conversations were the same – discussions about the merits of artisanal coffee and the evils of corporate capitalism. It dawned on me that, in my pursuit of nonconformity, I had inadvertently conformed to a set of predetermined norms. The \"hipster\" ideal had become a straitjacket, suffocating my individuality beneath a layer of pretentiousness.  This realization sparked a crisis of identity. If I wasn't a hipster, then who was I? What did I stand for? I began to question the motivations behind my actions, the reasons why I had so eagerly adopted a label that seemed to define me. The answer, I realized, lay in my desire for validation. I wanted to be seen as cool, as someone who was \"in the know.\" I wanted to be part of a community that shared my values, even if those values were shallow and superficial.  As I grappled with these contradictions, I came to a profound realization – true self-identity must precede external labels. I couldn't define myself by a predetermined construct, no matter how appealing it seemed. I had to look inward, to uncover the values, passions, and beliefs that made me unique. It was a daunting task, one that required me to shed the skin of my hipster persona and confront the uncertainty of self-discovery.  In the end, I emerged from this journey with a newfound sense of self-awareness. I realized that individuality is not about conforming to a particular ideal, but about embracing our quirks, our flaws, and our contradictions. It's about acknowledging that we are complex, multifaceted beings, incapable of being reduced to a single label or category. The \"hipster\" paradox, I discovered, was not a paradox at all – it was a symptom of a deeper issue, one that plagues us all: the desire to fit in, to be accepted, and to be loved.  As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of self-awareness in navigating the complexities of identity. It's easy to get caught up in the allure of a particular label or subculture, to lose ourselves in the pursuit of validation and acceptance. But true freedom lies in embracing our individuality, in celebrating our differences, and in refusing to be bound by the constraints of external expectations. The hipster paradox, I hope, will serve as a reminder to always question, to always challenge, and to always seek the truth – even if that truth is uncomfortable, uncertain, and complex.",

        "Text": "Growing up in a large, chaotic family was not always easy. In fact, it was often downright overwhelming. But looking back, I realize that those formative years taught me valuable lessons about adaptability, resilience, and the importance of embracing uncertainty. My family life was a masterclass in unpredictability, and it prepared me for the twists and turns that life would inevitably throw my way.  One memorable experience that stands out is the time I accidentally locked myself in our family van. I must have been around eight years old, and my siblings and I were fighting over who got to sit in the front seat. In the chaos, I somehow managed to lock the doors, trapping myself inside. My parents were nowhere to be found, and my siblings were too busy arguing to notice my predicament. I was stuck, with no clear way out.  At first, I panicked. I pounded on the windows, screaming for someone to let me out. But as the minutes ticked by, I realized that no one was coming to my rescue. I had to take matters into my own hands. I surveyed my surroundings, looking for any possible means of escape. That's when I spotted a small window in the back of the van that was slightly ajar. With a surge of determination, I squeezed through the narrow opening and tumbled out onto the driveway.  That experience taught me a valuable lesson about thinking on my feet and finding creative solutions to unexpected problems. It also taught me that sometimes, you have to take a deep breath and trust that you'll figure things out, even when everything seems impossible.  Growing up in a chaotic family forced me to develop these skills out of necessity. With multiple siblings vying for attention, resources were scarce, and conflicts were inevitable. But in the midst of all that chaos, I learned to adapt, to negotiate, and to thrive in situations beyond my control. I learned to prioritize, to problem-solve, and to think creatively.  But perhaps the most important lesson I learned was the importance of letting go of the need for order and perfection. In a family where things rarely went according to plan, I had to learn to roll with the punches. I had to learn to be okay with the unexpected, to embrace the unknown, and to face each new day with confidence and optimism.  This lesson has served me well in adulthood, where the unpredictability of life can be overwhelming. Whether it's dealing with a sudden change in plans, a unexpected setback, or a major life transition, I've learned to face each challenge with a sense of preparedness and resilience. I've learned to trust in my ability to adapt, to problem-solve, and to find a way forward, no matter what obstacles come my way.  In a world that is often chaotic and unpredictable, I believe that this ability to embrace uncertainty is a vital skill. It allows us to approach each new day with a sense of curiosity, rather than fear. It allows us to see challenges as opportunities, rather than threats. And it allows us to live with a sense of freedom, rather than constraint.  As I look back on my childhood, I realize that growing up in a chaotic family was not a curse, but a blessing in disguise. It taught me to be flexible, to be resourceful, and to be open to the unexpected. It taught me to embrace chaos, rather than trying to control it. And it taught me to live with a sense of confidence, optimism, and preparedness, no matter what life throws my way.",

        "Text": "As I sit with a pen in hand, staring at a blank sheet of paper, I am transported to a world of creativity and self-expression. The act of handwriting is more than just a means of communication; it is a reflection of my character, a representation of my knowledge, and a window into my soul. The meticulous construction of letters and characters is a dance of sorts, a harmonious blend of art and intellect that brings me a sense of satisfaction and connection to the ancient art of writing.  For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by the beauty of handwriting. As a child, I would spend hours practicing my cursive, carefully crafting each letter to perfection. My parents, both educators, instilled in me a love for learning and a passion for the written word. They encouraged me to explore the world of literature, to devour books of all genres, and to express myself through writing. And so, I did. I wrote stories, poems, and essays, each one a reflection of my growing knowledge and understanding of the world around me.  As I grew older, my appreciation for handwriting only deepened. I began to notice the unique characteristics of each person's script, the way a single letter could reveal a person's personality, their background, and their values. I saw how a well-crafted sentence could convey emotion, evoke empathy, and spark imagination. I realized that handwriting was not just a means of communication, but a form of self-expression, a way to convey one's thoughts, feelings, and experiences to others.  But handwriting is more than just a form of self-expression; it is also a reflection of our knowledge. Each stroke, each letter, and each word builds upon one another to convey meaning and beauty. The way we form our letters, the spacing between our words, and the flow of our sentences all reveal our understanding of the world around us. A well-written sentence is not just aesthetically pleasing; it is also a testament to our knowledge, our critical thinking skills, and our ability to communicate complex ideas.  As I reflect on my own academic journey, I am reminded of the diverse subjects I have studied, from literature to philosophy, from history to science. Each subject has its own unique language, its own set of rules and conventions, and its own beauty. And yet, despite these differences, handwriting remains a constant, a thread that weaves together my passion for learning, my conviction in the importance of knowledge, and my diverse academic interests.  Handwriting is also a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth. As I reflect on my own handwriting, I am reminded of my strengths and weaknesses, my passions and interests. I see how my script has evolved over time, how it has become more confident, more expressive, and more reflective of my character. I see how handwriting has helped me to process my emotions, to clarify my thoughts, and to express myself in ways that spoken words often cannot.  In an age of technology, where keyboards and touchscreens dominate our lives, the beauty of handwriting is often overlooked. We are encouraged to type faster, to communicate more efficiently, and to prioritize speed over style. But in doing so, we risk losing the very essence of handwriting, the unique characteristics that make it a reflection of our character and a representation of our knowledge.  As I finish writing this essay, I am reminded of the power of handwriting to connect us to our past, to our present, and to each other. It is a reminder that knowledge and character are not just abstract concepts, but tangible, beautiful things that can be seen and felt in the curves and lines of our script. And so, I will continue to cherish the beauty of handwriting, to cultivate it, and to celebrate it as a reflection of my knowledge and character.",

        "Text": "I still vividly remember the day I failed my high school math exam. It was a moment that sparked a heated debate in my family about the relevance and difficulty of mathematics. My parents, both math enthusiasts, were devastated by my failure, while I was convinced that math was an unnecessary and overly challenging subject. I argued that I would never need it in real life, and that it was only useful for a select few who were naturally gifted in the field. My parents, on the other hand, insisted that math was essential for problem-solving and critical thinking, and that it was a fundamental skill that would benefit me in the long run.  At the time, I was adamant that I was right. I saw math as a obstacle that was holding me back, rather than a tool that could help me succeed. But little did I know, my perspective was about to take a dramatic turn. A few months later, I participated in a business case competition, where teams were tasked with analyzing a company's financial data and presenting a strategy for growth. I was hesitant at first, given my math phobia, but I was determined to push past my comfort zone and give it a try.  As I delved deeper into the competition, I began to realize the practical value of mathematical processes. I saw how numbers and data could be used to tell a company's story, to identify areas of improvement, and to inform strategic decisions. I was amazed by how math could be used to drive business outcomes, and how it was an essential tool for anyone looking to succeed in the industry. For the first time, I saw math not as a abstract concept, but as a powerful tool that could be applied to real-world problems.  My experience in the business case competition was transformative. It gave me the courage to re-embrace mathematics, and to recognize that my previous failure was not a reflection of my intellectual abilities, but rather a lack of understanding and appreciation for the subject. I began to see math not as a barrier, but as an opportunity to learn and grow. I started to take math classes again, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed them. I realized that math was not just about solving equations and memorizing formulas, but about developing a logical and analytical mindset.  As I reflect on my journey, I am reminded that personal growth and success are not limited by intellectual constraints, but rather by one's willingness to seize opportunities. I could have easily given up on math, and convinced myself that I was not cut out for it. But instead, I chose to face my fears, and to push past my comfort zone. I chose to see math as an opportunity, rather than an obstacle.  Today, I am proud to say that I am a math enthusiast, and that I see the value and beauty in mathematical processes. I recognize that math is not just a subject in school, but a way of thinking, a way of problem-solving, and a way of understanding the world around us. I am grateful for that pivotal moment in my life, when I failed my math exam, because it sparked a journey of self-discovery and growth. It taught me that with courage and determination, I can overcome any obstacle, and that the mathematics of opportunity is always within reach.",

        "Text": "The diagnosis of cancer in a loved one is a life-altering event that can evoke a range of emotions, from shock and denial to fear and despair. When my family member, Kiersten, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, I was suddenly thrust into a world of uncertainty and chaos. As I navigated the challenges of caregiving, I was forced to confront my own limitations and biases, and in the process, I discovered the transformative power of compassion and empathy.  Initially, I approached Kiersten's illness with a problem-solving mindset, armed with an arsenal of medical jargon and treatment options. I was determined to \"fix\" the situation, to find a solution to this daunting problem. But as I delved deeper into the world of cancer, I realized that my intellectual understanding of the disease was woefully inadequate. I was unprepared for the emotional toll that cancer would take on Kiersten, on our family, and on me.  As I watched Kiersten undergo grueling treatments and endure unimaginable pain, I was struck by her courage and resilience. Her bravery in the face of adversity inspired me to re-examine my own values and priorities. I began to realize that my problem-solving approach was not only ineffective but also inadequate. Cancer was not just a medical condition; it was a deeply personal and emotional experience that required empathy, compassion, and solidarity.  As I learned to navigate the complexities of caregiving, I discovered the importance of emotional support and loyalty. I realized that Kiersten's battle with cancer was not just about her physical health but also about her emotional well-being. I learned to listen, to validate her feelings, and to offer comfort and reassurance. I discovered that the simplest acts of kindness – a gentle touch, a listening ear, or a comforting word – could be incredibly powerful in alleviating her suffering.  Through Kiersten's journey, I underwent a profound transformation. I shifted from a fearful, problem-solving mindset to a more empathetic and selfless individual. I learned to help others with my heart, not just my intellect. I discovered that compassion was not just about feeling sorry for someone but about being present, about being willing to walk alongside them in their darkest moments.  Kiersten's courage and resilience taught me that cancer is not just a disease; it is a journey of self-discovery and growth. It is an opportunity to re-examine our values, to confront our fears, and to discover our capacity for empathy and compassion. As I reflect on my experience, I am reminded of the power of human connection and the importance of emotional support in the face of adversity.  In the end, Kiersten's battle with cancer was not just about her; it was about me, about us, and about the transformative power of compassion and empathy. As I look back on this journey, I am grateful for the unseen lessons that cancer taught me. I am grateful for the opportunity to discover my own capacity for empathy and selflessness. And I am grateful for Kiersten's courage and resilience, which inspired me to become a better, more compassionate person.",

        "Text": "The scent of jasmine and the sound of gentle humming still linger in my memory, transporting me back to a time when my grandmother's warm presence filled my life. Her passing due to liver cancer left an unfillable void, and I was consumed by guilt and anger. I couldn't help but wonder if there was something I could have done to prevent her suffering. As I struggled to come to terms with my loss, I found solace in education, believing that academic perfection would be my redemption.  I poured my heart and soul into my studies, determined to make my grandmother proud. I spent countless hours poring over textbooks, attending extra tutoring sessions, and sacrificing sleep to ensure I achieved top grades. However, as time passed, I began to realize that my relentless pursuit of academic excellence was not bringing me the sense of fulfillment I had hoped for. The pressure to perform only led to anxiety and burnout, and I felt like I was losing myself in the process.  It wasn't until I started volunteering at a cancer treatment center that I discovered a new sense of purpose. Witnessing the bravery and resilience of patients battling cancer, I realized that my grandmother's legacy was not in my grades, but in the positive impact I could have on others. I saw firsthand the emotional toll that cancer takes on individuals and their loved ones, and I knew I wanted to make a difference.  As I interacted with patients, I began to understand the importance of emotional support and mental strength in their journey. I saw how a simple conversation, a listening ear, or a comforting smile could bring hope and comfort to those struggling. I realized that my grandmother's passing was not in vain, and that I could honor her memory by helping others navigate their own struggles.  My experience at the cancer treatment center sparked a newfound passion within me – to become an oncologist. I want to provide more than just medical treatment to my patients; I want to offer emotional support, empathy, and a sense of hope. I want to help them find meaning in life beyond their illness, just as I have found meaning in my own life through my grandmother's passing.  As I reflect on my journey, I am reminded that healing is not a linear process. It is a winding path filled with twists and turns, and it is okay to take detours. Losing my grandmother was a devastating blow, but it also taught me the value of compassion, empathy, and the importance of finding purpose in the face of loss.  In the end, my grandmother's passing was not just a loss, but a catalyst for growth and self-discovery. It led me to unearth a new path, one that is filled with meaning, purpose, and a sense of responsibility to my fellow humans. As I embark on this new journey, I am filled with a sense of excitement and anticipation, knowing that I have the power to make a difference in the lives of others.",

        "Text": "The Flavor of Memory: A Granddaughter's Legacy  The smell of garlic and ginger wafts through my kitchen, transporting me back to my grandmother's cozy home, where the art of kimchi-making was a cherished tradition. My grandmother's hands, wrinkled and worn, would move deftly, chopping, mixing, and seasoning the ingredients with a precision that only came from years of practice. As I watched, mesmerized, she would transform the humble cabbage into a flavorful, spicy, and tangy delight. Those moments, spent side by side, are etched in my memory like the intricate patterns on a Korean ceramic vase.  But Alzheimer's disease crept in, insidiously, stealing my grandmother's memories, one by one. The hands that once moved with confidence now fumbled, unsure. The eyes that sparkled with warmth now gazed blankly, as if searching for a lost thread. The kimchi, once a symbol of love and tradition, became a distant memory, a fleeting glimpse of a life left behind. I felt helpless, watching my grandmother's identity unravel, like the threads of a tapestry slowly coming undone.  And yet, on one remarkable day, something shifted. My grandmother, lost in the haze of her disease, suddenly sat up straight, her eyes focusing on the kitchen counter, where a batch of kimchi ingredients lay waiting. Without a word, she began to chop, her hands moving with a familiar rhythm, as if the memories had been waiting, patiently, to resurface. The room was silent, except for the sound of her knife slicing through the vegetables, and the soft murmur of her humming. In that moment, I saw my grandmother, whole and complete, her identity intact.  As I reflect on that poignant moment, I realize that writing has become my way of capturing and preserving memories, of holding onto the past, even as it slips away. My words are a legacy to my grandmother's enduring impact on my life, a testament to the power of love and tradition. When I write, I am not just recording events; I am reliving the emotions, the sensations, and the flavors that make up the tapestry of my memories.  In the end, it is not the kimchi itself that matters, but the memories it evokes, the emotions it stirs, and the love it represents. My grandmother's legacy lives on, not just in the recipes she passed down, but in the stories I tell, the memories I hold dear, and the love I continue to share with others. As I sit at my kitchen counter, surrounded by the aromas of garlic and ginger, I know that my grandmother's spirit lives on, in the flavor of memory, and in the words that I write.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on my life's journey, I am reminded of the profound impact that travel and language learning have had on my personal growth and development. From a young age, I was bitten by the travel bug, and my curiosity about the world has only continued to intensify with each new experience. My travels have taken me to 29 countries, where I have been fortunate enough to immerse myself in diverse cultures, meet people from all walks of life, and discover the beauty of linguistic diversity.  My fascination with language began during my early travels, when I realized that communication was the key to unlocking the secrets of a foreign culture. I was amazed by the way a single phrase or sentence could bridge the gap between two people from different backgrounds. This sparked an interest in language learning, which I pursued with passion and dedication. I began by studying French, which I found to be a beautiful and expressive language. As I delved deeper into the world of language, I became fascinated by the intricacies of pronunciation, cognates, and etymology. The more I learned, the more I realized how much more there was to discover.  My language learning journey continued with Spanish, Chinese, and English, each language presenting its unique challenges and opportunities. With each new language, I felt like I was unlocking a new door to a world of possibilities. I was no longer limited by my native language, and I could communicate with people from diverse backgrounds. This newfound ability to connect with others on a deeper level was incredibly empowering.  Language learning has not only broadened my cultural understanding but has also enabled me to form meaningful relationships with people from different parts of the world. During my travels, I have had the opportunity to stay with host families, participate in language exchange programs, and engage in conversations with locals. These interactions have been incredibly enriching, and I have learned so much about the world and its diverse cultures.  As I look to the future, I am excited to continue developing my language skills in college. I am eager to take advantage of the resources available to me, including language courses, cultural clubs, and study abroad programs. My goal is to apply my language skills in a career that aligns with my passions, whether it be in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation. I believe that language has the power to break down barriers and foster greater understanding between nations, and I hope to be a part of this process.  In conclusion, my journey of self-discovery through travel and language learning has been a transformative experience that has shaped me into the person I am today. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had, and I look forward to continuing my lifelong pursuit of language and culture. As I navigate the complexities of the world, I am reminded of the power of language to bring people together and foster greater understanding.",

        "Text": "I still remember the day I found a dying bird in my home. It was a typical Sunday morning, with the sun shining through the windows and a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the plants. But the tranquility of the moment was shattered when I spotted the bird, its fragile body struggling to move, its eyes dim and lifeless. My initial reaction was one of shock and horror, and I felt an overwhelming urge to save it. I rushed to get a bowl of water and some bread, hoping against hope that I could revive it. As I sat there, watching the bird's labored breathing, I was suddenly transported back to a painful memory – the tragic death of a close friend.  My friend's passing had been a devastating blow, one that had left me reeling for months. We had grown up together, shared countless memories, and had been each other's support system through thick and thin. Her death had been a cruel reminder of the fragility of life, and I had struggled to come to terms with it. As I sat there, watching the bird's struggle to survive, I was struck by the parallels between its fate and my friend's. Both had been full of life and vitality, and yet, both had been snatched away in an instant.  As I grappled with the bird's mortality, I couldn't help but think about my own existence. I realized that I had been living in a state of denial, pretending that death was something that happened to others, not to me. But the bird's struggles had brought me face to face with the reality of my own mortality. I felt a sense of vulnerability, of fragility, that I had never experienced before. It was as if the bird's dying had awakened me to the preciousness of life, and the importance of embracing my own vitality in the face of loss.  As I sat there, tears streaming down my face, I felt a sense of clarity wash over me. I realized that life and death were not separate entities, but intertwined threads in the fabric of existence. I understood that every moment, every breath, was a gift, and that I had been taking it for granted. The bird's dying had given me a newfound appreciation for life, and a sense of purpose that I had been lacking.  In the end, the bird did not survive. But its passing had given me a gift – the gift of clarity, of perspective, of a deeper understanding of the human experience. As I sat there, surrounded by the silence of my home, I felt a sense of peace, of acceptance, that I had never felt before. I knew that I would carry the memory of the bird, and of my friend, with me for the rest of my life, and that they would continue to inspire me to live life to the fullest.  The experience had been a poignant reminder that mortality is a part of life, and that it is only by confronting it that we can truly appreciate the beauty and fragility of existence. As I looked around my home, at the plants, the books, the memories, I felt a sense of gratitude, of wonder, at the preciousness of it all. I knew that I would never take life for granted again, and that I would strive to live every moment with intention, with purpose, and with a deep appreciation for the beauty and fragility of existence.",

        "Text": "I still remember the day my life changed forever. I was just a child, no more than eight years old, when I suffered an anaphylactic shock triggered by a peanut allergy. The incident was a blur of panic, confusion, and terror. My airways constricted, my skin broke out in hives, and my heart raced like a jackrabbit. It was as if my body had turned against me. The experience left an indelible mark on my psyche, sparking a journey of fear, paranoia, and resentment towards my own body.  For years, I lived in constant fear of another attack. I became obsessed with avoiding peanuts, scrutinizing every label, and interrogating waiters at restaurants. My allergy became a constant companion, a shadow that followed me everywhere. I felt like a prisoner in my own body, unable to fully participate in life's experiences. The fear of another reaction was suffocating, making me anxious and withdrawn.  But as I grew older, my fear began to transform into a sense of purpose. I realized that I wasn't alone in my struggles. There were millions of people like me, living with allergies that controlled their lives. I became determined to help others overcome the fear and bitterness that accompanied living with allergies. My passion to make a difference led me to pursue a career as an allergy specialist.  To achieve my goal, I delved into the human immune response, studying the intricacies of the body's defense mechanisms. I took courses in human immunology, fascinated by the complex dance of cells, proteins, and chemicals that governed our response to foreign substances. The more I learned, the more I realized that allergies were not just a personal issue, but a complex medical puzzle waiting to be solved.  As I delved deeper into my studies, I began to see the world in a different light. I realized that my allergy was not a curse, but an opportunity to make a difference. I started volunteering at local hospitals, working with patients who were struggling to cope with their own allergies. I saw firsthand the impact that allergies had on people's lives, the fear, the anxiety, and the sense of isolation.  But I also saw the resilience, the courage, and the determination of those who refused to let their allergies define them. I saw people who were fighting back, who were taking control of their lives, and who were determined to live life to the fullest. And I knew that I wanted to be a part of that movement.  Today, I am one step closer to achieving my dream. I am working towards a career as an allergy specialist, driven by a passion to help others overcome the fear and bitterness that accompanies living with allergies. I know that it won't be easy, but I am determined to make a difference. I want to help people like me, people who are living with allergies, to find a way to stop or alleviate their reactions, to take back control of their lives, and to live without fear.  My journey with allergies has been long and arduous, but it has also been transformative. It has taught me the value of resilience, the power of determination, and the importance of living life to the fullest. I know that I will always carry my allergy with me, but I also know that I am not alone. And together, we can overcome the fear and bitterness that accompanies living with allergies, and create a brighter, more hopeful future for all.",

        "Text": "As a foreign exchange student, I embarked on a 28-month journey to immerse myself in American culture by living with five different families across the country. This experience not only broadened my understanding of American values and traditions but also had a profound impact on my personal growth. From the Watkins family in Kansas to the Dirksen family in California, each household presented a unique set of dynamics, values, and challenges that forced me to adapt, empathize, and understand.  My first host family, the Watkins, were a quintessential Midwestern family. They lived on a farm in rural Kansas, where I was introduced to the importance of hard work, community, and tradition. Mrs. Watkins, a kind-hearted woman, took me under her wing and taught me how to bake apple pies and can vegetables. Her husband, a rugged farmer, showed me the ropes of farming and the value of manual labor. Their children, two rambunctious boys, became my instant friends, and we spent countless hours exploring the countryside and playing sports. The Watkins family taught me the importance of simplicity, humility, and the value of a strong work ethic.  In contrast, my second host family, the Smiths, were a fast-paced, urban family living in New York City. They were a bustling family of four, with two working parents and two children who were always on the go. I was initially overwhelmed by the pace of city life, but the Smiths quickly took me in and showed me the ropes. Mr. Smith, a financial analyst, taught me about the importance of time management and prioritization, while Mrs. Smith, a marketing executive, introduced me to the world of fashion and design. Their children, two bright and ambitious teenagers, became my guides to the city, taking me to iconic landmarks and introducing me to new foods and music. The Smiths taught me the value of adaptability, resilience, and the importance of staying organized in a fast-paced environment.  My third host family, the Patels, were a close-knit Indian-American family living in suburban New Jersey. They welcomed me into their home with open arms, feeding me delicious Indian cuisine and teaching me about their rich cultural heritage. Mr. Patel, a software engineer, shared his passion for technology and innovation, while Mrs. Patel, a talented artist, introduced me to the world of Indian classical music and dance. Their children, two shy but curious siblings, became my partners in crime, and we spent hours playing video games, watching Bollywood movies, and exploring the local park. The Patels taught me the importance of family, community, and the value of preserving cultural traditions.  My fourth host family, the Rodriguezes, were a vibrant, Hispanic family living in Miami, Florida. They were a lively bunch, always laughing, dancing, and cooking up a storm. Mrs. Rodriguez, a warm and nurturing woman, took me under her wing and taught me how to cook traditional Cuban dishes, while Mr. Rodriguez, a charismatic entrepreneur, shared his passion for business and innovation. Their children, two energetic and outgoing teenagers, became my friends and confidants, and we spent hours exploring the city, attending music festivals, and playing soccer. The Rodriguezes taught me the importance of joy, spontaneity, and the value of living life to the fullest.  Finally, my fifth and final host family, the Dirksens, were a laid-back, West Coast family living in California. They were a relaxed and easygoing bunch, always surfing, hiking, and enjoying the great outdoors. Mr. Dirksen, a free-spirited artist, taught me about the importance of creativity, self-expression, and following one's passion. Mrs. Dirksen, a yoga instructor, introduced me to the world of mindfulness, meditation, and holistic living. Their children, two free-spirited teenagers, became my guides to the California lifestyle, taking me to beaches, hiking trails, and music festivals. The Dirksens taught me the importance of living in the present, embracing individuality, and the value of pursuing one's dreams.  Through my interactions with these five families, I learned valuable lessons about the importance of adaptability, empathy, and understanding. I discovered that getting along with others requires recognizing their needs, knowing when to offer advice or simply listen, and appreciating individual differences. I learned to navigate diverse relationships and environments, to be sensitive to the needs of others, and to appreciate the beauty of cultural diversity.  My 28-month journey has shaped me into a more sensitive and open-minded individual, prepared to navigate the complexities of a globalized world. I have gained a deeper understanding of American culture and values, but more importantly, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself. I have learned to appreciate the beauty of diversity, to celebrate individuality, and to embrace the unknown. As I reflect on my journey, I am reminded of the power of cultural immersion and the transformative impact it can have on one's life.",

        "Text": "I still remember the days when the mere mention of vegetables would make me cringe. As a self-proclaimed \"anti-vegetable carboholic,\" my diet consisted of a steady stream of pizza, pasta, and burgers. The thought of giving up my beloved carbs was unthinkable, and the idea of adopting a plant-based lifestyle was laughable. But life has a way of throwing us curveballs, and it was my mother's cancer diagnosis that sparked a journey of transformation that would change my life forever.  As I watched my mother undergo treatment, I couldn't help but wonder if there was a way to prevent such illnesses. My research led me to the world of plant-based nutrition, and I was shocked by what I discovered. The evidence was overwhelming: a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains could not only prevent chronic diseases but also reverse them. I was intrigued, and my curiosity soon turned into a passion.  I devoured books, documentaries, and online courses, learning about the benefits of plant-based nutrition and its impact on health and sustainability. I was amazed by the science behind it all – how a plant-based diet could reduce inflammation, improve gut health, and even influence gene expression. As I delved deeper, I began to experiment with new recipes, ingredients, and cooking techniques. My kitchen, once a foreign territory, became my playground.  The more I learned, the more I realized that adopting a plant-based lifestyle wasn't just about personal health; it was about sustainability, animal welfare, and social justice. I was struck by the environmental impact of animal agriculture, the exploitation of workers in the food industry, and the role that food played in perpetuating social inequalities. My newfound passion wasn't just about me; it was about creating a better world for all beings.  As I transitioned to a whole food plant-based diet, I noticed profound changes in my body and mind. My energy levels soared, my skin cleared up, and my mood improved. But it wasn't just about physical health; I felt a sense of purpose and fulfillment that I had never experienced before. I began to connect with like-minded individuals, attending workshops, joining online communities, and participating in local activism.  My transformation from a carboholic to a vegaholic wasn't without its challenges. There were times when I felt like an outsider, when friends and family members questioned my choices or ridiculed my \"rabbit food.\" But I persevered, fueled by my passion for this new way of living. And as I looked around, I saw that I wasn't alone. I saw a community of individuals who shared my values, who were committed to creating a better world through the power of food.  My journey has taught me that personal transformation is possible, that we have the power to change our lives and the world around us. It has shown me that healthy living isn't just about individual choices; it's about creating a ripple effect that can inspire others to make a difference. As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the wisdom of Mahatma Gandhi, who said, \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\" For me, that change began with a simple decision to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, and it has led me to a life of purpose, passion, and fulfillment.",

The Happiness Spreadsheet, a digital journal where I record my daily happiness levels on a scale of 1-20, accompanied by brief descriptions of my experiences, has become an integral part of my life. Over 700 days, this spreadsheet has transformed from a simple numerical representation of my emotions to a rich tapestry of memories, relationships, and personal growth.  At first, the idea of tracking my happiness seemed trivial, even superficial. I was skeptical about the value of assigning a numerical value to something as subjective as happiness. But as I began to fill in the spreadsheet, I realized that it was not about the numbers themselves, but about the stories and reflections that accompanied them. The spreadsheet became a digital diary, a space where I could process my emotions, celebrate my triumphs, and learn from my setbacks.  One of the most significant insights I've gained from the Happiness Spreadsheet is the importance of family in my life. As I scroll through the entries, I am reminded of the countless times my loved ones have brought joy and comfort to my life. From lazy Sundays spent watching movies with my siblings to impromptu dinner parties with my parents, the spreadsheet is filled with moments that highlight the value of family in my pursuit of happiness. These entries serve as a reminder that true happiness is often found in the simplest, most mundane moments shared with the people I love.  The Happiness Spreadsheet has also taught me the value of gifting happiness to others. As I reflect on the times I've made a conscious effort to bring joy to someone else's life, I am struck by the profound impact it has on my own happiness. Whether it's surprising a friend with their favorite coffee or simply lending a listening ear, the spreadsheet shows that these small acts of kindness have a profound ripple effect on my own emotional well-being. This realization has encouraged me to prioritize acts of kindness and generosity in my daily life, recognizing that happiness is not a zero-sum game, but rather a collective endeavor.  Perhaps the most surprising insight I've gained from the Happiness Spreadsheet is the role of enthusiasm in navigating life's challenges. As I scroll through the entries, I notice that the days when I've approached challenges with enthusiasm and curiosity are often the days when I've reported higher happiness levels. This realization has encouraged me to approach life's obstacles with a sense of wonder and excitement, rather than fear and anxiety. By doing so, I've found that even the most daunting challenges can become opportunities for growth and self-discovery.  As I continue to add to the Happiness Spreadsheet, I am reminded that true self-discovery lies not in individual data points, but in the connections and patterns that emerge over time. The spreadsheet is not just a collection of numbers and notes; it is a dynamic and evolving record of my relationships, personal growth, and pursuit of happiness. As I reflect on the past 700 days, I am filled with a sense of gratitude and awe, recognizing that the Happiness Spreadsheet has become a testament to the beauty and complexity of the human experience.  In the end, the Happiness Spreadsheet is more than just a digital journal; it is a reflection of my journey towards self-discovery, a reminder of the importance of family, kindness, and enthusiasm in my pursuit of happiness. As I continue to fill in the spreadsheet, I am excited to see what new insights and patterns will emerge, and how this digital reflection will continue to shape my understanding of joy, family, and self-discovery.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on my time at Mountain School, I am reminded of the profound impact a single event had on my approach to learning and my understanding of the world. A concussion, which forced me to reevaluate my priorities, became a catalyst for transformation. I traded a narrow, result-oriented approach to learning for a more contemplative and interdisciplinary one, discovering the value of introspection, discussion, and creative problem-solving.  Before the concussion, I was driven by a relentless pursuit of achievement. I focused on grades, test scores, and academic accolades, often sacrificing sleep, relationships, and personal growth in the process. My priorities were skewed, and I had lost sight of the true purpose of education: to cultivate wisdom, empathy, and critical thinking.  The concussion, however, forced me to slow down. I was unable to engage in strenuous mental activities, and my usual coping mechanisms – cramming, multitasking, and perfectionism – were no longer viable. In this state of vulnerability, I began to explore the unknown, to question my assumptions, and to seek out diverse perspectives.  One of the most significant discoveries I made during this period was the power of contemplation. I started practicing mindfulness, meditation, and journaling, which allowed me to tap into my inner world and explore my thoughts, emotions, and desires. This introspection helped me develop a greater sense of self-awareness, enabling me to identify my strengths, weaknesses, and passions.  Another crucial aspect of my transformation was the emphasis on interdisciplinary thought. I began to see connections between seemingly disparate fields – psychology, neuroscience, economics, and philosophy – and how they could be integrated to address complex problems. This synergy sparked a passion within me, particularly in the field of behavioral economics, which combines insights from psychology, neuroscience, and practical applications to understand human decision-making.  Through behavioral economics, I gained a deeper understanding of the human experience, recognizing that our choices are often driven by cognitive biases, emotions, and social norms rather than rational calculations. This realization humbled me, and I began to approach problems with a more nuanced and empathetic perspective.  The Mountain School experience also taught me the value of discussion and creative problem-solving. Engaging in open, respectful, and constructive dialogue with peers and mentors helped me refine my ideas, challenge my assumptions, and develop innovative solutions. This collaborative approach fostered a sense of community and mutual support, which was essential in navigating the complexities of academic and personal growth.  As I look back on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of embracing the unknown, questioning assumptions, and slowing down. The concussion, which initially seemed like a setback, became a blessing in disguise. It forced me to reevaluate my priorities, to seek out diverse perspectives, and to cultivate a more contemplative and interdisciplinary approach to learning.  In conclusion, my experience at Mountain School has been transformative, and I am grateful for the lessons I have learned. I have come to realize that true wisdom lies not in accumulating knowledge or achieving success, but in embracing the complexity of human experience, cultivating empathy and self-awareness, and approaching problems with a nuanced and interdisciplinary perspective. As I move forward, I am committed to carrying these insights with me, using them to make a positive impact in the world and to inspire others to embark on their own journey of discovery.",

        "Text": "As I sat with my father in our small apartment in China, sipping Puer Tea and listening to his morning news briefings, I never imagined that those quiet moments would shape my future. My father, a wise and kind man, would share stories of the world beyond our borders, sparking my curiosity and inspiring me to explore. It was during those tender moments that I decided to take the leap and study in the United States, a country that seemed to embody the values of freedom and opportunity.  As I arrived in America, everything felt new and overwhelming. The sounds, the smells, the language – everything was different. But it was in those moments of uncertainty that I stumbled upon Blue House Cafe, a small coffee shop that would become my sanctuary. It was there that I met people from diverse backgrounds, each with their own stories and struggles. I was drawn to their passion and energy, and soon, I found myself volunteering and taking on leadership roles within the cafe's community programs.  At Blue House Cafe, I discovered a sense of purpose and belonging. I learned to navigate different perspectives and opinions, and I developed my leadership skills by organizing events and leading teams. But more importantly, I found opportunities to give back to the community, whether it was through volunteering at local schools or participating in charity events. As I looked around at the people I had come to care about, I realized that I had transformed from a passive listener to an active leader.  My experiences at Blue House Cafe gave me the confidence to share my stories and achievements with my father. I remember the first time I called him, my heart racing with excitement, to tell him about a successful event I had organized. His pride and joy were palpable, even across the distance of thousands of miles. In that moment, I knew that I had found my voice, and that it was loud and clear.  Looking back, I realize that finding my voice in a new world was not just about speaking up; it was about listening, learning, and growing. It was about embracing new experiences, even when they felt daunting, and finding opportunities to make a difference. My journey from China to America was not just about physical distance; it was about bridging the gap between my old self and my new self.  As I reflect on my time at Blue House Cafe, I am reminded of the power of community and the importance of embracing diversity. I am grateful for the people who became my mentors, my friends, and my family. And I am proud of the leader I have become – a leader who is not afraid to speak up, to take risks, and to make a difference.  In the end, my journey of self-discovery and leadership has taught me that finding one's voice is not a destination; it is a journey. It is a journey of growth, of learning, and of embracing new experiences. And it is a journey that I will continue to embark on, no matter where life takes me.",

        "Text": "As a \"good student,\" I always excelled in academics, effortlessly grasping complex concepts and acing exams. But despite my academic success, I felt a growing sense of disconnection between my mind and body. I was like a robot, going through the motions of studying, attending classes, and participating in extracurricular activities without any real passion or purpose. That was until I stumbled upon dance, an art form that would transform my life in ways I never thought possible.  It all began on a whim, when I decided to take a dance class at my local community center. I had no prior experience, and my initial hesitation was palpable. But as I stepped into the studio, something unexpected happened. The instructor's words, \"Let your body move freely,\" resonated deeply with me. For the first time, I felt like I was using my entire body to learn, not just my mind. The sensation was liberating, and I was hooked.  As I continued to dance, I discovered a new way of learning that was both physical and emotional. I no longer had to rely solely on my intellect to understand concepts; my body became an instrument of expression, allowing me to tap into my emotions and intuition. The process was challenging, yet exhilarating. I felt like I was unlocking a part of myself that had been dormant for years.  Dance also introduced me to a diverse community of individuals who shared my passion. We came from different backgrounds, ages, and skill levels, yet we were united by our love for movement. Through dance, I formed meaningful connections with people who accepted me for who I was, without judgment or expectation. For the first time, I felt like I belonged to a community that valued creativity, self-expression, and vulnerability.  But the most significant transformation dance brought to my life was a deeper understanding of my identity. As I explored different dance styles, I began to uncover aspects of myself that I never knew existed. I discovered my strength, resilience, and creativity, qualities that I had previously overlooked. Dance helped me to reconcile my mind and body, allowing me to develop a more holistic sense of self.  Through dance, I learned to embrace my uniqueness and celebrate my individuality. I no longer felt the need to conform to societal expectations or fit into predetermined molds. I was free to be myself, imperfections and all. This newfound sense of identity gave me the confidence to pursue my passions, take risks, and live life on my own terms.  In retrospect, taking up dance was one of the best decisions I ever made. It was a journey of self-discovery that transformed my life in profound ways. Dance taught me that learning is not just about the mind, but also about the body and spirit. It showed me that identity is not fixed, but rather a dynamic, evolving process. And most importantly, it reminded me that embracing our true selves is the key to living a life of purpose, joy, and fulfillment.",

        "Text": "Growing up in an affluent community, I never thought I would be affected by poverty. The neatly manicured lawns, the luxury cars, and the designer clothing all seemed to scream \"wealth\" and \"prosperity.\" But behind the façade of opulence, I was struggling. My family and I were living paycheck to paycheck, barely scraping by. We were the invisible poor, hidden behind a veil of shame and misconception.  In affluent communities, poverty is often stigmatized. People assume that if you live in a wealthy area, you must be wealthy too. They don't see the struggle, the sacrifice, and the stress that comes with living in a community where the cost of living is exorbitant. They don't see the families who are barely holding on, who are one medical bill or car repair away from financial disaster.  I remember feeling ashamed of my situation. I didn't want to tell my friends that we couldn't afford to go on vacation or that we had to cut back on extracurricular activities. I didn't want to be seen as different, as less than. So I kept quiet, suffering in silence as I watched my friends' families take lavish trips and buy expensive gifts.  But the silence was suffocating. It was a weight that I carried with me every day, a constant reminder that I wasn't good enough, that I didn't belong. And it wasn't until I finally broke my silence, sharing my story with a trusted friend, that I began to feel a sense of relief.  Breaking the silence of poverty is not easy. It takes courage and vulnerability. But it is necessary. When we share our stories, we create a ripple effect of understanding and empathy. We show others that they are not alone, that poverty can affect anyone, regardless of their zip code.  By breaking the silence, we can work towards creating a more considerate and generous community. We can create a community where poverty is not something to be ashamed of, but something to be addressed. We can create a community where people feel seen and heard, where they feel supported and empowered.  So I urge you, if you are struggling in silence, to break free. Share your story, and let others share theirs. Let us create a community that is built on empathy and understanding, not shame and misconception. Let us break the silence of poverty, and work towards a brighter, more compassionate future for all.",

        "Text": "I still remember the day I received the news that I had not been selected as a winner in the national mathematics competition in Turkey. I was devastated. For months, I had dedicated myself to preparing for the competition, pouring over textbooks and practice problems, convinced that I had what it took to emerge victorious. My confidence had been fueled by my parents, teachers, and even myself, all of whom had assured me that I was one of the best.  But as I stared at the rejection letter, my confidence began to crumble. I felt like I had let everyone down, including myself. The questions swirled in my mind: What had I done wrong? Was I not good enough? Would I ever be good enough? The disappointment was overwhelming, and for a while, it seemed like my world had come crashing down.  As I reflected on my experience, I began to realize that my desire to win had been driven by more than just a passion for mathematics. I had wanted to prove to myself and others that I was capable of achieving something significant, that I was worthy of recognition and respect. But in the process, I had lost sight of why I had started pursuing mathematics in the first place – because I loved it.  The failure forced me to re-examine my motivations and goals. I realized that I had been so focused on winning that I had neglected my own growth and development as a mathematician. I had been trying to fit into a mold, to meet the expectations of others, rather than pursuing my own passions and interests. The experience taught me a valuable lesson: that success is not just about achieving a specific goal, but about the journey itself, the learning, the growth, and the self-discovery.  Moreover, the experience also highlighted the challenges of pursuing scientific development in Turkey, where resources and opportunities are limited. As a woman in a male-dominated field, I faced additional obstacles, including stereotypes and biases that can discourage and undermine one's confidence. But rather than letting these challenges discourage me, I decided to use them as fuel to drive my ambition.  I began to seek out new opportunities, to explore different areas of mathematics that genuinely interested me, and to surround myself with people who supported and encouraged me. I realized that I didn't need to win a competition to be successful; I just needed to stay true to myself and my passions.  Through this journey, I discovered a broader perspective that has set me on the path to success. I learned that perseverance is not just about pushing through obstacles, but about staying committed to one's goals and values. I learned that ambition is not just about achieving a specific outcome, but about striving for excellence and making a positive impact.  Today, I am proud to say that I am a woman and a scientist who is driven by a sense of purpose and passion. I am proud to say that I have found my own path, one that is not defined by external validation or recognition, but by my own desires and aspirations. The disappointment of not winning the competition was a turning point in my life, one that taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, ambition, and self-discovery. It was a lesson that has stayed with me, guiding me towards a brighter and more fulfilling future.",

        "Text": "Growing up, I struggled with a childhood stutter that made me feel like an outcast. Simple tasks like ordering food at a restaurant or introducing myself to new people became daunting challenges. I often felt like I was living in a world that wasn't designed for people like me. But everything changed when I discovered soccer. The thrill of chasing down a ball, the rush of adrenaline as I scored a goal, and the sense of belonging to a team transformed my life. For the first time, I felt like I was part of something bigger than myself, something that didn't care about my stutter.  As I grew older, I realized that my experience wasn't unique. Many people with intellectual disabilities face similar struggles, often finding themselves on the fringes of society. This sparked an idea in me – what if I could create a program that brought together youth athletes with and without intellectual disabilities to play soccer together? The goal was simple: to break down social barriers and foster genuine acceptance and friendship among participants.  Thus, GOALS (Global Outreach and Leadership through Sports) was born. The program pairs youth athletes with and without intellectual disabilities, creating a unified team that competes against other unified teams. The results have been nothing short of remarkable. By promoting intentional connections and breaking down social barriers, GOALS has created a space where individuals of all abilities are valued and recognized for their unique contributions.  One of the most significant benefits of GOALS is the way it challenges traditional notions of ability and disability. In a unified sports setting, athletes with intellectual disabilities are not seen as separate or inferior; rather, they are integral members of the team. This shift in perspective has a profound impact on the athletes themselves, who begin to see their abilities in a new light. For the first time, they are given the opportunity to develop their skills, take on leadership roles, and forge meaningful relationships with their teammates.  The impact of GOALS extends far beyond the soccer field, however. By creating a space where individuals with and without intellectual disabilities can come together, we are fostering a more inclusive community. We are showing the world that everyone has something valuable to offer, regardless of their abilities. This message resonates deeply with our athletes, who often report feeling more confident, more accepted, and more empowered as a result of their participation in GOALS.  But GOALS is not just about the athletes; it's also about the ripple effect it has on the broader community. By promoting acceptance and inclusion, we are challenging societal norms and encouraging people to rethink their assumptions about intellectual disabilities. We are creating a world where everyone is valued, respected, and given the opportunity to thrive.  As I look back on my own journey, I am reminded of the power of sports to transform lives. Soccer gave me a sense of purpose and belonging when I needed it most. Through GOALS, I am honored to be able to pay it forward, creating a platform where others can experience the same sense of acceptance and inclusion.  In the end, breaking down barriers is not just about creating a more inclusive community; it's about recognizing the inherent value and worth of every individual. It's about acknowledging that everyone has something unique to offer, regardless of their abilities. As we continue to grow and expand GOALS, I am excited to see the impact it will have on our athletes, our communities, and our world. For in a world where everyone is valued and respected, we can truly say that we have broken down the barriers that once divided us.",

        "Text": "I still remember the day I shared a vulnerable poem in my creative writing class. It was a moment of recklessness, a moment of courage, and a moment that changed the course of my writing journey forever. As I stood before my peers, my heart racing with anticipation, I felt like I was about to jump off a cliff without a safety net. But it was in that moment of vulnerability that I discovered the true power of writing.  The poem I shared was deeply personal, a reflection of my struggles with anxiety and depression. It was a raw and honest portrayal of my emotions, a confession of sorts. I had written it in a moment of desperation, when the darkness seemed to be closing in around me. But as I read the words aloud, I felt a weight lifting off my shoulders. It was as if I had finally found a way to express the emotions that had been bottled up inside me for so long.  The response from my classmates was overwhelming. They listened with empathy and understanding, their eyes filled with compassion. For the first time, I felt like I was being seen, like my words were being heard. It was a moment of connection, a moment of community. And in that moment, I realized that writing was not just about putting words on paper, but about conveying emotion, about touching the hearts of others.  As I continued to write, I began to tap into that vulnerability, to channel my personal struggles into my work. It was not always easy, but it was necessary. I learned to take risks, to push past the fear of rejection and criticism. And as I did, I discovered a newfound confidence in my writing. I was no longer afraid to explore the darker corners of my mind, to confront the demons that had haunted me for so long.  But the power of vulnerability in writing goes beyond just personal growth. It has the ability to connect us, to bring us closer together. When we share our stories, our struggles, and our fears, we create a sense of community, a sense of belonging. We remind each other that we are not alone, that we are all in this together.  As I look back on that moment in my creative writing class, I am reminded of the impact that words can have on others. I am reminded of the power of vulnerability, of taking risks, and of being honest. I am reminded that writing is not just about self-expression, but about connection, about community, and about leaving a mark on the world.  In the end, finding my voice was not just about finding the right words to express myself, but about finding the courage to be vulnerable, to be honest, and to be open. It was about embracing my imperfections, my flaws, and my fears. And it was about using those imperfections to create something beautiful, something meaningful, and something that could touch the hearts of others.  As I continue on my writing journey, I am reminded of the importance of vulnerability, of taking risks, and of being honest. I am reminded that writing is not just about putting words on paper, but about conveying emotion, about connecting with others, and about leaving a mark on the world. And I am reminded that the power of vulnerability is not just about personal growth, but about creating a sense of community, a sense of belonging, and a sense of connection.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on my personal journey, I have come to realize that philosophy is meaningless without action. It is easy to get caught up in deliberation and doubt, but it is the bold steps we take that truly lead to progress and growth. In this essay, I will argue that embracing action over caution is essential for achieving success and making a positive impact in the world.  One of the most significant challenges I faced was taking on a challenging course in college. I had always been interested in computer science, but I was hesitant to pursue it due to my lack of experience. After much deliberation, I decided to take the leap and enroll in the course. It was not easy, and there were many times when I felt like giving up. However, I persevered, and my hard work paid off. I not only excelled in the course but also discovered a passion that has since become a significant part of my life.  This experience taught me the importance of taking bold steps. If I had let doubt and caution hold me back, I would have missed out on an incredible opportunity. Instead, I chose to embrace action, and it led to tangible results. I realized that determination and perseverance can overcome even the most daunting challenges.  Another area where I have seen the power of action is in making a positive impact in my community. I have always been passionate about volunteering, but I often found myself getting bogged down in deliberation. What if I didn't have the skills? What if I wasn't making a difference? However, I realized that these doubts were holding me back from taking action. I decided to volunteer at a local soup kitchen, despite my reservations. It was a humbling experience, and I saw firsthand the impact that I could make. I realized that even small actions can add up to make a significant difference.  The concept of embracing action over caution is often referred to as having a \"d'oh\" mentality. This mentality involves taking bold steps, even if they don't always guarantee success. It is about being willing to take risks and learn from our mistakes. By adopting this mentality, we can overcome doubt and caution, and achieve our goals.  In conclusion, philosophy is meaningless without action. It is the bold steps we take that truly lead to progress and growth. By embracing action over caution, we can overcome doubt and achieve tangible results. I urge everyone to take bold steps, even if they don't always guarantee success. Remember, determination and perseverance can overcome even the most daunting challenges. So, let us adopt a \"d'oh\" mentality and make a positive impact in the world.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on my life, I realize that the most transformative experiences have been the ones that pushed me out of my comfort zone. From navigating my father's deafness to studying abroad in China, I've learned that embracing uncomfortable situations is key to building meaningful relationships and unlocking potential. Through these experiences, I discovered the value of adaptability, resilience, and cultural awareness, leading to life-changing experiences and lifelong friendships.  Growing up with a deaf father, I often found myself acting as a bridge between him and the hearing world. Simple tasks like ordering food or communicating with doctors became daunting challenges. However, as I grew older, I began to see these experiences as opportunities to develop my communication skills and empathy. I learned to be patient, to observe, and to adapt to different communication styles. My father's deafness taught me that effective communication is not just about speaking, but also about listening and being willing to learn.  When I decided to study abroad in China, I knew it would be a challenging experience. The language barrier, cultural differences, and unfamiliar surroundings all contributed to my initial anxiety. However, I was determined to immerse myself in the culture and make the most of my time abroad. I enrolled in a language course, joined a local club, and volunteered at a community center. Through these experiences, I encountered many uncomfortable situations, from struggling to order food in Mandarin to accidentally offending a local custom.  At first, I felt frustrated and overwhelmed. I questioned my decision to study abroad and wondered if I was cut out for this kind of experience. However, as I reflected on my experiences, I realized that it was precisely these uncomfortable situations that were helping me grow. I was forced to think creatively, to problem-solve, and to be more open-minded. I learned to appreciate the beauty of cultural differences and to find common ground with people from diverse backgrounds.  One of the most significant lessons I learned was the importance of resilience. When faced with challenges, it's easy to give up or become discouraged. However, I realized that it's precisely in these moments that we have the opportunity to grow and learn. By persevering and pushing through difficulties, I developed a sense of confidence and self-assurance that has stayed with me to this day.  My experiences in China also taught me the value of cultural awareness. I learned that cultural differences are not just about food, music, or festivals, but about fundamental values and beliefs. I realized that cultural awareness is not just about understanding others, but also about understanding ourselves and our own biases. By being more aware of my own cultural assumptions, I was able to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with people from different backgrounds.  As I look back on my experiences, I realize that embracing uncomfortable situations has been key to my personal growth and development. By stepping out of my comfort zone, I discovered new strengths, new passions, and new perspectives. I formed lifelong friendships with people from diverse backgrounds and developed a sense of empathy and understanding that has enriched my life.  In conclusion, embracing uncomfortable experiences has been a transformative journey for me. It has taught me the value of adaptability, resilience, and cultural awareness, and has led to life-changing experiences and lifelong friendships. As I move forward in life, I know that I will continue to face challenges and uncomfortable situations. However, I also know that it's precisely these experiences that will help me grow, learn, and become the best version of myself.",

The struggles my family faced were often met with judgment and criticism from those who did not understand our circumstances. However, it was through these experiences that I discovered the importance of empathy and perspective. With the guidance of mentors Brian and Eric, I developed a passion for learning and a desire to inspire empathy in others. Through the arts and humanities, I aim to cultivate meaningful connections and open people up to different perspectives, ultimately promoting a more compassionate and understanding society.  My childhood was marked by the stigma of welfare. I remember the shame and embarrassment I felt when my mother would take me to the local food bank or when we would receive government assistance. It was as if the world was telling me that I was not good enough, that my family was not good enough. But my mother's strength and resilience in the face of adversity taught me that our circumstances did not define us. She instilled in me a sense of pride and self-worth, and I began to see that our struggles were not unique to us. Many families in our community were facing similar challenges, and it was only through empathy and understanding that we could begin to break down the barriers that divided us.  It was not until I met Brian and Eric, two mentors who would change the course of my life, that I began to see the power of human connection. Brian, a high school English teacher, saw something in me that I did not see in myself - potential. He encouraged me to read widely, to think critically, and to express myself creatively. Eric, a local artist, introduced me to the world of art and music, showing me that creativity could be a powerful tool for social change. Through their guidance, I began to see that education and the arts were not just means of personal enrichment, but also tools for building bridges between communities.  As I delved deeper into the world of arts and humanities, I realized that empathy and perspective were essential components of human connection. I saw how literature, music, and art could transport us to different worlds, allowing us to walk in the shoes of others and to see things from their perspective. I saw how these mediums could break down barriers of race, class, and gender, and how they could inspire us to take action. I began to understand that empathy was not just a feeling, but a choice - a choice to see the humanity in others, to understand their struggles, and to connect with them on a deeper level.  Through my experiences, I have come to believe that empathy and perspective are essential for building a more compassionate and understanding society. When we take the time to listen to others, to hear their stories, and to see things from their perspective, we begin to break down the barriers that divide us. We begin to see that our struggles are not unique to us, that we are all connected in our humanity. We begin to understand that the world is not always fair or just, but that through empathy and understanding, we can create a more just and equitable society.  As I look to the future, I am committed to using the arts and humanities as a means of inspiring empathy and promoting social change. I believe that through literature, music, and art, we can cultivate meaningful connections and open people up to different perspectives. I believe that we can use these mediums to tell the stories of marginalized communities, to amplify their voices, and to inspire action. I believe that we can create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background or circumstances.  In the end, it is through empathy, perspective, and human connection that we can break down the barriers that divide us. It is through these qualities that we can create a more compassionate and understanding society, a society where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. As I move forward, I am committed to using my passion for learning and my desire to inspire empathy in others to make a positive impact on the world. I am committed to breaking down barriers and to building bridges between communities, one connection at a time.",

        "Text": "As I reflect on the sacrifices my mother made for our family, I am reminded of Sonia, the protagonist in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel \"Crime and Punishment\". Sonia, a young and impoverished woman, is forced into prostitution to support her family, yet she remains a beacon of hope and morality in a world consumed by darkness. Similarly, my mother's story is one of immense sacrifice, love, and selflessness, which challenges traditional notions of morality and saintliness.  Growing up, I witnessed firsthand the struggles my mother faced in the face of poverty, domestic violence, and patriarchal oppression. Despite the odds against her, she worked tirelessly to provide for our family, often going without meals and sleep to ensure we had food on the table and a roof over our heads. Her sacrifices were not limited to physical needs; she also protected us from the emotional toll of our father's abuse, shielding us from the worst of his anger and despair.  Like Sonia, my mother's experiences were marked by a deep sense of morality and compassion. She never wavered in her commitment to our well-being, even when it meant sacrificing her own happiness and dignity. Her selflessness was not driven by a desire for recognition or reward, but rather by a profound love for her children. In a world that often expects women to prioritize their own needs and desires, my mother's story is a powerful reminder that maternal love can be a form of saintliness, even in the darkest of circumstances.  However, societal expectations often fail to recognize the sacrifices made by women like my mother. We are conditioned to view saintliness as a virtue reserved for those who have dedicated their lives to religious or charitable work. We forget that the everyday acts of love and sacrifice made by mothers, caregivers, and marginalized women are, in fact, a form of saintliness. These women are the unseen saints, their stories often relegated to the shadows of history and forgotten in the grand narrative of human experience.  Through my mother's story, I argue that we must redefine our understanding of morality and saintliness. We must recognize that the sacrifices made by women like Sonia and my mother are not only acts of love, but also acts of resistance against a society that often seeks to oppress and marginalize them. By sharing their stories, we can begin to challenge traditional notions of morality and create a more inclusive and compassionate understanding of what it means to be a saint.  In the end, my mother's story is a testament to the power of maternal love and sacrifice. It is a reminder that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is always hope, always a way forward. And it is a call to action, urging us to recognize and celebrate the unseen saints among us, who have dedicated their lives to the service of others, often at great personal cost.",

        "Text": "As a playwright, I have always been drawn to the power of storytelling to transform and uplift. My journey as a storyteller has been a winding path, filled with moments of revelation and growth. From adapting Ray Bradbury's \"The Rocket Man\" to creating a free playwriting course for middle-school girls, I have come to understand the sacred craft of storytelling as not only an emotional confrontation between author and audience but also a service to others.  For me, the journey began with a deep love for words and a desire to connect with others. As a child, I was fascinated by the way stories could transport me to different worlds and evoke strong emotions. I devoured books of all kinds, from fantasy novels to historical dramas, and soon began to write my own stories. But it wasn't until I adapted \"The Rocket Man\" for the stage that I realized the true power of storytelling. Watching the audience connect with the characters and themes, I saw how the story could evoke emotions and spark conversations.  This experience sparked a desire within me to use my craft to serve others. I began to write plays that explored complex social issues, from racism to gender inequality. But I soon realized that simply writing about these issues was not enough. I needed to create a safe space for audiences to engage with the stories, to grieve, to be seen, and to hope. This is when I began to understand the true ministry of storytelling.  As a playwright, I am not just a creator of stories, but a facilitator of emotional experiences. I am a guardian of the sacred space of the theatre, where audiences can come to confront their deepest fears and desires. My mission is to create a sense of community and transcendence through my craft, to bring people together in a shared experience of storytelling.  One of the most powerful experiences I have had as a playwright was creating a free playwriting course for middle-school girls. These young women, from diverse backgrounds and experiences, came together to share their stories and create something new. Watching them find their voices and express themselves through their writing was a truly sacred experience. I saw how the act of storytelling could empower and uplift, giving them a sense of confidence and purpose.  Through this experience, I came to understand that storytelling is not just about the author, but about the audience. It is about creating a space where people can come to be seen, to be heard, and to be understood. It is about fostering a sense of community and connection, where people can come together to share in the human experience.  As a playwright, my mission and ministry are to teach and offer story, to create a safe space for audiences to engage with the complexities of life. I believe that storytelling has the power to transform and uplift, to bring people together in a shared experience of humanity. Through my craft, I aim to create a sense of transcendence, where audiences can rise above their individual experiences and connect with something greater.  In the end, the sacred craft of storytelling is not just about the stories we tell, but about the connections we make. It is about creating a sense of community and understanding, where people can come together to share in the human experience. As a playwright, I am humbled by the power of storytelling, and I am committed to using my craft to serve others, to foster a sense of connection and transcendence, and to bring people together in the sacred space of the theatre.",

At a restaurant, I can sit down, relax, and enjoy my meal in a clean and comfortable environment. In contrast, food stands are often crowded and noisy, with limited seating options. Additionally, restaurants typically have a wider variety of menu options, which allows me to try new dishes and flavors. Furthermore, the service at restaurants is usually more attentive and personalized, making the overall dining experience more enjoyable.

The unforgiving neon green turf and jagged rock formations always seem to send my ball careening in the wrong direction, ultimately ending up in the roaring waterfall. My younger sister, on the other hand, effortlessly navigates the obstacles and sinks her ball into the hole with ease, followed by an embarrassing victory dance that leaves me dismayed. \n\nHowever, my lack of mini-golf skills belies my passion for the game of golf itself. As the sole girl on my high school's golf team, I've earned the nickname \"golf girl\" from my peers. Growing up, I was inspired by my father's coaching and watching the LPGA with my grandfather, which instilled in me a love for the game. I looked up to talented women like Annika Sörenstam, who played with grace and power, and I was determined to make them proud. \n\nWhen I was cut from the middle school golf team, I was devastated, but I didn't give up. I practiced tirelessly, taking over 100 swings every night and spending hours on the putting green, dreaming of that match-winning putt. The sense of accomplishment I felt when I made the team the following season was incredible. \n\nOver the past six years, I've grown accustomed to the quirks and humor of my male teammates. At our first match, I was intimidated by the four teams of tall, strong boys, but my teammate James broke the ice with a bizarre joke that put me at ease. As we played together, our team dynamic evolved into a tight-knit group of friends who supported each other on and off the course. \n\nAs the daughter of two teachers, I didn't have access to country club simulators or elite courses. So, two summers ago, I took matters into my own hands and got a job at the local country club, cleaning carts and taking out the trash. It wasn't glamorous, but it allowed me to play for free, and by the end of the summer, I realized that my hard work had leveled the playing field with my more affluent opponents. \n\nGolf has become an integral part of my life, bringing me joy and gratitude with every sunk putt and well-driven ball. Even though my sister still celebrates her mini-golf victories with a dance in the parking lot, I'll join her, knowing that I'll continue to play and learn from the game for the rest of my life.",

I was determined to conquer the 48th peak before school started, fulfilling a goal I had set in fifth grade after meeting a group of inspiring Appalachian Trail through-hikers. Climbing all 48 four-thousand-foot peaks in New Hampshire was a daunting task that took some people a lifetime to complete. Now, at 6:15 a.m., I was gasping for air and questioning who was responsible for my pain. Perhaps it was my parents, who had instilled in me a love for the wilderness from a young age.\n\nGrowing up, my family had taken a different path. Instead of luxury resorts, we opted for camping trips and exploring the great outdoors. I had been fortunate enough to experience the world in a unique way, from running from wild cattle in the Italian Alps to pedaling through Oregon's hilly streets on a three-person bike. These experiences had given me a sense of adventure and a passion for hiking and backpacking.\n\nThe 48 climbs had been grueling, but they had also rewarded me with breathtaking vistas. On lucky days, we would end our journey at a mountain hut, sipping hot chocolate and devouring books on rare lichen. It was at one of these huts that I met a female naturalist, who introduced me to the endangered alpine flora and sparked my desire to become a hands-on environmentalist.\n\nNow, as I stood at the base of Mount Isolation, my final peak, I felt a mix of emotions. The 13.6-mile hike was my last push, and I was ready. The initial struggle gave way to a stunning view of the Atlantic Ocean, with Mt. Washington glowing like amber in the distance. I was overcome with emotion, tears of joy and sadness streaming down my face. I had done it. I had achieved my goal.\n\nAs I began my descent, I realized that I had no one to blame for the early mornings and blisters. Instead, I wanted to thank my fifth-grade self for setting this goal. The struggles had been worth it, and I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment.\n\nOn the car ride home, music blasting and my feet wiggling in the wind, I felt like I was graduating from my childhood. Hiking with my family over the past seventeen years had created countless memories, but it was time for me to start a new chapter. I would continue to explore the wilderness, searching for rare specimens and marveling at the ordinary. The possibilities were endless, and I was excited to see what the future held.",

But just as quickly, hundreds of gallons of water poured down, extinguishing the blaze. \"CUT!\" a director yelled, and I cheered, thrilled by the scene I had just witnessed.\n\nThis childhood experience sparked my love for Hollywood. Disney's Hollywood Studios, with attractions like The Great Movie Ride and The Studio Backlot Tour, introduced me to the magic of special effects, illusions, and stunts. These early encounters hinted at my future passion for filmmaking, though I didn't realize it at the time.\n\nYears later, my fascination with cinema remains unwavering. Whether it's a blockbuster, an Oscar contender, or a cult classic, I seize every opportunity to experience original films. For a few hours, I can escape into the on-screen universe, where characters come alive and their stories intertwine with my own experiences. As a self-proclaimed \"tomboy\" who loves football and dislikes dresses, I've drawn inspiration from strong female characters like Hermione Granger and Princess Leia. Seeing them stand up for themselves has boosted my confidence and encouraged me to stay true to myself.\n\nMy passion for film extends beyond characterization to the technical aspects of cinema. Cinematographers and lighting designers work magic, evoking emotions and awe in audiences. I'm eager to learn more about the craft and tackle the challenges of producing a film. When I do, I'll pour my heart into it, perhaps creating a protagonist who defies stereotypes and embodies my own quirks and passions.\n\nWhat I love most about movies is their uniqueness to the individual creator.

Whether I pursue filmmaking as a career or hobby, I hope to spread a message of hope, perseverance, and strength. If I can inspire just one person through my characters, I'll consider myself successful. Even if I don't break box office records, I'll have achieved my goal if I can make a positive impact on someone's life through my work.",

At best, they are a fleeting presence in the sky, and at worst, they are seen as pests associated with filth and disease. However, for many centuries, birds held a revered place in folklore and tales from cultures around the world. \n\nWe are all familiar with stories featuring birds as central characters: the wise owl, the mischievous raven, the vain peacock, and the motherly hen. I was introduced to these stories at a young age, captivated by the avian parables on CDs, which became an integral part of my childhood. I still remember proudly reciting \"The Ant and the Magpie\" to my parents, a tale that taught the importance of saving resources for times of need. As I grew older, my love for birds persisted, but the influence of those stories waned. After all, none of my classmates attributed their love of dogs to a Danish fairytale or Chinese folklore. I assumed my love for birds was superficial, stemming from their colorful plumage and joyful calls. Birds were no longer a central part of my identity; instead, they became a casual answer to the question of my favorite animal.\n\nIt wasn't until I stumbled upon one of my favorite childhood books, \"Why Snails Have Shells,\" in my closet during high school that I rediscovered the significance of the lessons I learned from those cherished bird characters. Rereading the familiar stories, I realized that the straightforward teachings of the birds were more relevant to my life than they ever were in my childhood. Birds once again became more than just my favorite animal; they guided my reactions to challenging situations, which came in abundance as I grew older.\n\nOne lesson that has permeated my life is an old Chinese proverb, famously summed up by poet Maya Angelou: \"A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song.\" In today's high school environment, where social media dominates and approval from others is paramount, it's easy to get caught up in seeking validation. However, the bird's song reminds me of the importance of doing things for my own happiness, not others. I've adopted this mantra as a guiding principle, focusing on building genuine relationships, investing in activities I love, and expressing myself in ways that bring me joy. Although the stories and proverbs I learned as a child originated from distant times and places, they have woven themselves into my values and shaped me into the person I am today.",

I spent an hour practicing, and when I finally mastered it, I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and accomplishment. However, my excitement got the better of me, and I ended up breaking the table leg. My mom rushed in, and I was met with a look of disappointment. It was a setback, but it didn't deter me from pursuing my passion.\n\nGrowing up, I didn't have much to be proud of. I was a dreamer, imagining myself as an incredible dancer, drummer, or computer scientist. But I didn't have the opportunities to pursue these dreams. So, I started teaching myself dance at the age of 12, relying solely on YouTube tutorials and practice. It wasn't easy, but it's the foundation of my art.\n\nNow, I face the challenge of competing with people who have had access to tutors, classes, and workshops. They have had the opportunity to travel and learn from the best, while I've had to work twice as hard to achieve half of what they have. But I'm driven by my passion to prove that anyone can create something from nothing.\n\nWhen I started at King's as a freshman, I had the opportunity to work with my first dance teacher, Mr. Ryuji Yamaguchi. He introduced me to styles of dance that were considered taboo in Arab culture, and encouraged me to experiment and push boundaries. As the annual dance concert approached, I practiced tirelessly, determined to show the world what I was capable of. The night of the concert arrived, and I danced my heart out, performing in contemporary duets, group pieces, hip-hop solos, and Bollywood. The final bow was a moment of pure triumph, and I caught a glimpse of my mother's tearful eyes and proud smile. In that moment, I knew that I had finally broken free from the shackles that had held me back.\n\nFor me, art is utopia. It's the most rewarding work anyone can do, pouring hours of effort into creating something beautiful and unique. When you've invested all your energy into expressing your thoughts and ideas, you get to step back, admire your work, and say with pride, \"I created this.\"",

Beyond feeding the dogs and mowing the lawn, I've had to deal with unexpected challenges like rescuing chimney swifts from my room and shoveling snow off my bedroom floor during a Nor'Easter. While I sometimes envy my friends' newer, more weather-tight homes, I know I wouldn't trade my quirky, old Harvard, Massachusetts home for anything.\n\nSince my parents bought the tavern as a fixer-upper, I've been recruited to help with various projects, from glazing windows to painting rooms. This past summer, I reluctantly agreed to help repair the mortar joints in our basement's fieldstone foundation. The task required hauling 80-pound bags of cement, mixing it with water, and stuffing it into the deep crevices between the stones. As I worked, often on my hands and knees, I had plenty of time for self-reflection. Uninterrupted by technology, I let my mind wander, pondering conversations with friends, political issues, and essay topics.\n\nAs I worked with my hands, I realized that forming and sculpting the cement was a creative process, much like writing and editing. It was an iterative and exhausting process, but the sense of accomplishment was worth it. I was reminded of my experience rowing in the Head of the Fish Regatta, where I had to push through physical exhaustion to finish.\n\nGood mortaring, like eventing, requires technical precision, speed, and strength. It demands perseverance, attention to detail, and the ability to work through discomfort. As I worked on the wall, I recognized that these same qualities are essential for achieving any mental or physical goal, whether it's winning a competition, writing an essay, or rebuilding a wall. Standing back from the finished wall, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, not just in completing the task, but in discovering the zen in the art of mortar maintenance.",

I had come seeking a creative outlet after a stressful day. Behind the thick curtain, I found a room covered in a fine layer of that same dust, with bookshelves sporting a small collection of sculptures. Our task was to transform a 4' by 6' block of clay into a seated woman, modeled after the one sitting before us.\n\nI stared at the block, unsure where to begin. The woman beside me, however, was already shaping her rust-colored slab with ease. She added clumps to the top, subtracted pieces to form shoulders and arms, and I found myself mesmerized by her process. I was in awe of her ability to see the woman hidden within the clay.\n\nEventually, I turned back to my own sculpture and tentatively shaved off a small piece from the top corner. I continued to work on that corner, afraid to make any drastic changes. When my instructor visited my table, he offered suggestions, shaving away clay and encouraging me to remove even more. But I was hesitant, fearful of making mistakes that would be permanent.\n\nThis fear of impermanence held me back throughout the three-hour lesson. By the end, my piece resembled Mario from Super Mario Bros. rather than the model before me. As I left the class, I wondered when I had started letting fear dictate my actions.\n\nI recalled a time when I would boldly leap into new situations. Like the time I jumped off a chair lift 8 feet too soon, and my dad caught me. I had lost that fearlessness, and I was determined to reclaim it.\n\nThe following week, I approached my sculpture with a newfound sense of courage. I took out clumps of clay, rather than slivers. When my instructor visited, he pointed out numerous flaws: the arm was too high, the legs resembled a yeti's, and the head was balloon-shaped. But I was proud to be taking risks and enjoying the process.\n\nMy final piece was far from perfect, riddled with errors. Yet, I had come to appreciate those mistakes, and the journey they represented. Every crack, air bubble, and slip was a testament to my growth. I realized that, like my sculpture, I had been shaped by my mistakes, and that as long as I wanted to continue becoming myself, I would need to keep making them.",

I would have highlighted how it leveraged my strengths, attention to detail and empathy, and how it allowed me to repay the debt of gratitude I owed to my mother's cardiologist, who had given her a second chance at life. But that was then. Today, I no longer harbor that dream. The truth is, my passion for cardiology was a fabrication, a misguided notion of what I thought was just.\n\nIn reality, I have a way with words, a lyrical quality that is the essence of my being. I am a writer, and with every word I craft, a part of my soul takes flight, transcending time and space. For years, I had been writing about cardiology and science, deceiving myself into believing that my passion for writing was a passion for the medical field. I would write novels about my experiences as a cardiologist, but it was all a ruse. My love for writing had become so pronounced that I mistook it for a passion for cardiology.\n\nAs a child, I never recognized writing as more than a hobby. But the truth is, it is who I am. Despite my undying love for this art form, I would tell myself that cardiology was my true calling, even though I felt disconnected from it. It wasn't until I heard a simple yet profound sentence - \"If you do something you love, you never have to work a day in your life\" - that I realized my mistake. This sentence unlocked a new chapter in my life's story, redirecting my thoughts from who I was to who I wanted to be.

Writing liberates me, allowing me to think and be whoever I want to be. I had begun a story I thought I knew by heart, but the words had drifted, and my true love and destiny had become clear: becoming a writer.",

Growing up in a chaotic household with four siblings, I desperately needed an escape from the mayhem. Building Lego sets became my sanctuary, a way to calm my mind and focus on a single task. My first Lego set was a gift on my seventh birthday, and although I was excited, I was also perplexed by the challenge it presented. With persistence and help from others, I eventually mastered the art of building.\n\nAs I grew older, I continued to request Legos as gifts, determined to hone my skills. The breakthrough came when I completed my first kit, a miniature Seattle Space Needle, entirely on my own. This accomplishment sparked a sense of pride and creativity, transforming my bedroom floor into a studio where I could let my imagination run wild. I discovered that I was capable of creating unique sculptures and designs that I never would have conceived without my obsession with those tiny plastic blocks.\n\nAs I entered my teenage years, my Lego creations became more sophisticated, and I began to envision designing and constructing real-world buildings and entities. My bedroom floor evolved into a sprawling metropolis, reminiscent of New York City's iconic skyline. Returning home from school or a grueling practice, I found solace in my personalized city, a testament to my imagination and creativity.\n\nAlthough I no longer build Lego structures regularly, my passion for those tiny bricks instilled in me a sense of curiosity and creativity that will forever be a part of me. When I arrived at boarding school as a first-year student, I was anxious and hesitant. Seeking an escape from my anxiety, I enrolled in a ceramics and sculpting class. This new medium allowed me to express myself in a different way, and I soon found myself constructing complex designs and transferring them to my personal studio, my bedroom, where they joined my Lego creations.\n\nLegos have left an indelible mark on my life, fostering my capacity to experiment with new endeavors and cultivating my imagination, creativity, and optimism. As I continue to design my sculptures, write my essays, and shape my future, I am guided by the lessons I learned from those humble plastic blocks.",

But in a community where nearly half the population is Puerto Rican, I was shocked to hear my French and Irish uncle question why they were coming to our city, citing concerns about overcrowded schools and resources. His words were all the more hurtful because they implied that the struggles of Puerto Rican refugees were less important than those of his own son, who lacked an AP English book. It was a painful reminder of the ignorance that can surround our identities.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to notice the subtle yet insidious ways that racism and intolerance can manifest in those closest to us. I've heard loved ones make thoughtless jokes, only to follow up with a condescending \"not you, you're not really Puerto Rican.\" These comments left me feeling like I didn't belong, like I needed to assimilate into the dominant culture to be accepted. Even family gatherings, like Thanksgiving with my white cousins, could be alienating experiences. It was only when I was surrounded by my Puerto Rican cousins at my Abuela's house that I felt a sense of community and connection to my heritage.\n\nBut even then, I couldn't escape the feeling of being an outsider. People would ask if I was Muslim or Italian, as if my ethnicity was a puzzle to be solved. They would compliment my \"exotic\" name, only to reveal their own biases when they learned about my mixed heritage. It was as if my identity was a constant source of fascination and curiosity, rather than a fundamental aspect of who I am.\n\nWorking at a grocery store in a neighboring town, I saw firsthand how Hurricane Harvey victims received an outpouring of support, while Puerto Rico's struggles were largely ignored. It was a stark reminder that not all adversities are created equal in the eyes of society.\n\nBut I've come to realize that my identity is not defined by the glances or comments of others. I am more than my heritage, more than my skin color or accent. I am a daughter, a student, a friend, a sister. I am the sum of my passions, experiences, and relationships. I am a complex, multifaceted individual, and my identity cannot be reduced to a single characteristic or stereotype.\n\nGrowing up at the intersection of different cultures and identities has taught me the importance of empathy and understanding. It's only when we put ourselves in others' shoes, when we strive to see the world from their perspective, that we can begin to overcome our own biases and prejudices. My white uncle may never fully understand what it's like to be a minority, but that doesn't mean he can't try. By acknowledging and confronting our own ignorance, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.",

As my family and I moved from state to state, coast to coast, for my father's job over the past decade, I found solace in fantasy novels. With my head propped against the baseboard near my nightlight, I would escape into whimsical forests, fight daring battles, and rule over treacherous courts long after dark. In these fantastical worlds, I could be anyone: the queen, the knight, the hero, or even the villain. These books allowed me to express emotions I couldn't have imagined on my own - happiness, anger, sadness, and queerness.\n\nThe characters I discovered in novels during my library and bookstore tours across the country taught me resilience and empowered me to nurture my strengths. Mare Barrow inspired me to strive for academic excellence, earning a 4.4 GPA. Tane from The Priory of the Orange Tree motivated me to push my physical limits, leading me to traverse over 1,544 miles in cross-country races and practices. Evelyn Hugo's unapologetic character emboldened me to embrace my queerness rather than hide it. This year, I'm taking my love of fantasy to the next level by playing Mrs. White in my school's production of Shuddersome and The Monkey's Paw, drawing inspiration from Anne of Green Gables, my first fictional idol, who shaped my personality and flair for drama.\n\nAbove all, my favorite author, Leigh Bardugo, gave me the courage to write and dream big. What started as a safety net in my adolescence has grown into a true passion for English and its limitless expressive power. Language is power, and I want to wield it like a mighty sword. I aspire to be a New York Times bestseller, to know that my work makes a difference, no matter how small. I want to see my book in the hands of strangers, refusing to put it down, just as I did in the hallways of my middle school.\n\nI want to be a writer, a college professor, a publishing lawyer - I want it all, the triumphs and the setbacks. Without literature, I wouldn't be the person I am today. Without the constant moves and library hauls, I wouldn't have discovered my love for English, nor would I be as resilient, adaptable, and adventurous. With every move, I burrowed into books, and with every book, I became more myself. Literature has shaped me in every way, and the only way I can repay it is to become the writer I've always dreamed of being.",

Brood X is a cluster of cicadas that descends upon Washington, D.C. every 17 years, and I have the misfortune of living in the epicenter of their swarm. To me, cicadas were right up there with mosquitoes in the top tier of human annoyances. I loathed these off-brand cockroaches.\n\nBut as I reflected on their life cycle, I began to see some unexpected parallels with my own life. For 17 years, cicadas live underground, feeding on sap and avoiding danger. Then, they emerge into the real world, much like I've been sheltered by my parents for 17 years, living in the same house and town, with them providing for me and keeping me safe. Is it possible that I have more in common with cicadas than I initially thought?\n\nLike cicadas, I've been feeling a bit disoriented and blurry-eyed after a year of Zoom classes, tele-health appointments, and excessive social media and video game use. And, I have to admit, I do make a racket with my noisy blender and loud music, and I can be a bit of a mess-maker.

After 17 years of being cooped up, we're both eager to spread our wings and face new experiences. Cicadas want to explore the world, even if it means colliding into obstacles, and I want to escape to college, even if it means getting lost or making mistakes.\n\nJust as the hardiest cicadas survive their emergence and go on to thrive, I want to be a resilient Brood X cicada, willing to learn from my mistakes and keep moving forward. I'll need time to figure things out, but I'm ready to take on the challenges of college and emerge stronger on the other side.

All I know about him is that he has no history of cancer, a twin brother who's 6'4\", and studied math in school. He's a stranger to me, and I'm just a secret to him.\n\nPeople often ask about my father, and I'm forced to correct them, saying, \"I actually have two moms.\" This usually sparks reactions like my driving instructor's awkward comment, \"Oh, well that must be different.\" Even at 17, I'm still unsure how to respond to these kinds of comments.\n\nWhen I was just 5, Mary passed away after a long battle with leukemia. My world was turned upside down, and I was old enough to understand the grief that followed.

I'm struck by the harsh realities that kids half my age have already learned the hard way. My guide points out the overgrown grass and abundant fruit trees, areas that people and animals avoid due to the presence of landmines. It's a jarring contrast to my life in London, and it's hard to reconcile with my father's rosy stories about his childhood in Katyr-Yurt.\n\nAs I experience the beauty of the place, I'm also confronted with the less romanticized parts of my family's past. I grew up speaking Russian with my Muscovite, Jewish mother, but the Chechen children speak in broken Russian, and the adults are hesitant to communicate in the language of their enemy. Seeing the physical and psychological scars of war, I feel like an intruder, ashamed of my Russianness and my city-boy naivete.\n\nDespite this shame, I yearn to understand what it means to be Chechen, to see their home through their eyes. This desire sparks a deep connection to the land, and I begin to explore the conflicting layers of my familial identity. In Moscow, my awareness of these conflicting identities intensifies, particularly on the maternal side of my heritage. Relatives view Chechens as terrorists, and I'm met with distrust and fear when I share my experiences.\n\nWhen I return to London, I'm unable to slip back into my old life.

The cosmopolitanism of London takes on a new light, and I'm drawn to conversations about personal histories and complicated identities.

Two months of intense preparation had readied my fingers for this momentous concert. I had carefully selected three pieces for my repertoire: Erik Satie's soothing Gymnopedie No. 1, Beethoven's haunting First Movement of the Moonlight Sonata, and Bach's airy Prelude in C Major. As I walked onto the stage, I felt a sense of respect and prestige emanating from the audience.\n\nI took my seat, and the chair creaked in sympathy with the audience's anticipation. I arranged my sheet music and began to play. The performance was exhilarating, with every technique and trick I had practiced executed flawlessly. I brought Satie's phonological experiment to life with varying pressure on each chord, and Beethoven's cascading arpeggios resonated with unity and precision. The room was filled with bliss as I concluded with Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.\n\nAs I took my final bow, the audience erupted into applause, and I beamed with pride. But then, a faint question pierced the din: \"Could you play something more lively, darling, like a Neil Diamond song?\" I was taken aback by Mrs. Hersch's request, feeling my feathers ruffled by her disregard for the masterpieces I had just performed.\n\nAs I reflected on the event, I realized that my visceral reaction was unwarranted. Why had I been so hesitant to accommodate a simple request made in earnestness? It would have been easier to practice \"Sweet Caroline\" than to struggle with Beethoven's work. I came to understand that my choice of musical pieces mattered little as long as my audience enjoyed them. Whether it was a tortured pop song or a masterfully crafted concerto, I vowed to play them all.\n\nWorking with the elderly at the long-term-care facility had taught me a valuable lesson. Despite my mentors' platitudes, I had learned that the world didn't revolve around my tastes and interests.

But nothing could have prepared me for the challenges I would face as the first female \"boy scout\" in my town.

I realized that being a \"first\" isn't about being a fierce leader, but about putting in the extra hours, listening to criticism, and using your own feelings of isolation to connect with others. It's about going through the fire and emerging stronger on the other side.

I'll tell her the creases are like a map, evidence of the places I've been, the heartbreaks I've suffered, the joy I've danced. My life is in these shoes.

And, despite knowing it's irrational, I won't reuse clothes worn during lost debates. \n\nAlthough I value logic and strive for precision in my reasoning, I often make exceptions for my superstitions. Growing up in a multigenerational household, I was never short on advice, but I've developed a peculiar habit of rebelling against my Korean heritage by cooking Italian food during traditional holidays. My graph of physical activity versus time would resemble an irregular heartbeat, with peaks representing my surfing and debate team activities, and troughs symbolizing my research and piano practice. \n\nI find comfort in routine, like my midnight baking sessions with my brother, but I also cherish conversations with people from diverse backgrounds. Whether discussing research on female voting patterns in Kuwait or the nuances of college applications, I thrive on cultural exchanges with international debaters. My behavior may be unpredictable, but it's consistently so. While I may not conform to expectations, I'm always true to myself – even if that means cooking linguine whenever I catch a whiff of kimchi.",

        "Text": "When my mother told me I listened to \"white people music,\" I couldn't help but agree. Rock 'n' roll did originate in the basements of young, white men, after all. But I was quick to point out that its roots also lay in the jazz scene of the Harlem Renaissance, and that one of the greatest guitarists of all time, Jimi Hendrix, was black. My love affair with punk rock began in seventh grade, when Green Day's \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" randomly played on my iTunes. I delved deeper into their discography and soon found myself immersed in the world of punk. My mother, who grew up in a segregated New York, was more familiar with Stevie Wonder than Stevie Nicks, but she accepted my musical tastes.\n\nAs my friends listened to Taylor Swift and One Direction, I blasted Green Day, Ramones, and The Clash through my Hot Topic headphones. The raw energy and rebellious spirit of punk rock resonated deeply with me. It was as if I had found a community that understood me, a group of misfits who rejected the status quo and spoke out against injustice. I had always felt like an outsider in my prep school, where the goal was to be popular and conform to certain standards. But punk rock's anti-establishment ethos spoke to me, and I found solace in its message of nonconformity.\n\nHowever, as I adopted the punk philosophy, I began to realize that I was more focused on being different than on being true to myself. I wasted energy on rejecting mainstream culture simply for the sake of it, rather than focusing on what genuinely made me happy. It wasn't until I transitioned to a new high school that I had the opportunity to reevaluate my approach. I started listening to a wider range of music, including genres that weren't strictly punk. I bought yoga pants and discovered they were comfortable. And I learned to appreciate the beauty of compromise.\n\nMy revised punk philosophy is simple: do what makes you happy, regardless of whether it fits into the \"system\" or not. As John Lennon so eloquently put it in \"Revolution,\" \"You tell me it's the institution / Well, you know / You'd better free your mind instead.\" Questioning authority doesn't have to mean opposing everything; sometimes, it's about finding what truly resonates with you. For me, that means striving to act on ideals like love and justice, rather than simply rebelling against the mainstream.\n\nPerhaps I've failed the punk movement in some way, but I've come to realize that being true to oneself is the greatest form of rebellion. I'll wear my Doc Martens, drink my pumpkin spice latte, and blast my favorite guitar solo with pride. That's as punk as it gets.",

        "Text": "Here is a rewritten version of the passage:\n\nAs I gazed at the cluttered desk in front of me, my eyes landed on a small kohl. With a shaky hand, I carefully applied the ebony powder to my waterline, wincing as the fine specks got into my eyes. The vibrant colors of my birthday makeup kit seemed to leap out at me, and I was determined to master the art of using them. At 12, I was still new to the world of makeup, but I was driven to unlock its secrets. After school, I would retreat to my bedroom, shutting myself in to practice and perfect my techniques. \n\nBut my mom's unexpected visit one day brought me back down to earth. She chuckled at my smudged lipstick and uneven eyeliner, and I felt a flush of embarrassment. As she helped me clean up my mistakes, I realized that becoming a makeup expert would require some guidance. When I asked her about the ingredients in the bright powder she was using, she admitted she wasn't sure. Her suggestion that I find out for myself sparked a journey of discovery. Hours of research later, I learned that the powder was made from mica, a mineral commonly used in cosmetics - but one that was often sourced unethically and harmfully to the environment. \n\nDetermined to reconcile my love of makeup with my values, I put my kit away, vowing to find more sustainable alternatives. Now, at 17, I approach makeup with a more nuanced understanding of its impact. As I glance at my old kit, I'm reminded of the journey it's taken me on. Without that reckoning, makeup would have remained just a tool for physical transformation, rather than a catalyst for personal growth. \n\nToday, each time I apply eyeliner or lipstick, I'm not just enhancing my appearance - I'm also writing a chapter in my children's book about conscious consumerism. I'm working on algorithms and models that promote supply chain transparency. Makeup has taught me to be fearless in my self-expression and my expectations for the future. I coat my lips with bold colors, preparing to speak out about urgent issues at conferences and in everyday conversations. I see my passion inspiring others to embark on their own journeys of self-discovery and activism. \n\nAs I look in the mirror, I see a paradox - my skin is a canvas of creativity and activism, but it's also a reflection of my own identity. Perhaps that's why makeup fascinates me - it allows me to bring my imagination to life. Whether I'm channeling the Wicked Witch of the West or an Indian classical dancer, makeup gives me the freedom to explore different personas and express myself fully. And as I peel back the layers, I'm still the same curious, passionate person I've always been - driven to create positive change, one brushstroke at a time.",

        "Text": "I was thrilled to land a volunteer opportunity at the Long Marine Lab, a renowned marine biology research facility at UC Santa Cruz. I had visions of swimming with dolphins or studying the behavior of decorator crabs. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment on my first day when I discovered that I would be sorting through albatross boluses, the indigestible materials they regurgitate before setting out to sea. After three hours of separating fishing line from brown muck, I began to dread the task ahead. At the time, I had no idea how fascinating this opportunity would turn out to be, and how it would remind me of my tendency to become engrossed in even the most unexpected topics.\n\nInitially, I found the task of sorting through boluses tedious, but it didn't take long for my boredom to shift to curiosity. The project itself was fascinating, aiming to research the behavior and diet of albatrosses at sea. These incredible birds can fly for months without touching land, and when they have chicks, they regurgitate whatever they've eaten at sea to feed them. When the chicks become old enough to fly, they cough up the hard, indigestible materials left in their stomachs, which contain valuable information about their diet.\n\nAs I became more skilled at dissecting the boluses, I started to find remarkable things, and my colleagues and I would often discuss our significant discoveries. We would search for the largest squid beak, examine fish eyes, and occasionally stumble upon plastic artifacts like bottle caps, lighters, and even toothbrushes. The presence of these human-made objects was both shocking and fascinating, revealing the distant origins of the trash and the devastating impact of human activity on the oceans.\n\nThis experience taught me a valuable lesson: that even the most mundane tasks can be fascinating, and that there is beauty in the unexpected. As someone who plays piano and is passionate about various subjects, including albatrosses, particle physics, and history, I realized that I don't have to choose just one area to dedicate my life to. Instead, I can continue to explore and learn about different topics, always staying curious and engaged. With so many subjects to learn about, books to read, pieces to play, and albatrosses to save, I know that I will never be bored in life.",

The sound of waves crashing on the beach reminds me of the powerful forces of nature at work. It's astonishing to think that stars are blazing spheres of fire and that electrical impulses are what make us sentient beings. The very existence of our world is a wonder, a delicate balance of components that work in harmony to support life. What are the odds that this particular planet developed all the necessary parts to make life possible? How do they interact, and how did they come to be?\n\nI reflect on how my perspective has shifted over the past year. At Balboa, students are divided into small learning communities that are integrated into the curriculum. Initially, I had ranked the Law Academy as my top choice, but I was assigned to WALC, the Wilderness Arts and Literacy Collaborative, which I had ranked fourth. I was disappointed and felt bitter towards my classes. However, since students are required to wait at least a semester before switching pathways, I stayed in WALC. As it turned out, that semester marked a turning point in my thinking, shifting my focus from ambition to genuine interest.\n\nWALC's integrated classes and trips to natural areas not only fostered a sense of community among students but also allowed us to explore complex natural processes and humanity's role in them. As I pieced together these lessons, I began to visualize the intricate workings of our universe. I could see the carving of glacial valleys, the creation and erosion of mountains, and the transportation of nutrients through ecosystems. I saw these forces at work on the surface of a tiny planet rotating on its axis and orbiting the sun, a precious gem in the vast universe.\n\nThrough WALC, I gained a deeper understanding of natural systems and developed an insatiable curiosity about the interconnectedness of our cosmos. Understanding the complex mechanics of a system not only satisfies my curiosity but also adds beauty to my world. My newfound appreciation for tectonic and gradational forces allows me to see mountains and coastlines in a new light, beyond their aesthetic appeal. By physically experiencing the natural wonders described in WALC's lessons, I've gained not only the tools to admire these systems but also a genuine appreciation for them.\n\nThis has created a thirst in me to discover more beauty in a world often marred by poverty and violence, and a hunger for knowledge to satisfy that thirst. With so many systems to examine and dissect – from universal to subatomic scales – I hope to explore my interests through a variety of college courses and contribute to humanity's understanding through research, ultimately inspiring a deeper appreciation for the complex systems that govern our universe.",

I, as the camp counselor, observed his behavior, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I couldn't understand why the other campers treated him like an outcast. After three days of exclusion, James broke down during a game of soccer, tears streaming down his face as he slumped off the field, head in his hands. I rushed towards him, concern etched on my forehead. Some campers snickered, \"Why is that weirdo crying?\" My heart swelled with indignation; they were the ones who had bullied him, calling him \"James the Freak,\" and now they were mocking his tears. I firmly told them to keep their thoughts to themselves. I squatted beside James and asked what was wrong. Grunting, he turned his back to me. I needed to comfort him, so I spent the next hour chatting about topics a seven-year-old boy would love, from sports to Transformers. As James began to open up, I asked, \"Why do the other campers exclude you?\" Hesitantly, he removed his shoes and socks, revealing his left foot – he had four toes. It dawned on me that the other campers must have noticed during our swim two days prior. I recalled my own childhood, when even minor differences could lead to social exclusion. I finally understood. But how could I help? I racked my brain for the right words to soothe his pain. Nothing came to mind. On impulse, I hugged him – a gesture we camp leaders were discouraged from initiating, and an act I later discovered no friend had ever shown James before. Then, I placed my hand on his shoulder, looked him straight in the eye, and assured him that physical appearance didn't matter, and that as long as he was friendly, people would eventually come around. I listed successful individuals who had overcome their abnormalities. And finally, I told him he would always be my favorite camper, regardless of the number of toes he had. On the last day of camp, I was overjoyed – James was finally fitting in. Although the teasing hadn't entirely disappeared, James was speaking up and making friends. When he gave me one last hug and declared me his \"bestest friend in the whole wide world,\" my heart swelled with pride. From my campers, I learned that working with children is incredibly rewarding. And from James, I learned that a little love can go a long way.",

I idolize him, not because of his wealth or success, but because of his remarkable ability to find happiness in the face of adversity.\n\nI vividly remember Ye-Ye's visit to our home seven years ago. He brought with him his signature red baseball cap, which became a staple in our household. Every night, it would sit on the stairway railing post, waiting to be placed back on his head the next morning. He wore it everywhere, performing magic tricks to make my little brother laugh, buying me popsicles, and wiping the sweat off my neck with it.\n\nToday, whenever I see a red hat, I'm reminded of Ye-Ye's infectious smile and his zest for life. His story is a testament to the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity. Orphaned at a young age, Ye-Ye had to fend for himself and his brother, walking along railroad tracks to collect used coal to sell. He taught himself to read, write, and do arithmetic, and later worked in the harsh Gobi Desert for twelve hours a day.\n\nDespite the challenges, Ye-Ye remained optimistic, always finding ways to make his family and others happy. He'd buy small luxuries for his children, like sunflower seeds and candy, and tell them stories of the desert sky. Even at the age of seventy-eight, Ye-Ye continues to spread joy, biking to the market to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, and sharing them with his neighbors.\n\nLearning about Ye-Ye's past made me reevaluate my own life. I realized how trivial my worries were compared to his struggles. Now, whenever I face an obstacle, I think of Ye-Ye's smile and it gives me the strength to persevere.\n\nI keep a red baseball cap at home, a reminder of Ye-Ye's spirit and the lessons he's taught me. It's a symbol of the impact he's had on my life, and I smile every time I see it.\n\nThe second part of the text seems to be a separate story about a camp experience. Here is a rewritten version of that part:\n\nAt camp, I met James, a camper who struggled to fit in due to his physical abnormalities. I was determined to help him feel more confident.

Although the teasing hadn't completely stopped, he was speaking up and making friends. When he gave me a hug and called me his \"bestest friend in the whole wide world,\" my heart swelled with pride. Working with children at camp taught me that a little love and kindness can go a long way in making a difference in someone's life.",

I smooth my hair, a habitual gesture, though I know every strand is already in place. The stage lights above bathe my skin in warmth, and I wish their heat could seep into my brain, calming my frazzled nerves. Just then, a warm hand and an even warmer smile interrupt my anxious reverie. I glance up to see my lovely teacher, her nod coaxing a hesitant smile from my frozen lips. With a deep breath, my body takes its place, poised and ready. The music begins, and I count the beats: One, two, three, four; two, two, three, four.\n\nAs I step onto the stage, the lights and music envelop me. My lungs are on the verge of hyperventilating, but I focus on achieving a Zen-like state, imagining a field of daisies. Yet, my palms persist in sweating. It's not that I'm new to solo performances – I've had my share of piano recitals and competitions. But ballet demands a unique commitment of body and mind. I slide into an arabesque, leaning downward, careful not to stumble – Mom's recording every moment.\n\nDespite my outgoing personality, a fear of failure has long held me back from taking risks. The prospect of leaping too high and falling too far has kept me grounded. As I've progressed in the cutthroat world of dance, this fear has only intensified, fueled by the pressure of greater expectations and the specter of greater embarrassment. But now, with every eye on me, I have a chance to break free. I glance toward the wings, where my teacher's exuberant gestures urge me to stretch further, to give more. A genuine smile replaces my forced enthusiasm, and I breathe in the music, forgetting individual steps. I allow myself to stretch, to leap, and to feel the jubilation of the moment.\n\nExhilarated and scared in the best way, I throw myself into my jumps. I no longer need to imagine scenes to get in the mood; the emotions are alive within me, twirling and leaping across the stage. Reaching, stretching, grabbing, flinging – my fear no longer holds me back. I rediscover my passion for ballet, and the grace and poise that can convey every color of emotion. Playing it safe will leave me in the shadows; only by taking risks can I step into the spotlight. Maybe I'll fall, but the rush is worth it. I'll captain a science bowl team, run a marathon, audition for a musical, and embrace the thrill of taking risks.",

I pranced up and down the hill, my palms outstretched to the fluttering butterflies that surrounded me. \"Would you like to learn how to catch one?\" Grandfather asked, holding out a glass jar. I exclaimed, \"Yes!\" and he carefully wrapped my chubby five-year-old hands around it with his huge, calloused fingers.\n\nGrandfather put a finger to his lips, and I obediently watched as he skillfully maneuvered his net. He caught a magnificent butterfly perched on a flower, and I held the open jar in anticipation as he slid it inside. The butterfly quivered and fell to the bottom of the jar, and I gasped in wonder. It struggled until its wings, ablaze with a glory of orange and red, quivered to a stop. I watched, wide-eyed, as it stopped moving. \"Grandpa, what's happening?\" I asked.\n\nMy grandfather had always had a collection of butterflies, but that was the first time I saw him catch one. After witnessing the first butterfly die, I begged him to keep them alive; I even secretly set some free. To compromise, he began carrying a special jar on our outings, one that would keep the living butterflies alive. However, the creatures we caught always weakened and died after a few days in captivity, no matter how tenderly I fed and cared for them. Grandfather took me aside and explained that the lifespan of an adult butterfly was very short. They were not meant to live forever; their purpose was to shine brightly and then fade away. Thus, his art served as a memory of their beauty, an acknowledgment of nature's ephemeral splendor.\n\nBut nothing could stay the same. I moved to America, and as our weekly excursions to the mountainside ended, so did our lessons in nature and science. Although six thousand miles away, I would never forget how my grandpa's wrinkles creased when he smiled or how he always smelled like mountain flowers. As I grew older and slowly understood how Grandfather lived his life, I began to follow in his footsteps. He protected nature's beauty from decay with his art, and in the same way, I tried to protect my relationships, my artwork, and my memories.\n\nI surrounded myself with the journals we wrote together, but this time I recorded my own accomplishments, hoping to one day show him what I had done. I recorded everything, from the first time I spent a week away from home to the time I received a gold medal at the top of the podium at the California Tae Kwon Do Competition. I filled my new home in America with the photographs from my childhood and began to create art of my own. Instead of catching butterflies like my grandpa, I began experimenting with butterfly wing art as my way of preserving nature's beauty. Soon my home in America became a replica of my home in China, filled from wall to wall with pictures and memories.\n\nNine long years passed before I was reunited with him. The robust man who once chased me up the hillside had developed arthritis, and his thick black hair had turned white. The grandfather I saw now was not the one I knew; we had no hobby and no history in common, and he became another adult, distant and unapproachable. With this, I forgot all about the journals and photos that I had kept and wanted to share with him. After weeks of avoidance, I gathered my courage and sat with him once again. This time, I carried a large, leather-bound book with me.\n\n\"Grandfather,\" I began, and held out the first of my many journals. These were my early days in America, chronicled through pictures, art, and neatly-printed English. On the last page was a photograph of me and my grandfather, a net in his hand and a jar in mine. As I saw our faces, shining with proud smiles, I began to remember our days on the mountainside, catching butterflies and halting nature's eventual decay. My grandfather has weakened over the years, but he is still the wise man who raised me and taught me the value of capturing the beauty of life. Although he has grown old, I have grown up. His legs are weak, but his hands are still as gentle as ever. Therefore, this time, it will be different. This time, I will no longer recollect memories, but create new ones.\n\nAs I took the stage, I felt a surge of excitement. \"Lean extra in this pirouette; it's more aesthetic,\" I reminded myself. But is it always better to be safe than sorry? Glancing toward the wings, I saw my teacher's wild gesticulations: \"Stretch your arms out, she seems to mime, More!\" A genuine smile replaced one of forced enthusiasm; alone on the stage, this was my chance to shine. I breathed in the movements, forgot each individual step. More than just imagining, but finally experiencing the jubilation of the music, I allowed my splits to stretch across the stage and my steps to extend longer and longer, until I was no longer safe and my heart was racing.\n\nExhilarated and scared in the best way, I threw myself into my jumps. I no longer needed to imagine scenes to get in the mood; the emotions were twirling and leaping within me. Reaching, stretching, grabbing, flinging... My fear no longer shields me. I found my old passion for ballet, and remembered the grace and poise that can nevertheless convey every color of emotion. Playing it safe will leave me part of the backdrop; only by taking risks can I step into the limelight. Maybe I'll fall, but the rush is worth it. I'll captain an all-male science bowl team, run a marathon, audition for a musical, and embrace the physical and intellectual elation of taking risks.",

For years, my family and I had been nomads, moving from country to country in search of a better life. War and lack of educational opportunities had driven my parents to pack up and embark on a new journey, taking us from Kuçovë, Albania, to Athens, Greece, and finally to Boston, Massachusetts. Despite always having a roof over our heads, I had never had a place to call my own. That night, as I prayed, my mind flashed back to the evening I had stumbled upon the listing for the house. It was September 22, 2007 – exactly eight years since we had arrived in the United States. I knew it was fate that had brought this house to me. I remembered visiting the yellow house the next day with my parents and falling deeply in love with it. But I also remembered the crushing phone call that had come later that week, telling us that the owners had chosen another family's offer. A week after I had prayed, I had given up hope of ever owning that house. But then, one day after school, I walked into our small apartment and saw the flashing red light on the phone. I clicked PLAY and was shocked to hear our real estate agent's joyful voice on the other end. \"Eda! The deal fell through with the other family – the house is yours! Call me back immediately to start the paperwork.\" I stood there, stunned, replaying the words in my head. Was this really happening? Was my dream of owning a home finally coming true? Over the next month, I spent my days at school and my afternoons making phone calls, navigating the complex process of buying a home. Although my parents struggled with English, I was determined to help make this dream a reality. So, instead of gossiping with friends about makeup or boys, my conversations were filled with terms like \"fixed-rate mortgages\" and \"down payments.\" I was determined to help purchase this home, to give my family the sense of belonging I had always lacked. For thirteen years, I had felt ashamed of our small apartment, unable to host sleepovers or gossip with friends about our rooms. But now, I had the chance to change that. A home, to me, is more than just four walls and a roof – it's a place filled with laughter and memories, where my family can feel safe and loved. No matter where life takes me, I know that I will always have a yellow home, filled with love, waiting for me.",

I stared at the image of the little unicorn amigurumi on my laptop screen, then looked back at the UMO (unidentified messy object) in front of me, feeling utterly perplexed. This was supposed to be easy. I had followed the pattern: Round 1, create a magic circle with 6 single crochets - done. Round 2, increase to 12 stitches - also done. But the remaining rounds had blurred into hours and minutes, resulting in a tangled mess of white yarn instead of a little white unicorn. It wasn't until day seven that a creature with a lopsided head and a distinctive horn finally emerged.\n\nSimilarly, my journey to find my passion and forge my own path had been confusing, messy, and at times infuriating. I had heard stories of people finding their passion at a young age and exceling in their craft, others who abandoned their interests for a lucrative career, and those who pursued their dreams only to regret it later. These stories weighed heavily on me, as I was determined to have a success story like many of my family members. The problem was, I didn't have a direction.\n\nIn the years following primary school, I tried to find my passion by stepping out of my comfort zone and joining various activities: the school orchestra, debate class, and ballet school, where I explored contemporary and jazz dance. I accumulated experiences like an amigurumi stuffed with batting, but soon found myself overwhelmed by extracurriculars. I still felt lost, like I was drowning in a sea of tangled yarn.\n\nIt wasn't until high school that I realized I could view my mission to find a passion from a different perspective. Completing a crochet project is an accomplishment in itself, but the process of making slip knots, single or double crochets, takes you on an adventure. The knots I encountered in my craft were evidence of my experiences and what shaped me as an individual. My exploration of various paths, though sometimes resulting in roadblocks, taught me to persevere and learn from my experiences, applying the skills I gained to future challenges. The mini adventures I went on were crucial to my greater journey in life.\n\nThrough trial and error, I've found that my current adventure in service and environmental activism resonates with me the most. However, I've learned that no one path is static, and I can be on multiple paths at once. While I may not have achieved the proportionate unicorn amigurumi that others may have, I still have so much to learn and want to learn, and so my journey to grow continues.",

        "Text": "If someone had told me at the age of 11 that I would one day be playing a sport called squash, I would have thought they were crazy. But when I entered seventh grade at a new school that was ten times larger than my previous one, I felt like a small fish in a big pond. I was quiet, introverted, and often stuck to what was familiar. During the first week of school, a group of visitors introduced themselves as Squashbusters, a program that combined the sport of squash with academic support, mentoring, and service opportunities. Although I had only heard of squash once before, I was intrigued by the program's unique approach and decided to sign up. That decision has made a profound impact on my life over the past six years.\n\nAs a part of Squashbusters, I was pushed out of my comfort zone and encouraged to challenge myself in ways I never thought possible. The program's emphasis on pushing past our limits on the squash court translated to other areas of my life, and I began to take on new challenges with confidence. From team trips and tournaments to karaoke nights and quirky traditions like our annual Squashbusters Olympics, I gradually expanded my comfort zone. My peers brought out a side of me I never knew existed, and while I haven't transformed from an introvert to an extrovert, I have become more social and confident over the years.\n\nAs I prepare to join the Hopkins community, I am excited to continue this journey of self-discovery and growth. I want to try new things, embrace campus traditions, and explore beyond my comfort zone. While I am eager to develop intellectually through Hopkins' academic classes and clubs, I believe that true community is built by venturing beyond what we're used to. From Blue Jay Opening Day and the Spring Fair to clubs like Amnesty International and the Foreign Affairs Symposium, I am thrilled by the limitless opportunities to get involved and make a difference at Hopkins. I am excited to be a part of the Hopkins family and contribute to a community that values growth, exploration, and innovation.",

        "Text": "Here is a rewritten version of the passage:\n\nAs I walked in the door from school, my grandmother greeted me with a familiar phrase: \"Bring up the ace of spades.\" We settled in for our daily game of solitaire, working together in harmony to reorganize the cards with precision. Though solitaire was meant to be a solo activity, it was the one thing we did together, moving and dealing the cards in a rhythmic dance of order: red to black, red to black. For hours, we sat at our glossy kitchen table, playing game after game, pulling patterns out of the random array of cards.\n\nI often wondered why we had to follow the rules so strictly. Why not just take a peek at the cards or \"help ourselves\" to win? But my grandmother was adamant about adhering to the traditional rules, even when it meant losing. One day, after a particularly frustrating loss, I asked her why we played this way. She looked at me with her deep brown eyes and said, \"Solitaire isn't just a game for one person. It's a battle between two sides of yourself. If one side cheats, how can either side improve?\"\n\nAt first, I didn't understand. But as I watched her effortlessly move the cards with her frail hands, I began to see the wisdom in her words. Solitaire was a metaphor for life - a constant struggle to improve, to push oneself harder, and to resist the temptation to take the easy way out.\n\nYears later, I found myself drawing on this lesson in various aspects of my life. On the field hockey pitch, I realized I had been cheating myself and my team by not giving my all. While helping my parents with household chores, I saw the value in not taking shortcuts. And in the pottery studio, I discovered the satisfaction of creating something beautiful through hard work and dedication.\n\nLooking back, I realize that my grandmother's lesson has been a guiding force in my life. It's a reminder to always hold myself accountable, to work hard, and to resist the temptation to cheat. As I lay out the seven columns, four aces, and fifty-two cards, I'm transported back to those afternoons playing solitaire with my grandmother. Her inner strength and resilience in the face of adversity continue to inspire me, and I'm grateful for the lesson she taught me that day.",

        "Text": "\"Don't be so hasty, Dante,\" my chess coach advised. \"Take a step back, think critically, and examine the entire board.\" I was stumped, convinced that I had solved the intricate chess puzzle. But what was I missing? A knight fork, perhaps, or a bishop's clever move? Was I in check? A quick glance at the left side of the board revealed my mistake: my queen was idle, positioned on the opposite side of the board, and I had no idea. Sacrificing my queen would force the opposing rook to capture it, allowing me to checkmate with the elegant \"smothered mate.\" This lesson stuck with me: looking at the whole board made chess puzzles manageable. My chess skills improved rapidly, and my rating soared above 1000 Elo in just a few months.\n\nHowever, this lesson extended far beyond the chessboard. It became a foundational skill that I applied to various aspects of my life, including school and sports. On the soccer field, I was no powerhouse, weighing in at 125 pounds and standing 5'8\". My opponents often tackled me to the ground. But one day, as I lay dazed on the pitch, I recalled my chess lesson. Soccer, like chess, relies on the strategic positioning of each player to create a cohesive strategy. It's not just about speed, strength, or tackles; it's about understanding the game and making smart decisions. I realized that my greatest asset was my in-depth knowledge of the game – knowing where to pass, when to make a run, and how to outmaneuver my opponents. I picked myself up, focused on the game, and chipped the ball into open space behind the defender, trusting my teammate to follow. From then on, I honed my skills through intense practice, working in tandem with my teammates to become a well-balanced, unified team.\n\nThrough chess and soccer, I learned that every piece in a puzzle has a purpose. This new perspective has enhanced my ability to stop, reflect, and analyze the bigger picture in various dimensions of my life. In my scientific studies, I learned to zoom out and examine the entire scope of quorum sensing, rather than focusing on a single cell. In music, I discovered that the true beauty of a composition lies in the harmony of all instruments, not just the melody. These facets of my life – music, research, soccer, chess – are not isolated puzzles but interconnected parts of a greater whole. Every aspect of myself matters equally. As high school comes to a close, the pieces on my board are set, and I'm poised for success. Your move.",

On the ground, these directions might be sufficient for navigating highways and parking lots, but in the air, they're woefully inadequate. During one of my early flights in a small Cessna-182, my instructor tasked me with scanning the horizon for approaching aircraft. I spotted a plane to my right, a Cessna with maroon stripes, its windows glinting in the sunlight. I gestured vaguely to my two o'clock and informed my instructor, \"There's a plane to the right.\" But he corrected me, \"No, to your right. From his perspective, what direction does he see you?\" I realized that from his angle, I was to his left. In that moment, I understood the importance of perspective and precise language.\n\nAs I navigated through the skies using my compass's north, east, south, and west directions, I came to appreciate that every pilot's vantage point differs, creating opposing perspectives. My right was that pilot's left. This realization sparked a newfound appreciation for considering multiple viewpoints, regardless of my personal perspective. Perhaps it was this ability to scan the horizon and communicate a single story, uniting contrasting outlooks, that drew me to journalism and the diverse community that was my home.\n\nTo me, journalism embodies the ancient power of storytelling, filled with imperfect characters and intricate conflicts, where I serve as the narrator. As editor-in-chief of my school newspaper, The Wildcat's Tale, I strive to share the uncensored perspectives of all students and encourage my editorial team to engage with those who hold differing opinions. We begin each edition with a round-table discussion, exploring questions like \"why did this happen\" and \"where will it lead?\" By expanding my reach to publications like the Korea Daily and the Los Angeles Times High School Insider, I've had the opportunity to interview city council candidates, voters of all ages, and mayors, weaving their quotes and anecdotes into my writing. My experiences have taught me to report on polarizing opinions through an unbiased lens, recognizing that I cannot presume my readers' opinions, but rather provide them with the tools to form their own conclusions.\n\nIn my writing, I've discovered that differences in perspective aren't limited to politics. I've found that my community craves stories about the small-town hospitality of their friends and neighbors. Quirky traditions, like our Fourth of July carnival clown and local elementary school's Thanksgiving talent show, are just as important to me as national headlines. My favorite stories to publish are those that resonate with readers, proudly displayed on fridges, in diners, or on classroom corkboards. I've learned that the impact I leave on my readers matters more than the size of my story. Through flying and writing, I've come to appreciate the importance of embracing diverse perspectives, recognizing that living life with blinders can be not only boring but also dangerous. Whether I'm soaring through the skies or reporting on the ground, I've discovered that the most compelling stories come from the people most different from me.",

My grandmother often laments my lack of rhythm, describing it as a 'tragedy' to watch me struggle with our traditional West African dances. Yet, I still take to the dance floor at family gatherings, seemingly oblivious to my limitations. Eventually, my embarrassing display prompts someone to intervene and teach me the correct steps. What's astonishing is that, despite my initial claim of being unable to dance, I've been performing choreographed routines at my school's pep rallies for the past three years. Reflecting on these experiences has made me realize that my initial statement was a misrepresentation. I can dance, but only when I'm willing to collaborate with others. My ability to dance is directly tied to my willingness to work with others, and I've come to value community and collaboration greatly. \n\nThrough my internship at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, I was exposed to the collaborative spirit that defines Johns Hopkins. The idea that innovation and discovery are impossible without teamwork was reinforced during my research. I've come to see that mutual collaboration and community are essential aspects of Johns Hopkins' unique culture. From research initiatives that bridge the gap between class levels to organizations like the Tutorial Project, which relies on students working together to make a positive impact on Baltimore, and the access to interdisciplinary topics like neuromorphic systems, I believe that Johns Hopkins represents the pinnacle of collaborative achievement in education.\"\n\nI made some changes to improve clarity, coherence, and sentence structure.

I would often envy my friends who had brothers and sisters to play with, feeling stuck at home alone with my parents. But everything changed when my parents brought home my new sister, Mia - a furry Lhasa Apso dog. Although she wasn't the human sibling I had dreamed of, Mia helped me appreciate being an only child.\n\nHowever, it took me much longer to come to terms with feeling alone in other ways. Living in a predominantly white town and attending a school with a mostly white student body had a profound impact on my sense of identity as a Filipino. I would secretly eat the traditional adobo chicken my mom packed for lunch, while my friends had turkey and cheese sandwiches. I stood by as my classmates made jokes about Asians, and I felt like my heritage was something to be ashamed of. In social studies classes, I learned more about my friends' ancestry than my own.\n\nI started to believe that assimilation was the key to acceptance, and that it was the only way to feel less alone. I masked the aromas of Filipino delicacies with pasta and hamburgers when my friends came over, laughed off incidents of mistaken identity, and accepted that learning about European and East Asian history was the norm.\n\nBut everything changed when I entered high school. Although the student body wasn't more diverse in terms of ethnicity, I was surrounded by open-minded, politically and culturally active students. Through electives, clubs, and activities, I was exposed to a wide range of perspectives. I met students from around the world at speech and debate tournaments, and engaged in lively discussions with the High School Democrats Club and Young Conservatives Club.\n\nFor the first time, I felt confident in my Filipino identity. I introduced my friends to Filipino dishes like lumpia and toron, asked my social studies teachers about the history and current state of the Philippines, and stopped seeing my background as a source of loneliness. Instead, I embraced it as what made me unique.\n\nI changed my narrative from \"alone\" to \"unique,\" and I strive to spread the message that being different is something to be celebrated. I wouldn't be who I am without my Filipino background, and although my community initially made me feel alone, it also gave me the opportunity to learn, grow, and appreciate what makes me special.",

At first, I was taken aback, but as I imagined lacing up my field hockey cleats again, a surge of excitement coursed through my veins. The next day, as I stepped onto the turf, my initial anxiety resurfaced. I felt like all eyes were on me, and I could almost hear the girls thinking, \"Boys don't play field hockey.\" As I trailed behind during the warm-up, the silence was deafening, and quitting seemed more tempting by the second. But when the whistle blew, something remarkable happened. The gender barrier vanished, and I saw a shared passion in the girls' red faces and heard the emotion in their cheers. By the end of practice, I was overcome with joy, my body aglow as I caught my breath on the bench. In that moment, I realized that I shouldn't let obstacles like gender boundaries hold me back from exploring new opportunities. Embracing the unconventional had brought me joy, and I decided to apply this mindset to the soccer field, focusing on the beauty of the sport rather than worrying about playing time or titles. Within days, the same electric atmosphere transferred to the soccer field, and I began to absorb feedback, ask questions, and try new skills. As I improved, I grasped the value of my new approach. I took this open, curious, and risk-taking mindset into the classroom, asking deeper questions to understand new material, and into the dorm, where I turned cultural differences into opportunities to learn and contribute. From mastering nucleophile-electrophile reactions to sharing Dutch treats with my hall, these moments reminded me why I had sacrificed my field hockey gear to attend Deerfield. Even as I achieved the grades, friendships, and athletic successes I had sought, I realized that I valued the exploration, growth, and joy behind those successes far more. Now, before I take the field, enter the classroom, or step into my dorm, I don't worry about what I might fail to achieve or the obstacles that might hold me back. Instead, I pour my heart into these opportunities, embracing the experiences they bring.",

        "Text": "The Oreo cookie, with its firm chocolate exterior and creamy white center, holds a surprising significance for me. Unbeknownst to me, this simple treat was tied to a social stigma that left a lingering bad taste in my mouth. As a lover of both ballroom and pop music, I've always found myself lost in the stories woven by each note. From the sultry tango melodies to the upbeat Top 40 hits, I've been drawn to the vastly different styles since I was a little girl listening to Hans Zimmer's \"Discombobulate\" and One Direction's \"Kiss You\". However, when I shared my musical tastes with my black peers in high school, I was met with confused stares. \"Faith, that's so white of you,\" a friend exclaimed. \"You're such an Oreo!\" I didn't understand the connection between Oreos and racial identity until I later learned that being an \"Oreo\" meant being a black person who adopted characteristics typically associated with white people, thereby \"betraying\" their black roots.\n\nI never thought of ballroom and pop music as belonging to a particular race, but the negative connotations of \"betrayal\" introduced a new sense of guilt. Should I embrace my musical interests and risk social alienation from those who share my skin tone? Or should I set aside my \"white\" tastes and conform to the expectations of an African-American woman? I didn't abandon music altogether. As a clarinet player in my school band, I was exposed to various styles daily. During my freshman year, I decided to challenge myself by performing a solo for the county solo and ensemble festival. Lyrical Composition No. 6 was a piece I could technically master, but my band director pushed me to go beyond mere technicality. \"Where's your interpretation? What can you add to this piece?\" At first, I saw only the fixed, unyielding notes on the page. How could I contribute to a composition that seemed so definitive?\n\nThen I looked beyond the measures, beyond the notes, and saw the blank white space waiting for my input. I realized that I needed to decide what I wanted the audience to feel from this composition. With pencil in hand, I added crescendos, decrescendos, breath marks, and other markings that I felt were necessary. I didn't want to simply regurgitate the notes; I wanted to take the audience on a dynamic journey. This realization clarified the distinction between style and stereotype. Being labeled an Oreo was jarring because the documented definition couldn't be erased. Most stereotypes are deeply ingrained in societal views of certain races. While I can't change the minds of others, I can change my own.\n\nI am my own music maker. I will celebrate the intricacies of ballroom music and belt out a One Direction tune as a proud black woman. That is my style. That is my choice of expression. If allowed, stereotypes can consume me, but I refuse to be held down by their grip. I decide my definition of the black experience. My musical interests are not a betrayal that isolates me from my roots; they're a beautiful addition that enhances my ever-evolving character. Am I an Oreo? Yes, but by my own design. The creamy white center no longer represents a betrayal; it's a blank canvas waiting for my input. With pencil in hand, I will not hesitate to make my mark.",

But I think you're up for it.\" The title \"Mission Possible!\" on the cover seemed to leap out at me, its black italicized letters radiating an air of mystery. I felt a thrill of excitement, my fingers tingling and goosebumps rising on my arms. As I walked home, I couldn't help but stare at the title, sensing that it held secrets waiting to be unlocked.\n\nAs soon as I got home, I rushed to my top bunk, grabbed a pencil, and made a mental pact with the packet: \"I, Zerubabel, promise to prioritize you, put you above all else in my life, not rest, and not eat until all the problems that lay in your pages are solved.\" Looking back, I was a dramatic 11-year-old, but that experience was just one example of the many challenges I've faced throughout my life.\n\nMy love for challenges and my tenacious approach to them were instilled in me through observing my family and my own experiences. Ten years ago, my family and I made the bold decision to leave everything behind and start anew in America. During our first year in Minnesota, we faced the daunting challenge of financial struggle. My sister had to share a bed with my mom and me, while my dad slept on a makeshift bed every night. My mom worked tirelessly, waking up early and staying up late, both at home and at her minimum wage job. Despite the difficulties, my parents never complained, viewing it as just another stage of life to overcome.\n\nThrough their hard work and perseverance, our living situation gradually improved. One bed became two, and eventually, each of us had our own bed to sleep on. Reflecting on this experience and many others, I realize that it was through observing my parents' unwavering dedication that I learned the value of perseverance, my mom's commitment to her job that taught me the value of devotion, my dad's pursuit of better opportunities that instilled in me the value of ambition, and my sister's willingness to make sacrifices that showed me the value of selflessness.\n\nThrough my own experiences, I learned that I could apply these values to overcome any challenge that came my way. After two grueling months of working on the packet, I finally finished with all the questions answered. This sense of accomplishment fueled my ambition, leading me to take the most challenging courses available in middle and high school. In my community, my commitment to serving at my church for the past five years has been a testament to the values instilled in me.\n\nThese values have shaped me into the person I am today and will continue to guide me as I pursue my goals in life. It is because of these values and the people who first demonstrated them to me that I have decided to pursue a career as a surgeon. I am confident that with the guidance of these values, I will be able to achieve my goal.",

We had all converged on this iconic venue to witness the legendary Tom Petty perform live. His music was a shared thread that connected us all, a common language that transcended our individual experiences. I had grown up listening to his songs, introduced to them by my mother, and they held a special place in my heart. But as I looked around the room, I realized that his music meant something unique to each person present, a kaleidoscope of emotions and memories that harmonized with the rhythm of the music.\n\nAs I closed my eyes, I could feel the collective heartbeat of the crowd, pulsating in time with the music. It was as if Tom Petty's art had given me a profound awareness of the lives and emotions of those around me. In that moment, I understood that his music would live on, long after he was gone, because it had become an integral part of our collective experience.\n\nAs I gazed out at the sea of smiling faces, dancing arms, and carefree spirits, I realized that we were all feeling something deeply personal, yet shared. We were all connected, bound together by our emotions, despite our individual struggles and challenges. Tom Petty's music had created a sense of community, a sense of belonging that transcended time and space.\n\nI long to make connections with others, to understand their experiences and emotions, and to find common ground. Music, art, and storytelling have become my tools for bridging the gaps between people. I sit at my piano, lost in the rhythm and melody, trying to capture the essence of the human experience. I collect the art of others, staring at paintings until they seem to stare back at me, and I cry at films that touch my heart.\n\nArt, to me, is a reflection of our collective humanity, a manifestation of empathy and understanding. It allows us to see the world from different perspectives, to walk in others' shoes, and to connect with their emotions. Tom Petty's music, like all great art, is a testament to the power of human connection, a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and triumphs.\n\nAs I navigate my daily commute, I use music as a catalyst for conversation, a way to break down barriers and connect with strangers.

        "Text": "As a child, I had a peculiar dream job: driving a giant pickle truck. I was captivated by the idea after seeing it in Richard Scarry's \"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go.\" My parents would read the book to me and my sister every night, and I'd search for the hidden golden bug, Goldbug, on every page. I'd imagine myself as a pig driving the pickle truck across the country, chasing Goldbug. As I grew older, my ambitions shifted: I wanted to be a Lego Master, then an architect, and eventually a surgeon. But when I discovered gold nanoparticles that could reprogram macrophages to fight cancer, my passion for nanomedicine was ignited. I devoured articles on liposomes, polymeric micelles, and dendrimers, all of which seemed to hold the key to conquering cancer.\n\nI sought out a mentor to guide me deeper into the field and was thrilled to work with Dr. Sangeeta Ray at Johns Hopkins. In her lab, I was given the autonomy to design and implement my own procedures. I chose to tackle a pressing issue in nanomedicine: the consistent failure of nanoparticles to translate from animal studies to clinical trials. I created three novel constructs based on different linear polymers, each using fluorescent dye, to test whether a pre-dose of a common chemotherapeutic could enhance nanoparticle delivery in aggressive prostate cancer. Although I didn't expect my hypothesis to work, I was thrilled to find that cyclophosphamide did indeed increase nanoparticle delivery to the tumor in a statistically significant way.\n\nBeyond the research, I discovered a new passion: sharing my findings with others. Living alone in Baltimore, I formed unexpected friendships with graduate school students from the lab, and we explored the city together. I realized that making others interested in science was more exciting to me than the research itself. This epiphany solidified my pursuit to use writing to illuminate science in a way that's accessible to everyone, adding value to a society that needs more scientific literacy.\n\nAs I reflect on my journey, I'm reminded that my goals are still evolving. In Scarry's book, there's a goldbug on every page, and I've come to realize that it's not the destination that matters, but the act of searching for the goldbugs that will shape and refine my passions. Regardless of where my journey takes me, I know that my pickle truck has only just begun its journey.",

I've been a farmer since my sophomore year, working on a one-acre plot that's more like a garden with chickens, managed by my school. Today, my task is to harvest cherry tomatoes, most of which have ripened to perfection. I grab a tray from the shed and walk along the pathways I created during my junior year, lined with wood chips that I raked into place. Our two tomato vines are thriving, standing three feet tall and stretching out at least six feet, laden with small, glistening red and orange spheres. As I work, I fall into a rhythm, plucking and collecting the tomatoes, snacking on a few as I go. I'm reminded of when I was six, and my mom would send my twin brother and me to the backyard to weed dandelions. We'd get distracted and play with our dog or climb the dogwood tree. I think back to the awe I felt last week when I harvested a giant sunflower, discovering ten potatoes growing in its roots, or when I found a sweet potato the size of a football, which I had planted the previous year. I ponder the jalapenos, whose scratches indicate their level of spiciness. I recall the satisfaction I felt the first time I ate a raw green bean I grew at the farm, and the pleasure I feel knowing that friends and teachers also enjoy the produce we donate to the school's dining hall and sell at the weekly farmer's market. After my farm shift, I'll work at the market, ready to answer questions about the farm's location, its workers, and what we do with unsold food. Sometimes, I think about the farmers I met in Yangshuo, China, who rely solely on farming to feed their families, and how the difference between one and two dollars for pomelos means the world to them. As I carry my share of tomatoes to the shed, I reflect on how much the farm has taught me. I can't sit down to a meal without imagining the plants on my plate as seeds and sprouts, and wondering about the many hands that brought them to my table. To me, education means understanding the hidden processes that make up daily life. Playing with the farm chickens and knowing how the coating around an egg works as a natural preservative makes me appreciate my omelet more. Watching weeds decompose into fertilizer in the compost pile makes me consider the roles of carbon and nitrogen cycles. Although I initially joined the farm to try something new, I quickly found that the work offers a balance with the intellectual work of the rest of my day. The farm connects education with experience, teaching me to see the application of my classroom learning in a real setting. This connection piques my curiosity and inspires me to maintain it throughout my life, contributing to my community in meaningful ways, locally and globally. I will seek out opportunities to cultivate soil and use my learning to see and understand more of the world.",

My math teacher, a Starbucks barista, and a customer at my workplace have all caught my attention with their unique tattoos. I'm fascinated by the quotes, dates, symbols, and abstract shapes that adorn their bodies, and I've started asking them questions to uncover the stories behind their ink. This informal interviewing process has become a daily scavenger hunt, inspiring me with the individuality and diversity of the women I meet.\n\nWithout the constraints of a school assignment or deadline, I've been able to engage in meaningful conversations with these women, exploring the significance of their tattoos and the impact they've had on their lives. So far, I've conducted fifteen interviews with women from all walks of life, from teenagers to senior citizens, and from teachers to spiritual healers. These conversations have been eye-opening, with women sharing stories about overcoming struggles, finding strength, and embracing their identities.\n\nThrough these interviews, I've discovered that tattoos can be a powerful form of self-expression, revealing aspects of a person's personality, values, and experiences. I've learned about the complex relationship between the personal and public spheres, and how tattoos can be both a form of empowerment and a source of vulnerability. The stories I've heard have also taught me about the art of storytelling and the importance of active listening.\n\nAs I continue this project in college, I'm excited to gather more stories and showcase the strength, creativity, and diversity of the women I've met. By exploring the art and stories behind their tattoos, I hope to inspire others to embrace their individuality and to foster greater understanding and empathy. Ultimately, this project has taught me that with an open mind and a willingness to explore, even the simplest idea can become a meaningful and impactful reality.",

Too lazy to consult a dictionary or even their phones, we engage in a heated debate. In the end, I emerge victorious, basking in the glory of being the champion of the Merchant household. However, my triumph is short-lived, as the glossy plastic tiles that formed my winning word are swept away and mixed with the rejected tiles, setting the stage for our next game of Bananagrams.

They can evoke laughter, tears, and a range of emotions. The idea that a single word can contribute to a larger concept, much like the intricate biogeochemical cycles, is truly remarkable.

Since my pre-teen years, I've had an innate desire to stand out from the crowd, to reject the status quo. In middle school, this manifested in my fashion choices, musical tastes, and literary interests. As I entered high school, I felt a sense of pride in being different and a passion for exploring new ways to express myself.\n\nHowever, as I delved deeper into the world of nonconformity, I stumbled upon a subculture that was often associated with the term \"hipster.\" This subculture was defined by its fashion trends and musical genres, and its adherents were known for their strong nonconformist tendencies. I was drawn to this subculture and began to adopt its aesthetic, donning beanies and cardigans, and filling my iPod with Bon Iver and The Smiths. But as I did, I started to receive attention from my peers, both positive and negative, in the form of the very phrase that had become so ubiquitous: \"You're such a hipster!\"\n\nAt first, the attention was exhilarating, and I found myself obsessed with maintaining my \"hipster\" reputation. But as time went on, I realized that I was conforming to a certain standard, rather than staying true to myself. I was asking myself how I could fit the ideal, rather than who I wanted to be. This was the paradox at the heart of the \"hipster\" label: on the one hand, it celebrated individuality and nonconformity, but on the other hand, it required adherents to conform to a certain set of norms.\n\nIt took me months of struggle and self-reflection to realize that the problem wasn't with the qualities associated with being a \"hipster,\" but with letting a label define my identity. I had to figure out who I was, free from outside influence, before I could apply any adjectives to my character. The solution was not to reject the \"hipster\" label outright, but to understand that it was just one aspect of my personality, and that I was more than just a label.",

Our group had finished their first day, and the Hotchkiss volunteers had left to enjoy some Texas BBQ, leaving me and the college kids to clean up. But as we were about to leave, we realized we were locked out of the van. Someone rummaged through a dumpster, pulled out a coat hanger, and handed it to me, suggesting I try to unlock the door. I was skeptical, but I gave it a shot. To my surprise, after a few minutes of jiggling the hanger around the window frame, the lock clicked open.\n\nAs I succeeded in breaking into the van, I had a sudden realization: I had been in this type of situation before. In fact, I was born into it. Growing up in a family of seven, I was accustomed to unpredictability and chaos. My home was always loud, messy, and spottily supervised. My siblings argued, the dog barked, and the phone rang - all part of a normal day. My dad, a retired Navy pilot, was often away, and when he was home, he ruled with a firm hand. At the age of nine, he taught me how to clear burning oil from the surface of water, a lesson that may not have been practical but drove home the point that life is full of unexpected twists and turns.\n\nLiving in my family taught me to roll with reality, negotiate on the fly, and attempt the improbable. I learned not to sweat the small stuff and not to expect perfect fairness. When our dining room table only had six chairs for seven people, someone learned to be on time every night. But more importantly, I learned to thrive in situations beyond my control. I learned to adapt, to forge alliances, and to realign them as necessary. Sometimes I was the vulnerable little brother, and sometimes I was the wise elder. I learned to be different things to different people, depending on the situation.\n\nThis fall, our Head of School asked us a question that resonated deeply with me: \"How can I participate in a thing I do not govern, in the company of people I did not choose?\" It was a question that echoed the one I had faced in Laredo. And I knew the answer. I knew why the coat hanger had been handed to me. Growing up in my family, I was a vital participant in a thing I did not govern, in the company of people I did not choose. It's family, it's society, and often, it's chaos. You participate by letting go of the small stuff, not expecting order and perfection, and facing the unexpected with confidence, optimism, and preparedness. My family experience taught me to face a serendipitous world with confidence.",

I find immense satisfaction in this process, which is often spontaneous and subconscious. I'll jot down characters in the margins of notebooks with a humble pencil or trace letters in the air with chopsticks or my fingertips. In an era dominated by keyboards, handwriting is a relic, but one that holds a special significance.\n\nThe ancient Chinese believed that \"one's handwriting is a painting of one's mind.\" When I practice my handwriting, I'm not just crafting characters, I'm crafting my character. I take pleasure in meticulously designing each character, stroke by stroke, and building up to a personalized quote that reflects my own voice. Every movement of the pen and every drop of ink leads to something profound, as if the curves of every \"m\" are doorways to revelations.\n\nCharacters are the building blocks of language, and language is the vehicle through which knowledge unfolds. In a way, the letters under my pen are representations of knowledge, and the delicate beauty of each letter proves the intrinsic beauty of knowing. Handwriting reminds me of my conviction that through learning, answers are found, lives are enriched, and societies are bettered.\n\nMy passion for handwriting is a testament to my dedication to learning and my zeal for my conviction. It's a crucial aspect of my character. As I write, I'm reminded of David Hilbert's resolute declaration, \"We must know...\" - a mantra that echoes in my mind as I strive to uncover knowledge.\n\nI'm fascinated by the versatility of handwriting, particularly the various styles developed by the Chinese. Each style - or \"hand\" - seems to parallel one of my many academic interests. The Regular Hand, with its legible script, serves me well when I'm working through mathematical proofs. The Running Hand, with its semi-cursive script, is like the passionate words I speak before a committee of Model United Nations delegates. And the Cursive Hand, with its spontaneous strokes, is like the artistic sparks that come alive on stage.\n\nThe fact that these three distinctive hands can cooperate seamlessly, fusing together the glorious culture of writing, is a testament to the power of learning. It's a reminder that the many talents of the Renaissance Man can come together to enrich human society. My methodology is simple: just as I organize my different hands into a neat personal style, I can unify my broad interests with my passion for learning.\n\nAs Hilbert finishes his adage, \"...We will know!\" I scribble an exclamation mark, the final stroke of this painting of my mind. I must know, for knowing has an inherent beauty and intrinsic value. I will know, for my versatile interests in academics will flow like my versatile styles of writing. I must know, and I will know, for my fetish for writing is a fetish for learning.",

I, the plaintiff, argued that mathematics was too difficult and irrelevant to my goals, citing my recent struggles as evidence. My father, representing the defendant, countered that mathematics was essential for a career in business, which he hoped I would pursue. My brother and sister formed a small jury, and my mother presided over the case as judge.\n\nIn a passionate plea, I recounted how I had attempted to learn advanced math concepts, such as the Poisson distribution, but to no avail. I argued that persisting in mathematics would be a futile effort, and I petitioned the court to allow me to focus on the humanities instead. The jury deliberated and ultimately ruled in my favor, declaring that I shouldn't have to take math if I didn't want to. My father was disappointed, but I was thrilled.\n\nHowever, a year later, new evidence emerged that challenged the initial verdict. Mathematics appealed its sentence, and our makeshift court reconvened. My father reiterated that mathematics was not too difficult or irrelevant, pointing out that I had recently succeeded in pitching a business case to a company, which required mathematical skills. He implored me to give mathematics another chance.\n\nAs I reflected on my experience with the business case competition, I realized that mathematical processes made sense when applied in a practical context.

She was a bright light, with her blonde hair and infectious smile, amidst my family's sea of brunettes. She quickly became an integral part of our family, attending my concerts, award ceremonies, and even helping me study for tests. I was grateful for her support, but I had no idea that our roles would soon be reversed.\n\nKiersten was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of 22. Watching her undergo 20 rounds of chemotherapy was unbearable. Her cancer was later classified as refractory, resistant to treatment, and I felt helpless. I prayed to God, to her cancer, to anyone who would listen, to just leave her alone.\n\nEventually, Kiersten was able to leave the hospital and stay with my family for six weeks. We transformed our home into a sanctuary, protecting her from outside illnesses. I watched TV with her, baked cookies for her, and marveled at her persistence as she regained strength and achieved remission. In those moments, we beat biology, time, and death, with cookies, TV, and friendship.\n\nBut as I looked back on that experience, I realized that I had been so focused on helping Kiersten that I hadn't noticed how she had helped me.

The more I talked, laughed, and shared memories with her, the more I realized the power of loyalty, companionship, and optimism in the face of adversity. Kiersten showed me that living to love and loving to live is what truly matters.\n\nMost importantly, she taught me that helping others requires not just intellect and preparation, but solidarity and compassion.

When my parents finally told me that she had been battling liver cancer, I was 12 and consumed by anger - mostly towards myself.

I had abandoned my sick grandmother for trivial pursuits, and I was determined to make up for it.\n\nI threw myself into my education, believing that knowledge was the key to freeing myself from ignorance.

I'd stumble into the kitchen to find my grandma hunched over a large silver bowl, meticulously mixing fresh cabbage leaves with garlic, salt, and red pepper. This was how our beloved Korean dish, kimchi, was born every weekend in our home. My grandma's specialty always took center stage at the dinner table, filling every plate with its bold flavors. The savory smell of garlic seemed like a permanent fixture in our home, just like my grandma's presence.\n\nBut even the most treasured recipes are no match for the devastating effects of Alzheimer's disease. Dementia slowly consumed my grandma's memories, leaving her as blank as a new notebook. The ritualistic routine of Saturday mornings came to a halt, and the artificial taste of store-bought kimchi only highlighted the absence of our family tradition. I'd look at her and ask, \"Grandma, what's my name?\" only to be met with a clueless stare. Within a year of her diagnosis, she lived with us like a stranger.\n\nOne day, my mom brought home fresh cabbages and red pepper sauce, reviving the old tradition. As she prepared the ingredients, the familiar tangy smell wafted through the air, and my grandma, drawn by the aroma, slowly got up from the couch and sat beside the silver bowl. Her bony hands, though no longer swift and precise, moved with a determination that belied her frailty. As she shredded the cabbage leaves, her face reflected the aged rigor of a master craftsman. For the first time in years, the smell of garlic filled the air, and the rattling of the silver bowl resonated throughout the house. That night, we savored the imperfect yet precious kimchi, its flavors heightened by the memories it evoked.\n\nI still remember my grandma placing a piece in my mouth and saying, \"Here, Dong Jin. Try it, my boy.\" Seeing her again this summer, that fleeting moment of clarity seemed like a distant memory. Her disheveled hair and expressionless face told of the aggressive progression of her illness. Yet, holding her hands and looking into her eyes, I could still smell that garlic. The memories of Saturday mornings remain etched in my mind. My grandma was an artist who painted the cabbages with bold strokes of red pepper. Like the sweet taste of kimchi, I hope to capture those memories in my writing, preserving what time takes away.\n\nAs my grandma used to say, \"Tigers leave their fur when they die, humans leave their names.\" Her legacy is the lingering smell of garlic in our home.

It all began when my grandparents took me to their home in France, sparking a passion that has led me to visit twenty-nine countries and counting. Each destination has provided a unique learning experience, broadening my perspective and shaping my interests.\n\nI vividly remember marveling at the Eiffel Tower in Paris at the age of five, feeding pigeons in Venice's Piazza San Marco at eight, and standing in awe of Stonehenge and the Great Wall of China at thirteen. These experiences not only fueled my wanderlust but also sparked an interest in language. I realized that understanding the local language was key to fully immersing myself in different cultures.\n\nMy language journey began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I recall a humorous encounter in Paris where I mispronounced \"Rue des Pyramides\" and received a bewildered look from a store owner. This experience emphasized the significance of accurate pronunciation in effective communication.\n\nIn eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish, discovering the similarities between it and English through cognates. The realization that \"baseball\" in Spanish is \"béisbol,\" with a similar sound and structure, made speech and comprehension more fluid. Even today, I rely on cognates to help me navigate linguistic challenges.\n\nLater, in high school, I developed a passion for Chinese, mesmerized by the intricate characters and the way they combine to form complex words. I spent hours practicing calligraphy, captivated by the beauty and rhythm of the strokes. Studying foreign languages also led me to explore my native tongue, English, and I began to develop a sesquipedalian lexicon. I became intrigued by etymology, the history of words, and their origins.\n\nMy love for language also deepened my appreciation for history, which I came to see as a rich tapestry of stories that have shaped our world. In my freshman year, I took a world history class, and my enthusiasm for the subject grew exponentially.\n\nHowever, the most significant dimension that language has brought to my life is the ability to form intimate connections with people from diverse backgrounds. When I communicate with individuals in their native language, I find that I can connect with them on a deeper level. I've had the privilege of striking up conversations with people in unexpected places, from a Bulgarian painter in Paris to an Indian woman in Mumbai who used to work at the Argentinian embassy.\n\nMy passion for language has led me to pursue a college education in foreign language and linguistics. I am confident that this field will continue to enrich my life, enabling me to connect with people and cultures worldwide. Whether I pursue a career in international business, foreign diplomacy, or translation, I know that my language skills will be an invaluable asset.\n\nAs a Chinese proverb taught to me by my teacher goes, \"I am like a chicken eating at a mountain of rice.\" Each grain represents a new word to learn, a new language to master, and a new connection to forge. Today, I still have the travel bug, and I am equally addicted to language, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and connection.",

It was an ordinary day, with me typing away on an English essay, when my cat's loud meows and the flutter of wings disrupted the silence. I turned to find a barely breathing bird lying in front of me. The initial shock was overwhelming - my mind raced, my heart beat faster, and my face drained of blood. But as I instinctively reached out to hold the bird, I was jolted back to reality. This was a living creature, with flesh, blood, and a will to survive.\n\nMy reflexes kicked in, and I scrambled to find gloves, napkins, and towels to tend to the bird's wounds. Despite my cat's protests, I carefully picked up the bird, donning yellow rubber gloves to protect myself from its fragile body. As I stroked the bird with a paper towel to clear away the blood, I was met with a gruesome sight - crumpled wings, mangled feet, and a large gash near its jugular. The bird's shallow breathing was a harsh reminder of its mortality.\n\nIn that moment, I was transported back to a painful memory - the funeral of my friend Kari Hsieh, who had died in the Chatsworth Metrolink Crash at the age of 17. The grief, the apologies, and the sense of helplessness all came flooding back. But as I held the bird, I felt a surge of determination. I couldn't save Kari, but maybe, just maybe, I could save this bird.\n\nMy frantic actions heightened my senses, and I ran outside, hoping the cool air would work a miracle. But as I stood there, cupping the bird in my hands, I realized that it was dying. The line between life and death blurred, and I felt the weight of mortality acutely. Bird, human, human, bird - what was the difference, after all? Both were fragile, both were mortal.\n\nAs the bird's warmth faded away, I was left with a sense of despair. I wanted to retreat into my bedroom, confine myself to tears, and replay my memories. But instead, I dug a small hole in the earth and laid the bird to rest. As I covered it with dirt, I felt my own heart grow stronger, my own breath more steady. The wind, the sky, and the damp soil on my hands whispered a gentle truth: \"The bird is dead. Kari has passed. But you are alive.\"\n\nIn that moment, I knew that I had to hold on to life, to cherish every breath, every heartbeat, every sweat-drenched moment. As I stood there, surrounded by the silence of nature, I whispered back, \"I am alive. I am alive. I am alive.\"",

My body convulsed with uncontrollable shaking, and I gasped for air as the room spun around me. Just ten minutes earlier, I had been enjoying dinner with my family at a Chinese restaurant, savoring a bowl of chicken-feet soup. My mom had specifically asked the waitress if it contained peanuts, aware of my deadly allergy that we discovered when I was two. When the waitress assured us it was peanut-free, I dug in. But soon, I began scratching my neck, feeling the hives that were forming. I rushed to the restroom, desperate to throw up as my throat itched and a weight pressed on my chest. I was experiencing anaphylactic shock, struggling to take anything but shallow breaths. It was as if my own body was fighting against me, the very thing meant to protect and sustain me. At five years old, I couldn't understand what was happening. All I knew was that I felt sick, and I was waiting for my mom to make it better. I thought my parents were superheroes, capable of fixing anything. But when I heard the fear in their voices as they rushed me to the ER, I became scared. After that incident, fear took hold of me. I became afraid of death, eating, and even my own body. As I grew older, I became obsessed with checking food labels and avoided eating if I didn't know what was in the food. I knew the risks of eating something wrong, and I wasn't willing to take that chance. Ultimately, that fear turned into resentment; I resented my body for making me an outsider. But that experience, combined with my regular visits to my allergy specialist, inspired me to pursue a career in allergy research. Even at ten years old, I wanted to find a way to help kids like me. I wanted to find a solution so that nobody would have to endure the same pain, fear, and resentment. As I delved deeper into the medical world, I became fascinated with the body's immune responses, particularly how it reacts to allergens. This past summer, I took a month-long course on human immunology at Stanford University, where I learned about the complex mechanisms and cells that our bodies use to fight off pathogens. My desire to major in biology in college has been fueled by my fascination with the human body, its processes, and my desire to find a way to alleviate the suffering of those with allergies. I hope that one day I can discover a way to stop allergic reactions or at least mitigate their symptoms, so that children and adults don't have to live with the same fear and bitterness that I did.\"",

        "Text": "When I was 16, I lived with the Watkins family in Wichita, Kansas, as part of a foreign exchange student program coordinated by Mrs. Watkins. I babysat her nine-year-old son, Cody, every day after school for two to three hours, playing Scrabble or listening to him read from Charlotte's Web or The Ugly Duckling. He would chat about his friends and school life, and I would ask him about unfamiliar words. Cody became my first friend in the United States.\n\nMy second family was the Martinez family, friends of the Watkins. The host dad, Michael, was a high school English teacher, and the host mom, Jennifer (who I called \"Jen\"), taught elementary school. Although she had just given birth and was still in the hospital when I arrived, the family welcomed me with open arms. We spent quality time together, making pizzas, watching Shrek, and going fishing on Sundays. On rainy days, Michael, Jen, and I would sit on the porch, listening to the rain and discussing our dreams and thoughts. Within two months, I began calling them mom and dad.\n\nAfter completing the exchange program, I had the option to return to Korea but decided to stay in America to explore new places and meet different people. As I was no longer an exchange student, I had to find a new school and host family on my own. After a thorough search, I found the Struiksma family in California. They were a unique family, with Shellie, the single mom, having two biological sons and two adopted Russian daughters. The kids were always well-behaved and had a warm meal ready. Shellie's upbringing was the key to their discipline. My room was on the first floor, next to her hair salon, and the living room was equipped with massive amplifiers and a grand chandelier. Although the constant stream of visitors made me nervous at first, I soon grew accustomed to it. However, after a few months, I realized we weren't the best fit, and I politely told them I had to leave. They understood my decision.\n\nMy fourth family was the Ortiz family. Kimberly, the host mom, treated me like one of her own, assigning me chores like cooking dinner, feeding their dogs, and cleaning the bathroom. I also had to follow certain rules, such as no food in my room, no using the family computer, and no lights after midnight. The first few months were tough, but I eventually adjusted. I lived with the Ortiz family for seven months, but when Greg's asthma worsened, they decided to move to the countryside. I had to find a new host family within a week, and my friend Danielle offered me a temporary place to stay until I found a new home. That's how I met the Dirksen family, my fifth and final family.\n\nThe Dirksen family had three kids, each with their own unique preferences. We would play Wii Sports together after dinner, and I was the bowling champion. Afterward, we would gather in the living room, where Danielle would play the piano, and we would sing hymns together. I don't remember a single argument about the games.\n\nAlthough my 28 months with these five families were too short to fully understand each of them, I learned valuable lessons from each. Cody taught me the importance of learning from anyone; the Martinez family showed me the value of quality family time; the Struiksma family taught me not to judge divorced women and adopted children; Mrs. Ortiz taught me the importance of discipline; and the Dirksen family taught me to appreciate individual differences. Living with five families has made me more sensitive to others' needs, and I've learned to recognize when someone needs to talk, when to offer advice, and when to simply listen. I've become more adaptable and am ready to change, learn, and be shaped by my future families.",

However, everything changed when my mom was diagnosed with cancer and switched to a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I decided to support her by adopting this new way of eating, and together we dove into the world of nutritional science. We binge-watched documentaries like \"What the Health\" and \"Forks Over Knives,\" and read books by featured doctors like \"The China Study\" and \"How Not To Die.\" I became fascinated by the impact of diet on health and discovered how certain foods could prevent cancer, boost metabolism, and even cure acne and heart disease. I learned to pair foods to achieve the perfect macronutrient balance and was amazed by the benefits of plant-based eating, such as how beans and rice make a complete protein. This new lifestyle also sparked a passion for sustainability in me, as I realized that animal agriculture has a devastating impact on the planet. I began making small changes, like switching to reusable beeswax wraps and a foldable straw, to reduce my ecological footprint. My journey led me to become co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, where we're working to encourage local restaurants to offer plant-based, oil-free menu options. I even dream of opening my own affordable oatmeal cafe, where I can educate people about nutritional science through delicious, healthy food. I believe that hands-on experience is the best way to learn about the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle, so I love cooking and experimenting with new flavors. By using my taste buds as my textbook, I can teach others about the benefits of whole, plant-based foods and show them that healthy food doesn't have to be boring. As a result of my new lifestyle, I have more energy and have been able to push myself harder physically, even earning my high school Cross Country team's Most Improved award. While I'm still a picky eater, my preferences have changed, and I'm proud to call myself a vegeholic.",

The spreadsheet has become more than just a numerical record; it's a collection of memories and experiences that have shaped my life. A \"14\" on November 15, 2018, marked the inaugural meeting of the Lakeside Cooking on the Stove Club, which started as a whimsical idea but evolved into a biweekly gathering where friends and I prepare savory snacks. A \"16\" on February 27, 2019, commemorated the completion of a fence we built for a small Colombian village, a project that brought us closer to the community we grew to love. The Happiness Spreadsheet isn't just a reflection of my emotions; it's a testament to the joy I derive from bringing happiness to others. My family is the foundation of my life, with each member representing a unique neighborhood, each with their own story. When I'm overwhelmed, I turn to my father, who teaches me to look beyond the chaos and appreciate the hidden accomplishments. My mother, with her tranquil and sturdy background, helps me build confidence when I need it most. Whenever my happiness levels dip, my family is always there to support me. The Happiness Spreadsheet also serves as a gauge for my enthusiasm, which can be fully charged, like when I won a piano composition competition, or depleted, like when I'm struggling with writer's block. The spreadsheet can be a hall of fame, but it can also be a catalog of mistakes and challenges. It all began on a typical school day, after a confusing physics test, when I spontaneously came up with the idea and shared it with two friends. We thought it would last only a few weeks, but 700 days later, we're still going strong. With each new entry, I realize that it's not the individual data points that define me, but the ever-growing line that connects them, reflecting who I am today. As I continue to update the spreadsheet, I wonder where it will take me next.",

From this elevated vantage point, I feel a sense of solidarity with the mountains, as if we're motionless peers. I've transcended my physical form, surrendering to the epistemological stream, where I'm alone with my questions, diving for answers. Just a few months ago, I would have deemed this a frivolous waste of time.\n\nBefore attending Mountain School, my perspective was limited by the testosterone-driven environment of Landon School. I was funneled towards psychology and neuroscience, influenced by the proximity of the NIH, a mere 2.11-mile run from my school. I was taught that specialization was the ultimate achievement. Yet, subconsciously, I knew this wasn't the person I wanted to be. I seized the opportunity to apply to Mountain School, seeking a change.\n\nUpon arrival, however, I felt like an outsider. The atmosphere of laid-back acceptance was foreign and unsettling. Instead of engaging, I retreated to what was comfortable: sports and work. During the second week, a Broomball tournament presented the perfect blend of both. I organized the event, despite having no experience, and envisioned it unfolding. That night, the glow-in-the-dark ball skittered across the ice as my opponent and I clashed, brooms in hand. I suffered a concussion, but my stubbornness drove me to persist. Eventually, my healing brain protested, and I was forced to slow down.\n\nWith no classroom constraints, I wandered the campus, accompanied only by my thoughts. Occasionally, Zora, my English teacher's dog, would join me, and we'd walk for miles in silence. I also found solace in pruning the orchard, feeding the wood furnaces, and splitting wood. During those days, I created a new sense of home in my mind. However, thinking independently wasn't enough; I needed diverse perspectives.\n\nI initiated lively late-night discussions about medieval war machines, political theory, and more, challenging my friends to defend outrageous statements. Whether we achieved profundity or not, I reveled in the act of discourse itself. As Thoreau wrote, \"Let the daily tide leave some deposit on these pages, as it leaves, the waves may cast up pearls.\" I've always been enamored with ideas, but now I understand the value of riding their waves, letting them breathe, and becoming more than just answers to immediate problems.\n\nI'm drawn to ideas that cultivate innovative, practical enrichments for humanity. I enjoy tackling conundrums, large or small, and puzzling out solutions. Recently, my friend and I stumbled upon a design for a socially responsible disposable water bottle while returning from a cross-country meet. We now hope to bring it to life. While I still appreciate psychology and neuroscience, I want to incorporate contemplative thought into my work, analyzing enigmas from multiple perspectives.\n\nMy internships at the NIH and the National Hospital for Neuroscience and Neurosurgery in London provided valuable exposure to research and medicine. However, I've come to realize that neither of my previous intended professions allows me to expand consciousness in the way I desire. After much introspection, I've landed on behavioral economics as the perfect synergy of the fields I love. All it took was a knock on the head to set me on this path.",

We'd sit beside a dark end table, lifting our teacups to savor the mild aroma that filled the air. As we gazed out the French window, my father would share the latest news from China Daily, covering topics like the Syrian civil war, climate change, and gender equality in Hollywood. I'd mostly listen, but with each news story, my curiosity would grow. I secretly longed to discuss these issues with him from my own perspective. This desire motivated me to study in America, where I could learn more about the world. After a year of extensive research and numerous interviews, I made the move to America for 9th grade and began living with a host family. However, my new room lacked the warmth and comfort of our morning tea rituals. Fortunately, I stumbled upon Blue House Cafe on my way home from church and made it my new study spot. The cafe's spacious, bright atmosphere, complete with white walls, comfortable sofas, and high stools, provided the perfect setting for learning. As I sat by the window, I'd observe people from all walks of life, watching as a production designer scouted locations for his film or a painter brainstormed ideas for his next project. With a cup of coffee in hand, I'd dive into my studies, pouring over differential and parametric equations for my AP Calculus test, learning about public speaking through Michael Sandel's Justice lectures, and planning fundraising events for my non-profit. I'd also observe leaders hosting meetings at the cafe's conference table, taking note of their confidence and charisma as they expressed their ideas. As president of the International Students Club, I'd invite my teammates to meet with me at the cafe, where we'd plan events like Lunar New Year celebrations, field trips to the Golden Gate Bridge, and Chinese lunches to help international students feel more at home. Over cups of coffee, we'd discuss and debate, and after each meeting, we'd share buttermilk coffee-cake. From my spot by the window, I'd witness the diversity of San Francisco, observing visitors from all over, women carrying shopping bags, and people struggling to get by. Two years ago, I saw volunteers from City Impact offering sandwiches and hot chocolate to homeless people outside the cafe, which inspired me to get involved. I began volunteering with City Impact, and soon I was no longer just a bystander. At holiday outreach events, I'd help prepare and deliver food to those in need. Over a cup of coffee, I'd listen to stories like the one from an older Chinese man who shared with me, in Mandarin, his struggles with loneliness after being abandoned by his children. Last summer, I returned to Xiamen, China, and taught my father how to appreciate coffee. Now, our end table boasts both a Chemex and a teapot. Instead of just listening, I shared my experiences with my father, telling him about my work as a club president, community leader, and volunteer. I showed him my business plan and prototypes, and he beamed with pride, raising his cup of coffee in a toast to me. \"Good girl!\" he exclaimed, patting my head as he used to. Together, we savored the lingering aroma of coffee, enjoying each other's company.",

As I delved deeper into dance, I began to understand my body in ways I never thought possible, and it felt like rediscovering the joy of taking my first steps as a child.

While my classmates obsess over who to ask and how to muster the courage to do so, I've resigned myself to skipping the event for another year. When someone discovers I'm not attending, they always assume it's not because I can't afford to go. Instead, they ask with a chuckle, \"What, are you too poor?\" I'm forced to laugh it off and make up an excuse. It's disheartening to live in a wealthy community where kids can be so tactless. They're not intentionally mean, but rather, they're oblivious to the impact of their words. The few of us who are less fortunate often hide our situation, fearing being labeled as different. However, hiding our poverty only avoids the real problem: we shouldn't be ashamed of being poor.\n\nThe solution lies in educating our community about our struggles. We need to stop hiding our poverty and instead, share our stories. By doing so, we can foster a deeper understanding and encourage empathy towards those who are less fortunate. I've seen this movement begin, with individuals sharing their stories in person and on social media. Inspired by this, I confessed to my friends about why I never attended the dance. To my surprise, they offered me $60 each to cover the cost. One friend said, \"I'd rather spend money on letting you have a good time than on myself.\" I was humbled by their generosity, realizing I had been stingy and unaware of the importance of kindness. I hope to never again be as unaware as I thought my community was. As a member of this community, I must strive to be better.",

Just moments before, I had been bursting with excitement, as if I were waiting to receive the Nobel Prize. Throughout the four-day Project Fair, I had presented my mathematics project to over 100 visitors, and even received a mentorship offer from a renowned professor who was impressed by my work. I had developed two innovative approaches to expressing power sums in a formula, a complex topic that had previously been unsimplified. Given the enthusiastic response from everyone, including my fellow contestants, I was confident that I would win. However, my overconfidence ultimately led to great disappointment. As I reflected on my motivations, I realized that I wanted to win not just for the recognition, but for the validation of my mathematical findings on a national scale. When the winners were announced, I understood that what truly mattered was having my work appreciated. I took comfort in knowing that some projects overlooked by Turkish institutions had gone on to achieve international recognition, so my project may not have been inferior, just unsuccessful. The competition was the only platform in Turkey where I could showcase my mathematical skills, which is why I had been so eager to excel. However, failing to win taught me that there will be times in life when I will lose, just as there will be times when I will win. Fortunately, my upbringing has taught me to learn from failure and build myself up through it. My experience also made me more aware of the challenges facing Turkey, including political difficulties, terror threats, and constraints on scientific development. As an IB student, I had been taught to think globally, but the current atmosphere in Turkey is often at odds with this worldview. I began to wonder how I, as an international-minded and creative thinker, could reach my full potential in an environment that is often unsuitable. I realized that pursuing my studies in a place where science and development are prioritized would allow me to explore my passions without the limitations of the Turkish system. In Turkey, it's rare to hear people say \"I want to make a difference\" due to the constant distractions and challenges that make it difficult to focus on progress. As a woman and aspiring scientist, I want to make a difference and contribute to science, inspire Turkish women to pursue careers in science, and be a force for positive change in my homeland. I have come to see the outcome of the competition not as a failure, but as a catalyst for my growth and success.",

The more I tried to force them out, the more they would jam up, like a train derailment. Kids would often laugh or make fun of my stutter, but mostly they would ignore me, assuming I had nothing valuable to say. Eventually, I stopped trying to talk to people altogether. They thought I was stupid, and I started to believe it too.\n\nMy parents signed me up for soccer, hoping it would help me make friends. I wasn't exactly the next Messi, but soccer is a sport that welcomes anyone. On the field, my stutter didn't matter. I discovered that I could lead through action, rather than words. I could make a difference without having to say a thing. Eventually, speech therapy helped me overcome my stutter, but it was on the soccer field that I learned to be myself.\n\nOne of my teammates had a brother with Down Syndrome who would come to our games and watch from the sidelines. He had his own cleats and ball, but because of his intellectual disability, he couldn't join our team. It hit me that although soccer is a sport for everyone, not everyone is included. I knew the pain of being excluded because of an inability to communicate.\n\nThat's why, in February 2015, I launched GOALS (Giving Opportunities to All who Love Soccer), a unified soccer program for kids with and without special needs. GOALS pairs youth athletes with intellectual disabilities with neurotypical peer buddies. They play together in small-sided, non-competitive scrimmages. Our first program had just nine participants, but today we hold events twice a month for fifty players of all abilities. GOALS has impacted over 400 kids and is now an official partner of Special Olympics Arizona.\n\nBut what I'm most proud of isn't the numbers – it's the impact on kids like Josh, who came to his first GOALS event reluctantly, having never tried sports before. He discovered a love for soccer and now looks forward to playing with his friends at every event, where his autism diagnosis doesn't define him. What makes GOALS special is that it's not a community service program for kids with intellectual disabilities – it's a program that serves the entire community, recognizing that people of all abilities are valuable members.\n\nGOALS breaks down barriers, creating intentional connections that allow true friendships to develop. For many kids, GOALS is the first time they experience genuine acceptance. Through sports, we can create something better than tolerance – we can create a sense of belonging. People with intellectual disabilities are often isolated socially, not because they're not capable, but because we're too quick to pass them by. We need to slow down and get to know them.

        "Text": "Here is a rewritten version of the passage:\n\nAs I stood to recite my first vulnerable poem, my palms sweated with ocean waves of panic and my hands trembled like a 6.3 magnitude earthquake. But I spoke deliberately, refusing to let fear silence me. The words poured out: \"I want my insides—dry, dead wood—to be lit with a match, and no water could ever put me out, no hurricane of sadness, no gentle rainstorm of doubt could stop the heat inside...\" When I finished, I looked up to see my teacher's unblinking eyes brimming with tears. In that moment, I became a writer.\n\nIt was my sophomore year, in a creative writing class where students focused on a single genre. I had always stuck to fiction, the safe path, but poetry intimidated me. I admired its power to convey complex emotions in just a few lines, but I doubted my ability to craft such imagery and detail. That was until a classmate shared her work, and I was struck by her bold metaphors and cryptic imagery. What surprised me most was how effectively she conveyed her message. It was then that I realized writing didn't have to follow rules; it was about evoking emotions through unique images.\n\nWith newfound zeal, I began to experiment with literary devices and purposeful imagery. I aimed to convey emotion, not just tell a story. My poem was a departure from my usual fiction, as I poured my own confusion and stress onto the page. Reading it aloud was a transformative experience. I broke free from the fear of taking risks, and it gave me the courage to transfer to a new school, a decision that continued to build my confidence and creativity.\n\nBefore, I wrote as a means of escape, creating distractions by hiding in fictional worlds. But poetry taught me to confront my problems, to be brave, and to embrace vulnerability. I realized that my writing could have a profound impact on others, that it could be a unifying force that helped people feel less alone. I no longer view writing as an individual experience, but as a way to connect with others through shared emotions.\n\nThe tears that fell down my teacher's face and the wide eyes of my peers were not because they shared my exact experience, but because they connected the emotions I created with their own life stories. In revealing the deepest parts of myself, I helped others contemplate their own deeper thoughts. Now, I write to examine, to understand, and to comfort the chaos. I etch pieces of myself into every sentence, not expecting others to connect with the story, but with the emotion. I know that each poem or story is a heart, beating and alive, raw and vulnerable, yet stretching out to unite readers in a shared human experience.",

        "Text": "The ancient Greek poet Homer once said, \"How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!\" But I'd rather take a cue from Homer Simpson's infamous \"D'oh!\" - a carefree expression that embodies my approach to life. I'm not a philosopher, and I don't get bogged down in abstract thinking. For me, the meaning of life is not something to be debated, but rather something to be lived. I've learned that excessive doubt and caution can hold us back, and that sometimes, the best course of action is to simply take the leap.\n\nIn my junior year of high school, my school introduced Dual Credit courses with a GPA multiplier, touting them as a wise and less demanding alternative to AP classes. But I didn't play it safe. I took six AP classes, and I loved the challenge they presented. When it comes to education, I'm not cautious - I'm a doer. If I want to learn something, I go for it, without getting caught up in doubts about whether I'm capable or whether it's the \"right\" decision.\n\nThis approach has served me well in my pursuits. In ninth grade, I could have doubted my ability to run for office in the school's health club, but instead, I went for it and earned a position. Later, when our club faced a scheduling conflict with the Technology Students Association, I didn't get bogged down in debate - I simply took action, signing up for the technology club and proposing a solution that benefited both groups.\n\nBeyond school, my determination to take action has allowed me to make a positive impact in my community. At 17, I may not be able to vote, but that doesn't mean I'm powerless. I've made a difference through small actions, like teaching a kindergartener addition and tutoring classmates for the SAT. I may not be able to solve world hunger, but by pulling weeds from the community garden, I'm taking a step in the right direction.\n\nNot every action I take is successful, but I'd rather try and fail than play it safe and do nothing. As I see it, the choice is between cautious wisdom and taking a chance - and I'll always choose the latter. So, when faced with a decision, I'll take a cue from Homer Simpson and say, \"D'oh!\" - and then I'll take action.",

As a middle child, I've always been optimistic about the possibilities of meeting new people. My family of five often had to split up on flights, and I saw this as an opportunity to engage with someone new. This willingness to take risks and step out of my comfort zone has been a hallmark of my life, and it has led to some incredible experiences.\n\nOne of the most significant influences on my communication style has been my father, who was born profoundly deaf. Growing up, I had to adapt my approach to communicate with him, often recalibrating my words and gestures to ensure he understood me. This process taught me the importance of overcoming communication barriers and the value of persistence in building meaningful relationships.\n\nMy fascination with Chinese culture began at a young age, and it eventually led me to earn a competitive scholarship to study abroad in Chengdu, China. Immersing myself in the language and culture was a challenging but rewarding experience. Without fluency in Mandarin, I had to rely on gestures and intuition to navigate everyday situations. It was humbling to realize that I was experiencing what my father must have felt like his entire life - struggling to express his needs and understand others.\n\nDuring my time in China, I was pushed out of my comfort zone daily, from navigating the education system to trying new foods. But it was through these experiences that I developed a deeper appreciation for the importance of adaptability, resilience, and open-mindedness. When I was asked to deliver a speech in Chinese to over 500 people, I was terrified, but I knew it was an opportunity to push myself further.\n\nIn the end, my experiences in China taught me that the key to overcoming communication barriers is to embrace them head-on. By saying \"yes\" to new and uncomfortable experiences, I was able to develop lifelong friendships, gain a deeper understanding of a foreign culture, and even acquire a taste for exotic foods. As I returned home, I reflected on the power of stepping out of my comfort zone and the incredible experiences that can result. And, of course, I chose to sit next to a stranger on the flight home - an encounter that did not disappoint.",

As I grew physically, I began to understand the world around me, and the truths of society became clearer. I used to justify my mom's long work hours and our small apartment with black mold by thinking that everyone else had something \"better.\" But as I learned more, I realized that those differences became harder to ignore as people grew up and conformed to their roles in society.\n\nMy mom's youth, financial struggles, and lack of a degree, as well as my lack of a second parent, were characteristics I saw in people portrayed as failures. But my mom was anything but a failure. She worked tirelessly, putting my needs before hers, and sacrificing her own education to support me. Despite her strength, we faced looks of pity and degradation. But we refused to let others' judgments define us.\n\nWhen my mom worked late, she left me with her friends Brian and Eric. They discussed politics, philosophy, and physics, and answered my endless questions with honesty and insight. They inspired my passion for learning and taught me about the world. Brian, a chef, would often cook while we talked, and one night, as he made risotto, I asked about welfare. I knew my mom and I received it, but I didn't understand the negative connotation surrounding it. They explained that people often have misconstrued ideas about welfare, and that close-mindedness can lead to a lack of empathy.\n\nThis conversation stuck with me, especially after a girl at school laughed at me because my mom received welfare. She said her mom thought my mom shouldn't be in the PTA because she couldn't attend meetings due to work. Brian and Eric's words came back to me: \"There are a lot of things about the world that aren't fair. This is one of them.\" They reminded me that people like that girl and her mom try to tear others down because they don't understand the struggles of those who are different.\n\nWelfare didn't make me inferior; it taught me about perspective. People are quick to judge what they don't know or understand, and empathy is often overlooked. I believe that empathy and morality are essential traits, and I care deeply about how people treat each other. I've seen the damage that results when people become too self-involved to care about the impact of their words.\n\nThrough arts and humanities, I want to inspire empathy in others. Brian and Eric helped cultivate my passion for learning about people and evoking emotions to form meaningful connections. Whether through art, literature, or human sciences, I want to be someone who can open people up to different perspectives, and I want to do it by learning as much as I can so that I have something to give back.\n\nOn the flight home from China, I sat next to a stranger, and it didn't disappoint.

        "Text": "In Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel \"Crime and Punishment,\" the character Sonia is symbolically linked to Christ. After being forced into prostitution to support her family, Sonia covers her head and face with shawls and lies on her bed, overcome with grief - a gesture reminiscent of Christ's crucifixion. Her mother, Katarina, kisses her feet, echoing the devotion of worshippers who would kiss the feet of idols in churches. Through this scene, Dostoevsky suggests that even acts considered sinful, like prostitution, can be a path to sainthood. When I shared this anecdote with my mother, she became visibly emotional, leaving me perplexed. What could have triggered such a strong reaction? I asked if she wanted to talk about something, and her response was an understatement. She recounted how my father had destroyed our family's home, seized our identifying documents, and eventually took custody of my brother and me. Although my mother regained custody of me, my brother was left in the care of a father who showed little interest in his sons' well-being at the time. With no money, no home, and no supportive friends, my mother turned to her sister for help, only to be met with cruelty, deceit, and greed. My mother drew a parallel between her own situation and Sonia's. Both women faced seemingly insurmountable problems and were trapped in a patriarchal system that often values women only for their physical appeal. Despite her efforts to improve her circumstances, the system worked against her. She couldn't afford to replace her lost documents without risking eviction, and I was too young to endure the harsh conditions. She was stuck. When my father returned after over a year of poverty and lack of autonomy, he offered to rekindle their relationship, and she accepted - all for my sake. After witnessing her struggles with alcoholism and domestic violence, I had judged my mother as immoral or misguided. But I was wrong. Despite enduring unimaginable hardships and suffering in silence, she stayed in a toxic household with a man who had hurt her deeply, all for my well-being. If there is a higher power, I am convinced that it views Sonia and my mother not as sinners, but as saints.",

Looking back, I don't pinpoint a single moment when I realized my purpose was to study, craft, and teach story. Instead, it's a collection of memories, each one worn and fingerprinted with age. I recall devouring Peter Brook's \"The Empty Space\" on theatre theory late into the night, where I stumbled upon the line, \"Drama was exposure, it was confrontation... it led to... an awakening of understanding.\" These words sparked a revelation: storytelling is an emotional confrontation between the author, the writing, and the audience – a collision that yields catharsis. As a playwright, catharsis defines me.\n\nMy first play, \"The Rocket Man,\" adapted from Ray Bradbury's short story, follows a teenage boy struggling with his astronaut father's frequent absences. The parallel to my own life was uncanny – my father traveled for business, leaving our family incomplete without him. Writing a scene where the boy begs his father to stay changed my life. I wept, hoping my own father, a thousand miles away, was listening. That's when I learned that catharsis is releasing my own story within a story. When the line between my soul and the soul of my story blurs, that's when the real work begins.\n\nThe construct of \"The Rocket Man\" was like a cathedral, with my emotions as stained glass and memories as arches. But I realized that a cathedral is empty without people to experience it. When I shared the script with my cast and crew, they were moved to tears. I want to recreate this experience for audiences, establishing the theatre as a safe space where they can grieve, be seen, and hope. This goal begins not just with craft, but with overwhelming love for the audience. At its core, storytelling is service.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges of my life was creating a free playwriting course for middle-school girls. When the pandemic hit, I had to reimagine the course for a virtual setting. Teaching playwriting over Zoom meant listening to their struggles and desires, and witnessing the transcendence of having their lives reflected through story. They loved it. One student, Isabel, exclaimed about her excitement for class, even filming a one-woman version of her play. I left each class feeling like I might burst from joy. Teaching students to release their own story within a story is the most purposeful thing I've ever done.\n\nSitting in a theatre, feeling the collective hush as the overture begins, watching a thousand conversations stop in a single heartbeat – that's why I exist. To offer story. To teach it. That's my mission and my ministry.",

The unforgiving, neon green turf and the jagged rock formations send my ball spiraling in the wrong direction and careen straight into the roaring waterfall every time. The irony of my inadequate skills, however, is not lost on my younger sister, who routinely avoids obstacles and sinks her ball straight into the hole. Her embarrassing victory dance follows soon after, much to my own dismay. Notwithstanding my mini-golf shortcomings, I am known as “golf girl” by my peers and have learned much about myself and the game as the sole girl on my high school’s golf team. Growing up hearing tales of the golf team that my father coached and watching the LPGA from my grandfather’s couch instilled me with a passion for golf. As I grew older, my interest in golf only intensified. I would often tag along with my father to his coaching sessions, watching in awe as the players perfected their swings and strategized their shots. My grandfather, a keen enthusiast himself, would regale me with stories of legendary golfers like Annika Sorenstam and Se Ri Pak, inspiring me to work on my own game. It wasn't long before I decided to take the leap and join the high school golf team, despite being the only girl among a sea of boys.\n\nAt first, it was daunting. I had to contend with skeptical glances and whispered doubts from my teammates. Would I be able to keep up? Could I really hold my own against the boys? But I was determined to prove them wrong. I practiced tirelessly, honing my skills and building my strength. And slowly but surely, I began to earn their respect.\n\nAs \"golf girl,\" I faced unique challenges, of course. There were times when I struggled to keep up with the boys' longer drives, or when I felt self-conscious about my swing in front of my male teammates. But I refused to let those obstacles hold me back. Instead, I focused on my own game, working on my short game and developing a strategic approach to each hole.\n\nMy hard work paid off. I started to notice improvements in my game, and my teammates began to take notice too. They would offer words of encouragement and advice, and we would work together to perfect our shots. I discovered that golf wasn't just about individual skill, but about teamwork and camaraderie as well.\n\nThrough golf, I learned valuable lessons about perseverance, discipline, and sportsmanship. I learned to handle defeat graciously, to celebrate my teammates' victories, and to stay focused under pressure. And as I looked out at the lush green courses, I realized that golf was more than just a game – it was a way of life.\n\nAs I look back on my journey, I am grateful for the support of my family and friends, who encouraged me to pursue my passion despite the odds. I am proud to be \"golf girl,\" a title that has become synonymous with determination and grit. And as I prepare to take my game to the next level, I know that the lessons I've learned on the course will stay with me for a lifetime.",

The answer: twenty-two times. I was in a rush to finish the 48th peak before school began in order to fulfill a goal I set in fifth grade after meeting a wild pack of Appalachian Trail through-hikers. I marveled at their determination. As I reflected on my journey, I realized that it wasn't just about reaching the 48th peak, but about the lessons I learned along the way. The Appalachian Trail through-hikers I met had sparked a fire within me, and I was determined to follow in their footsteps. Over the years, I had faced numerous challenges, from navigating treacherous terrain to battling harsh weather conditions. But with each obstacle, I grew stronger and more resilient.\n\nThe early morning wake-up calls, which initially seemed daunting, became a ritual I looked forward to. There was something special about watching the sunrise from the summit, feeling the cool morning breeze on my face, and knowing that I had the entire day ahead of me. As I climbed, I began to appreciate the beauty of nature, the silence of the wilderness, and the sense of accomplishment that came with pushing my limits.\n\nReaching the 48th peak was not just a personal achievement; it was a testament to the power of perseverance and dedication. I remembered the countless hours I spent pouring over maps, planning my route, and preparing my gear. I recalled the times I wanted to give up, when the fatigue and pain seemed too much to bear. But I also remembered the moments of triumph, when I stood at the summit, feeling proud and exhilarated.\n\nAs I looked out at the breathtaking view from the top of the 48th peak, I felt a sense of pride and fulfillment. I had set a goal for myself, and I had achieved it. But more importantly, I had discovered a sense of purpose and direction. I realized that the journey, not the destination, was what truly mattered.\n\nThe experience had taught me valuable lessons about hard work, discipline, and self-reliance. I learned to trust myself, to believe in my abilities, and to push beyond my comfort zone. I developed a deeper appreciation for the natural world and the importance of preserving it for future generations.\n\nAs I began my descent, I felt a sense of gratitude towards the Appalachian Trail through-hikers who had inspired me. They had shown me that with determination and perseverance, anything was possible. I realized that my journey was not just about reaching the 48th peak, but about the people I met along the way, the experiences I had, and the lessons I learned.\n\nThe summer of 2022 will always be etched in my memory as a time of growth, discovery, and adventure. It was a summer that tested my limits, pushed me to new heights, and taught me valuable lessons about myself and the world around me. As I looked out at the breathtaking view from the top of the 48th peak, I knew that I would carry these lessons with me for the rest of my life.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't just about waking up at 4:15 a.m. twenty-two times; it was about the journey, the people, and the experiences that made it all worthwhile. It was about discovering my own strength, resilience, and determination. And it was about the realization that the true summit was not the 48th peak, but the person I had become along the way.",

        "Text": "The ground beneath me began to shake as an oil truck instantly burst into flames. A massive ball of fire flared into the sky, illuminating my awestruck eyes. Suddenly, hundreds of gallons of water rushed down onto the truck, safely extinguishing the blaze. “CUT!” a director yelled. I cheered, astonished by the scene I had just witnessed. My love for Hollywood began with moments like these from my childhood. Disney’s Hollywood Studios was home to attractions like The Great Movie Ride and The Studio Backlot Tour, both of which introduced me to the special effects, intricate illusions, and thrilling stunts seen in professional films. These two attractions were early indicators of my love for filmmaking, I just didn’t know it yet. Years later, I am still captivated by the magic of cinema. Whether it be a summer blockbuster, an Oscar-hopeful, or a cult classic, I’ll take any opportunity I can get to experience an original film. For a few hours, I can forget about the world around me, becoming completely immersed in the universe on-screen. As I grew older, my fascination with filmmaking only intensified. I began to notice the subtle nuances that made a movie truly exceptional – the way a cinematographer could manipulate lighting to evoke emotions, the manner in which a composer's score could elevate a scene, and the art of editing that seamlessly wove together disparate shots into a cohesive narrative. I devoured behind-the-scenes documentaries, attended film festivals, and even attempted to create my own short films with friends.\n\nMy love for cinema soon transcended mere entertainment, becoming a passion that influenced my perspective on the world. I began to see the world as a series of cinematic moments, each with its own unique story to tell. A sunset on a beach became a poignant closing shot, a bustling city street a vibrant montage, and a quiet conversation between friends an intimate character study. Film had taught me to appreciate the beauty in the mundane, to find meaning in the everyday, and to cherish the fleeting moments that make life worth living.\n\nAs I explored the world of filmmaking, I discovered that it was not just about the technical aspects of cinematography or editing, but about the people behind the camera. I was drawn to the visionaries, the risk-takers, and the dreamers who dared to bring their unique perspectives to the screen. I was inspired by the pioneers who broke down barriers, challenged conventions, and pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible.\n\nMy admiration for filmmakers soon turned into a desire to join their ranks. I began to take courses in screenwriting, directing, and production design, honing my skills and learning from my mistakes. I collaborated with like-minded individuals on short films, music videos, and even a feature-length script. With each project, I felt myself growing closer to realizing my dream of becoming a filmmaker.\n\nAs I look back on my journey, I am reminded of that oil truck bursting into flames on the backlot of Disney's Hollywood Studios. It was a moment that sparked a passion, ignited a curiosity, and set me on a path that has led me to where I am today. The magic of cinema has taken me on a wild ride, and I am grateful for the adventure. As I continue to chase my dreams, I am reminded that the greatest special effect of all is the power of storytelling, and I am eager to see where this journey will take me next.",

        "Text": "These days, birds are losing the battle of favored domestic animal to dogs and cats. At best, they're an easily forgotten blot in the otherwise clear sky, and at worst, they're nasty pests associated with filth and disease. But for many years, birds were something much greater, the catalyst of folklore and tales for nearly every culture around the world. We've all heard some iteration of a bird story before: Common characters you might recall include the wise owl, mischievous raven, vain peacock, and motherly hen. I was introduced to these stories early on, first captivated by the avian parables I listened to on CDs, and they became an integral part of my early years. I can still remember proudly reciting \"The Ant and the Magpie\" word for word to my parents, an important tale reminding listeners to save resources for a time in need, represented by the winter in the animal world. As I grew older, my fascination with bird stories only deepened. I began to notice the subtle nuances in the way different cultures depicted birds in their folklore. In some, birds were messengers of the gods, while in others, they were tricksters, outsmarting even the most cunning of foes. The more I delved into these stories, the more I realized that birds were not just mere characters, but rather, they embodied the values and principles of the societies that created them.\n\nThe owl, for instance, was often associated with wisdom, but in some African cultures, it was also seen as a symbol of darkness and evil. This dichotomy fascinated me, as it revealed the complexities of human nature and the multifaceted nature of wisdom itself. Similarly, the peacock's vanity was not just a humorous anecdote, but a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and arrogance.\n\nAs I explored these stories further, I began to appreciate the role that birds played in shaping our collective imagination. They were not just passive characters, but active agents that inspired creativity, sparked imagination, and conveyed moral lessons. In many ways, birds were the original superheroes, possessing extraordinary abilities and powers that set them apart from the mundane world of humans.\n\nMoreover, bird stories often served as a window into the natural world, highlighting the intricate relationships between humans and the environment. The tale of the ant and the magpie, which I had proudly recited to my parents, was not just a simple fable about saving for the future, but a commentary on the delicate balance between nature's bounty and human responsibility.\n\nAs I reflect on my childhood fascination with bird stories, I am struck by the enduring power of these tales. They have the ability to transcend time and culture, speaking to fundamental human concerns and aspirations. In an era where birds are often relegated to the periphery of our attention, it is more important than ever to revisit these stories and rediscover the wisdom they impart.\n\nBy doing so, we can not only appreciate the beauty and diversity of the avian world, but also tap into the rich cultural heritage that birds have inspired. We can learn valuable lessons about the importance of community, cooperation, and environmental stewardship. And, perhaps most importantly, we can recapture the sense of wonder and awe that these stories evoke, reminding us of the magic and mystery that lies just beyond our reach, in the skies above.",

        "Text": "YouTube taught me everything, from simple tasks I was too insecure to ask about- such as how to correctly toast bread- to what defines me now, being a dancer. I remember one night, I was sitting on the guest room rug with my small Samsung phone, looking up videos. Trying to learn how to do a coffee grinder, a breakdance move. I remained there an hour, tirelessly attempting to learn this one move— that every break-dancer made seem so easy—over and over again. After the extensive and what seemed to be an infinite hour. I did one, jumping up and down in the air with jubilance. I instantly went down for a second attempt, breaking the shackles of failure with maximum momentum. I continued, proceeding counter-clockwise, moving with a kind of elegance that can only be associated with a mindset for success. As I mastered the coffee grinder, I began to explore more advanced moves, devouring tutorials on YouTube like a hungry student. I spent hours upon hours practicing, perfecting my technique, and pushing myself to new heights. The guest room rug became my sanctuary, my happy place where I could escape the doubts and fears that had once held me back.\n\nYouTube became more than just a platform for entertainment; it was my mentor, my guide, and my confidant. I would watch videos of professional dancers, analyzing their movements, studying their body language, and absorbing their energy. I would then attempt to replicate their moves, often failing miserably, but never giving up. The sense of accomplishment I felt when I finally nailed a difficult step was indescribable.\n\nAs I progressed in my dance journey, I began to notice changes within myself. I was more confident, more assertive, and more self-assured. Dancing had become a part of me, a fundamental aspect of my identity. I no longer felt like the insecure, timid person I once was. I had transformed into a bold, fearless individual who was unafraid to take risks and push boundaries.\n\nYouTube had not only taught me how to dance, but it had also taught me valuable life lessons. It had taught me the importance of perseverance, of hard work, and of dedication. It had shown me that with enough passion and determination, I could overcome any obstacle, no matter how daunting it may seem.\n\nAs I continued to dance, I began to realize that my journey was not just about mastering moves or perfecting techniques. It was about self-discovery, about finding my true purpose, and about embracing my true self. Dancing had become a form of self-expression, a way for me to convey emotions, to tell stories, and to connect with others on a deeper level.\n\nToday, as I look back on my journey, I am grateful for that small Samsung phone and the countless hours I spent watching YouTube tutorials. I am grateful for the struggles, the setbacks, and the frustrations, because they have made me the dancer I am today. I am proud of the person I have become, and I know that YouTube will always be a part of my story, a reminder of the power of perseverance, passion, and dedication.",

I do my share of feeding the dogs and mowing the lawn, but growing up in a two hundred and thirty-four-year-old tavern has meant that my experiences and responsibilities go well beyond the usual fare—like when I discovered my cats meowing and leaping at two chimney swifts that had fallen down the fireplace and were frantically circling my room. Once, during a Nor’Easter, I woke up to find that snow was blowing through the seams of the house’s original window panes. I swept up the little, swirling drifts on my bedroom floor, taped up the windows, and went back to bed. It was in times like these that I was just a bit envious of my friends’ newer, weathertight homes, but deep inside, I knew I would not trade sleeping in extra layers in my quirky, old Harvard, Massachusetts home for any other place. As I grew older, I began to appreciate the unique charm of our historic tavern. I loved how the creaky wooden floorboards beneath my feet told stories of generations past, and how the musty smell of aged woodwork transported me to a bygone era. I would often imagine the countless gatherings, celebrations, and quiet moments that had taken place within these walls, and the countless people who had called this place home.\n\nMy parents, both history buffs, had painstakingly restored the tavern to its former glory, and I had grown up watching them work tirelessly to preserve its integrity. They would regale me with tales of the tavern's past, of the Revolutionary War soldiers who had once gathered here, of the traveling musicians who had performed in the very room where I now slept. As I listened, I felt a deep connection to the place, a sense of pride and ownership that went beyond mere residency.\n\nBut it wasn't just the history that made our home special – it was the way it seemed to come alive at night. When the lights were dimmed and the fire crackled, the shadows on the walls would seem to shift and dance, as if the old tavern was sharing its secrets with me. I would sit by the fireplace, listening to the wind howl through the chimneys, and feel the weight of centuries of stories and memories bearing down upon me.\n\nOf course, there were also the more mundane aspects of living in a historic home. The plumbing was temperamental, the heating system was ancient, and the electricity would sometimes flicker ominously. But even these quirks had become a part of the tavern's charm, a reminder that this was a place that had been lived in, loved, and worn in over the years.\n\nAs I look back, I realize that growing up in that old tavern taught me valuable lessons about the importance of preservation, community, and storytelling. It showed me that even the most ordinary-seeming places can hold extraordinary secrets and stories, if only we take the time to listen. And it instilled in me a deep appreciation for the beauty of imperfection, for the way that worn wooden floorboards and creaky door hinges can speak volumes about the people who have come before us.\n\nToday, as I prepare to leave the tavern behind and make my own way in the world, I know that I will carry the lessons of this quirky, old home with me. I will carry the memories of chimney swifts and swirling snowdrifts, of creaky floorboards and musty woodwork. And I will carry the sense of pride and ownership that comes from having called this special place my own.",

        "Text": "The air thickened with red dust as I walked into the basement of Washington Studio School for my first sculpting class - a way to be creative after a stressful day. As I pulled back a thick curtain to enter, I looked around the room, examining the surfaces, all covered in a thin layer of that same dust. The bookshelves behind me were sporting a small collection of sculptures. We were given a 4’ by 6’ block of clay to mold into a woman that was sitting in front of us. I stared at the block of clay, unable to imagine how to start. The woman next to me immediately started shaping her rust-colored slab. As I stood frozen, the instructor, a kind-eyed woman with a wild mane of curly hair, began to circulate around the room, offering words of encouragement and gentle guidance. She stopped in front of me, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she smiled. \"Don't worry, you'll get there,\" she said, her voice low and soothing. \"Just start with the basics. Think about the shape of the woman's body, the curves and lines that make her who she is.\"\n\nI nodded, taking a deep breath as I gazed at the block of clay in front of me. It was daunting, to say the least. I had never worked with clay before, and the thought of shaping it into a recognizable form seemed like an impossible task. But as I began to tentatively touch the cool, damp surface, something strange happened. My fingers seemed to move of their own accord, tracing the outline of a shoulder, the curve of a hip.\n\nAs I worked, the room around me began to fade away, and I was transported to a different time and place. I thought about the women in my life, the ones who had shaped me into the person I am today. My mother, with her strong, angular features and her quick, clever hands. My grandmother, with her soft, round face and her gentle, loving touch.\n\nThe clay began to take shape beneath my fingers, slowly but surely. I added a neck, a head, arms and legs. The woman began to emerge, her features rough and unfinished, but somehow, somehow, alive. I stepped back, surveying my work, and felt a surge of pride and accomplishment.\n\nAs the class drew to a close, the instructor walked around the room, examining each of our creations. She stopped in front of mine, her eyes narrowing as she studied it. \"You know, this is really good,\" she said, her voice filled with surprise. \"You have a natural talent for this.\"\n\nI beamed, feeling a sense of validation and excitement. Maybe, just maybe, I had found a new passion, a new way to express myself and tap into my creativity. As I packed up my things and said goodbye to my fellow students, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation, a sense of possibility.\n\nI left the studio that day feeling lighter, freer, than I had in weeks. The stress and anxiety that had been weighing me down seemed to lift, replaced by a sense of purpose and direction. I knew that I would be back, that I would continue to explore this new medium, to see where it would take me.\n\nAs I walked out into the bright, crisp air, I felt a sense of gratitude for that dusty, cramped basement, for the instructor and her words of encouragement, and for the block of clay that had sparked something deep within me. I knew that I would never forget this experience, this moment of discovery and creativity. It was a reminder that, no matter how old we get, no matter how stuck we may feel, there is always the possibility for growth, for change, and for transformation.",

        "Text": "Had I written this essay three years ago, I would have written with utmost passion about my desire to be a cardiologist. I would have shared that cardiology had lifted the veil placed on my eyes to blind me from my true essence - saving lives. I would have continued to share that it exhibited two of my most accented strengths: my attention to detail and my ability to value each person if though their soul was a reflection of my own. However, as I reflect on my journey, I realize that my passion for cardiology has undergone a significant transformation. The veil that was once lifted has been replaced by a new lens, one that has allowed me to see the world of medicine in a more nuanced and complex way. My experiences have taught me that being a cardiologist is not just about saving lives, but about understanding the intricate web of factors that contribute to a person's well-being.\n\nI recall my volunteer work at a local hospital, where I was exposed to the harsh realities of healthcare disparities. I saw patients who were struggling to access basic medical care, not because they lacked the desire to get better, but because they lacked the means to do so. I saw families who were torn apart by the financial burden of medical bills, and I saw communities that were ravaged by preventable diseases. These experiences shook me to my core, and I began to question whether being a cardiologist was truly the most effective way to make a positive impact.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of medicine, I discovered the importance of preventative care and public health initiatives. I realized that many of the health problems that plague our society are not just medical issues, but social and economic ones as well. I saw how poverty, lack of education, and systemic inequality can all contribute to poor health outcomes, and I began to understand that being a cardiologist was not just about treating individual patients, but about addressing the root causes of disease.\n\nMy attention to detail, which was once focused solely on the intricacies of the human heart, has expanded to encompass the complexities of healthcare systems and social structures. I have come to realize that saving lives is not just about performing surgeries or prescribing medications, but about advocating for policies that promote health equity and social justice.\n\nMy ability to value each person as if their soul was a reflection of my own has also evolved. I no longer see patients as mere individuals, but as part of a larger community that is interconnected and interdependent. I have learned to appreciate the cultural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors that shape a person's health, and I have come to understand that true healing can only occur when we address these factors holistically.\n\nIn many ways, my passion for cardiology has not diminished, but it has matured. I still believe that cardiology has the power to transform lives, but I now see it as part of a larger movement towards creating a more just and equitable healthcare system. I am no longer content to simply treat individual patients, but I am driven to address the systemic issues that perpetuate health disparities.\n\nAs I look to the future, I am excited to embark on a journey that will take me beyond the walls of a hospital or clinic. I am eager to engage with communities, to advocate for policy change, and to work towards creating a world where healthcare is a right, not a privilege. My desire to be a cardiologist has evolved into a desire to be a force for positive change, and I am confident that my passion, combined with my attention to detail and my ability to value each person, will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the world.",

Growing up in a house of four children was a hectic environment to say the least; an escape from the chaos of siblings was much needed. As a kid, sitting down and concentrating on one task was never my intention, rather I was constantly energetic, chasing and being chased by my siblings. Building Lego sets had always been a way to minimize any stressors that were going on at the time, or to simply relax and enjoy the challenge. My first Lego set was given to me at a very young age, my seventh birthday, and although excited, I was puzzled with what I was supposed to accomplish. I knew that Luke Skywalker was going to need a little more assistance than I could offer at that age, so after countless hours of struggling and persisting, I inevitably succumbed to the numerous offers of help. Each birthday and holiday moving forward, I requested Legos in order to perfect my ability, and each time I gained expertise. As I grew older, my passion for Legos never wavered. In fact, it only intensified. I began to appreciate the intricacies of each piece, the way they fit together seamlessly, and the sense of accomplishment that came with completing a set. My room became a Lego haven, with boxes upon boxes of colorful bricks and half-built creations scattered about. My siblings would often tease me, calling me a \"Lego nerd,\" but I didn't mind. I was too busy building my own reality, one brick at a time.\n\nAs I entered my pre-teen years, my Lego creations became more complex and ambitious. I began to experiment with different themes and styles, moving beyond the traditional Star Wars sets to explore the world of architecture, space exploration, and even abstract art. My parents, though sometimes frustrated by the mess, encouraged my creativity, recognizing the value of this unique outlet.\n\nBut Legos weren't just a hobby; they also taught me valuable skills that would benefit me in the long run. Patience, perseverance, and attention to detail were essential in completing even the most basic sets. As I worked on more intricate designs, I developed problem-solving skills, learning to think critically and outside the box. These skills would later translate to academic success, as I excelled in math and science, and even helped me navigate the challenges of team projects and presentations.\n\nMoreover, Legos helped me develop a sense of self-confidence. As I built and created, I began to see myself as capable and competent. I realized that with dedication and hard work, I could bring my ideas to life, no matter how ambitious they may seem. This confidence spilled over into other areas of my life, as I became more outgoing and willing to take risks.\n\nToday, as I look back on my childhood, I am grateful for the impact Legos have had on my life. They have taught me the value of creativity, perseverance, and self-confidence. They have provided an escape from the chaos of everyday life, a way to relax and unwind. And, perhaps most importantly, they have given me a sense of purpose, a reminder that even in the most turbulent of times, I have the power to build my own reality, one piece at a time.",

        "Text": "Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and my Massachusetts city had also been torn apart. In a city where nearly half of the population is Puerto Rican, the destination of people fleeing the island had immediately come into question, “Why are they coming here? Our schools already don’t have enough books for our students, never mind Puerto Rican refugees.” These are words out of my French and Irish uncle’s mouth. I was taken aback by his words, not because I hadn't heard similar sentiments before, but because they came from someone I loved and respected. My uncle, a kind and generous man, had always been welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Yet, in that moment, his fear and frustration got the better of him. I realized that the sentiment was not unique to him, but was a reflection of a broader anxiety that had been simmering beneath the surface of our community.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, the city struggled to cope with the influx of new residents. Our schools were indeed overcrowded, and our social services were stretched to the breaking point. It was easy to understand why some people felt overwhelmed and resentful. But as I looked around at the faces of my friends and neighbors, I saw a different story.\n\nI saw families who had lost everything, who had fled their homes with nothing but the clothes on their backs. I saw children who had been torn from their schools, their friends, and their familiar surroundings. I saw people who were desperate for a sense of safety and security, and who were willing to work hard to rebuild their lives.\n\nAs I listened to their stories, I began to understand the depth of their trauma. I heard about the fear of not knowing if their loved ones were safe, of not having access to basic necessities like food and water, of living in a state of constant uncertainty. And I realized that my uncle's words, and the words of others like him, were not just about resources or logistics – they were about empathy and compassion.\n\nI began to wonder why we, as a society, were so quick to turn away from those in need. Why did we assume that the people coming to our city were a burden, rather than an opportunity? Why did we forget that we, too, had once been strangers in a new land, seeking a better life?\n\nAs I reflected on these questions, I realized that the issue was not about the refugees, but about us. It was about our own fears and biases, our own sense of scarcity and insecurity. It was about our failure to recognize that we are all in this together, that we are all human beings deserving of dignity and respect.\n\nIn the months that followed, I saw a glimmer of hope. I saw community leaders and activists coming together to support the new arrivals. I saw volunteers donating their time and resources to help families get back on their feet. I saw businesses offering jobs and training programs to help people rebuild their lives.\n\nAnd I saw my uncle, who had initially spoken out against the refugees, begin to see the error of his ways. He started volunteering at a local food bank, where he met some of the very people he had once feared. He heard their stories, and he saw their faces, and he began to understand.\n\nHe began to understand that the people coming to our city were not a burden, but a blessing. They brought with them new perspectives, new skills, and new energy. They brought with them a sense of resilience and determination that inspired us all.\n\nAs I looked around at the people of my city, I saw a community that was slowly, but surely, coming together. I saw a community that was learning to embrace its differences, rather than fear them. And I saw a community that was beginning to understand that we are all in this together, that we are all human beings deserving of dignity and respect.\n\nThe devastation of Hurricane Maria was a tragedy, but it also brought us an opportunity. It brought us an opportunity to re-examine our values, to re-evaluate our priorities, and to re-commit to the principles of compassion and empathy that have always defined us as a society. As I looked around at the faces of my friends and neighbors, I knew that we still had a long way to go. But I also knew that we were on the right path, and that together, we could build a brighter future for all.",

As my family and I flitted between states and coasts for my father’s job over the last decade, I shielded myself with fantasy novels. With my head propped on the baseboard near my nightlight and a book held up in front of me by aching arms, I would dance in whimsical forests, fight daring battles, and rule dangerous courts long after dark. In my fantastic universe, I could take turns being the queen, the knight, the hero, and even the villain. These books helped me express the happiness, anger, sadness, and queerness I could not have even begun to imagine alone. The characters I discovered in novels as I toured libraries and Barnes & Noble stores in strip malls around the country taught me resilience and empowered me to nourish my strengths. As I navigated the complexities of adolescence, my fictional worlds became an escape from the turbulence of my real life. With each move, I had to rebuild my social circle, adapt to new teachers and classmates, and find new hiding spots in unfamiliar neighborhoods. The characters in my books, however, remained constant companions, offering solace and wisdom as I struggled to find my place in the world.\n\nThrough their stories, I learned to confront my fears, to stand up for myself, and to embrace my individuality. I realized that I didn't have to conform to societal norms or expectations; I could forge my own path, just like the heroes and heroines I admired. In the pages of those novels, I discovered a sense of belonging, a sense of self that I couldn't find in the ever-changing landscape of my childhood.\n\nAs I grew older, my love for fantasy novels only deepened. I began to explore more complex themes and genres, delving into the realms of science fiction, historical fiction, and magical realism. I devoured books by authors like Ursula K. Le Guin, Octavia Butler, and N.K. Jemisin, who challenged my perspectives and broadened my understanding of the world.\n\nTheir works introduced me to diverse characters, cultures, and experiences that resonated with my own feelings of displacement and disorientation. I saw myself in the struggles of their protagonists, who navigated alternate realities, fought against oppressive regimes, and explored the boundaries of identity and power.\n\nThrough these stories, I gained a new appreciation for the power of imagination and the importance of representation. I realized that fiction wasn't just a form of entertainment; it was a tool for social commentary, a platform for marginalized voices, and a catalyst for empathy and understanding.\n\nAs I prepare to embark on my own journey, leaving the familiarity of my family's nomadic lifestyle behind, I know that the lessons I've learned from my beloved books will stay with me. They have taught me to be brave, to be resilient, and to be unapologetically myself. They have shown me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope, always a chance for redemption and transformation.\n\nAnd so, as I flip the pages of my latest novel, I am reminded of the incredible journey that has brought me to this moment. I am grateful for the characters who have become like family to me, for the authors who have inspired me, and for the fantastical worlds that have given me a sense of purpose and belonging. As I close the book and look out at the unknown landscape of my future, I know that I will carry the magic of those stories with me, guiding me every step of the way.",

        "Text": "I dreaded their arrival. The tyrannical cicadas swarmed DC and neighboring areas in 1987, 2004, and again in 2021. I was freaking about Brood X, the worst of them all. Brood X is a cluster of cicadas that descend on Washington, D.C., every 17 years. I live in the epicenter of their swarm. As the days drew closer to their emergence, I could feel the anxiety building up inside me. I had heard horror stories from friends and family members who had lived through previous broods. They spoke of the deafening noise, the overwhelming stench, and the sheer terror of being surrounded by millions of crawling, flying creatures. I couldn't help but imagine myself trapped in a scene from a sci-fi horror movie, with cicadas crawling out of every crevice and corner.\n\nAs the predicted date of their arrival drew near, I began to prepare myself for the worst. I stocked up on earplugs, knowing that the incessant chirping would drive me mad. I covered my windows with screens, hoping to keep the pesky insects out of my home. I even considered staying indoors for the entire duration of their visit, but something about that felt like surrender.\n\nAnd then, one morning, they arrived. I woke up to the sound of gentle humming, like a distant engine revving up. At first, I thought it was just the usual city noise, but as I stepped outside, I was met with a sight that took my breath away. The trees were alive, their branches quivering with the weight of thousands of cicadas. The air was thick with their bodies, a swirling vortex of red eyes and translucent wings.\n\nI stood there, frozen in awe, as the cicadas began to crawl out of the ground. They emerged from the earth like a dark, writhing tide, their shells cracking open to reveal the awkward, gangly creatures within. It was both fascinating and terrifying, like watching a natural disaster unfold before my very eyes.\n\nAs the days passed, the noise grew louder, the chirping reaching a fever pitch that seemed to vibrate through every cell in my body. I learned to recognize the different species, each with their unique song and rhythm. I even found myself growing accustomed to the constant din, my brain adapting to the cacophony like a sailor growing used to the rocking of the waves.\n\nBut it wasn't all bad. As I ventured out into the swarm, I began to notice the strange beauty of it all. The cicadas brought a sense of community to the city, with strangers stopping to marvel at the spectacle together. Children laughed and played, chasing after the insects with nets and buckets. Even the usually stoic city officials couldn't help but crack a smile, as if the sheer absurdity of it all had brought us all together.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as they had arrived, the cicadas began to disappear. Their bodies littered the sidewalks, their shells crunching beneath my feet like brittle leaves. The noise faded away, leaving behind an eerie silence that felt almost palpable.\n\nAs I looked out at the empty trees, I felt a pang of sadness. I had grown accustomed to the chaos, to the sense of wonder and awe that the cicadas had brought to my life. But as I watched the last of them disappear into the earth, I knew that I would always cherish the memory of Brood X, the tyrannical cicadas that had descended upon my city like a biblical plague, and had somehow, against all odds, brought us all together.",

        "Text": "I was born to two moms. One, my biological mom, Meredith. One, my mom who adopted me, Mary. Growing up, I never thought of my family as unconventional. To me, it was just normal. I had two moms who loved me unconditionally, and that's all that mattered. They were my rock, my support system, and my everything. I didn't realize until much later that not everyone had the same experience.\n\nAs I entered elementary school, I began to notice that my family was different from others. Kids would ask me about my dad, and I would explain that I didn't have one. Some would look at me with confusion, while others would stare with curiosity. I remember feeling a sense of pride when I would tell them that I had two moms instead. It was as if I was saying, \"Yeah, I'm special, and my family is unique.\"\n\nBut as I grew older, the questions became more frequent and more invasive. People would ask me about my biological mom, about how I felt about not having a father figure in my life, and about whether I felt \"normal.\" It was as if they thought I was somehow broken or incomplete because of my family structure. I would try to brush it off, but deep down, it would sting.\n\nMy moms were always there to reassure me, to tell me that I was loved and that our family was perfect just the way it was. They would remind me that family is not just about biology, but about the love and commitment that people have for one another. They would tell me stories about how they met, about how they fell in love, and about how they decided to start a family together.\n\nAs I entered my teenage years, I began to realize that my family was not just unique, but also incredibly strong. My moms had faced obstacles and challenges that many heterosexual couples would never have to endure. They had to navigate a complex legal system to adopt me, and they had to deal with discrimination and prejudice from people who didn't understand or accept their relationship.\n\nBut despite all of this, they remained steadfast in their love for each other and for me. They showed me that family is not just about blood ties, but about the bonds that we form with one another. They taught me that love is love, no matter what gender or sexual orientation.\n\nToday, I am proud to say that I was born to two moms. I am proud to be a part of a family that is unapologetically itself, even in the face of adversity. I am proud to have grown up with two role models who have shown me what it means to love without condition, to accept without judgment, and to be true to oneself without apology.\n\nAs I look back on my childhood, I realize that my family's uniqueness was not a weakness, but a strength. It taught me to be open-minded, to be empathetic, and to be accepting of others. It taught me that family is not just about biology, but about the love and commitment that we have for one another.\n\nAnd as I move forward in life, I know that I will carry these lessons with me. I will carry the love and support of my two moms with me, and I will use it to make a positive impact on the world. I will be an ally to those who are marginalized and oppressed, and I will fight for the rights of all families, no matter what they look like.\n\nI was born to two moms, and I am grateful for it. I am grateful for the love, the support, and the lessons that they have taught me. I am grateful for the unique perspective that I have on the world, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my story with others.",

I am freshly 14 and visiting my father’s homeland for the first time, unfamiliar with the harsh realities that kids half my age already know ironclad. My guide points out the areas where the grass is overgrown and the fruit trees abundant. As we walk, the boy's eyes dart back and forth, scanning the terrain with a practiced air that belies his youth. He gestures to a spot where the earth is disturbed, and I follow his gaze to a crater-like depression in the ground. \"Anti-tank,\" he says matter-of-factly, as if pointing out a particularly interesting rock or a rare species of bird. I feel a shiver run down my spine as I realize the significance of what I'm seeing.\n\nThe boy's nonchalance is a stark contrast to my own wide-eyed wonder. Growing up in a peaceful, suburban neighborhood, I had never seen the remnants of war up close. The only explosions I had witnessed were in movies or video games, and the only mines I had heard of were the ones used in fantasy novels. But here, in the rugged mountains of Chechnya, the reality of conflict is palpable.\n\nAs we continue our walk, the boy points out more signs of the war that has ravaged this region. We pass by abandoned buildings, their walls pockmarked with bullet holes, and streets lined with the rusting hulks of destroyed tanks. The air is thick with the smell of smoke and ash, and I can feel the weight of history bearing down on me.\n\nDespite the devastation, there is a beauty to this place that is hard to ignore. The mountains rise up around us, their peaks shrouded in mist, and the sound of birdsong fills the air. It's a jarring contrast to the destruction that surrounds us, and I find myself wondering how a place so breathtakingly beautiful can be scarred by such violence.\n\nThe boy notices my gaze and follows it to the mountains. \"It's a hard place,\" he says, his voice low and serious. \"But it's home.\" I nod, trying to understand the complexities of this place and its people. I realize that, despite our differences, we share a common humanity. We both have families, friends, and a desire to live in peace.\n\nAs the sun begins to set, casting a golden glow over the landscape, the boy leads me back to the village. We walk in silence, the only sound being the crunch of gravel beneath our feet. I feel a sense of gratitude towards this young stranger, who has shown me the harsh realities of war and the beauty of his homeland.\n\nAs we part ways, I look into his eyes and see a deep sadness. It's a sadness that comes from knowing too much, too young. It's a sadness that I can't fully comprehend, but one that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.\n\nThe experience has left an indelible mark on me. It has made me realize that war is not just something that happens in far-off lands, but a reality that affects real people, with real lives and real stories. It has made me appreciate the peace and security that I take for granted, and has instilled in me a sense of empathy for those who are not so fortunate.\n\nAs I look back on that walk through the Chechen mountains, I am reminded of the power of human connection. Despite our differences, we are all connected by our shared humanity. And it is this connection that gives me hope for a future where children can grow up without the scars of war, and where the beauty of a place like Chechnya can be appreciated without the shadow of conflict.",

        "Text": "I know that I had prepared well for this moment. For two arduous months, I readied my fingers for an exciting concert. No anxiety could undermine my confidence in my preparation, and my piano recital’s success was “in the bag.” I selected three pieces for my repertoire: the ambience of Erik Satie’s Gymnopedie No. 1 as the opener, a somber contemplation of Beethoven’s First Movement of the Moonlight Sonata, and Bach’s light and surreal Prelude in C Major for the conclusion. My shining moment arrived, and I strode purposefully toward the piano. The building in which my performance was held was new, but its dwellers were old. Respect and prestige permeated the atmosphere as I took each stride to my seat. As I settled into the piano bench, I adjusted my posture, took a deep breath, and let my fingers hover above the keys. The anticipation was palpable, and I could feel the weight of expectation from the audience. I glanced up to meet the gaze of my family, friends, and mentors, all of whom had supported me throughout my musical journey. Their encouraging smiles and nods bolstered my confidence, and I began to play.\n\nThe first notes of Satie's Gymnopedie No. 1 flowed effortlessly from my fingers, filling the room with a sense of calm and serenity. The audience was entranced, their eyes fixed on me as I navigated the intricate melodies and harmonies. I felt completely in my element, my fingers moving with a life of their own as I lost myself in the music.\n\nAs I transitioned into Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, the mood shifted, and the room was bathed in a somber, contemplative atmosphere. The music seemed to take on a life of its own, pouring out of me like a emotional release. I felt the weight of Beethoven's genius, the turmoil and passion that he had poured into every note. The audience was transfixed, hanging on every phrase as I explored the depths of this iconic piece.\n\nFinally, I arrived at the Prelude in C Major, Bach's masterpiece of counterpoint and harmony. The music danced and sparkled, a joyful celebration of sound and rhythm. I felt a sense of elation as I played, the notes flying from my fingers like a burst of confetti. The audience was smiling, tapping their feet, and nodding their heads in time with the music.\n\nAs I finished the final chord, the room erupted into applause. I stood up, beaming with pride, and took a triumphant bow. The months of hard work, the countless hours of practice, had all been worth it. I had shared my music with the world, and the world had responded with enthusiasm and appreciation.\n\nAs I walked off the stage, I was met with congratulations and pats on the back from my loved ones. My teacher, who had guided me through the preparation process, was beaming with pride, tears of joy welling up in her eyes. I felt a sense of accomplishment, of validation, that I had never felt before. I knew that this moment would stay with me forever, a reminder of the power of music to bring people together and transcend borders.\n\nIn that instant, I knew that all the hard work, the sacrifices, and the dedication had been worth it. I had found my voice, my passion, and my purpose. I was a musician, and I would continue to share my gift with the world, one performance at a time.",

        "Text": "I have never felt such palpable emotion, such profound grief emanating from a space, as I did while hiking through the forest fire scorch in Philmont, New Mexico. A universe had once existed under the protection of these Ponderosa Pine, now black and crusted, turning brittle in the wind. It was a landscape that didn’t sing its laments, but whispered of its loss through every pile of scalded timber and skinny, wavering shadow cast by the hollow towers of ash. I felt prepared when I made the decision to become a scout. I love nature and camping. I love the Scouts BSA program. I love the people. I was definitely not prepared, however, for the numerous challenges I would face during my years as a scout. I was the first female “boy scout” in my town, which continues to be both my greatest honor and a constant reminder of the isolation and insecurity that comes with being any “first.” I became a symbol, whether for good or bad, and my actions not only spoke of me, but of the future young women in Scouts BSA. I felt like an imposter. I wasn’t a strong-willed leader like those who usually have “first” stitched into their title. I wasn't a trailblazer, paving the way for others with confidence and charisma. I was just a teenager, trying to find my place in a world that seemed to be constantly watching and judging me. Every mistake I made, every struggle I faced, felt like a reflection not just of myself, but of all the girls who would come after me.\n\nAs I hiked through the charred remains of the forest, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between the landscape and my own journey. Just as the fire had ravaged the land, leaving behind a scarred and barren landscape, I felt like I was navigating a terrain of uncertainty and self-doubt. The once-strong trees, now reduced to hollow shells, seemed to echo my own feelings of inadequacy.\n\nBut as I walked further, I began to notice something remarkable. Amidst the devastation, there were signs of life. Tiny shoots of green pushing through the ashes, tender and fragile, yet resilient and determined. It was as if the forest was telling me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for renewal and growth.\n\nI realized that my experience as a scout wasn't so different. Just as the forest was rebuilding itself, I too was rebuilding my sense of self. With every challenge I faced, I was learning to adapt, to persevere, and to find strength in my own vulnerabilities. I was discovering that leadership wasn't about being perfect, but about being brave enough to take the first step, even when the path ahead was uncertain.\n\nAs I looked around at the other scouts, I saw that they too were struggling to find their way. They too were facing their own doubts and fears. And in that moment, I felt a sense of solidarity with them. We were all in this together, stumbling through the wilderness of adolescence, trying to find our footing in a world that often seemed too big and too overwhelming.\n\nThe forest fire had scarred the land, but it had also revealed a deeper truth. That even in the darkest of times, there is always beauty to be found. That even in the most uncertain of journeys, there is always a way forward. And that even in the most daunting of challenges, there is always the possibility for growth, for renewal, and for transformation.\n\nAs I stood there, surrounded by the charred remains of the forest, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that I still had a long way to go, that there would be many more challenges ahead. But I also knew that I was not alone. I was part of a community, a community of scouts, of leaders, and of individuals who were all struggling to find their way.\n\nAnd in that moment, I felt a sense of pride, not just in being a \"first,\" but in being a part of something much bigger than myself. I was proud to be a scout, proud to be a leader, and proud to be a symbol of hope and resilience for the girls who would come after me.",

Mum caught me dancing to some of her old Irish tapes — the Chieftains, Sinead O’Connor. She asked me if I wanted to do it for real. I said sure and went back to dancing. Now a freckled woman digs around in a cardboard box and pulls out a pair of dusty, worn black shoes. “Don’t worry,” she says, “you’ll learn eventually.” The shoes are too big; they sag at the toes. I approach the stage. Twenty-five pairs of eyes fix on me. In a room bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I feel like a clown in an ill-fitting costume. All that matters is the dancing. I’m 9. I sit in the hallway of the Times Square Marriott watching girls in big wigs and sparkly dresses run around, squawking like glamorous, unhinged chickens. In my tartan skirt and simple bun, I feel like an ugly duckling. The bobby pins dutifully securing my bun in place make my scalp ache. My hands slide to my shoes. They’re too tight. Mum put them on her feet to “try and stretch them out a little.” I pass some over-enthusiastic dance moms who put the “mother” in “smother.” I reach the stage. A hundred pairs of eyes fix on me. In a hotel bustling with motion, everything stands still. I take a deep breath, trying to calm the flutter in my chest. The music begins, and I let my feet take over, the rhythm coursing through my veins like a familiar pulse. The judges' faces blur as I lose myself in the steps, the clicks of my shoes echoing through the auditorium. I'm no longer a nervous, awkward child; I'm a dancer, a storyteller, a vessel for the ancient traditions of Ireland.\n\nI'm 12. I stand in the wings, listening to the emcee's booming voice announce the top three dancers in my age group. My heart skips a beat as I hear my name. I walk out onto the stage, my eyes scanning the crowd for Mum's beaming face. She's there, clapping and cheering, a bouquet of flowers in her hand. I take my place beside the other two dancers, and we pose for a photo, our medals glinting in the bright lights.\n\nI'm 15. I'm in the midst of a grueling practice session, my feet screaming in protest as I repeat the same step over and over. My teacher, a stern but kind woman named Mrs. O'Connor, corrects my posture, her hands firm on my shoulders. I'm no longer the carefree child who danced for the joy of it; I'm a serious competitor, driven to perfect my craft.\n\nI'm 18. I stand on the stage of the Grand Ballroom, the World Championships logo emblazoned on the backdrop behind me. The music begins, and I launch into my solo, every step, every movement, every gesture honed to perfection. The crowd fades away, and it's just me, the music, and the dance. I'm no longer just a dancer; I'm a warrior, a champion, a guardian of a centuries-old tradition.\n\nAs I take my final bow, the roar of the crowd washes over me, a tidal wave of applause and cheers. I scan the sea of faces, searching for Mum's proud smile. She's there, tears streaming down her face, her eyes shining with pride. I mouth \"thank you\" to her, knowing that without her, I wouldn't be here, on this stage, in this moment. The music fades away, and I'm left with the knowledge that I've found my true self in the rhythms and steps of Irish dance.",

I quickly wipe away the paint without a thought except for panic. Before I realize what I have done, the black droop becomes an ugly smear of black paint. The peaceful picture of the girl standing in the meadow is nowhere to be seen. Even though I successfully avoid having the spilled paint touch the dress, all I can focus on is the black smudge. The stupid black smudge. As I continue to stare at the enemy in front of me, I hear Bob Ross’s annoyingly cheerful voice in my head: “There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.” At this moment, I completely disagree. There is nothing happy about this, only frustration. Actually, there is one other emotion: excitement. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not excited about making a mistake and definitely not happy about the accident. but as I gaze at the smeared paint, I feel a spark of excitement. It's a feeling I haven't experienced in a long time, a feeling that I've been trying to recapture since I first picked up a paintbrush as a child. It's the thrill of uncertainty, the rush of not knowing what will happen next.\n\nAs I stand there, frozen in frustration and excitement, I'm transported back to my childhood art classes. I remember the feeling of freedom, of not caring about making mistakes, of simply creating for the sake of creating. My art teacher, Mrs. Johnson, would always tell us that art is a process, not a product. She'd encourage us to experiment, to try new things, and to not be afraid of making mistakes.\n\nBut as I grew older, that carefree attitude towards art began to fade. I started to worry about what others would think of my work, about whether it was good enough, about whether I was good enough. I began to strive for perfection, to try to control every brushstroke, every color choice. And in doing so, I lost that sense of excitement, that sense of freedom.\n\nAs I look at the smeared paint, I realize that I've been given a second chance. I can choose to see this mistake as a happy accident, as an opportunity to create something new and unexpected. I can choose to let go of my need for control and perfection, and simply see where the paint takes me.\n\nWith a newfound sense of excitement, I dip my brush into the paint and begin to work. I add strokes of color, of texture, of movement. I let the paint guide me, rather than trying to guide it. And as I work, I feel that spark of excitement grow into a flame.\n\nThe black smudge is no longer an enemy, but a friend, a catalyst for something new and beautiful. I'm no longer frustrated, but exhilarated. I'm creating again, not just painting.\n\nAs I step back from the canvas, I see a new picture emerging. It's not the peaceful meadow I had originally envisioned, but something more vibrant, more alive. The black smudge has become a dynamic element, a symbol of the beauty of imperfection.\n\nI smile to myself, feeling a sense of gratitude towards that annoyingly cheerful voice in my head. Bob Ross was right, after all. There are no mistakes, only happy accidents. And I'm grateful for this one, for the reminder that art is a journey, not a destination, and that sometimes, it's the mistakes that lead to the most beautiful creations.",

I try to ignore the buzz, interspersed with, “Oh my God!” and the occasional, “Damn!” Then, a complete stranger asks for a picture, so I stand with people foreign to me and politely smile and laugh. After the click of the camera, they go on their way. Sometimes I wish I weren’t so tall. Maybe then I could take a friend to a movie and just blend into the crowd. Attention from strangers is nothing new to me. Questions about my height dominate almost every public interaction. As I navigate through the crowded streets, I've grown accustomed to the constant stares and whispers. It's as if my height has become a spectacle, a source of entertainment for others. I've learned to tune it out, to focus on my own thoughts and ignore the commotion around me. But it's not always easy.\n\nSometimes, I feel like a zoo animal, gawked at and prodded by curious onlookers. They ask invasive questions, like \"How tall are you?\" or \"Do you play basketball?\" as if my height is the only defining characteristic of my being. I've even had people ask to touch my hair or measure themselves against me, as if I'm some sort of human ruler.\n\nIt's exhausting, constantly being the center of attention. I long for the anonymity of being average, of being able to walk down the street without drawing a crowd. I dream of being able to go to the grocery store without being stopped for selfies or autographs. I just want to be able to live my life without being defined by my height.\n\nBut it's not just the strangers that make me feel like a spectacle. Even those close to me can't help but stare. Family gatherings become a parade of \"Oh, look at how tall you are!\" and \"You're so lucky to be so tall!\" as if being tall is the only thing that matters. Friends will often make jokes about my height, teasing me about being able to reach high shelves or see over crowds. It's all in good fun, but it wears on me.\n\nI've tried to explain to them how it feels, to be constantly on display. But they just laugh and tell me I'm being too sensitive. They don't understand that being tall isn't just about physical stature; it's about being a constant spectacle, a sideshow attraction.\n\nI've learned to adapt, to develop a thick skin and ignore the stares. But sometimes, in quiet moments, I wonder what it would be like to be like everyone else. To be able to blend into the crowd, to be anonymous. To be more than just my height.",

        "Text": "“You should scrub off the top layer of your skin whenever you lose a round,” my debate teammate once advised me. “That’s not practical,” I replied. “Neither is your refusal to wear clothes you’ve lost important debate rounds in. Your wardrobe has very little to do with your success.” Half of me disagrees with him. I still bring three BIC Round Stic pencils with 0.7 lead to every test because my gut tells me this fastidious procedure raises my scores. This peculiar habit of mine is not an isolated incident. I have a plethora of superstitions that I've accumulated over the years, each one rooted in a deep-seated fear of failure. From always sitting in the same seat during exams to avoiding certain foods on test days, my rituals have become an integral part of my academic routine. While they may seem irrational to others, they provide me with a sense of comfort and control in high-pressure situations.\n\nMy debate teammate's comment, however, made me realize that these superstitions can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, they give me an added layer of confidence and focus, allowing me to perform at my best. On the other hand, they can be crippling if I'm unable to adhere to them. I recall a particular instance where I forgot to bring my lucky pen to a critical exam, and the ensuing anxiety affected my performance.\n\nAs I reflect on my teammate's words, I've come to understand that our superstitions often stem from a deeper fear of uncertainty. We crave control over the uncontrollable, and these rituals provide a sense of agency in situations where we feel powerless. But what happens when our superstitions start to dictate our actions, rather than the other way around? Do we become slaves to our own fears, or can we learn to harness them in a way that empowers us?\n\nFor me, the answer lies in striking a balance between embracing my superstitions and recognizing their limitations. While I'll likely continue to bring my trusty BIC pencils to every test, I'm working to develop a growth mindset that acknowledges the impermanence of these rituals. By doing so, I hope to cultivate a sense of resilience that extends beyond the confines of my superstitions.\n\nUltimately, my teammate's comment served as a poignant reminder that success is not solely dependent on our rituals or wardrobe choices. It's about developing a sense of self-awareness, acknowledging our fears, and learning to navigate the complexities of our own minds. As I move forward, I'm committed to embracing my superstitions, but also to recognizing their place in the grand scheme of things. By doing so, I hope to unlock a deeper level of confidence and self-trust, one that's not beholden to the whims of my gut or the contents of my pencil case.",

        "Text": "Several years ago, my mother told me I listen to “white people music.” And I suppose that’s true—rock 'n' roll tends to spring from the middle-class basements of young, white men. Though I did point out that its origins trace back to jazz musicians of the Harlem Renaissance. Also that one of the greatest guitarists of all time—dear Mr.Hendrix; may he rest in peace—was black. My devotion to punk rock began in seventh grade, when Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” came up on my iTunes shuffle. I started to look into their other releases, eventually immersing myself into the complete punk discography. My mother, having grown up in a racially segregated New York, was more likely to listen to Stevie Wonder than Stevie Nicks. But, she must have figured, to each her own. So while my compatriots indulged in the music of Taylor Swift, One Direction, and Lady Gaga, my tacky Hot Topic headphones blasted Green Day, Ramones, and The Clash. My young adolescent ears drank in the raw, chaotic beauty, an echo of the pain of the past. The thrashing, pulsating vitality of the instruments painted a picture, connecting me to the disillusioned kids who launched an epic movement of liberation some 40 years ago. Punkers question authority. Aggressively contrarian, they advocate for the other side—the side that seemed smothered silent during the post-Vietnam era. They rejected the established norms. As I delved deeper into the punk rock scene, I began to realize that this genre was not just about loud guitars and rebellious lyrics, but about a sense of community and belonging. It was about finding solace in the outcasts and misfits, who refused to conform to the mainstream. I felt a kinship with these punk rock pioneers, who dared to challenge the status quo and speak truth to power.\n\nMy mother, though puzzled by my musical choices, couldn't deny the passion and energy that punk rock ignited within me. She saw how it transformed me from a shy, introverted kid into a confident, outspoken individual. Punk rock gave me a voice, a platform to express my frustrations and disillusionments with the world around me.\n\nAs I explored the punk rock movement further, I discovered that it was not just a musical genre, but a cultural phenomenon that transcended race, class, and gender. It was a movement that celebrated individuality, creativity, and nonconformity. Punk rockers came from all walks of life, united by their desire to challenge the norms and push boundaries.\n\nI remember attending my first punk rock concert, surrounded by kids with spiky hair, ripped jeans, and DIY tattoos. It was a sea of diversity, where everyone was equal, and everyone was welcome. For the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged to something bigger than myself.\n\nMy mother, though still puzzled by my musical tastes, began to understand the impact that punk rock had on my life. She saw how it helped me develop a sense of purpose and identity, and how it connected me to a community of like-minded individuals.\n\nIn the end, my love for punk rock taught me a valuable lesson: that music is not just about sound, but about the values and ideals that it represents. It's about the power to challenge, to question, and to inspire. And it's about the community that forms around it, a community that celebrates individuality, creativity, and nonconformity.\n\nAs I look back on those formative years, I realize that my mother was right – I did listen to \"white people music.\" But I also listened to the music of the marginalized, the oppressed, and the disillusioned. I listened to the music of the punk rock movement, which continues to inspire and empower generations of young people around the world.",

I packed the ebony powder into my waterline with a shaky hand, wincing at the fine specks making their way into my eyes. The palette's colors bore in, the breadth of my imagination interwoven into now-brittle brushes. The girl in the mirror seemed sharper, older, somehow. At only 12, I was relatively new to the powders and blushes that lined my birthday makeup kit, but I was determined to decipher the deep splashes of color that had for so long been an enigma to me. After school involved self-inflicted solitary confinement, as I shut myself in my bedroom to hone my skills. The palette’s colors bore in, the breadth of my imagination interwoven into now-brittle brushes. As I practiced, the strokes of my brush grew bolder, more confident. I experimented with different techniques, watching YouTube tutorials and reading makeup blogs to learn new skills. My bedroom floor became a canvas of discarded makeup wipes, crumpled up pieces of paper, and empty compacts. My parents, though initially skeptical of my newfound obsession, began to notice the transformation in me. They saw how makeup gave me a sense of control, of empowerment, and they encouraged me to pursue it.\n\nBut it wasn't just about the physical act of applying makeup. As I delved deeper into the world of beauty, I discovered a community of like-minded individuals who shared my passion. I spent hours scrolling through social media, marveling at the intricate designs and bold looks created by makeup artists from all over the world. I began to connect with them, sharing my own work and receiving feedback and support in return.\n\nMakeup became an outlet for me, a way to express myself and tap into my creativity. I no longer felt like just a shy, awkward 12-year-old; I was an artist, a creator. As I looked in the mirror, I saw not just a reflection of myself, but a canvas waiting to be transformed. I experimented with different looks, pushing the boundaries of what I thought was possible. I created characters, personas, and stories, all through the power of makeup.\n\nBut as I delved deeper into the world of beauty, I also began to realize the darker side of the industry. I saw how unrealistic beauty standards were perpetuated, how women were objectified and judged based on their physical appearance. I saw how the industry capitalized on people's insecurities, selling them products and promises of perfection. I began to question the true cost of beauty, and whether it was worth the price.\n\nDespite these reservations, I couldn't help but be drawn to the world of makeup. It was a double-edged sword, capable of both empowering and oppressing. But for me, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. Makeup had given me a voice, a sense of confidence and self-worth that I never thought possible. It had allowed me to tap into my creativity, to express myself in ways I never thought I could.\n\nAs I looked in the mirror, I saw a young woman emerging, one who was still learning, still growing, but unapologetically herself. The girl who had once been intimidated by the powders and blushes was now a master of her craft, a creator of beauty and magic. The palette's colors still bore in, but now they were a reminder of the power and creativity that lay within me, waiting to be unleashed.",

I envisioned swimming with dolphins, or perhaps studying behavioral patterns of decorator crabs. But when I discovered the nature of my work on the first day of volunteering, my excitement turned to disappointment: I’d be picking through albatross boluses, the indigestible materials they cough up before going to sea. Sure enough, after three hours of separating fishing line from brown muck, I began to dread what I was in for. As the days went by, my initial enthusiasm began to wane. The task was not only tedious but also gruesome. The smell of rotting fish and the texture of the boluses made my stomach churn. I couldn't help but wonder why I had signed up for this. Was it really worth it? The questions swirled in my mind as I mechanically sorted through the debris, trying to focus on the bigger picture.\n\nBut then, something changed. As I delved deeper into the boluses, I started to notice patterns. I saw the same types of plastic debris recurring, from six-pack rings to microbeads. It was as if I was holding a tiny mirror to the ocean's problems, and it was a reflection I couldn't ignore. The albatrosses, these majestic creatures, were ingesting our trash, and it was killing them.\n\nMy disappointment turned to outrage, and then to determination. I realized that my role, although small, was crucial in understanding the impact of human actions on marine life. The data I was collecting would contribute to a larger study, one that could inform policy changes and inspire individuals to make a difference.\n\nAs I continued to work, I began to appreciate the intricacies of the research facility. I met passionate scientists, dedicated to their craft, who were working tirelessly to protect the ocean and its inhabitants. I saw the cutting-edge technology, the state-of-the-art labs, and the collaborative spirit that permeated the entire facility.\n\nMy experience at the Long Marine Lab taught me a valuable lesson. Sometimes, the most impactful work is not glamorous or exciting, but it is necessary. It is the behind-the-scenes effort, the tedious data collection, and the meticulous analysis that ultimately lead to change. As I left the lab on my final day, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had contributed to something bigger than myself, and I knew that my experience would stay with me for a lifetime.\n\nIn the end, I didn't swim with dolphins or study decorator crabs, but I did something more meaningful. I played a small part in the fight against marine pollution, and I gained a newfound appreciation for the unsung heroes of science. As I walked away from the lab, I knew that I would carry the lessons of the albatross boluses with me, and that they would inspire me to make a difference in the world.",

Isn’t it odd how stars are flaming spheres and electrical impulses make beings sentient? The very existence of our world is a wonder; what are the odds that this particular planet developed all the necessary components, parts that all work in unison, to support life? How do they interact? How did they come to be? I thought back to how my previously simplistic mind-set evolved this past year. The very existence of our world is a wonder; what are the odds that this particular planet developed all the necessary components, parts that all work in unison, to support life? As I pondered the intricacies of our universe, I couldn't help but think about the profound shift in my perspective over the past year. It was as if I had been living in a world of black and white, only to have the vibrant colors of complexity and wonder suddenly revealed to me.\n\nI recalled the countless hours I spent poring over books on astrophysics, biology, and philosophy, each new discovery and concept blowing my mind like a supernova. The more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew, and yet, this realization only fueled my curiosity. I began to see the world as an intricate tapestry, woven from threads of chance and necessity, where every strand was interconnected and interdependent.\n\nThe stars above, once mere twinkling lights, became gateways to understanding the universe's origins and evolution. I marveled at the sheer scale of it all – the billions of galaxies, each containing billions of stars, all hurtling through space and time. And yet, amidst this vastness, our planet, a tiny blue dot, had somehow managed to create an environment conducive to life.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the mysteries of existence, I began to appreciate the beauty of uncertainty. The more I learned, the more I realized that the unknown was not something to be feared, but rather, it was an invitation to explore, to question, and to seek answers. The search for knowledge became an end in itself, a journey that transformed me from the inside out.\n\nThis newfound appreciation for the complexity of existence also led me to reevaluate my place within it. I began to see myself not as a separate entity, but as an integral part of the grand tapestry, connected to every other being, every molecule, and every star. This realization brought with it a sense of responsibility, a sense of stewardship towards the planet and its inhabitants.\n\nAs I stood there, gazing up at the starry sky, I felt a deep sense of awe and gratitude. The universe, in all its complexity and wonder, had awakened something within me. I had evolved from a simplistic mind-set to one that was open, curious, and reverent. And in this evolution, I had discovered a new sense of purpose – to explore, to learn, and to appreciate the beauty and mystery of existence.",

        "Text": "James was not fitting in with everyone else. During lunch, he sat alone, playing with his own toys. During group activities, the other campers always complained when paired with him. What was wrong? As camp counselor, I quietly observed his behavior—nothing out of the ordinary. I just couldn’t fathom why the other campers treated him like a pariah. After three days of ostracism, James broke down during a game of soccer. As he sat on the sidelines, tears streaming down his face, I knew I had to intervene. I called the group over and asked them to explain why they were treating James this way. At first, no one spoke up, but eventually, one of the campers muttered something about James being \"weird.\" I pressed them for more information, but they just shrugged and said they didn't know why, he just was.\n\nI realized that James was being bullied, not because of anything he had done, but because of who he was. He was different, and that difference was enough to make the other campers uncomfortable. I decided to take a different approach, one that would help the campers understand and appreciate James' unique qualities.\n\nThe next day, I introduced a new activity, one that would require teamwork and creativity. I divided the campers into small groups, making sure James was included in one of them. At first, the other campers were hesitant, but as they started working together, something remarkable happened. James' quiet nature and attention to detail proved to be a huge asset, and his group began to excel.\n\nAs the day went on, I noticed the other campers starting to look at James in a new light. They were laughing and joking with him, and he was smiling, really smiling, for the first time all week. By the end of the activity, James' group had created an incredible project, one that showcased his talents and creativity.\n\nThe rest of the week was a turning point for James. The other campers began to see him as an equal, someone who brought value to their group. They started to include him in their games and activities, and he was no longer eating lunch alone. As a counselor, it was heartwarming to see James finally feeling like he belonged.\n\nBut the experience also taught me a valuable lesson. As adults, we often talk about the importance of diversity and inclusion, but we don't always practice what we preach. We need to create environments where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their differences. James' story is a reminder that being different is not something to be ashamed of, but something to be celebrated.\n\nAs the summer came to a close, James left camp with a newfound confidence, and I left with a renewed sense of purpose. I realized that as a counselor, I had the power to create a positive impact on the lives of my campers. I vowed to continue promoting inclusivity and acceptance, and to always be an ally to those who are marginalized or excluded.\n\nJames' story may have started with ostracism, but it ended with acceptance and belonging. It's a reminder that we all have the power to create positive change, one small act of kindness at a time.",

When Ye-Ye came from China to visit us seven years ago, he brought his red cap with him and every night for six months, it sat on the stairway railing post of my house, waiting to be loyally placed back on Ye-Ye’s head the next morning. He wore the cap everywhere: around the house, where he performed magic tricks with it to make my little brother laugh; to the corner store, where he bought me popsicles before using his hat to wipe the beads of summer sweat off my neck. Today whenever I see a red hat, I think of my Ye-Ye and his baseball cap, and I smile. Ye-Ye is the Mandarin word for “grandfather.” My Ye-Ye is a simple, ordinary person—not rich, not “successful”—but he is my greatest source of inspiration and I idolize him. Of all the people I know, Ye-Ye has encountered the most hardship and of all the people I know, Ye-Ye is the most joyful. Ye-Ye's life has not been easy. Born in a small village in southern China, he grew up during a time of great turmoil and poverty. His childhood was marked by hunger and scarcity, and he often had to go to school with an empty stomach. Despite the difficulties, Ye-Ye's parents instilled in him a strong sense of determination and resilience. They encouraged him to pursue his education, and he eventually became one of the few students in his village to attend college.\n\nHowever, Ye-Ye's academic pursuits were cut short when the Cultural Revolution swept through China. He was forced to abandon his studies and work in the countryside, where he labored for long hours in the fields, often under the scorching sun. It was a difficult and demoralizing time, but Ye-Ye never lost hope. He continued to educate himself, reading books and learning new skills in his spare time.\n\nYears later, when the economic reforms took hold in China, Ye-Ye saw an opportunity to improve his life. He moved to the city, where he worked tirelessly to build a better future for himself and his family. He took on multiple jobs, often working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. He saved every penny, investing in his children's education and eventually building a small business of his own.\n\nThrough it all, Ye-Ye remained steadfast, never complaining or showing bitterness. Instead, he radiated a sense of joy and contentment, even in the face of adversity. He would often tell me stories about his childhood, laughing and joking about the hardships he had faced. His positivity was infectious, and it inspired me to approach life with a similar attitude.\n\nWhen Ye-Ye came to visit us, I was struck by his simplicity and humility. He didn't bring any fancy gifts or boast about his accomplishments. Instead, he brought his red baseball cap and a heart full of love. He spent his days playing with my brother and me, teaching us Chinese phrases and cooking us traditional meals. He was always willing to lend a helping hand, whether it was fixing a broken toy or helping with household chores.\n\nYe-Ye's visit was a transformative experience for me. It made me realize that true happiness and fulfillment come not from material possessions or external validation, but from a sense of purpose and contentment. Ye-Ye's joy was not dependent on his circumstances; it was a fundamental part of who he was. He had faced incredible hardships, yet he remained one of the most optimistic and joyful people I had ever met.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to appreciate Ye-Ye's wisdom and life experience even more. I would often seek his counsel on matters big and small, and he would offer words of wisdom and guidance. He taught me the importance of hard work, perseverance, and gratitude. He showed me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope and always something to be thankful for.\n\nToday, whenever I face challenges or feel overwhelmed, I think of Ye-Ye and his red baseball cap. I remember his stories, his laughter, and his unwavering optimism. I am reminded that true strength and resilience come not from external circumstances, but from within. Ye-Ye's life is a testament to the power of the human spirit, and I am grateful to have him as my role model and inspiration.\n\nAs I look to the future, I know that I will carry Ye-Ye's lessons with me. I will strive to emulate his joy, his humility, and his sense of purpose. I will remember that true happiness comes from within, and that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope and always something to be thankful for. And whenever I see a red hat, I will smile, knowing that Ye-Ye's spirit is with me, guiding me and inspiring me to be my best self.",

My skin absorbs heat from stage lights above—if only that heat would seep into my brain, denature some proteins, and deactivate the neurons stressing me out. A warm hand, accompanied by an even warmer smile, interrupts my frenzied solitude. I glance up. My lovely teacher nods, coaxing my frozen lips into a thawed smile. As I return the smile, a sense of calm washes over me, temporarily dispelling the pre-performance jitters that had taken up residence in my stomach. My teacher's reassuring presence is a balm to my frazzled nerves, reminding me of the countless hours we've spent rehearsing, perfecting every step, every gesture. The whispered \"Merde!\" – a traditional dancer's good luck charm – still lingers in the air, and I feel a surge of determination course through my veins.\n\nThe orchestra begins to tune their instruments, the discordant notes a stark contrast to the harmony I strive to achieve on stage. My gaze drifts to the wings, where my fellow dancers are gathered, their faces set with focus, their bodies coiled springs ready to unleash their energy. We exchange brief, encouraging glances, a silent understanding that we're all in this together.\n\nThe music starts, and I take a deep breath, letting the melody guide me onto the stage. The lights blind me for an instant, but as I begin to move, my senses come alive. The rustle of my skirt, the creak of my shoes, the thrum of the music – all blend together in a symphony of motion. My teacher's words of wisdom echo in my mind: \"Trust your training, trust yourself.\"\n\nThe dance becomes a meditation, my body responding to the rhythm without conscious thought. I lose myself in the movement, the music, the moment. Time dissolves, and all that exists is the stage, my fellow dancers, and the audience, a sea of expectant faces.\n\nAs the final notes fade away, I feel a sense of exhilaration, of pride, of accomplishment. The applause erupts, a tidal wave of sound that washes over me, carrying with it the validation of all my hard work. I take my bow, my heart full, my spirit soaring.\n\nIn the wings, my teacher awaits, beaming with pride. We share a warm embrace, the warmth of her hand still lingering on my skin. \"You did it,\" she whispers, her voice full of emotion. I nod, still basking in the glow of the performance. For a fleeting instant, all my doubts, all my fears, are forgotten. I am a dancer, and this is my stage.",

I pranced up and down the hill, my palms extended to the moving collage of butterflies that surrounded me. “Would you like to learn how to catch one?” Grandfather asked, holding out a glass jar. “Yes!” I cheered, his huge calloused fingers closing my chubby five-year-old hands around it carefully. Grandfather put his finger to his lips, and I obliged as I watched him deftly maneuver his net. He caught one marvelous butterfly perched on a flower, and I clutched the open jar in anticipation as he slid the butterfly inside. It quivered and fell to the bottom of the jar, and I gasped. It struggled until its wings, ablaze in a glory of orange and red, quivered to a stop. I watched, wide-eyed, as it stopped moving. “Grandpa! What’s happening?” My grandfather had always had a collection of butterflies, but that was the first time I saw him catch one. He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and said, \"It's okay, little one. The butterfly is just resting. It will come back to life when we release it.\" I looked up at him uncertainly, but he reassured me with a gentle pat on the head. \"Watch closely,\" he said, and I did, mesmerized, as he carefully opened the jar and coaxed the butterfly out onto his finger. To my amazement, it began to flutter its wings, slowly at first, and then more rapidly, until it took to the air, joining its companions in their dance around us.\n\nFrom that day on, I was hooked. I spent every spare moment with Grandfather, learning about the different species of butterflies, how to identify them, and, of course, how to catch them. He taught me about the life cycle of butterflies, from egg to larva to pupa to adult, and I was fascinated by the intricate process. I helped him tend to his collection, carefully pinning the specimens to the board, and labeling them with their scientific names.\n\nAs I grew older, my fascination with butterflies only deepened. I began to accompany Grandfather on his expeditions to remote areas, where we would spend hours trekking through dense forests, searching for rare species. He taught me how to navigate using the position of the sun, how to identify different types of plants, and how to track the movements of the butterflies. Those were some of the happiest days of my childhood, spent in the company of the man I loved and respected most in the world.\n\nBut it wasn't just about the butterflies. Grandfather was a wise and kind man, with a deep understanding of the natural world and our place in it. He taught me about the interconnectedness of all living things, and the importance of respecting and preserving the environment. He showed me how to appreciate the beauty in the smallest details, and how to find wonder in the everyday.\n\nAs I entered my teenage years, I began to take my passion for butterflies more seriously. I started reading books on entomology, and even began to conduct my own experiments, breeding butterflies in a small enclosure in our backyard. Grandfather was proud of me, and encouraged me to pursue my dreams, even when others doubted me. \"You have a gift, kiddo,\" he would say. \"Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\"\n\nWhen I was accepted into a prestigious university to study entomology, Grandfather was over the moon. He beamed with pride as he handed me a small, exquisite butterfly-shaped pendant, which I still wear to this day. \"This was your grandmother's,\" he said, his voice choked with emotion. \"She would have been so proud of you.\"\n\nI remember the day I graduated, Grandfather was in the front row, his eyes shining with tears as I walked across the stage. I knew that he was thinking of all the times we had spent together, chasing butterflies and exploring the natural world. I knew that he was proud of the person I had become, and that he knew I would make a difference in the world.\n\nYears have passed since then, and I have gone on to become a renowned entomologist, making groundbreaking discoveries and contributing to the conservation of butterfly populations around the world. But no matter how far I go, I will always remember those magical days spent with Grandfather, chasing butterflies and learning about the beauty and wonder of the natural world.",

        "Text": "I sat on my parents’ bed weeping with my head resting on my knees. “Why did you have to do that to me? Why did you have to show me the house and then take it away from me?” Hopelessly, I found myself praying to God realizing it was my last resort. For years, my family and I found ourselves moving from country to country in hopes of a better future. Factors, such as war and lack of academic opportunities, led my parents to pack their bags and embark on a new journey for our family around the world. Our arduous journey first began in Kuçovë, Albania, then Athens, Greece, and then eventually, Boston, Massachusetts. Throughout those years, although my family always had a roof over our heads, I never had a place I could call “home.” That night that I prayed to God, my mind raced back to the night I was clicking the delete button on my e-mails, but suddenly stopped when I came upon a listing of the house. It was September 22, 2007 —eight years exactly to the day that my family and I had moved to the United States. Instantly, I knew that it was fate that was bringing this house to me. As I gazed at the listing, a sense of nostalgia washed over me. The house was a cozy, two-story colonial with a white picket fence and a big backyard. It was the epitome of the American dream, a far cry from the cramped apartments we had been living in. I couldn't believe that after all these years, I had finally found a place that felt like home.\n\nI showed the listing to my parents, and their faces lit up with excitement. We scheduled a viewing, and as we walked through the doors, I knew that this was it. The house was perfect. The natural light pouring in through the windows, the creaky wooden floors, and the smell of fresh paint all combined to create a sense of warmth and comfort.\n\nBut as we were about to make an offer, my heart sank. The sellers had received a higher bid, and our dream was slipping away from us. I felt like I was reliving the same disappointment and heartache that I had experienced countless times before. Why did it have to be so hard for us to find a place to call our own?\n\nAs I sat on my parents' bed, weeping and praying to God, I realized that I wasn't just praying for a house. I was praying for a sense of belonging, for a place where I could put down roots and feel like I was a part of something bigger than myself.\n\nGrowing up, I had always felt like an outsider. I was the kid who didn't speak the language, who wore clothes from a different country, and who had a funny accent. But as I looked at the listing of that house, I saw a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this was where I was meant to be.\n\nThe next morning, my parents and I decided to take a chance and make a higher offer on the house. It was a risk, but it was one we were willing to take. As we waited for the sellers' response, I felt a sense of anxiety wash over me. But I also felt a sense of determination. I was determined to make this house my home, no matter what it took.\n\nIn the end, our offer was accepted, and we were overjoyed. As we stood in the backyard, holding hands and looking up at our new home, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I finally had a place to call my own, a place where I could be myself without fear of judgment or rejection.\n\nLooking back, I realize that my journey was not just about finding a house. It was about finding a sense of identity, a sense of belonging, and a sense of purpose. And as I sit in my cozy living room, surrounded by the people and things I love, I know that I have finally found my true home.",

        "Text": "The white yarn slipped off my aluminium crochet hook, adding a single crochet to rows and rows of existing stitches, that looked to be in the form of a blob. Staring at the image of the little unicorn amigurumi lit up on the screen of my laptop, and looking back at the UMO (unidentified messy object) number five, I was extremely perplexed. This had seemed so easy. I had watched countless YouTube tutorials, read through detailed instructions, and even joined online crochet communities to ensure that I was doing everything right. Yet, somehow, my creation looked more like a failed science experiment than a cute, cuddly unicorn. I couldn't help but wonder what I was doing wrong.\n\nAs I sat there, staring at my UMO, I couldn't help but think about how I had always been fascinated by the world of amigurumi. Those adorable, intricately designed creatures that seemed to come to life in the hands of skilled crocheters. I had always been in awe of their ability to create something so beautiful and detailed with just a hook and some yarn.\n\nDetermined to master the craft, I had invested in the best yarn, the perfect hook, and even a fancy stitch marker. I had spent hours poring over patterns, watching tutorials, and practicing my stitches. But somehow, it seemed like the more I practiced, the worse my creations turned out.\n\nI looked back at the laptop screen, comparing my UMO to the perfect, fluffy unicorn staring back at me. The difference was laughable. Where the tutorial's unicorn had delicate, defined features, mine looked like a blob with a few random stitches stuck on. I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration and disappointment.\n\nAs I sat there, feeling like a complete failure, I began to think about all the times I had seen others struggle with a new skill. My friend, who had always been terrible at cooking, had finally mastered the perfect soufflé after months of practice. My sister, who had always been clumsy with her hands, had learned to play the guitar with ease. Why was it that I, who had always been so meticulous and detail-oriented, couldn't seem to get the hang of this?\n\nI took a deep breath, put down my hook, and stepped away from my UMO. Maybe, I thought, the problem wasn't my skills or my materials. Maybe the problem was my approach. I had been so focused on following the pattern, on doing everything \"right,\" that I had forgotten the most important thing: to have fun.\n\nI picked up my hook again, but this time, instead of following the pattern, I let my fingers guide me. I started to experiment, to try new stitches, to see what happened when I added a little more yarn or changed the tension of my hook. And as I crocheted, I felt a sense of freedom, of creativity, that I had been missing.\n\nMy UMO began to take shape, slowly but surely. It wasn't perfect, but it was mine, and it was unique. I added a few more stitches, a little more yarn, and before I knew it, I was staring at a creation that, while not perfect, was at least recognizable as a unicorn.\n\nI smiled, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. Maybe, I thought, the key to mastering amigurumi wasn't about following the pattern, but about embracing the imperfections, about letting go of the need for perfection and allowing myself to create. As I packed up my yarn and hook, I couldn't help but feel excited for my next project, for the opportunity to create something new, something imperfect, and something truly mine.",

I felt like a little fish in a big pond. Everything was overwhelming, from the crowded hallways to the complex class schedules. I struggled to make friends, and my grades began to slip. It was as if I was drowning in a sea of unfamiliarity. That was when I stumbled upon the squash team during a school assembly. The coach, a tall, lanky man with a kind smile, was enthusiastically promoting the sport. I had never heard of squash before, but something about his energy was infectious. I decided to give it a shot, mostly because it sounded like a fun way to get some exercise and meet new people.\n\nAt first, I was terrible. I had never held a racquet before, and my hand-eye coordination was nonexistent. The coach patiently taught me the basics, and I slowly began to improve. But it wasn't just about the game – it was about the sense of belonging I felt with my teammates. We were all misfits, trying to find our place in this massive school. Squash became our common ground, our sanctuary.\n\nAs I continued to play, I noticed changes in myself beyond the court. I became more confident, more outgoing. I started to participate in class, and my grades began to rise. I even made friends outside of the squash team, bonding with classmates over our shared struggles and triumphs. Squash had given me a sense of purpose, a reason to show up to school every day with enthusiasm.\n\nLooking back, I realize that squash was more than just a sport – it was a lifeline. It helped me navigate the treacherous waters of adolescence, and it taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, teamwork, and self-improvement. If I had to do it all over again, I would still choose to play squash, even if it meant being a little fish in a big pond. Because in the end, it was that very experience that helped me grow into the person I am today.",

        "Text": "“Bring the ace of spades up,” my Grandmother said as we started our first game of solitaire after I got home from school. “Now, put the black eight onto the red nine.” We played solitaire often, working together to reorganize the cards most efficiently. While it was meant to be a single-player game, solitaire was the one thing we did together, moving and dealing the cards in a symphony of order: red to black, red to black. Pulling the pattern out of the random array of cards. For hours, we sat at our glossy kitchen table, playing game after game. If there were no more moves to make, I would always sneak a card from below a column without my grandma seeing. She would scold me playfully, \"You're cheating, kiddo!\" and I would giggle, feeling like I got away with something. But in reality, I was just trying to prolong our time together. Those hours spent playing solitaire with my grandmother were some of the most precious moments of my childhood. It was our special bonding time, a ritual that brought us closer together.\n\nAs I grew older, our solitaire sessions became less frequent. Schoolwork and extracurricular activities took up more of my time, and my grandmother's health began to decline. But whenever I had a spare moment, I would rush to the kitchen table, eager to resume our game. The cards would rustle as we shuffled through them, the sound transporting me back to a simpler time.\n\nMy grandmother's eyes would light up as we played, her face a picture of concentration. She would offer words of encouragement, \"You're doing great, kiddo!\" or \"Almost there!\" as we worked together to clear the tableau. In those moments, it was just the two of us against the cards, our collaboration a testament to the power of teamwork and love.\n\nAs the years went by, our games became more bittersweet. My grandmother's hands would tremble as she dealt the cards, her eyesight failing her. I would try to compensate, taking on more of the workload, but it was hard to accept that our time together was limited. The solitaire games became a poignant reminder of the impermanence of life.\n\nOne day, as we sat at the kitchen table, my grandmother's hands struggled to hold the cards. I took them from her, gently, and began to deal them out myself. She looked up at me, her eyes clouding over with tears. \"I'm sorry, kiddo,\" she whispered. \"I don't think I can play anymore.\" I nodded, trying to hold back my own tears, and we sat there in silence, the cards scattered before us like a broken puzzle.\n\nAfter she passed away, I found myself returning to the kitchen table, the solitaire cards still neatly stacked in their box. I would take them out, shuffling through them mechanically, trying to recapture the feeling of our games together. But it was never the same. The cards seemed dull, lifeless, without my grandmother's presence.\n\nYet, even now, as an adult, I find myself drawn to solitaire. I'll play a game or two when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed, the familiar rhythm of the cards a comforting reminder of those hours spent with my grandmother. It's a bittersweet nostalgia, a longing for a time that can never be recaptured. But in the quiet moments, as I move the cards around the table, I can almost hear my grandmother's voice, whispering words of encouragement, reminding me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope, always a way to reorganize the chaos and find order in the world.",

        "Text": "No, Dante. Stop, think, and look at the entire board. I was thoroughly confused. I thought I had procured the complete solution to this elaborate chess puzzle. What am I missing? A knight fork, a bishop move? Am I in check? After a quick glance at the left side of the board, I slapped my hand on my head as I suddenly realized what my chess coach was telling me. My queen was sitting unused, positioned all the way on the other side of the board, and I had no idea. How could I have overlooked such a crucial piece? I felt a wave of embarrassment wash over me as I gazed at the board, my eyes scanning every square, every piece, trying to comprehend how I had neglected the most powerful piece on the board. My coach's words echoed in my mind, \"Stop, think, and look at the entire board.\" It was a simple yet profound advice, one that I had neglected in the heat of the moment.\n\nAs I re-examined the board, I began to see the game in a new light. The queen, once idle and forgotten, now became the key to unlocking the puzzle. I started to envision the possibilities, the potential moves, the attacks and defenses that could be orchestrated with her involvement. The more I thought about it, the more excited I became. This was it, the turning point in the game.\n\nWith renewed confidence, I started to make my moves, carefully considering each step, each attack, each defense. The queen, once a bystander, now became the star of the show, dominating the board with her presence. My opponent, caught off guard by my sudden resurgence, struggled to keep up with the pace of the game.\n\nAs the game progressed, I could feel the tension building, the excitement growing. This was what chess was all about – the thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline, the satisfaction of outmaneuvering your opponent. My coach's words continued to echo in my mind, a reminder to stay focused, to think critically, and to never underestimate the power of any piece on the board.\n\nThe final move was a beauty, a checkmate that left my opponent stunned and impressed. As I shook hands with him, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had learned a valuable lesson, one that would stay with me for the rest of my chess career – never overlook any piece, no matter how insignificant it may seem.\n\nAs I walked out of the tournament hall, my coach approached me with a smile. \"Well done, Dante,\" he said, patting me on the back. \"You learned a valuable lesson today. Remember, chess is not just about making moves, it's about thinking critically, staying focused, and never underestimating the power of any piece on the board.\"\n\nI nodded, still replaying the game in my mind, still feeling the rush of excitement and pride. I knew that this was just the beginning, that there were many more games to be played, many more lessons to be learned. But for now, I was content, knowing that I had grown as a player, and that I would never forget the lesson of the forgotten queen.",

        "Text": "The first lesson I learned as a student pilot is that left and right don’t exist. Maybe driving on a highway or in a parking lot, left and right is precise enough to describe the location and movements of slow-moving bikers, pedestrians, and cars. But at 36,000 feet in the air in a steel tube hurdling almost 200 miles an hour? Left and right just don’t cut it. During one of my first flights in a small Cessna-182, my flight instructor ordered me to scan the horizon for approaching aircrafts. To my right, I caught a glimpse of one: another Cessna with maroon stripes, the sun’s reflection glinting off its windows. Gesturing vaguely to my two o’clock, I informed my flying instructor, “There’s a plane to the right.” “No, to your right. He corrected me, his voice firm but patient. \"In aviation, we use clock positions to describe directions. Imagine a clock face superimposed on the horizon. Twelve o'clock is directly in front of you, three o'clock is to your right, six o'clock is behind you, and nine o'clock is to your left.\" I nodded, feeling a mix of embarrassment and curiosity. This was a fundamental concept, and I had been oblivious to it.\n\nAs we continued to fly, I practiced using clock positions to identify objects in the sky. It wasn't easy, especially when the horizon was hazy or the sun was in my eyes. But with each passing flight, I became more comfortable with this new way of thinking. I began to appreciate the precision and clarity it brought to communication in the cockpit.\n\nThis lesson extended beyond the realm of aviation, however. As I reflected on my experience, I realized that the concept of clock positions was applicable to many areas of life. In business, for instance, it's essential to be precise when communicating with colleagues or clients. Vague directions or instructions can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes. By using specific language and clear references, we can ensure that everyone is on the same page.\n\nIn personal relationships, too, the importance of clear communication cannot be overstated. When we use vague terms or rely on assumptions, we risk misinterpretation and conflict. By being more specific and precise in our language, we can build stronger, more effective relationships.\n\nThe lesson I learned as a student pilot has also influenced my approach to problem-solving. When faced with a complex issue, I try to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This helps me to identify the key components and develop a clearer understanding of the situation. It's similar to using clock positions to navigate the sky – by creating a mental map of the problem, I can better understand the relationships between different elements and develop a more effective solution.\n\nIn many ways, learning to think in clock positions has been a transformative experience. It has taught me the value of precision, clarity, and effective communication. As I continue to grow and develop as a pilot, a professional, and an individual, I am grateful for this fundamental lesson. It has helped me to navigate not only the skies but also the complexities of life itself.",

My grandmother often describes it as “a tragedy” as she is forced to watch her grandchild absolutely butcher our country’s cultural dances, beautiful expressions of our unique West African roots turned into poor facsimiles by my robotic movements. I remember the first time I attempted to dance in front of my grandmother. I must have been around eight years old, and she had decided to teach me some traditional steps. She put on some lively music, and with a warm smile, began to demonstrate the moves. I watched intently, my eyes wide with excitement, as she swayed her hips and tapped her feet with ease. But when it was my turn, disaster struck. My legs seemed to have a mind of their own, stiffening up like wooden stilts as I tried to mimic her graceful movements. My grandmother's smile faltered, and she looked at me with a mixture of confusion and concern.\n\nAs I grew older, my inability to dance only became more pronounced. While my friends would effortlessly bust out intricate steps at parties and gatherings, I would stand awkwardly on the sidelines, my feet rooted to the spot. Even simple dances like the electric slide or the cha cha slide seemed to be beyond my capabilities. It was as if my body was allergic to rhythm and coordination.\n\nDespite my grandmother's best efforts to teach me, I never seemed to improve. She would patiently guide me through the steps, but no matter how hard I tried, I would always end up stumbling over my own feet. It got to the point where I would avoid dancing altogether, fearing embarrassment and ridicule from my peers. But deep down, I longed to be able to express myself through movement, to feel the freedom and joy that came with letting loose and dancing without a care.\n\nMy grandmother's words, \"a tragedy,\" still resonate with me to this day. Not because I'm a bad dancer, but because I feel like I'm missing out on a fundamental part of my cultural heritage. Dancing is an integral part of our West African tradition, a way to connect with our ancestors and celebrate our unique identity. And yet, I feel like I'm stuck on the outside, looking in, unable to fully participate in this beautiful expression of our culture.",

I wanted a sibling. I would always look to my friends and think how lucky they were to have brothers and sisters to play with, while I was stuck at home alone with my parents. However, these sentiments soon changed and my life was transformed, when my parents came home with my new sister, Mia. And while Mia was a furry, Lhasa Apso dog, rather than the human baby sister or brother I dreamed of, she helped me accept and even cherish my life as an only child. At first, I was hesitant to accept Mia as a replacement for the human sibling I had always longed for. I thought that having a dog would be boring and not at all comparable to having a brother or sister. But as soon as I laid eyes on her fluffy white coat and big brown eyes, I knew that I was wrong. Mia brought a sense of excitement and energy into our home that I had never experienced before. She would follow me everywhere, eager to play or cuddle, and her antics would always make me laugh.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to realize that having a dog as a companion had its own unique advantages. For one, I never had to fight over toys or attention with Mia. She was always happy to play with whatever I wanted, and she never got jealous or upset if I didn't want to play with her. In fact, she would often curl up beside me and nap while I did my homework or read a book.\n\nMoreover, having a dog taught me valuable lessons about responsibility and empathy. I had to take care of Mia's needs, feeding her, walking her, and making sure she was healthy and happy. This taught me the importance of putting someone else's needs before my own, and it helped me develop a sense of compassion and understanding for others.\n\nAs I entered my teenage years, I began to appreciate the benefits of being an only child even more. I didn't have to compete with siblings for my parents' attention, and I was able to pursue my own interests and hobbies without interference. I was able to focus on my studies and extracurricular activities, and I was able to develop a strong sense of independence and self-reliance.\n\nOf course, there were still times when I felt lonely or wished I had a human sibling to talk to. But Mia was always there to listen, and she never judged me or told me what to do. She was a constant source of comfort and companionship, and I knew that I could always count on her to be by my side.\n\nIn the end, I realized that my childhood wish for a sibling had been granted in a way that I never could have imagined. Mia may not have been the human sibling I had always dreamed of, but she was something even more special - a loyal companion, a trusted friend, and a beloved member of our family. And as I look back on my childhood, I know that I wouldn't trade my life as an only child with Mia by my side for anything in the world.",

I felt thrown off by the unusual opportunity at first, yet I quickly relished a warm rush of excitement surging through my veins as I imagined putting on field hockey cleats again. When I set foot on the turf the following day, however, my initial anxiety rejoined my exuberance. I felt more eyes turning towards me with each step I made. “Boys do not play field hockey,” I could hear the girls think. As I trailed behind the girls during the warm-up, the thought of quitting seemed more tempting with each second of silence that passed. But then, something unexpected happened. One of the girls, a petite blonde with a bright smile, approached me during a water break. \"Hey, I'm Emily,\" she said, extending her hand. \"Welcome to the team!\" Her genuine enthusiasm was contagious, and I found myself smiling back at her. As we chatted, I learned that Emily was the team captain, and she took it upon herself to show me the ropes. She explained the rules, demonstrated the drills, and even offered me tips on how to improve my game.\n\nAs the practice progressed, I began to feel more at ease. The other girls, too, started to warm up to me, asking me questions about my experience and sharing their own stories. I realized that they weren't judging me; they were curious, and they wanted to learn from me. By the end of the practice, I was sweating, panting, and grinning from ear to ear. For the first time in weeks, I felt like I belonged.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I continued to attend the girls' field hockey practices. I learned to navigate the turf, to communicate with my teammates, and to trust my instincts. But more importantly, I learned to silence the voices in my head that told me I didn't belong. I learned to embrace my differences and to celebrate my uniqueness.\n\nAs I looked around at my new teammates, I realized that we were all misfits in our own way. Emily, the captain, was a math whiz who loved poetry. Sarah, the goalie, was a bookworm who could quote Shakespearean sonnets. And I, the newcomer, was a boy who played field hockey. We were an unlikely bunch, but we had found a common ground on that turf. We had found a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose.\n\nAs I walked off the field that day, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had faced my fears, and I had come out on top. I had discovered a new passion, a new community, and a new sense of self. And as I looked up at the sky, I knew that I would always cherish this moment, this feeling of being part of something bigger than myself.",

        "Text": "Oreos. On the exterior, a firm chocolate crust; however, when opened, a creamy white center awaits. Unbeknownst to me, a social meaning awaited behind an Oreo that left a lingering poor taste in my mouth. From the seductive, powerful attacks within a tango melody to the upbeat, peppy nature of Top 40 hits, I find myself within a new story with each note. Ballroom and pop music, while vastly different styles, have been interconnected since I was a little girl listening to both Hans Zimmer’s ‘Discombobulate and One Direction’s Kiss You. In high school, when I shared my musical taste with my black peers, I received confused stares back. It was as if I had committed a musical sin, a transgression that was unforgivable. The reactions were not just limited to my music preferences; they extended to my food choices as well. When I pulled out an Oreo from my lunchbox, my black peers would snicker and whisper to each other. I didn't understand why; to me, Oreos were just a delicious cookie. But to them, it was a symbol of cultural appropriation, of me trying to be something I'm not.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of music and food, I realized that there was a deeper meaning behind these reactions. It was not just about the music or the food itself, but about the cultural context in which they were consumed. Ballroom music, with its roots in Latin American culture, was seen as a symbol of sophistication and elegance. On the other hand, pop music, with its roots in Western culture, was seen as shallow and superficial. And Oreos, with their origins in white American culture, were seen as a symbol of cultural assimilation.\n\nI began to understand that my love for these different genres of music and food was not just about personal taste, but about the cultural baggage that came with them. I was a black girl who loved ballroom music and Oreos, and that was seen as a contradiction. I was supposed to love hip-hop and soul food, not tango and cookies.\n\nBut as I navigated this complex web of cultural expectations, I realized that I didn't have to choose. I didn't have to conform to the expectations of my peers or the cultural norms of my community. I could love ballroom music and hip-hop, Oreos and soul food. I could be a black girl who loved tango and Top 40 hits, and that was okay.\n\nIn fact, it was more than okay. It was necessary. In a world where cultural boundaries are constantly being blurred and redefined, it's essential to embrace our differences and celebrate our individuality. By loving different genres of music and food, I was not only expressing my personal taste, but also challenging the cultural norms that sought to confine me.\n\nAs I look back on those confused stares and snickers, I realize that they were not about me at all. They were about the fear of cultural erasure, of the blurring of boundaries that had been carefully drawn. But I know that those boundaries are meant to be crossed, and that the beauty of culture lies in its diversity and complexity.\n\nSo, I'll continue to listen to Hans Zimmer's 'Discombobulate' and One Direction's 'Kiss You', and I'll continue to eat Oreos and soul food. I'll continue to be a black girl who loves tango and Top 40 hits, and I'll continue to challenge the cultural norms that seek to confine me. Because in the end, it's not about the music or the food; it's about the freedom to be myself, without apology or explanation.",

        "Text": "I could still hear her words, the words my teacher said as she handed me the packet, “This is a challenge. But I think you’re up for it.” I held the math packet in my hand. On the cover, the title ‘Mission Possible!’ screamed at me. I could feel my fingers tingling, and the goosebumps rolling up my arms. I stared at the black italicized letters of the title as I walked home. They seemed to stare back, alluding to the mysteries that lay underneath them. As I walked home, the packet felt heavier with each step, as if the weight of the challenge was settling in. I couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden within its pages. The title \"Mission Possible!\" seemed to taunt me, daring me to take on the impossible. I felt a surge of adrenaline coursing through my veins, a mix of excitement and trepidation.\n\nWhen I arrived home, I dropped my backpack on the floor and plopped down on the couch, the packet still clutched in my hand. My mom, noticing my intense focus, asked what was wrong. I held up the packet, and she raised an eyebrow. \"What's this?\" she asked. I told her about my teacher's words, and the mysterious title. She smiled, \"Well, it looks like you've got a mission on your hands.\"\n\nI spent the rest of the afternoon pouring over the packet, my mind racing with possibilities. The problems were unlike anything I'd seen before. They were complex, multi-layered, and seemed to require a level of mathematical sophistication I wasn't sure I possessed. But I was determined to rise to the challenge.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, I found myself spending every spare moment working on the packet. I'd wake up early, before school, and work on it for an hour. I'd stay up late, long after my parents had gone to bed, pouring over equations and theorems. My friends would try to distract me, but I was resolute. I had to crack the code, unlock the secrets of \"Mission Possible!\"\n\nThe packet became an obsession, a constant presence in my life. I'd carry it with me everywhere, pulling it out during lunch, or between classes. My teacher would occasionally check in, offering words of encouragement, and the occasional hint. But mostly, I was on my own, wrestling with the problems, trying to tame the beast that was \"Mission Possible!\"\n\nAs the deadline loomed closer, I began to feel the pressure. What if I failed? What if I wasn't good enough? The doubts crept in, like whispers in the dark. But I pushed them aside, focusing on the task at hand. I worked tirelessly, fueled by a determination to succeed.\n\nAnd then, it happened. The breakthrough. The moment when everything clicked into place. I stared at the page, my heart racing, as the solution unfolded before me like a map. I felt a sense of pride, of accomplishment, that I'd never felt before. I'd done it. I'd conquered \"Mission Possible!\"\n\nWhen I handed in the completed packet, my teacher's eyes lit up with pride. \"I knew you could do it,\" she said, beaming. I felt a sense of validation, of vindication. The challenge had been worth it, every late night, every early morning, every struggle. I'd discovered a strength within myself, a resilience I didn't know I possessed.\n\nAs I walked out of the classroom, packet in hand, I felt a sense of pride, of ownership. I'd taken on the impossible, and emerged victorious. The title \"Mission Possible!\" still screamed at me, but now it was a reminder of what I was capable of. I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, I was ready. I was up for it.",

Freshman year, I tried so hard to keep them that pristine, popular M7652-000 color. Time progressed, however, and dirt, guitar chords, and conversations eventually covered the canvas of the shoes. When I first moved to Houston in eighth grade, I tried to follow the status quo and keep my shoes white. But as various conflicting influences crept into my life--Liberal vs. Conservative; Portland, OR vs. Houston, TX; LCD Sound system vs. Ed Sheeran--I began to realize how important it is to listen to the other side and to maintain the confidence to pursue my passions while inspiring others to do the same. I needed to appreciate Houston's voice and learn from its stories as much as it needed to hear mine, and my shoes grew dirtier every day as each person's testimony helped solidify and expand my own. As I walked through the bustling streets of Houston, my shoes became a reflection of my journey. The dirt and stains accumulated, telling the story of late-night conversations with friends, impromptu jam sessions, and spontaneous adventures. Each scuff mark and smudge represented a moment of growth, a lesson learned, or a connection made. My shoes became a testament to the beauty of imperfection, a reminder that true character is forged in the fires of experience, not in the sterile vacuum of conformity.\n\nAs I navigated the complexities of high school, I began to realize that the same principles applied to my relationships and interactions with others. I learned to appreciate the diverse perspectives and backgrounds that surrounded me, to listen actively, and to empathize deeply. I discovered that the most profound connections were formed when I was willing to get my hands dirty, to engage in messy, uncomfortable conversations, and to challenge my own assumptions.\n\nMy shoes, once a symbol of superficiality, had transformed into a badge of honor, a symbol of my commitment to authenticity and self-expression. I no longer felt the need to conform to the expectations of others, to present a polished, Instagram-perfect facade. Instead, I embraced the beauty of my imperfections, the quirks and flaws that made me uniquely me.\n\nAs I looked down at my worn, faded Chucks, I was reminded of the power of storytelling. Each stain, each scuff, each tear told a story of its own, a story of resilience, of perseverance, of growth. My shoes had become a canvas, a tapestry woven from the threads of my experiences, and I was proud to wear them as a badge of honor.\n\nIn a world that often values superficiality over substance, my shoes stood as a defiant rebuke. They proclaimed that true beauty lies not in the pristine, the polished, or the perfect, but in the worn, the weathered, and the well-loved. They whispered that it's okay to be imperfect, to be messy, to be human.\n\nAs I walked through the streets of Houston, my shoes making soft crunching sounds on the pavement, I felt a sense of pride, of ownership, of self. I knew that I was not just a product of my environment, but a co-creator, a storyteller, a work of art in progress. And my shoes, those trusty, tattered Chucks, were the perfect reflection of that journey.",

We had all journeyed to the TD Garden from wherever we were in our lives to see Tom Petty perform. I knew his music because my mother had shared it with me. It meant something to her and it meant something to me. His music meant something different to every person in that room and all those meanings, all infinite number of them, wrapped around the music notes and existed in harmony on that July night. I had to close my eyes. It was as if I could hear the heartbeats of every person in that room, pulsing along with the rhythm of the music. By sharing his music, Tom Petty gave me a striking awareness of 19,580 people that live and feel alongside each other. Tom Petty will live as long as people feel. Lights flashing beyond my eyelids, I could feel what it was like to live more lives than just my own. Tom Petty's art described his life, but it has weaved its way into those of so many others. My own, my mother's then and when she was my age, and all the strangers around me who didn't seem so strange anymore. We all have to go through our own lives and our own challenges, but just because we have our own lessons to learn doesn't mean we are alone. As I stood there, surrounded by the pulsating energy of the crowd, I felt a deep sense of connection to the people around me. It was as if Tom Petty's music had bridged the gaps between our individual experiences, creating a collective understanding that transcended our differences. In that moment, I realized that his art was not just a reflection of his own life, but a thread that stitched together the tapestry of human experience.\n\nAs I looked around the room, I saw people of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life, united by their love for Tom Petty's music. I saw tears streaming down the faces of those who had lost loved ones, and I saw smiles on the faces of those who had found solace in his songs. I saw people singing along to every word, their voices hoarse from years of belting out their favorite tunes. And I saw people like me, who had been introduced to his music by a loved one, and had found a piece of themselves in his lyrics.\n\nTom Petty's music was more than just a collection of songs – it was a shared experience, a common language that spoke to our deepest fears, desires, and hopes. It was a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles, that we are all connected by our shared humanity. As I stood there, surrounded by the pulsating energy of the crowd, I felt a sense of gratitude to Tom Petty for giving me this gift – the gift of connection, of community, of understanding.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the music faded into the silence, I knew that I would carry this feeling with me long after the concert was over. I would carry it with me as I navigated the ups and downs of life, as I faced my own challenges and struggles. And I would carry it with me as I connected with others, as I formed new relationships and deepened old ones.\n\nTom Petty may have left us, but his music remains, a testament to the power of art to bring us together, to make us feel seen and heard and understood. And as I looked around the room, I knew that I was not alone in this feeling – that there were 19,580 people who felt the same way, who had been touched by his music in a way that would stay with them forever.",

        "Text": "My first dream job was to be a pickle truck driver. I saw it in my favorite book, Richard Scarry's \"Cars and Trucks and Things That Go,\" and for some reason, I was absolutely obsessed with the idea of driving a giant pickle. Much to the discontent of my younger sister, I insisted that my parents read us that book as many nights as possible so we could find goldbug, a small little golden bug, on every page. I would imagine the wonderful life I would have: being a pig driving a giant pickle truck across the country, chasing and finding goldbug. I then moved on to wanting to be a Lego Master. As I grew older, my dream jobs continued to evolve, but the sense of adventure and creativity remained a constant theme. I wanted to be a Lego Master because I was fascinated by the endless possibilities of building and creating something from scratch. I would spend hours constructing intricate cities, spaceships, and castles, and I loved the feeling of bringing my imagination to life. My parents, seeing my passion, encouraged me to pursue it, and I began to participate in local Lego competitions, where I would meet other kids who shared my enthusiasm.\n\nAs I entered middle school, my interests shifted again, and I became obsessed with the idea of being a marine biologist. I was captivated by the wonders of the ocean and the creatures that lived within it. I would spend hours watching documentaries about sharks, coral reefs, and sea turtles, and I dreamed of one day exploring the depths of the ocean in a submarine. I even started a small aquarium in my room, where I would care for fish and learn about the delicate balance of marine ecosystems.\n\nIn high school, I discovered my passion for writing and storytelling. I began to write short stories and poetry, and I fell in love with the power of words to evoke emotions and transport people to new worlds. I started a school literary magazine, where I would publish the work of my fellow students, and I even landed an internship at a local publishing house. I thought that I had finally found my dream job – to be a published author, traveling the world and telling stories that would inspire and captivate people.\n\nBut as I entered college, I began to realize that my dream job was not just about the job itself, but about the impact it would have on others. I started to volunteer at a local literacy program, where I would teach underprivileged kids how to read and write. It was there that I saw the power of education to transform lives, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. I changed my major to education, and I began to pursue a career as a teacher.\n\nLooking back, I realize that my dream jobs were not just fleeting fancies, but a reflection of my values and passions. Being a pickle truck driver, a Lego Master, a marine biologist, a writer, and a teacher may seem like vastly different careers, but they all share a common thread – a desire to explore, create, and make a difference in the world. As I continue on my journey, I know that my dream job will continue to evolve, but I am excited to see where it will take me next.",

        "Text": "On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I sit in soil pulling crab grass and borage. I've been a farmer since sophomore year. The farm--managed by my school--is a one-acre plot more accurately described as a garden with chickens. My task today is to pick cherry tomatoes, most of which have ripened. I grab a tray from the shed and walk across pathways to the vine. I created these pathways during junior year, shoveling large heaps of wood-chips into a wheelbarrow, then raking these chips onto the pathways between beds. Our two tomato vines stand three feet tall and extend horizontally at least six feet; they are heavy with small red and orange glistening spheres. As I begin to pick the cherry tomatoes, the warm sun beats down on my back, and the sweet aroma of ripe fruit fills the air. I gently twist each tomato from its stem, careful not to bruise the delicate skin. The tray quickly fills with the vibrant red and orange orbs, and I take a moment to admire my handiwork. There's something satisfying about watching something you've nurtured grow and flourish.\n\nAs I work, I think back to how I first got involved with the farm. It was during my sophomore year, when I was struggling to find my place in school. I was always interested in science and the outdoors, but I didn't know how to channel that interest into something meaningful. That was when I stumbled upon the farm club, a small group of students who were passionate about sustainable agriculture. I was drawn to their enthusiasm and dedication, and soon found myself volunteering on the farm every week.\n\nOver time, I took on more responsibilities, learning about crop rotation, composting, and irrigation systems. I discovered that farming wasn't just about growing food; it was about building a community, working together towards a common goal. The farm became my sanctuary, a place where I could escape the pressures of school and focus on something tangible.\n\nAs I continue to pick tomatoes, I notice the chickens pecking at the ground nearby, searching for bugs and seeds. We have five chickens in total, each with its own unique personality. There's Luna, the curious one, who always seems to find her way into trouble. Then there's Ginger, the gentle giant, who loves to be petted and cuddled. The chickens are an integral part of the farm, providing us with fresh eggs and entertainment.\n\nAfter I've filled the tray with tomatoes, I take a break to sit under the shade of a nearby tree. I pull out a water bottle and take a refreshing sip, feeling the cool liquid slide down my throat. As I sit there, I reflect on what I've learned from my experience as a farmer. It's not just about growing food; it's about cultivating patience, perseverance, and a deeper connection with the natural world.\n\nAs I look out at the garden, I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. We've worked hard to create this oasis, and it's a testament to what can be achieved when people come together with a shared vision. The farm has taught me that even in the midst of chaos, there is always beauty to be found. And as I head back to the shed, tray in hand, I know that I'll carry this lesson with me for the rest of my life.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon passes quickly, as I help with other tasks around the farm. We have a meeting to discuss our plans for the upcoming harvest festival, and I volunteer to help with the setup. As the sun begins to set, I pack up my things and head back to school, feeling fulfilled and content. Being a farmer has taught me to appreciate the simple things in life, and I know that no matter where life takes me, I'll always cherish this experience.",

A Starbucks barista hands me my drink with a hand adorned by a small music note. Where I work, a customer hands me her credit card wearing a permanent flower bracelet. Every day, I am on a scavenger hunt to find women with this kind of permanent art. I'm intrigued by the quotes, dates, symbols, and abstract shapes I see on people that I interact with daily. As I go about my daily routine, I find myself scanning the arms, legs, and torsos of the people I encounter, searching for these hidden gems. It's become a game, a thrill of the hunt, to spot a new tattoo and wonder about the story behind it. What inspired this person to choose this particular design? What does it represent to them?\n\nI've come to realize that tattoos are more than just decorative body art; they're a form of self-expression, a way for individuals to convey their personality, values, and experiences. Each tattoo is a unique window into the wearer's soul, a glimpse into their history and what makes them tick.\n\nI've had the privilege of striking up conversations with some of these tattooed individuals, and their stories are always fascinating. There was the young woman with a delicate cherry blossom on her ankle, which symbolized her grandmother's love and the beauty of impermanence. Then there was the burly man with a sleeve of skulls and snakes, which represented his journey through addiction and redemption.\n\nThese encounters have not only broadened my understanding of tattoos but also changed my perception of the people who wear them. I used to think of tattoos as a form of rebellion or nonconformity, but now I see them as a badge of courage, a sign of vulnerability, and a testament to the human experience.\n\nAs I continue on my scavenger hunt, I've started to notice patterns and themes. There are the music lovers, with their treble clefs and guitar strings, who wear their passion on their sleeves. There are the travelers, with their maps and compasses, who have etched their journeys onto their skin. And then there are the survivors, with their ribbons and awareness symbols, who have transformed their struggles into symbols of hope and resilience.\n\nThese tattoos are more than just ink on skin; they're a language, a way for people to communicate their essence without words. They're a reminder that everyone has a story to tell, and that each person we meet is a complex tapestry of experiences, emotions, and values.\n\nAs I go about my day, I'm no longer just seeing people; I'm seeing the art that adorns their bodies, and the stories that lie beneath. I'm seeing the beauty in the imperfections, the courage in the vulnerabilities, and the humanity in the ink. My scavenger hunt has become a journey of discovery, not just of tattoos, but of the people who wear them, and the incredible stories they have to tell.",

        "Text": "“You’re such a hipster.” It’s a phrase heard everyday in school hallways across America, and its usage often operates as a conundrum that obscures teenagers’ perceptions of themselves and who they want to be. I, in turn, have struggled immensely with the paradoxical use of this label. Since the onset of my tween years and perhaps even before that, I have constantly carried with me an insistent urge for nonconformity; it has never sat well with me to be like everyone else. Throughout my middle school years, this natural instinct of mine manifested itself in many different ways: jeans tucked into knee-high socks, anything from punk to Harlem renaissance jazz bellowing from my headphones, Palahniuk novels peeking out of my backpack. As my identity shifted, my career as a social renegade flourished, and I found in myself a certain pride in being different and a passion for seeking out eccentric new ways to express myself. However, as I entered high school, the label \"hipster\" began to take on a new meaning. It was no longer a badge of honor, but a term of ridicule and scorn. Suddenly, my eclectic style and love for underground music were seen as pretentious and superficial. I was accused of trying too hard to be different, of being a poser who only adopted alternative interests to seem cool. The phrase \"you're such a hipster\" was hurled at me like a insult, implying that I was somehow inauthentic, that my nonconformity was just a shallow attempt to stand out.\n\nAt first, I was taken aback by this sudden shift in perception. I had always thought that being different was something to be proud of, but now it seemed like a liability. I began to question whether my passion for individuality was genuine or just a facade. Was I really just trying to fit into a certain mold, to be accepted by a certain crowd? The uncertainty was crippling, and for a while, I felt like I was losing myself in the midst of it all.\n\nBut as I reflected on my experiences, I realized that the problem wasn't with me or my desire for nonconformity. The issue lay with the way the term \"hipster\" was being used - as a way to dismiss and belittle anyone who dared to be different. It was a label that reduced complex individuals to a set of superficial characteristics, ignoring the depth and sincerity behind their actions. I realized that my passion for alternative music, literature, and fashion wasn't about trying to fit into a certain crowd, but about expressing myself authentically.\n\nMoreover, I came to understand that the desire for nonconformity wasn't unique to me or even to the \"hipster\" subculture. It was a fundamental human impulse, a need to break free from the constraints of societal norms and forge one's own path. In embracing this impulse, I was not only staying true to myself, but also contributing to a rich cultural heritage of innovation and creativity.\n\nIn the end, the label \"hipster\" lost its power over me. I continued to wear my skinny jeans and listen to my vinyl records, not because I was trying to fit into a certain mold, but because it was a genuine expression of who I was. And as I looked around at my peers, I saw that we were all struggling with the same paradox - the desire to be different, yet the fear of being labeled and judged. But it was in embracing this paradox, in owning our individuality and rejecting the superficial labels, that we could truly find ourselves and forge our own paths in life.",

        "Text": "I had never broken into a car before. We were in Laredo, having just finished our first day at a Habitat for Humanity work site. The Hotchkiss volunteers had already left, off to enjoy some Texas BBQ, leaving me behind with the college kids to clean up. Not until we were stranded did we realize we were locked out of the van. Someone picked a coat hanger out of the dumpster, handed it to me, and took a few steps back. \"Can you do that thing with a coat hanger to unlock it?\" \"Why me?\" I thought to myself, but before I could respond, one of the college kids chimed in, \"Yeah, you're from the city, you must know how to do that stuff.\" I was taken aback by the assumption, but I decided to roll with it. After all, I had seen it done in movies before, how hard could it be?\n\nI took the coat hanger and began to manipulate it, trying to recreate the scenes I had seen on screen. The college kids gathered around, watching with a mix of curiosity and amusement. I poked and prodded at the lock, trying to get it to budge, but it wouldn't give. Sweat began to form on my forehead as I worked, my hands shaking slightly with the effort.\n\nJust when I was about to give up, I felt a slight click. The lock disengaged, and the door swung open. The college kids cheered, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. Who knew that my fake reputation as a city kid with a talent for breaking and entering would actually come in handy?\n\nAs we piled back into the van, I couldn't help but think about the irony of the situation. Here we were, a group of volunteers dedicated to building affordable housing for those in need, and yet we were resorting to questionable tactics to get back into our own vehicle. It was a humbling reminder that even with the best of intentions, we're not above making mistakes.\n\nThe rest of the trip was a blur of long days and hard work, but that moment stuck with me. It was a reminder that even in the most unexpected situations, we have the power to surprise ourselves. And it was a testament to the power of teamwork and quick thinking, even when things don't go according to plan.\n\nAs we drove away from Laredo, headed back to our respective homes, I couldn't help but think about the lessons I had learned on that trip. It wasn't just about building houses; it was about building relationships, and learning to adapt to unexpected situations. And it was about discovering hidden talents and skills that we never knew we had.\n\nThat trip was a turning point for me, a moment of self-discovery that has stayed with me to this day. It reminded me that even in the most mundane of situations, there is always the potential for adventure and growth. And it taught me that sometimes, it's the unexpected moments that end up being the most memorable.\n\nYears later, when I look back on that trip, I'm reminded of the power of community and the importance of taking risks. I'm reminded that even when things don't go according to plan, we have the power to adapt and overcome. And I'm reminded that sometimes, it's the unexpected moments that end up being the most transformative.\n\nThat trip to Laredo was just a small part of my journey, but it's a memory that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's a reminder that even in the most unexpected situations, we have the power to surprise ourselves, and to discover new strengths and abilities that we never knew we had.",

        "Text": "I have a fetish for writing. I’m not talking about crafting prose or verses, or even sentences out of words. But simply constructing letters and characters from strokes of ink gives me immense satisfaction. It’s not quite calligraphy, as I don’t use calligraphic pens or Chinese writing brushes; I prefer it simple, spontaneous, and subconscious. I often find myself crafting characters in the margins of notebooks with a fifty-cent pencil, or tracing letters out of thin air with anything from chopsticks to fingertips. The art of handwriting is a relic in the information era. Why write when one can type? Yet, for me, the tactile experience of putting pen to paper, or rather, pencil to paper, is an essential part of the creative process. It's a sensory experience that typing on a keyboard cannot replicate. The feel of the graphite gliding across the page, the subtle variations in pressure and speed that can alter the shape and size of the letters, the way the lead wears down to a nub, leaving a trail of graphite dust in its wake – all of these sensations are integral to the joy I derive from writing.\n\nMoreover, handwriting is an intimate, personal act. It's a reflection of one's personality, a window into the subconscious. The loops and flourishes, the tightness or looseness of the script, the way certain letters are favored over others – all of these reveal something about the writer's character. In an era where digital communication has become the norm, handwriting is a rare and precious commodity. It's a tangible connection to the past, a link to the countless generations who have put pen to paper to express themselves.\n\nI often find myself lost in the flow of handwriting, the strokes and curves of the letters blending together in a hypnotic dance. It's a meditative state, one that quiets the mind and focuses the attention. The world outside recedes, and all that's left is the gentle scratch of the pencil on paper, the soft whisper of the graphite as it leaves its mark.\n\nOf course, there are practical advantages to handwriting as well. Studies have shown that writing by hand improves retention and recall, that it enhances cognitive function and boosts creativity. In an age where information is readily available at our fingertips, handwriting forces us to slow down, to process and absorb the information in a more meaningful way.\n\nBut for me, the appeal of handwriting goes beyond the practical or cognitive benefits. It's an act of rebellion, a refusal to surrender to the homogenizing forces of technology. In a world where everything is instant, where communication is reduced to emojis and abbreviations, handwriting is a defiant assertion of individuality.\n\nAs I sit here, pencil in hand, crafting letters and characters in the margins of my notebook, I feel a sense of connection to the writers who have come before me. I think of the great authors, the poets and novelists who poured their hearts and souls onto the page, leaving behind a legacy of ink and paper. I think of the countless love letters, the diaries and journals, the scribbled notes and marginalia that have been lost to the ages.\n\nAnd I think of the future, of the generations to come who will inherit our digital detritus, our tweets and texts and emails. Will they cherish these ephemeral messages, or will they be lost in the void, forgotten in the vast expanse of cyberspace? I don't know, but I do know that the handwritten word, with all its imperfections and quirks, will endure. It's a testament to the human touch, a reminder that even in the most sterile of digital landscapes, there is still beauty to be found in the strokes of a pencil, the flow of ink on paper.",

        "Text": "When I failed math in my sophomore year of high school, a bitter dispute engulfed my household -- “Nicolas Yan vs. Mathematics.” I was the plaintiff, appearing pro se, while my father represented the defendant (inanimate as it was). My brother and sister constituted a rather understaffed jury, and my mother presided over the case as judge. In a frightening departure from racial stereotype, I charged Mathematics with the capital offences of being “too difficult” and “irrelevant to my aspirations,” citing my recent shortcomings in the subject as evi. as evidence of its alleged wrongdoing. My father, a stalwart defender of the mathematical arts, countered with a scathing cross-examination, probing the depths of my study habits and questioning my commitment to the subject. The jury, comprised of my siblings, seemed sympathetic to my plight, but ultimately, they were swayed by my father's impassioned argument that mathematics was not only essential to my academic success but also a vital tool for problem-solving in everyday life.\n\nAs the verdict was read – guilty of not applying myself – I felt a mix of emotions: disappointment, frustration, and a hint of defiance. How could my family not understand that math just wasn't my thing? I had always struggled with numbers, and no amount of tutoring or extra help seemed to make a difference. But as I reflected on the trial, I began to realize that my failure in math wasn't just about the subject itself; it was about my own fear of failure and my reluctance to ask for help.\n\nIn the months that followed, I made a conscious effort to change my approach to math. I started attending tutoring sessions regularly, not just to improve my grades but to understand the underlying concepts. I also began to see math in a different light, recognizing its beauty and elegance in the way it described the world around us. My grades slowly began to improve, and with them, my confidence.\n\nThe experience taught me a valuable lesson about perseverance and the importance of seeking help when needed. It also made me appreciate the value of constructive criticism, even when it comes from those closest to us. My father's tough love and high expectations pushed me to work harder and strive for excellence, even in a subject that didn't come naturally to me.\n\nAs I look back on that tumultuous period in my life, I am reminded of the power of family and the impact they can have on our lives. The \"trial\" may have been a dramatic and humorous way to address my struggles in math, but it was also a testament to the unwavering support and guidance that my family has always provided. In the end, it was not mathematics that was the problem; it was my own attitude and approach to learning.\n\nThe experience has also influenced my approach to challenges in general. When faced with obstacles, I no longer shy away or become discouraged. Instead, I draw on the lessons I learned from my \"trial\" and remind myself that with persistence, hard work, and a willingness to ask for help, I can overcome even the most daunting hurdles.\n\nIn many ways, the \"Nicolas Yan vs. Mathematics\" trial was a defining moment in my life, one that taught me valuable lessons about resilience, hard work, and the importance of family. It may have started as a humorous and lighthearted dispute, but it ultimately became a transformative experience that has shaped me into the person I am today.",

I was taking my chapter 7 biology test when I came upon the last question, “What is cancer?”, to which I answered: “The abnormal, unrestricted growth of cells.” After handing in the test, I moved on to chapter 8, oblivious then to how earth-shattering such a disease could be. I learned the meaning of cancer two years later. A girl named Kiersten came into my family by way of my oldest brother who had fallen in love with her. I distinctly recall her hair catching the sea breeze as she walked with us along the Jersey shore, a blonde wave in my surrounding family's sea of brunette. Physically, she may have been different, but she redefined what family meant to me. She attended my concerts, went to my award ceremonies, and helped me study for tests. Whenever I needed support, she was there. But little did I know, Kiersten was hiding a secret. One day, my brother sat me down and told me that Kiersten had been diagnosed with cancer. I was in shock, my mind racing back to that biology test two years prior. The definition I had so confidently written down seemed so trivial now. I couldn't fathom how something so seemingly abstract could be wreaking havoc on the person I had grown to love.\n\nAs Kiersten began her treatment, I watched her transformation from a vibrant, energetic young woman to a frail, exhausted patient. Her once-luxuriant hair fell out in clumps, her skin turned pale, and her bright smile began to fade. I felt helpless, unable to do anything but stand by and watch as cancer ravaged her body. The pain and suffering she endured was a harsh reality check, and I was forced to confront the brutal truth about this disease.\n\nDespite the grueling treatment, Kiersten's spirit remained unbroken. She continued to attend my concerts, albeit in a wheelchair, and still managed to muster a smile whenever I needed it. Her resilience in the face of adversity inspired me, and I began to realize that cancer was not just a disease, but a test of human strength and courage.\n\nAs the months went by, Kiersten's battle with cancer became a defining aspect of our family's life. We rallied around her, supporting her through the darkest of times. I learned to appreciate the little things, like a good day, a decent night's sleep, or a moment of laughter amidst the tears. I saw firsthand the importance of family, friends, and community in the fight against cancer.\n\nKiersten's journey with cancer taught me that life is precious, fragile, and unpredictable. It showed me that even in the darkest moments, there is always hope, always a reason to keep fighting. And although cancer may have taken its toll on her body, it could never diminish her spirit, her love, or her impact on my life. Today, as I reflect on that biology test and the lessons I've learned since, I realize that the true meaning of cancer goes far beyond a simple definition – it's a testament to the human spirit's capacity to persevere, to love, and to inspire.",

It was my turn to take the shovel, but I felt too ashamed to dutifully send her off when I had not properly said goodbye. I refused to throw dirt on her. I refused to let go of my grandmother, to accept a death I had not seen coming, to believe that an illness could not only interrupt, but steal a beloved life. When my parents finally revealed to me that my grandmother had been battling liver cancer, I was twelve and I was angry--mostly with myself. They had wanted to protect me--only six years old at the time--from the complex and morose concept of death. As I stood there, frozen in grief, my parents' words echoed in my mind. They had wanted to shield me from the harsh reality of mortality, but in doing so, they had also deprived me of the opportunity to say goodbye, to come to terms with her illness, and to prepare myself for the inevitable. I felt cheated, as if I had been robbed of precious time with my grandmother.\n\nIn the days that followed, I struggled to reconcile my emotions. I was angry with my parents for not telling me sooner, but at the same time, I understood their motivations. They had wanted to preserve my childhood innocence, to let me enjoy the carefree days of youth without the burden of mortality weighing me down. But as I navigated the complex web of emotions that followed my grandmother's passing, I realized that their decision had also stolen from me the chance to develop a deeper understanding of life and death.\n\nAs I looked around at my family, gathered together in mourning, I saw the weight of grief etched on their faces. My parents, who had always been my pillars of strength, seemed fragile and vulnerable. My siblings, who had always been my partners in mischief, were somber and quiet. We were all struggling to come to terms with the loss, to find a way to move forward in a world without our beloved grandmother.\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, I began to realize that my grandmother's death was not just a personal loss, but also a rite of passage. It marked the end of my childhood innocence and the beginning of my journey towards adulthood. I began to understand that life was precious, fleeting, and unpredictable. I learned to cherish every moment, to appreciate the beauty of the present, and to find meaning in the impermanence of life.\n\nAs I reflect on that difficult time, I am grateful for the lessons I learned. I am grateful for the opportunity to understand the complexity of human emotions, to develop empathy and compassion, and to appreciate the beauty of life. My grandmother's death was a painful experience, but it was also a transformative one. It taught me to live life with intention, to cherish every moment, and to find meaning in the impermanence of life.\n\nIn the end, I did take the shovel, and I did throw dirt on her grave. But it was not an act of closure; it was an act of acceptance. I accepted that my grandmother was gone, but I also accepted that her memory would live on in me. I accepted that life was precious, and that every moment counted. And I accepted that I would carry her legacy with me, always.",

        "Text": "Every Saturday morning, I’d awaken to the smell of crushed garlic and piquant pepper. I would stumble into the kitchen to find my grandma squatting over a large silver bowl, mixing fat lips of fresh cabbages with garlic, salt, and red pepper. That was how the delectable Korean dish, kimchi, was born every weekend at my home. My grandma’s specialty always dominated the dinner table as kimchi filled every plate. And like my grandma who had always been living with us, it seemed as though the luscious smell of garlic would never leave our home. But even the prided recipe was defenseless against the ravages of Alzheimer’s that inflicted my grandma’s mind. Dementia slowly fed on her memories until she became as blank as a brand-new notebook. The ritualistic rigor of Saturday mornings came to a pause, and during dinner, the artificial taste of vacuum-packaged factory kimchi only emphasized the absence of the family tradition. I would look at her and ask, “Grandma, what’s my name?” But she would stare back at me with a clueless expression. Within a year of diagnosis, she lived with us like a total stranger. One day, my mom brought home fresh cabbages and red pepper sauce. and placed them on the kitchen counter, hoping to spark some memory in my grandma's mind. She sat beside her, holding her hands, and said, \"Mom, remember how we used to make kimchi together every Saturday?\" My grandma's eyes wandered, unfocused, as if searching for a familiar face in a crowded room. My mom's voice trembled, but she persisted, \"Let's make kimchi together, just like we used to.\" Slowly, my grandma's gaze settled on the cabbages, and for a fleeting moment, a glimmer of recognition flickered in her eyes.\n\nWith my mom's guidance, my grandma's hands began to move, as if on autopilot, mimicking the motions she had performed countless times before. The familiar rhythm of chopping, mixing, and seasoning returned, and the aroma of garlic and pepper wafted through the air once more. It was as if the kimchi had awakened a part of her that Alzheimer's had tried to erase. For that brief, shining moment, my grandma was back, her eyes sparkling with a hint of her former self.\n\nAs we sat down to eat the kimchi, the flavors exploded on my tongue, transporting me back to those Saturday mornings when life was simpler. My grandma took a bite, and a faint smile crossed her face. It was a small victory, but it was enough to give us hope. In that instant, I realized that even as memories fade, the love and traditions that bind us together can still be savored, and that the smell of garlic and pepper can evoke a sense of home and belonging, even in the darkest of times.",

        "Text": "When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience. At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place. It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language. It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. As I continued to travel, my fascination with language only grew stronger. I was amazed by how a single phrase, spoken with a different accent or inflection, could completely alter its meaning. In Spain, I learned that the formal \"you\" (usted) was used to show respect, while in Germany, the informal \"you\" (du) was used with friends. These nuances sparked a curiosity in me to delve deeper into the world of linguistics.\n\nMy experiences with language were not limited to just speaking and listening. I also became fascinated with the written word. In Japan, I was captivated by the intricate characters of Kanji, which seemed to hold secrets and stories of their own. In India, I marveled at the beauty of Devanagari script, which flowed like a river across the page. As I explored these different writing systems, I began to appreciate the complexity and diversity of human communication.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until I visited Brazil that I truly understood the power of language to bridge cultural divides. I was struck by the warmth and hospitality of the Brazilian people, who welcomed me with open arms despite our language barriers. Through gestures, smiles, and broken Portuguese, we managed to communicate and form connections that transcended words. This experience taught me that language is not just about conveying information, but also about building relationships and fostering understanding.\n\nAs I reflect on my travels, I realize that language has been the thread that has woven my experiences together. It has allowed me to connect with people from diverse backgrounds, to appreciate the richness of different cultures, and to gain a deeper understanding of the world around me. My passion for language has also inspired me to pursue a career in international relations, where I hope to use my skills to facilitate cross-cultural communication and foster global cooperation.\n\nIn conclusion, my travels have taught me that language is not just a means of communication, but a key to unlocking the secrets of human connection. It has the power to break down barriers, to build bridges, and to foster understanding between people from different cultures and backgrounds. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue exploring the world of language, and to use my skills to make a positive impact on the global community.",

Smeared blood, shredded feathers. Clearly, the bird was dead. But wait, the slight fluctuation of its chest, the slow blinking of its shiny black eyes. No, it was alive. I had been typing an English essay when I heard my cat's loud meows and the flutter of wings. I had turned slightly at the noise and had found the barely breathing bird in front of me. The shock came first. Mind racing, heart beating faster, blood draining from my face. I instinctively reached out my hand to hold it, like a long-lost keepsake from my youth. But then I remembered that birds had life, flesh, blood. Death. Dare I say it out loud? Here, in my own home? Within seconds, my reflexes kicked in. Get over the shock. Gloves, napkins, towels. I hastily gathered the necessary items, my mind racing with the thought of saving this creature's life. The irony was not lost on me - I, a self-proclaimed animal lover, had been so oblivious to the suffering of this bird just moments before. My cat, Mr. Whiskers, sat calmly by my side, seemingly proud of his catch. I shot him a stern glance, but he just blinked innocently.\n\nAs I gently wrapped the bird in a towel, I felt a surge of responsibility wash over me. This was no longer just about saving a life; it was about making amends for my initial indifference. I carefully placed the bird in a makeshift nest, constructed from a cardboard box and some old cloth. The bird's labored breathing and faint chirping filled the air, and I knew I had to act fast.\n\nI quickly researched local animal rescue centers and found one that was open 24/7. With the bird securely in its makeshift nest, I rushed out the door, Mr. Whiskers watching me with a curious gaze. The drive was a blur, my mind consumed by thoughts of the bird's fate. Would I be too late? Would they be able to save it?\n\nUpon arriving at the rescue center, I was greeted by a kind-faced volunteer who quickly took the bird from me. She examined it with a practiced eye, her expression a mix of concern and compassion. \"We'll do everything we can,\" she reassured me, as I watched the bird being whisked away to a specialized care unit.\n\nThe ride back home was somber, my thoughts reflecting on the experience. I realized that, in that moment, I had been forced to confront my own moral compass. Would I have acted differently if I hadn't been caught off guard? The incident had awakened a sense of empathy within me, a reminder that even in the most mundane of moments, we are faced with choices that can have a profound impact on the world around us.\n\nAs I walked back into my house, Mr. Whiskers greeted me with a curious mew. I scooped him up, holding him close, and whispered a silent apology to the bird, now in the care of strangers. The experience had left an indelible mark on me, a reminder to always be mindful of the intricate web of life that surrounds us, and to never underestimate the power of a single, fleeting moment to shape our character.",

My body couldn’t stop shaking as I gasped for air, and the room started spinning. Ten minutes prior, I had been eating dinner with my family at a Chinese restaurant, drinking chicken-feet soup. My mom had specifically asked the waitress if there were peanuts in it, because when I was two we found out that I am deathly allergic to them. When the waitress replied no, I went for it. Suddenly I started scratching my neck, feeling the hives that had started to form. I rushed to the restroom to throw up because my throat was itchy and I felt a weight on my chest. I was experiencing anaphylactic shock, which prevented me from taking anything but shallow breaths. As I lay on the cold bathroom floor, my vision began to blur and my body felt like it was shutting down. I could hear my parents' panicked voices outside the door, but they seemed distant, muffled. My mom burst in, her face etched with worry, and quickly assessed the situation. She grabbed her EpiPen, a device that injects epinephrine to counteract the allergic reaction, and administered it to my thigh. The burning sensation was intense, but I knew it was my only hope.\n\nWithin minutes, the paramedics arrived, and I was rushed to the hospital. The ambulance ride was a blur, but I remember feeling like I was going to die. My airways were constricting, and every breath was a struggle. The beeping of the machines and the murmurs of the medical staff created a sense of chaos around me.\n\nWhen we arrived at the hospital, the doctors and nurses sprang into action. They hooked me up to oxygen and IV fluids, and administered more medication to counteract the allergic reaction. I was in and out of consciousness, but I remember the feeling of relief when the doctor told my parents that I was going to be okay.\n\nThe incident was a harsh reminder of the severity of my peanut allergy. It's not just a minor inconvenience; it's a matter of life and death. I've learned to be more vigilant, to always carry my EpiPen with me, and to never take food allergies lightly. That night, I came close to losing my life, but it also taught me the importance of being proactive about my health.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, my family and I made changes to ensure my safety. We started carrying a second EpiPen with us at all times, and we became more meticulous about reading food labels and asking questions about ingredients. We also made sure to educate our friends and family about the severity of my allergy, so they could be better equipped to help in case of an emergency.\n\nThe experience was terrifying, but it also taught me a valuable lesson about taking responsibility for my own health. I've learned to be more confident in advocating for myself, and to never take my life for granted. That night, I came face to face with mortality, but it also gave me a newfound appreciation for life.",

She had a nine year old son named Cody. I would babysit Cody every day after school for at least two to three hours. We would play Scrabble or he would read to me from Charlotte’s Web or The Ugly Duckling. He would talk a lot about his friends and school life, and I would listen to him and ask him the meanings of certain words. He was my first friend in the New World. My second family was the Martinez family, who were friends of the Watkins’s. The host dad Michael was a high school English teacher and the host mom Jennifer (who had me call her “Jen”) taught elementary school. She had recently delivered a baby, so she was still in the hospital when I moved into their house. The Martinez family did almost everything together. We made pizza together, watched Shrek on their cozy couch together, and went fishing on Sunday together. On rainy days, Michael, Jen and I would sit on the porch and listen to the rain, talking about our dreams and thoughts. Within two months I was calling them mom and dad. After I finished the exchange student program, I had the option of returning to Korea but I decided to stay in America. I wanted to see new places and meet different people. I applied to several colleges and was accepted into a small liberal arts college in the Midwest. It was a big decision, but I knew it was the right one. I wanted to experience the American college life, and I was excited to meet new people and learn from different professors.\n\nDuring my freshman year, I struggled to adjust to the academic system and language barrier. But with the help of my professors and classmates, I slowly began to find my footing. I joined the international student club and volunteered at a local elementary school, where I helped teach English to young students. It was a rewarding experience, and it reminded me of my time with Cody and the Martinez family.\n\nAs I settled into college life, I began to explore different parts of the country. I visited Chicago with my friends, where we took a stroll along Lake Michigan and tried deep-dish pizza for the first time. I went to New York City with my family, where we saw a Broadway show and walked across the Brooklyn Bridge. I even took a road trip to Yellowstone National Park with my roommate, where we marveled at the geysers and hot springs.\n\nBut no matter where I went, I always carried the lessons I learned from the Watkins and Martinez families with me. They taught me the importance of family, community, and kindness. They showed me that even in a foreign country, I could find a sense of belonging and home.\n\nAfter graduating from college, I decided to stay in America and pursue a career in education. I wanted to make a difference in the lives of young students, just like Michael and Jen had made a difference in mine. I earned a master's degree in education and began teaching English at a high school in a diverse neighborhood.\n\nIt's been over a decade since I first arrived in Wichita, Kansas, but the memories of my time with the Watkins and Martinez families remain vivid in my mind. They were my first friends in America, and they will always be my second family. I'm grateful for the experience of being an exchange student, which opened my eyes to a new world and introduced me to people who would change my life forever.\n\nToday, I'm proud to say that I'm a naturalized American citizen, and I've built a life here that I love. I still keep in touch with the Watkins and Martinez families, and we meet up whenever I'm in Wichita. Cody is now a grown man with a family of his own, and I'm honored to be his friend. Michael and Jen are still teaching, inspiring new generations of students.\n\nAs I look back on my journey, I realize that being an exchange student was just the beginning of my American adventure. It was a chance to discover a new country, a new culture, and a new sense of self. But more than that, it was a chance to form lasting bonds with people who would become my family, my friends, and my community.",

        "Text": "I’ve spent most of my life as an anti-vegetable carboholic. For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. My transformation began with my mom’s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole “vegan” thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as “What the Health” and “Forks Over Knives”. Those documentaries opened my eyes to the harsh realities of the food industry and the devastating impact of animal agriculture on our health, the environment, and animal welfare. I was shocked to learn about the manipulative tactics used by food manufacturers to keep us hooked on their products, and the ways in which the government and big agriculture collude to prioritize profits over people's health.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of plant-based eating, I began to notice changes in my own body. My energy levels increased, my skin cleared up, and I felt more mentally alert and focused. I started to experiment with new recipes and ingredients, and discovered a whole new world of flavors and textures that I had been missing out on. My mom and I would spend hours in the kitchen, cooking up a storm and laughing together as we explored this new culinary landscape.\n\nBut it wasn't all easy. There were challenges and setbacks along the way. I struggled to give up my beloved cheese and dairy products, and I had to navigate social situations where my new dietary choices were met with skepticism or even ridicule. There were times when I felt like I was losing my identity as a foodie, and that I was sacrificing too much by giving up the foods I loved.\n\nDespite these challenges, I persisted. I started to connect with other like-minded individuals online and in my community, and I found a sense of belonging and support that I had been missing. I began to see that this lifestyle change wasn't just about food, but about taking control of my health, my values, and my impact on the world.\n\nAs I continued on this journey, I started to notice the ripple effects of my new lifestyle. My friends and family began to take notice of the changes in me, and they started to ask questions and seek my advice. I started to share my knowledge and experiences with others, and I found that I had a passion for inspiring and empowering others to make positive changes in their own lives.\n\nMy transformation also had a profound impact on my relationship with my mom. We had always been close, but this shared experience brought us even closer together. We bonded over our shared passion for plant-based eating, and we supported each other through the ups and downs of this journey. I was grateful to have her by my side as I navigated this new world, and I was inspired by her courage and determination to take control of her health.\n\nLooking back, I realize that my mom's cancer diagnosis was a wake-up call for both of us. It forced us to re-examine our priorities and values, and to make changes that would have a lasting impact on our lives. I'm grateful for that journey, and for the lessons I learned along the way. I'm proud to say that I'm no longer an anti-vegetable carboholic, but a passionate advocate for the power of plant-based eating to transform our lives and our world.",

        "Text": "Meditation over a flaxen sunset with a friend and parmesan-topped spaghetti for dinner — “14.” Assignments piling up on my desk as a high fever keeps me sick at home — “3.” Taking a photo excursion through downtown Seattle for a Spanish project — “15.” For the past 700 days and counting, the Happiness Spreadsheet has been my digital collection for documenting numerical, descriptive, and graphical representations of my happiness. Its instructions are simple: Open the Google Sheet, enter a number between 1 and 20 that best represents my level of happiness, and write a short comment describing the day. But the practical aspect of the spreadsheet is only a piece of what it has represented in my life. A “14” etched on November 15, 2018, marked the first Lakeside Cooking on the Stove Club meeting. What had started as a farcical proposition of mine transformed into a playground where high school classmates and I convene every two weeks to prepare a savory afternoon snack for ourselves. A few months later, a “16” scribbled on February 27, 2019, marked the completion of a fence my Spanish class and I constructed for the dusty soccer field at a small Colombian village. Hard-fought days of mixing cement and transporting supplies had paid off for the affectionate community we had immediately come to love. These numerical representations of my happiness have become a tangible manifestation of my personal growth, a reminder of the moments that have shaped me into the person I am today. The spreadsheet has also served as a catalyst for self-reflection, encouraging me to acknowledge and appreciate the beauty in the mundane.\n\nAs I scroll through the spreadsheet, I am transported back to memories that would have otherwise been lost in the chaos of everyday life. A \"10\" on a drizzly April morning reminds me of the impromptu picnic my friends and I had in the school courtyard, laughing and joking as we devoured sandwiches and fruit. A \"19\" on a warm summer evening brings back the thrill of watching the fireworks display at the Seattle waterfront, the smell of saltwater and smoke lingering in the air.\n\nThe Happiness Spreadsheet has also helped me develop a greater sense of empathy and understanding. When I'm feeling down, I can look back at the comments and see that even on my worst days, there were moments of joy to be found. It's a powerful reminder that happiness is not a fixed state, but rather a dynamic and ever-changing entity that can be cultivated and nurtured.\n\nMoreover, the spreadsheet has become a symbol of my commitment to living a life of intention and purpose. In a world that often prioritizes productivity and efficiency, it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle and forget to appreciate the little things. The Happiness Spreadsheet is my rebellion against that, a declaration that happiness and joy are worth fighting for.\n\nAs I continue to update the spreadsheet, I am reminded of the power of mindfulness and gratitude. It's easy to get caught up in the negativity and stress that can come with high school life, but the Happiness Spreadsheet encourages me to focus on the positive, to seek out the beauty and joy in every day. And as I look to the future, I know that this habit of reflection and appreciation will serve me well, a reminder to always prioritize my happiness and well-being.",

        "Text": "I sit, cradled by the two largest branches of the Newton Pippin Tree, watching the ether. The Green Mountains of Vermont stretch out indefinitely, and from my elevated vantage point, I feel as though we are peers, motionless in solidarity. I’ve lost my corporeal form and instead, while watching invisible currents drive white leviathans across the sky, have drifted up into the epistemological stream; completely alone with my questions, diving for answers. But a few months ago, I would have considered this an utter waste of time. Prior to attending Mountain School, my paradigm was substantially limited; opinions, prejudices, and ideas shaped by the testosterone-rich environment of Landon School. I was herded by result-oriented, fast-paced, technologically-reliant parameters towards psychology and neuroscience (the NIH, a mere 2.11 mile run from my school, is like a beacon on a hill). I was taught that one’s paramount accomplishment should be specialization. But Mountain School, nestled in the heart of Vermont's wilderness, was a far cry from the fast-paced, tech-driven world I was accustomed to. The rustic, off-the-grid campus, surrounded by dense forests and rolling hills, forced me to confront the limitations of my previous paradigm. Without the constant hum of technology, I was compelled to reevaluate my priorities and question the very notion of success.\n\nAt first, the adjustment was jarring. I felt lost and disconnected, like a sailor without a compass. The absence of concrete goals and tangible outcomes made me anxious, and I struggled to reconcile my desire for knowledge with the school's emphasis on experiential learning. But as the weeks passed, I began to appreciate the beauty of uncertainty. I discovered that the freedom to explore, to meander, and to question was, in fact, a luxury.\n\nMy days at Mountain School were filled with moments of epiphany, like the one I experienced beneath the Newton Pippin Tree. As I sat, suspended between the branches, I realized that the pursuit of knowledge was not a linear journey, but a labyrinthine exploration of the human experience. The trees, the mountains, and the sky became my teachers, imparting lessons on the interconnectedness of all things.\n\nThe more I immersed myself in the natural world, the more I began to see the world in a different light. I started to question the notion that success was synonymous with specialization. I wondered if the relentless pursuit of expertise was not, in fact, a form of intellectual myopia. Was it not possible that the most profound insights lay at the intersections, where disciplines converged and merged?\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of ideas, I discovered a new appreciation for the humanities. I found solace in the words of poets and philosophers, who spoke to the complexities and mysteries of human existence. I began to see that the pursuit of knowledge was not merely about accumulating facts, but about cultivating wisdom, empathy, and understanding.\n\nMy time at Mountain School was a journey of self-discovery, a process of shedding the skin of my old self and emerging anew. It was a reminder that education is not merely about the acquisition of knowledge, but about the cultivation of a curious, open, and receptive mind. As I sit beneath the Newton Pippin Tree, watching the clouds drift lazily across the sky, I am reminded that the greatest accomplishment is not specialization, but the ability to see the world with fresh eyes, to question, and to wonder.",

        "Text": "Before I came to America, I drank Puer Tea with my father every morning in my bedroom, sitting cross-legged on Suzhou-silk mats beside a view of the Lakeside reservoir. Beside a dark end table, we picked up teacups as the mild aroma greeted our noses. As we faced the French window, my father would share the news he read in China Daily: the Syrian civil war, climate change, and gender equality in Hollywood. Most of the time, I only listened. Those morning rituals were a sacred part of my childhood, a time when the world seemed simpler and more innocent. My father's voice would rise and fall as he discussed the news, his tone measured and thoughtful. I would nod along, pretending to understand the complexities of global politics, but in reality, I was more fascinated by the way the sunlight danced through the French window, casting intricate patterns on the floor.\n\nAs I grew older, our morning conversations began to shift. My father would ask me about my day, my interests, and my dreams. I would share with him my passion for literature, my love for Chinese poetry, and my aspirations to become a writer. He would listen intently, his eyes sparkling with pride, and offer words of encouragement. Those moments were precious to me, a time when I felt seen and heard by the person I admired most in the world.\n\nBut life had other plans. I grew up, and my family moved to America. The Lakeside reservoir was replaced by the towering skyscrapers of New York City. The Suzhou-silk mats were swapped for a small, cluttered apartment in Queens. And the morning rituals, once so sacred, began to fade away.\n\nAt first, I tried to hold on to the tradition. I would wake up early, brew a pot of Puer Tea, and sit alone in my small bedroom, staring out the window at the unfamiliar cityscape. But it wasn't the same. The news was different, the language was different, and the world seemed to be spinning at a frantic pace. I felt lost and disconnected, a small boat adrift in a stormy sea.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, I began to lose touch with my father. We would talk on the phone, but the conversations were stilted and awkward. He would ask me about my job, my apartment, and my life in America, but I struggled to find the words to describe the sense of dislocation and disorientation that had taken over my life.\n\nI felt like I was living in two worlds, one foot in China and the other in America. I was torn between the comfort and familiarity of my childhood and the uncertainty and excitement of my new life. I was struggling to find my place in this new world, to find my voice and my identity.\n\nBut as I sat alone in my bedroom, sipping my Puer Tea and staring out the window, I began to realize that my father's lessons had stayed with me. He had taught me to be curious, to be open-minded, and to be brave. He had taught me to face the world with a sense of wonder and a sense of responsibility.\n\nAnd so, I began to rebuild my life, to find my footing in this new world. I started writing again, pouring my thoughts and feelings onto the page. I started exploring the city, discovering new neighborhoods and new cultures. And I started to reconnect with my father, to find common ground in our shared experiences and our shared values.\n\nAs I look back on those morning rituals, I realize that they were more than just a pleasant memory. They were a foundation, a foundation upon which I could build my life. They were a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope, always a chance to start anew. And they were a testament to the power of love and family, a reminder that no matter where life takes us, we are always connected, always bound together by the threads of our shared humanity.",

My story is not one of the typical dancer: I was not the student who couldn’t sit still or pay attention in class, only to find focus and expression through movement. That just isn’t my story. Instead, my journey as a dancer began much later in life, when I was already an adult. I had always been interested in dance, but I never thought I was good enough or had the right body type to pursue it seriously. I was always the observer, watching in awe as dancers glided effortlessly across the stage, their movements seemingly choreographed to perfection.\n\nBut something shifted inside of me when I turned 30. Maybe it was the realization that life is short, and I shouldn't let fear hold me back from trying something I truly loved. Maybe it was the desire to challenge myself and push beyond my comfort zone. Whatever the reason, I finally gathered the courage to sign up for a dance class at a local studio.\n\nAt first, it was intimidating. I felt like I was the only beginner in a sea of seasoned dancers. My body was stiff, my coordination was off, and I struggled to remember even the simplest of steps. But as I continued to attend class, something remarkable happened. I began to feel a sense of freedom and release that I had never experienced before.\n\nDancing allowed me to tap into a part of myself that I never knew existed. It was as if my body had been waiting for this moment, this chance to express itself in a way that was both physical and emotional. I felt like I was unlocking a deep well of creativity and passion that had been hidden beneath the surface.\n\nAs I continued to dance, I began to notice changes in other areas of my life as well. I felt more confident, more self-assured. I carried myself with a newfound sense of pride and poise. I started to see the world in a different light, as if everything was infused with a sense of rhythm and movement.\n\nOf course, there are still days when I feel like I'm not good enough, when I doubt my abilities and wonder why I'm even trying. But those moments are fleeting, because I know that dancing is not just about the steps or the technique – it's about the journey, the process of self-discovery and growth.\n\nAs I look back on my journey as a dancer, I realize that it's not about being a certain type or fitting into a particular mold. It's about embracing my uniqueness, my quirks, and my imperfections. It's about finding my own rhythm, my own style, and my own voice.\n\nAnd so, I'll continue to dance, to move, to express myself in ways that feel authentic and true. I'll continue to push beyond my limits, to challenge myself, and to grow. Because in the end, that's what being a dancer is all about – embracing the beauty of imperfection, and finding freedom in the movement.",

Lovesick teenagers armed with cheesy posters and grocery store flowers. Because at my school, winter is the harbinger of the Winter Formal Dance. a ritual that brings out the most cringe-worthy displays of affection and awkwardness from my fellow students. It's as if the cold weather has somehow awakened a deep-seated desire in them to proclaim their undying love to the world, or at least to their significant other.\n\nAs the days leading up to the dance approach, the hallways of my school transform into a scene from a bad rom-com. Couples cling to each other, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes, completely oblivious to the fact that they're blocking the lockers and causing a human traffic jam. The sound of giggling and whispers of \"I love you, babe\" fills the air, making me want to roll my eyes so hard they get stuck that way.\n\nThe posters, oh the posters. They're the worst. Giant, glittery signs that scream \"Will you go to Winter Formal with me?\" in Comic Sans font, accompanied by a drawing of a heart or a cartoon character. It's like they're trying to outdo each other in a competition of who can be the most creative and over-the-top. Newsflash: it's just a dance, people. Not a marriage proposal.\n\nAnd then there are the flowers. Oh, the flowers. They're always the final nail in the coffin of my sanity. Grocery store bouquets of wilted roses and baby's breath, hastily purchased by desperate suitors trying to impress their dates. They're thrust into the hands of unsuspecting girls, who coo and squeal with delight, completely unaware of the fact that they're holding a symbol of their boyfriend's laziness.\n\nBut despite all the chaos and cheesiness, I have to admit that there's something endearing about Winter Formal. Maybe it's the way the school is transformed into a winter wonderland, complete with twinkling lights and fake snowflakes. Or maybe it's the excitement and anticipation that builds up in the days leading up to the dance.\n\nAs I watch my friends and classmates prepare for the big night, I can't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. Winter Formal may be a bit ridiculous, but it's also a rite of passage, a chance for us to let loose and have fun before the stresses of college applications and final exams take over.\n\nSo, I'll put up with the posters and the flowers, the lovesick gazes and the awkward slow dances. Because in the end, Winter Formal is a reminder that even in the midst of chaos and cringe-worthiness, there's still room for a little bit of magic and romance.",

A few seconds before, I was so excited that it might have seemed as if I was waiting to win the Nobel Prize, instead of an award for my project in mathematics at the Scientific and Research Council of Turkey National Projects Competition. Throughout the 4 days of the Project Fair, I presented my project to over 100 visitors. including judges, teachers, and students from various schools. I had confidently explained the concept, methodology, and results of my project, answering numerous questions and receiving positive feedback from many of them. Therefore, when the winner's name was announced, and it wasn't mine, I felt a pang of disappointment and disillusionment.\n\nAs I walked out of the auditorium, I couldn't help but wonder what had gone wrong. Had my project not been good enough? Had I not presented it well enough? These questions swirled in my mind, making me question my abilities and the effort I had put into my project. I felt like I had let myself and my family down.\n\nBut as I began to reflect on the experience, I realized that the true value of participating in the competition lay not in winning, but in the journey itself. I had spent countless hours researching, experimenting, and refining my project, and in the process, I had learned so much about mathematics, critical thinking, and problem-solving. I had also developed important skills such as communication, time management, and perseverance.\n\nMoreover, the Project Fair had provided me with an opportunity to meet and interact with like-minded individuals who shared my passion for science and mathematics. We had exchanged ideas, discussed our projects, and learned from each other's experiences. These interactions had broadened my perspective and inspired me to continue pursuing my interests in mathematics.\n\nAs I looked back on the four days of the Project Fair, I realized that I had gained so much more than a prize or recognition. I had gained confidence in my abilities, a sense of accomplishment, and a deeper understanding of the importance of perseverance and hard work. I had also learned to appreciate the value of feedback and constructive criticism, which had helped me to refine my project and improve my presentation skills.\n\nIn the days that followed, I received numerous messages of encouragement and support from my teachers, family, and friends. They reminded me that winning was not everything and that the true measure of success lay in the effort and dedication I had put into my project. They encouraged me to continue pursuing my passions and to use this experience as a stepping stone for future success.\n\nAs I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of resilience and perseverance. Life is full of setbacks and disappointments, but it is how we respond to them that matters. We can choose to let them discourage us, or we can use them as opportunities to learn and grow. I am grateful for the experience of participating in the Scientific and Research Council of Turkey National Projects Competition, and I am proud of myself for having the courage to take risks and pursue my dreams, even in the face of disappointment.\n\nIn the end, I realized that winning was not the only measure of success. Success lies in the journey, the learning, and the growth that we experience along the way. It lies in the relationships we build, the skills we develop, and the confidence we gain. And it is these things that will stay with me long after the competition is over, inspiring me to continue pursuing my passions and striving for excellence in all that I do.",

        "Text": "Growing up with a stutter was difficult. My thoughts were always fully formed, but the words would get stuck. The harder I tried to force them out, the more they would jam up, like train cars going off a track. Sometimes kids would laugh or make fun of my stutter, but mostly they just ignored me. They had better things to do than wait to hear my ideas, so they assumed I had none worth hearing. As I grew older, the frustration and embarrassment of having a stutter only intensified. I would avoid speaking up in class, fearing that my classmates would giggle or whisper to each other. I would hesitate to order food at a restaurant, worried that the cashier would misunderstand me or think I was stupid. Even simple conversations with my family became a source of anxiety, as I struggled to articulate my thoughts and feelings.\n\nBut the most painful part of having a stutter was the feeling of being silenced. It was as if my stutter had taken away my voice, my ability to express myself and be heard. I felt like I was living in a world where everyone else had a megaphone, while I was stuck with a whisper. I longed to be able to speak freely, to be able to share my thoughts and ideas without fear of ridicule or judgment.\n\nDespite the challenges, I was determined to overcome my stutter. I began to see a speech therapist, who taught me techniques to slow down my speech and relax my muscles. I practiced every day, repeating words and phrases in front of the mirror, trying to smooth out the rough edges of my speech. It was hard work, but slowly, I began to see progress.\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs came when I discovered the power of writing. I had always loved to write, but I never realized how much it could help me express myself until I started writing regularly. With a pen and paper, I could say everything I wanted to say, without fear of stuttering or being misunderstood. Writing became my sanctuary, my safe space where I could be myself, without apology or explanation.\n\nAs I continued to write, I began to develop a sense of confidence that I had never felt before. I started to see that my stutter didn't define me, that I was more than just my speech. I was a thinker, a writer, a dreamer. I had ideas and opinions, and I was determined to share them with the world.\n\nIn college, I decided to take a public speaking class, despite my initial reservations. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life, but it was also one of the most liberating. For the first time, I was able to stand in front of a group of people and speak freely, without stuttering or apologizing. It was a moment of pure triumph, and it marked a turning point in my life.\n\nToday, I still stutter, but it no longer holds me back. I have learned to accept it as a part of who I am, and to use it as a reminder of my strength and resilience. I have also learned to speak up, to use my voice to advocate for myself and others. I know that my stutter is not a limitation, but rather a unique perspective, a way of seeing the world that is all my own.\n\nAs I look back on my journey, I realize that growing up with a stutter was not easy, but it was worth it. It taught me the value of perseverance, the power of self-expression, and the importance of embracing my differences. It also taught me that my voice matters, that my thoughts and ideas are worth hearing. And for that, I am forever grateful.",

I was afraid but spoke deliberately; fear would not stop me from sharing my first vulnerable poem: …I want my insides—dry, dead wood—to be lit with a match, and no water could ever put me out, no hurricane of sadness, no gentle rainstorm of doubt could stop the heat inside… When finished, I looked up to see unblinking eyes and tears running down my teacher’s face. In that moment, I became a writer. I recited the poem near the end of my creative writing class my sophomore year. Throughout the class, students focused on one genre, and choosing to stay on the safe path, I focused on fiction, which I had written since I could hold a pencil. Although I admired poetry and the way a poet in a few lines could convey the feelings expressed in 300 pages of a novel, it intimidated me. I feared I did not have the skill to craft with such imagery, detail, and purpose. When a poet in my class shared her work, I was taken aback by her striking metaphors and cryptic imagery. But what shocked me most was that she got her message across. Suddenly, I had an epiphany: writing didn’t have to follow all the rules. This realization sparked a newfound curiosity within me, and I began to explore the world of poetry. I started reading the works of renowned poets, analyzing their techniques, and experimenting with different forms and styles. The more I delved into poetry, the more I discovered the freedom it offered. Unlike fiction, where I felt bound by the need to create a cohesive narrative, poetry allowed me to express myself in fragmented thoughts, emotions, and observations.\n\nAs I continued to write poetry, I found that it became an outlet for me to process my emotions, to make sense of the world around me. I wrote about my struggles with anxiety, my relationships, and my observations of the human condition. The act of writing poetry became a form of therapy, a way for me to untangle my thoughts and emotions.\n\nMy teacher's reaction to my first poem had a profound impact on me. It showed me that my words had the power to move people, to evoke emotions and spark connections. It gave me the confidence to continue writing, to take risks, and to push beyond my comfort zone.\n\nThroughout the rest of my sophomore year, I continued to explore poetry, experimenting with different forms and styles. I wrote about the beauty of nature, the complexity of human relationships, and the struggles of growing up. My poetry became a reflection of my own growth, a testament to the power of self-expression.\n\nAs I looked back on that moment when I shared my first poem, I realized that it marked a turning point in my writing journey. It was the moment when I discovered my voice, my passion, and my purpose. I learned that writing wasn't just about following rules or conforming to a particular genre; it was about expressing myself, taking risks, and connecting with others.\n\nIn the end, that 6.3 magnitude earthquake of fear had transformed into a spark of creativity, igniting a fire within me that continues to burn bright. I had discovered my true calling as a writer, and I was determined to fan the flames, to let my words light the way for others, and to inspire them to do the same.",

        "Text": "“How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!” -Homer “D’oh!” -Homer Simpson I’m not a philosopher; eloquence eludes me, the meaning of life is unquestioned, and thinking, beyond what is required to carry out a potential, is postponed to a more leisurely time. I’ve experienced doubt, and proceeded with caution; and in my experience, I’ve learned to discard unnecessary thought and conventional wisdom in favor of progress. Philosophy amounts to nothing unless it results in action. “You’re kidding.” Scanning my schedule, my classmate shakes her head. “Why didn’t you take Dual Credit?” During Junior year, my high school began to incentivize Dual Credit courses with a GPA multiplier. Advertised to be less demanding than an AP class, Dual Credit was extolled as the wise man’s curriculum. But I had other plans. I opted for a vocational program, one that allowed me to work part-time in a field I was passionate about. My classmate's skepticism was understandable; after all, the notion of sacrificing a potentially higher GPA for a \"hands-on\" education seemed illogical. But I had doubts about the conventional path. I questioned the value of accumulating credits and accolades if they didn't translate to real-world skills. I was willing to take a risk, to venture off the beaten path, and to challenge the status quo.\n\nAs I reflect on that decision, I realize that it was a philosophical one. I was choosing to prioritize practicality over prestige, to favor experience over credentials. It wasn't an easy choice, but it was one that aligned with my values and goals. I wasn't concerned with appearing wise or intelligent; I was focused on making progress, on taking action.\n\nPhilosophy, to me, is not about intellectual posturing or theoretical debates. It's about making conscious choices, about questioning assumptions, and about living intentionally. It's about recognizing that doubt is a natural part of the learning process, and that caution can be a catalyst for growth. My decision to forego Dual Credit was not a rejection of academic rigor, but a commitment to a different kind of rigor – one that emphasized application over abstraction.\n\nIn the end, my choice paid off. I gained valuable work experience, developed skills that are still relevant today, and cultivated a sense of purpose that has guided my subsequent decisions. I may not have the highest GPA or the most impressive credentials, but I have something more valuable – a sense of direction, a willingness to challenge convention, and a philosophy that emphasizes action over eloquence.",

        "Text": "Most airplanes are constructed with seats in rows of two or three. Mathematically, that means no matter the configuration, someone in my family of five has to sit by a stranger. Ever since I was little, I always asked to be that person. Perhaps it’s the optimistic middle child in me, but I always considered the greatest possibility was that I could meet someone remarkable, and that the conversation could be anything on the spectrum from slightly interesting to life-changing. From the time I could speak, I began to realize that overcoming communication barriers was an integral key to unlocking the enormous potential in constructing meaningful relationships with others. As I grew older, my enthusiasm for sitting next to strangers on planes only intensified. I would often find myself engaging in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds, occupations, and cultures. These chance encounters not only broadened my perspective but also taught me valuable lessons about empathy, active listening, and the importance of human connection.\n\nOne particular encounter that stands out in my mind was with a retired teacher from Japan. We were on a long-haul flight from New York to Tokyo, and I was initially hesitant to initiate a conversation, fearing that our language barriers would hinder our ability to communicate. However, as we exchanged smiles and introduced ourselves, I discovered that she spoke some English, and we began to chat about our shared love of literature.\n\nAs we delved deeper into conversation, I learned about her experiences teaching in rural Japan, her passion for haiku poetry, and her family's traditions. In turn, she was fascinated by my stories of growing up in a multicultural community in the United States. Our conversation flowed effortlessly, and before I knew it, we had spent hours discussing everything from education reform to our favorite books.\n\nWhat struck me most about this encounter was the way our initial language barriers dissipated as we found common ground. We laughed together, shared stories, and even exchanged contact information, promising to stay in touch. As the plane landed in Tokyo, I felt a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to connect with someone from a different world, someone who had enriched my life in ways I never thought possible.\n\nThese kinds of encounters have taught me that meaningful relationships can be forged in the most unexpected places. They have also instilled in me a sense of curiosity and openness, encouraging me to approach strangers with a willingness to listen and learn. In an era where technology often dominates our interactions, I believe that face-to-face conversations are more crucial than ever.\n\nAs I look back on my experiences, I realize that my enthusiasm for sitting next to strangers on planes has been a catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery. It has allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the world and its diverse inhabitants, to appreciate the beauty of cultural differences, and to recognize the profound impact that a single conversation can have on our lives.\n\nIn a world where division and polarization often dominate the headlines, I believe that these chance encounters can serve as a powerful antidote. By embracing the unknown and engaging with strangers, we can break down barriers, foster empathy, and cultivate a sense of global citizenship.\n\nAs I continue to travel and meet new people, I am reminded of the boundless potential that lies within each conversation. Whether it's a brief exchange or a lifelong connection, every interaction has the power to transform us, to broaden our perspectives, and to inspire us to become better versions of ourselves. And so, I will continue to seek out these opportunities, to sit next to strangers on planes, and to embrace the serendipity that can lead to life-changing conversations.",

        "Text": "When we are small, the world seems infinite. Personally, I believed that Germany was adjacent to Wisconsin until I was 8. But eventually, physical growth lends itself to a greater understanding of the world around us as we become exposed to truths of society. It was easy for me to justify my mom’s long work hours and our pocket-sized apartment filled with black mold when I did not know that everyone else had something “better”—and for me, it never felt like I was worse off, it just felt different. My friend had blue eyes and a house. I had brown eyes and I got free lunch. But as I learned more about the world, I found that those differences became difficult to overlook as people grew up and closed their minds in order to conform to their roles in society. As I navigated the complexities of adolescence, I began to realize that the differences that once seemed trivial were, in fact, indicative of a much larger issue. The disparities in our living situations, our access to resources, and our socioeconomic statuses were not just minor variations, but rather symptoms of a deeply ingrained system of inequality. I started to notice how my friends from more affluent backgrounds would often take their privileges for granted, while I struggled to make ends meet. They would complain about their parents' expensive cars, while I worried about how my mom would afford to fix our broken one.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of social awareness, I became increasingly disillusioned with the notion that everyone had an equal shot at success. The more I learned, the more I realized that the playing field was far from level. I saw how systemic injustices, such as racial profiling and gender discrimination, perpetuated cycles of poverty and marginalization. I saw how the education system, meant to be a great equalizer, was in fact, a reflection of the societal hierarchies that existed outside its walls.\n\nThe more I learned, the more I felt a sense of responsibility to do something about it. I began to volunteer at local organizations that worked to address issues of poverty and inequality. I started to engage in conversations with my peers about the importance of social justice and the need for collective action. But as I did, I encountered a surprising amount of resistance. Many of my friends, who had grown up with the same privileges as me, seemed unwilling to acknowledge the existence of these problems, let alone take action to address them.\n\nIt was as if they had become so comfortable in their own bubbles of privilege that they had forgotten what it was like to walk in someone else's shoes. They would say things like, \"Why can't people just work harder?\" or \"If I can make it, why can't they?\" without stopping to consider the structural barriers that stood in the way of marginalized communities. It was a stark reminder that ignorance is not always a lack of knowledge, but often a refusal to see.\n\nAs I navigated these complex social dynamics, I began to realize that growing up is not just about physical growth, but also about moral growth. It's about recognizing the injustices that exist in the world and taking a stand against them. It's about acknowledging our own privileges and using them to amplify the voices of those who have been silenced. It's about being willing to listen, to learn, and to adapt.\n\nIn the end, it's not about who has blue eyes or brown eyes, who has a house or who gets free lunch. It's about recognizing that we are all human beings, deserving of dignity, respect, and equality. It's about understanding that our differences are not weaknesses, but strengths, and that together, we can create a world that is more just, more compassionate, and more equitable for all.",

        "Text": "In Fyodor Dostoevsky’s, “Crime and Punishment”, the character Sonia is metaphorically linked to Christ. After prostituting herself to feed her family, she covers her head and face in shawls, before lying on her bed face down and sobbing– through this, she is linked to the death of Jesus. Her mother, Katarina, kisses her feet while she sobs, the same way people in the churches of that time wept and kissed at the feet of idols to Christ. In this situation, Dostoevsky is implying that even something such as prostitution that might be deemed a sin can instead be that which allows one to be a Saint. As my mother choked up while I described the above anecdote, I was filled with confusion. As I looked at my mother's tearful eyes, I couldn't help but wonder why this passage had struck a chord with her. Was it the raw emotion that Sonia displayed, or was it the idea that even in the darkest of circumstances, there was a glimmer of hope? My mother, a devout Christian, had always instilled in me the importance of compassion and empathy, but I had never seen her react so strongly to a literary passage before.\n\nAs I pondered this, I began to think about the significance of Sonia's character in the novel. On the surface, she was a prostitute, a social outcast, and a symbol of moral decay. Yet, Dostoevsky had somehow managed to imbue her with a sense of dignity and grace, even in the midst of her desperation. It was as if he was saying that it was not the actions that defined a person, but rather their intentions and motivations.\n\nThis realization struck me as profoundly relevant to our own lives. How often do we judge others based on superficial appearances, without taking the time to understand their struggles and challenges? How often do we assume that someone's mistakes or flaws define their entire being? Sonia's character was a powerful reminder that we are all complex, multifaceted individuals, capable of both good and evil.\n\nAs I looked at my mother, I saw a depth of understanding in her eyes that I had never seen before. It was as if she had been transported back to a time when she, too, had struggled to make ends meet, when she had been forced to make difficult choices to provide for our family. In that moment, I realized that my mother's tears were not just for Sonia, but for all the Sonias of the world, who had been marginalized and stigmatized, yet continued to hold on to their dignity and humanity.\n\nThe passage had unlocked a door in my mind, revealing a world of complexity and nuance that I had previously overlooked. It had shown me that even in the darkest of times, there was always hope, always a chance for redemption and forgiveness. And it had reminded me that, above all, it was our capacity for empathy and compassion that truly defined us as human beings.",

        "Text": "The craft of storytelling, for me, is holy. Looking back on my life, I don’t see one defining moment where I realized that my purpose is to study, compose, and teach story. It’s more like a collection of snapshots whipping by, each one yellowed with age and fingerprints. I remember reading The Empty Space by Peter Brook on theatre theory long into the night, encountering the line, “Drama was exposure, it was confrontation… it led to… an awakening of understanding.” These words were what led me to the discovery of how storytelling is an emotional confrontation between the author and the writing and between the writing and the audience. It’s collision. It’s catharsis. This concept of collision and catharsis has been a guiding force in my creative journey, influencing the way I approach storytelling and teaching others to do the same. I recall the countless hours spent pouring over scripts, novels, and plays, dissecting the narrative structures, character arcs, and thematic resonance. Each new discovery was like uncovering a hidden treasure, illuminating the path forward and deepening my understanding of the craft.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of storytelling, I began to notice the ways in which it permeated every aspect of human experience. From the anecdotes shared around the dinner table to the myths and legends passed down through generations, storytelling is an integral part of our collective DNA. It's how we make sense of the world, how we connect with one another, and how we process the complexities of life.\n\nMy own writing journey has been marked by a series of epiphanies, each one revealing a new facet of the craft. I remember the first time I wrote a character that felt truly alive, their voice and motivations springing forth from the page like a whispered secret. It was as if I had tapped into a hidden reservoir of empathy, and suddenly the world seemed a little more vibrant, a little more real.\n\nAs I continued to hone my skills, I began to notice the ways in which storytelling could be used as a tool for social change. I saw how narratives could challenge our assumptions, spark empathy, and inspire action. I saw how they could give voice to the marginalized, and amplify the silenced. This realization ignited a fire within me, and I knew that I wanted to dedicate my life to helping others harness the power of storytelling.\n\nTeaching has become an integral part of this journey, allowing me to share my passion with others and watch as they, too, discover the transformative power of storytelling. There's something profoundly moving about witnessing a student's breakthrough, seeing the light bulb moment when they grasp a new concept or find their unique voice. It's a reminder that the craft of storytelling is not just about self-expression, but about connection, community, and the exchange of ideas.\n\nAs I look back on my life, I'm struck by the ways in which storytelling has been woven into the fabric of my existence. It's the thread that runs through every moment, every decision, and every interaction. It's the reason I wake up in the morning, eager to create, to teach, and to learn. The craft of storytelling is, indeed, holy – a sacred trust that I'm honored to carry, and one that I will continue to nurture, refine, and share with the world.",
