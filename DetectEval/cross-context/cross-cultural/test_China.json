        "Text": "The 51-50 vote ends Trump's toughest confirmation battle yet. Senate Democrats debated through the night and into Tuesday morning in a last-ditch attempt to derail DeVos, buoyed by support from Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Throughout the fight, Democrats argued they needed \"Just one more!\" to lure away another Republican vote. But Senate Republican leaders succeeded in delivering a victory to Trump in a confirmation fight that very few expected to become as tough as it did. DeVos' poor performance in her confirmation hearing -- punctuated by her suggestion that a school in Wyoming might want to have guns on premises to protect against grizzly bears -- contributed to roaring anger among public school supporters and teachers unions. Even before her hearing, critics pointed to DeVos's lack of experience with public schools and her bankrolling of efforts like school vouchers that could take money from public institutions. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer voiced his displeasure with the vote moments after she was confirmed, tweeting, \"Today @VP Mike Pence did something no one else has ever done: cast the tie breaking vote on his own cabinet nominee.\" Devos tweeted after the vote, \"I appreciate the Senate's diligence & am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. Let's improve options & outcomes for all US students.\" Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN earlier Tuesday that DeVos seemed to have no knowledge of the federal law that protects students with disabilities. \"You put those two things together, lack of compassion for what's happened to places like Sandy Hook and an inability to just understand the basic law around vulnerable students and it was clear at the end of that hearing that this was someone who shouldn't be the secretary of education,\" the Connecticut Democrat said. DeVos' Senate vote comes after a dramatic 24 hours of protest from Democrats inside and outside the Capitol that lasted through the night, into Tuesday morning, with Democratic senators taking shifts in the Senate arguing against DeVos. The delay tactics have succeeded in stalling many of Trump's most important Cabinet picks -- but Senate Republican leaders promised Monday to get votes for four nominees this week: DeVos, Health and Human Services nominee Tom Price, Treasury pick Steven Mnuchin and attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions. Meanwhile, with each passing day, more questions have been raised about Trump's Cabinet picks. Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder admitted Monday to hiring an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper. But Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn promised to overcome Democratic tactics with long hours at the Capitol -- including the possibility of working through Saturday. \"We'll be burning the midnight oil,\" Cornyn said Monday.",

        "Text": "The limited scope of DeVos' education policy experience has raised questions for many about whether she is suited to run the federal agency charged with making American public education first-rate for all children. But there is another subterranean element to this debate, which now should be surfaced, especially given our racially charged environment and the role that segregated schools have long played in our politics. Racial animus was a primary catalyst of the move toward private and religious K-12 education almost 50 years ago, and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling, public and private, today. DeVos' track record suggests that as secretary, she will do little to combat these trends. In the wake of the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which famously declared that separate schools for black and white children were not equal, the federal government began -- albeit slowly -- to desegregate. This applied to schools in the South that were previously forbidden by law from educating children of different races together and to schools in the North plagued by de facto segregation. The backlash, now infamous but perhaps too familiar even today, was fierce. From Alabama Governor George Wallace's stance in the schoolhouse door and his proclamations of \"segregation now, segregation forever\" to Louise Day Hicks leading the Boston antibusing movement, the reaction to desegregation roiled American politics. But the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools. Thus, an estimated half-million white students left public schools between 1964 and 1975 to enroll in schools that were known as \"segregation academies.\" This move to private schools was part of a larger \"white flight\" movement. White flight was one of the greatest demographic shifts in American history. Millions of whites nationwide moved out of cities and into racially isolated suburbs. Scholar Kevin Kruse has called white flight \"the most successful segregationist response to the moral demands of the civil rights movement and the legal authority of the courts.\" The character and quality of most American schools today, like the neighborhoods in which they are found and which they shape, have a racial past. Now, American public schools are falling back into a kind of racial segregation that is reminiscent of our country before Brown. In the last 25 years, the number of severely racially isolated schools, defined as those with 0-10% white students, has tripled. In 2010 in New York City, 92% of black students and 88% of Latino students attended schools that were majority-minority, some of which see such severely racialized and concentrated poverty that they are dubbed \"apartheid schools.\" In DeVos's own state of Michigan, which has seen two decades of charter school growth, enrollment and funding for public schools has waned while schools have become increasingly segregated. Nor does public funding for private schools, which DeVos advocates, seem to achieve much good for students of color. Voucher and other public funding programs are marketed as appealing because tax dollars \"follow the child.\" But research over the past fifteen years shows that private schools are even more racially segregated than public schools. This has negative consequences for both white students and students of color. Research shows that both black children who attend desegregated schools end up with more income, higher wages and better long-term health, with no negative effects on white students. Further, a range of studies strongly suggest that desegregated schools educate all children such that they can better contribute to American society and to a healthier American economy. It is therefore both a moral outrage and an economic mistake that so much of the current movement in favor of school choice and religious education carries the stain of racial animosity, even in dog-whistle form. Of course, many private and religious schools are excellent and inclusive places of learning. But let's not be fooled. School choice is not really about freedom. Freedom, of course, is a bedrock American value. But the kind of \"freedom\" associated with the flight away from integration and toward racial isolation will never lead to a more truly free United States. So as senators consider DeVos' nomination to oversee public education for every American child, they would do well to remember the deepest values of public schooling, as well as the deeper meaning of appointing a Secretary of Education associated with a more exclusive and racially exclusionary vision.",

        "Text": "Khamenei told a gathering of Iran's air force commanders in Tehran that the new US administration has shown the world \"the depth of corruption in US government,\" according to quotes published by Iran's semi-official MEHR news agency. Khamenei reportedly told the commanders: \"We however thank this new guy in the White House, since he largely did the job we had been trying to do in the past decades: to divulge the true face of the US. We had been working to show the world the depth of corruption in US government and ranks and files of the ruling elite; Trump did it in few days after coming to the White House.\" He added: \"Their claims to human rights are no longer tenable.\" Khamenei also made an apparent reference to the five-year-old son of an Iranian mother who was detained at a US airport following Trump's ban on visas for seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. According to Iran's official news agency, IRNA, the Ayatollah said: \"Presently, too, by embarking on such actions, like putting handcuffs on a five-year-old kid, he [Trump] is demonstrating the reality behind the American human rights.\" Khamenei's comments come amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US since Trump became president. The travel ban and sanctions enacted by the Trump administration, coupled with missile testing by Iran, have contributed to the deteriorating relationship. Concerns have been raised over the future of a deal, brokered by the Obama administration, that requires Iran to heavily restrict its nuclear program. On Saturday, a day after the Trump administration imposed fresh sanctions over an Iranian ballistic missile test, US Defense Secretary James Mattis called Iran \"the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\" Two days earlier, Trump had tweeted that \"Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE\" and should have been \"thankful\" for the \"terrible deal\" brokered by the Obama administration. He declined to rule out military action against Iran. But a senior Iranian adviser to the Ayatollah, Ali Akbar Velayati, dismissed Trump's remarks as \"baseless ranting.\" And this is not the first time that the Ayatollah has spoken in such terms about the US President. In November, during the election race, Khamenei lambasted both Trump and Hillary Clinton for revealing what he called the moral shortcomings of the US.",

        "Text": "In an 11-minute recording, AQAP leader Qassim al-Rimi condemned the January 29 raid, saying, \"The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.\" The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. In the recording, Rimi also claimed \"dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,\" a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week's raid. Trump is using Obama as a security blanket Civilian deaths Reportedly among the dead was the 8-year-old the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late US-born cleric who directed attacks against the United States. Awlaki was killed in 2011. Reprieve, a London-based nongovernmental organization, and a Sanaa-based human rights worker told CNN that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. \"When the Americans escaped, they dragged their killed and wounded, and they found no other alternative but to destroy their own planes so that it would not be proof of their scandal,\" Rimi said. The senior US military official told CNN on Monday that intelligence collection wasn't the only objective of the Yemen raid but that it had also targeted Rimi. In the event Rimi wasn't there, the US military believed it would find intelligence that would help lead to him, the official said. Green-lighting the mission was not dependent on al-Rimi being there, however, a senior US military official emphasized. But US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, had strongly disputed that Rimi was the objective of the raid more than a week ago. \"It wasn't a high-value target mission,\" Col. John Thomas told CNN, referring to operations aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas added no hard intelligence indicated a \"high possibility\" Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, saying that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an intelligence-gathering operation. \"Anyone found on site would have been taken,\" Thomas said. NBC first reported that Rimi was a target of the raid. The chance to take out such a pivotal member of al Qaeda may explain the large allocation of resources used in the mission. Military botches release of video seized in Yemen raid Raid missteps Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Following news of the raid, the military had said the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. On Friday, the Pentagon released clips from an al Qaeda training video seized during the raid but later pulled them because the video was nearly a decade old. Government officials previously told CNN plans for the raid had been in the works for months and that Trump green-lighted the mission shortly after his inauguration. How Donald Trump's first military action went from the Obama White House to deadly raid The Pentagon said the battle resulted in the deaths of 14 al Qaeda fighters, including two AQAP leaders. Many observers have considered al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula among the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, branch of al Qaeda since its formation in 2009. Rimi reportedly became its leader following a 2015 drone strike that killed Nasir al-Wuhayshi.",

        "Text": "On Monday, the White House issued a list of 78 terror attacks to underscore President Donald Trump's assertion that the media is failing to adequately report them. Trump told enlisted service-members at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida that attacks were happening \"all over Europe\" and that \"it's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported.\" \"And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that,\" Trump added. Later, the White House distributed a list of the attacks Trump was citing, saying \"most did not receive adequate attention.\" \"Below is a list of 78 major terrorist attacks targeting the West that were executed or inspired by ISIS since September 2014, soon after the terror group declared its caliphate. Most of these attacks did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources,\" a White House official said on background, when distributing the list. But reporters in print, on air and on social media have robustly covered many of those attacks and terror in general. \"As a journalist I'm really troubled by that,\" Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said on CNN's \"The Lead\" on Monday, responding to Trump's initial statement. \"We have brave colleagues who everyday are taking big risks to cover these stories. Look at The New York Times, which the President demonizes often. The New York Times this weekend had an outstanding piece of reporting about how ISIS has been reaching out, is more involved in some attacks in Europe and abroad,\" he said. Ignatius said he has about 100 examples of strong reporting he'd like to show the President. CNN's Anderson Cooper also highlighted his coverage of many of the events listed. \"Not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list the White House has released, we covered them heavily. I know because I was there on the ground reporting a number of them,\" he said Monday night, before showing footage of himself reporting from Ottawa, Canada, in 2014; Paris in November 2015; San Bernardino, California, in 2015; in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He added: \"To be sure, we as a program did not cover each and every incident on the list, however other programs, as well as CNN International covered most if not all of them, many of them exhaustively.\" The attacks listed span from September 2014 to December 2016, and include the Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting, the truck attacks in Nice and Berlin, the Brussels airport attack, the Istanbul airport and Sultanahmet attacks, and the Sydney siege. But the White House only mentions attacks that appear to have been carried out with Islamist motives and omits other terror operations. It does not mention the recent attack on a mosque in Quebec City, or the racially motivated attack by Dylann Roof on a church in South Carolina, in which nine black worshipers were shot dead. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters after Trump's statement that the President \"felt as though members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage.\" Trump has used terror attacks to justify his controversial temporary ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the US. He has also repeatedly referred to media organizations critical of him as \"fake news.\"",

        "Text": "The lawsuit, brought by attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, has captivated the nation since last Friday when a federal district court judge put a stop to Trump's executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals, and as a result, temporarily opened US borders to immigrants once again. The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here's what to listen for: What's the hearing about? US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump's executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions. The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban. No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far. The players The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, Lori Swanson. The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, DC. The randomly assigned three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. When is this hearing? The appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET. It will be available for live streaming through the court's website. Each side will get 30 minutes to make their case. What are the states saying? On Monday attorneys for the states that filed the lawsuit submitted their brief urging the appellate court to keep the travel ban suspension in place. The states say that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President had \"unleashed chaos\" by signing the order. They also argue that the government's claim -- that it would be \"irreparably harmed\" by keeping Robart's temporary suspension order in place while the case proceeds to the merits -- doesn't make any sense. To accept DOJ's position, they argue, \"would mean that until the (Executive) Order was issued, Defendants were suffering some, unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. That makes no sense. ...Preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties.\" What is the Trump administration's argument? The government submitted its own brief in response Monday evening. DOJ continues to emphasize that the states do not have the ability to sue in this case and a district court judge does not have the right to second-guess the President's national security judgment in the immigration context. But the government also raised a fallback argument in its latest court filing -- suggesting if the appellate court is inclined to uphold the Seattle district court's decision, then it must at least limit it to the class of people who have been previously admitted to the US -- like someone traveling on a student visa. In the government's view, aliens outside of the US who have never stepped foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the US. What happens next? The judges have a number of different options at their disposal to resolve this case, but it is unlikely that they would rule on whether the ban is constitutional (since that is not the question before them) -- the central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now. For example, the judges could dismiss DOJ's request for a stay of Robart's decision because, as the government acknowledges, temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable, or they could uphold his ruling -- but under either scenario the suspension of the ban would remain in place while the case moves forward with further scheduled hearings. Alternatively, the appellate court could find Robart abused his discretion and overreached to include classes of people not protected under the Constitution (e.g., aliens living abroad) -- in which case the travel ban would go back into effect. After the three-judge panel publishes its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case by the full appellate court (but is not required to do so in order to get the case in front of the Supreme Court). Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit, it is expected that whoever ultimately loses before the Ninth Circuit will most likely appeal to the Supreme Court. At the moment, there are only eight justices on the court, meaning if there is a 4-4 split then the Ninth Circuit's ruling will be the law of the land.",

        "Text": "President Klaus Iohannis said it is time for Romania to decide whether it wants to be a \"strong prosperous\" nation or a \"weak despised one\" -- and he called for a referendum so the people can have their say. Half a million citizens took to the streets on Sunday in the largest of a series of demonstrations over a bill that would have protected many politicians from being prosecuted for corruption. The Social Democrat-led government announced that day in a statement that it was repealing the decree, which had been approved last week without input from Parliament. However, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu indicated that he still planned to push through the amendments to the criminal codes via legislation that would be put to Parliament for approval. Protests continued over the issue Monday night -- albeit on a smaller scale -- with calls for the government to be removed. 'Transparent government' In his speech on Tuesday, Iohannis, a former National Liberal Party politician, said withdrawing the decree is too little. Although he stopped short of calling for a fresh election, he told members of the center-left government, which has been in power since December, \"Your first worry was to take care of the files of the convicted (politicians). Romanians are appalled. \"The withdrawal of Ordnance 13 is too little. Early elections, at this point, is too much. Who needs to come up with a solution? The Social Democrats, as they created the problem.\" At this point, members of the governing coalition -- made up of the Social Democrats and a smaller party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, walked out of the room. \"Are you already tired?\" asked the President. \"Too bad. Romania needs a strong government, a transparent one, whose governing is predictable, done in broad daylight, not stealthily at night.\" He went on to ask, \"What kind of nation do we want to be? Do we want to be a strong, prosperous one, which builds a rule of law and respects it, where justice is strong and independent? Or do we want to be a weak nation, despised, which risks everything to save a few from difficult times?\" This, he said, would be the \"question and the purpose\" of a referendum, which would \"really find out the will of the Romanian people.\" Demonstrations continue Around 25,000 demonstrators gathered in Victory Square, Bucharest, on Monday evening and around 20,000 elsewhere in the country, according to estimates by the Romanian media. Although they turned out in far smaller numbers than Sunday, they continued to call for the government to resign. A counter-demonstration with about 3,000 people gathered outside the presidential palace in support of the government, calling for Iohannis to resign. Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Vlad Mixich, a Romanian journalist and political commentator, said of the President's address to Parliament, \"He talked mainly to the people who protested in the last week in the streets. I think it was important for him to do that. \"This was one of the biggest protests in Romania since (the fall of communism in) 1989. So he had to speak directly to those people who were in the streets to protest even if the protesters don't perceive the President as their leader\".\" Mixich said the referendum suggested by the President \"would be a symbolic gesture. One of the type that politicians love so much -- it will keep this topic on the table.\" A brighter future \"The protests won't stop until some of the ministers will quit their jobs. We've had enough of them,\" said Bianca Dumitru, 25, a sports journalist who joined protests in her home town of Brasov, central Romania. \"The last week was incredible for the whole country. We got so united and motivated that we have to thank the government for this. But I think it's time for them to let us enjoy the victory and live in a prosperous environment, with a bright future ahead.\" Parliament is due on Wednesday to debate a censure motion submitted by the opposition in a bid to remove the government from office. This is not expected to succeed, as the coalition holds a majority in the legislative body.",

        "Text": "Before returning to Washington, the former president dove into an aquatic and athletic challenge with his friend, Virgin Group founder and billionaire Richard Branson, while vacationing on the British Virgin Islands with former first lady Michelle Obama. Now that Obama is free from many Secret Service-imposed restrictions that did not allow him to partake in activities like surfing, Branson offered Obama the chance to learn how to kitesurf. But to make things more interesting, Branson took on a challenge of his own. \"We decided to set up a friendly challenge: Could Barack learn to kitesurf before I learned to foilboard? We agreed to have a final day battle to see who could stay up the longest,\" Branson wrote in a post on Virgin.com. Kitesurfing is riding on a surfboard while holding onto a kite and foilboarding is riding a surfboard with a hydrofoil that goes into the water lifts the board above the surface. Following a few days of training, the challenge was on and Obama kitesurfed his way to victory. \"We were neck and neck until the last run on the last day, when I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 metres, three feet above the water,\" Branson wrote. \"I was feeling very pleased with myself, only to look over and see Barack go 100 metres on his kiteboard! I had to doff my cap to him and celebrate his victory.\"",

        "Text": "And it's been this way for more than a century. But a new injectable gel that blocks sperm inside the body, preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through, has proved effective in trials using monkeys. The researchers behind the product, known as Vasalgel, hope it could get trials in humans within a few years. \"What was important here was that this worked and was safe in animals similar to humans,\" said Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, the medical research organization behind Vasalgel that is also leading the trials. A new study, published Tuesday, involved 16 male monkeys receiving injections of Vasalgel who were released into social outdoor housing with females. Any adverse effects, as well as their ability to impregnate females, was compared with a historical sample of monkeys that had received vasectomies. \"It was a simple efficacy study,\" Lissner said, meaning the researchers merely set out to see whether the gel was safe and worked to prevent pregnancy. The social groups were monitored for at least one breeding season, and the team reported in its paper that none of the females in the group conceived during that time. One monkey had the gel inserted incorrectly, and another developed a sperm granuloma, or lump of sperm, but the majority tolerated the gel and saw little inflammation, Lissner said, adding that rates of granuloma and inflammation are usually higher after a vasectomy. Lissner's team is hoping to conduct clinical trials in humans next year and plans to stage further animal trials this year in preparation. But although the gel worked well in monkeys, it won't necessarily translate perfectly to humans. \"This is a bigger, longer task than we first anticipated,\" Lissner said. Stopping sperm in their tracks Administering Vasalgel inside a man, or a monkey, involves a polymer injected into the sperm-carrying tubes between the testicles and penis, known as the vas deferens, to block sperm as they are released. The injection is given under anesthetic and mimics the effect of a vasectomy, but without the snip. \"It's a sticky gel that goes into (the tubes) and basically filters out sperm,\" Lissner said. A similar polymer called RISUG is being trialled in India and has proved effective in men. The new gel is injected in a location similar to that cut during a vasectomy and allows fluids through while blocking sperm. The backed-up sperm are then reabsorbed by the body. A further benefit is that -- unlike with a vasectomy -- the gel is meant to disintegrate when a second solution is injected to break down the barrier and flush it out. This would make the process reversible. Reversibility was shown in trials on rabbits, but it was not tested in the new trial on monkeys. Recent trials on baboons also failed to reverse the effect. \"Successful reversibility will be the key to make this world-changing,\" Lissner said. Invasive procedure A further factor likely to impact numbers using this method is that Vasalgel still involves minor surgery to pull out the sperm tubes and inject the gel. What's more, when sperm are reabsorbed into the body, there is a risk of an immune reaction, potentially leaving men less fertile after reversal -- similar to vasectomy, though risks with the gel are lower, according to Lissner. \"Fifty percent of men after a vasectomy reversal remain infertile,\" said Dr. Ilpo Huhtaniemi, emeritus professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the new study. However, he points out that this doesn't prevent men from having children, as sperm can still be collected and used for in-vitro fertilization. The latest evidence on monkeys has many hoping a new form of contraceptive may be on the horizon, but experts believe more evidence is first needed on its reversibility. \"In order for it to have a chance of replacing the traditional surgical method of vasectomy, the authors need to show that the procedure is reversible, and it's reassuring that apparently such studies are ongoing,\" said Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who was also not involved in the new research. \"The idea of trying to replace the traditional method of vasectomy by inserting a gel into the tube which carries sperm from the testicles to the penis at ejaculation is not a new one. However, we haven't seen much progress in developing the idea in recent years, so this study is a useful step in the right direction.\" A male hormonal birth control injection was shown to prevent pregnancy in a 2016 study but was ended early due to side effects. Other approaches have involved strategies to control the production of sperm by targeting the hormone testosterone, but this had side effects of depression and weight gain. In 2015, Japanese scientists discovered a protein, calcineurin, found to be crucial in helping sperm swim and break through the membrane of a female egg in order to fertilize it. When the genes behind this protein were blocked during studies in mice, they became infertile. But Vasalgel is further along than the Japanese research and has not shown severe side effects in animals. Lissner is confident that her team's gel will overcome the challenges. She sees value in providing birth control that does not interfere with hormones. \"Why manipulate the whole body when there's a small tube that all the sperm swim through?\" she asked. Huhtaniemi agrees that Vasalgel could be valuable in certain populations but feels that in terms of birth control for the masses, a less-invasive option is needed. \"We need a pill. That's the easiest to administer,\" he said. \"It is feasible. We just need to find the right target.\"",

        "Text": "New Zealand Rugby had reported that a room had been bugged in Sydney's Double Bay Intercontinental Hotel, where the All Blacks held meetings before August's Bledisloe Cup clash with the Wallabies. New South Wales police said Tuesday that a 51-year-old man, who was employed as a security consultant at the time of the alleged offense, had been charged with public mischief. He will appear in court on March 21. READ: 'Invictus' legend dies aged 45 All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen described the charge as \"bizarre\" and \"unbelievable.\" \"The charged man has worked for the All Blacks, and many other organizations, for a long time and is someone who is well respected by us,\" the 57-year-old said in a statement released by New Zealand Rugby. \"However, as with all cases before the courts, there has to be a due process that takes place and it is not right or proper for us to make any further comment as this could jeopardize the outcome of the case.\" READ: The double life of 'Super Maro' READ: Record-breaking All Blacks sidestep 'clown affair' READ: NZ star apologizes after airport toilet incident 'Still leaves a bitter taste' Bill Pulver, chief executive of Australia Rugby Union (ARU), praised the police. \"The aspect that still leaves a bitter taste out of this whole affair is that the discovery of the device was reported publicly on game day, when it is understood that the alleged discovery of the device occurred much earlier in the week leading up to the Test match,\" he said in a statement. \"Clearly the media attention which resulted from it was a distraction that neither team needed on the morning of a very important Test match. \"The ARU and the Wallabies were never accused of any wrongdoing, however it was still important that this matter reached a conclusion to provide complete reassurance to all fans that the organization and the team had no part in any of this. \"There may be some questions that remain but certainly today's news is welcome news that an individual has been called to account over this incident.\" READ: NZ legend McCaw ends career Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos The All Blacks, ranked the world's best rugby union team, went on to beat Australia 42-8 in the match to record their biggest win over the Wallabies on Australian soil in 113 years.

        "Text": "Doctors in the hospital where Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, is being treated say they still \"have no real idea\" what caused his illness, but agree a \"toxic substance\" is to blame, his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told CNN. Kara-Murza's wife, Yevgenia, told CNN that doctors have tried to bring her husband out of a medically-induced coma but that when they did so, he \"had almost no reaction at all, except to his name being called.\" He is currently on dialysis and artificial ventilation. She said doctors have diagnosed him with \"acute intoxication by an unidentified substance\" and that there is \"no prognosis,\" adding that the risks are now more serious due to his previous illness. Prokhorov told CNN that an investigator from the Khamovniki district of Moscow contacted him last Friday to inquire about the circumstances which led to Kara-Murza's hospitalization, but has not received any further updates about the ongoing investigation. \"The problem is that they are not paying any real attention to this,\" Prokhorov said. \"The investigative committee is only interested in this situation because of the media coverage.\" He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in Kara-Murza's 2015 illness. Moscow denies involvement in 2015 health scare CNN spoke to Kara-Murza in 2015, months after a mysterious illness nearly killed him. \"I fell into a coma, all of my major organs began failing, one after another. It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver,\" he said at the time. He said he believed his 2015 suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack. \"Frankly there is no other possible reason,\" he said. \"I don't have any money dealings. I don't have any personal enemies. I didn't steal anybody's wife.\" The case had parallels with the killing of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko in London. A British public inquiry into that 2006 poisoning found two former Russian agents responsible for carrying out the poisoning with the radioactive isotope Polonium-210. Its final report concluded that Putin was \"probably\" aware of the operation. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated and the Kremlin said Russia wasn't involved. In February 2015, a leading Russian opposition figure and friend of Kara-Murza, Boris Nemtsov, was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. US lawmakers urge investigation Kara-Murza's hospitalization has triggered an outcry from US lawmakers, who have called on the Trump administration to speak out on his behalf. US Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said Putin should be held accountable if there is evidence the government poisoned Kara-Murza. \"Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime,\" said Rubio, a frequent Putin critic. \"I am praying that Kara-Murza's condition improves.\" He urged the White House and the State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. Kara-Murza, who splits his time between Russia and his family home in Virginia, is a dual Russian-British citizen. He is part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. When he fell ill last week, Kara-Murza was touring Russia for screenings of a documentary about Nemtsov.",

        "Text": "The law, called the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, was passed and signed by Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and goes into effect later this year. It prohibits dismemberment abortion, the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. A clause in the law states that the husband of a woman getting the abortion can sue the doctor to stop his wife's abortion. The husband has to be the father of the child. And because there's no exemption in the law for rape or incest, a woman's rapist could theoretically file suit to stop the abortion. The ACLU of Arkansas claims the law is unconstitutional and plans to challenge it in court before it goes into effect. One Arkansas lawmaker said there wasn't much debate about those parts of the law. \"It was not something that was talked about on the Senate floor,\" Arkansas state Sen. Joyce Elliott told CNN affiliate KARK. \"If we cannot make headway on something like an exception for rape and incest, I think it just felt kind of fruitless to make some sense out of the rest of what was in the bill.\" Elliott added, \"They don't see the outrage in constantly putting the thumb on women to dictate what they can do and not do.\" But another lawmaker believes husbands should have a voice in these decisions. \"I think a woman does have control over her own body, but when you have created a life, you created a life with someone else,\" said state Sen. Missy Irvin. Kansas and Oklahoma passed similar abortion laws which are tied up in the courts, according to CNN affiliate KFSM. A few states, with conservative lawmakers emboldened by Donald Trump's election, have passed strict new abortion laws, including Ohio, which passed a measure banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.",

        "Text": "Japan controls the chain and calls them the Senkaku Islands, while China calls them the Diaoyu Islands. The sailing comes just days after US Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed America's commitment to defending Japan and its disputed islands. According to Japanese broadcaster NHK, protests were lodged with the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and in Beijing through the Japanese Embassy. Tensions have flashed numerous times in recent years over the disputed islands,-including face-offs between Japanese and Chinese air and naval forces-that have been termed dangerous by both sides. EXPLAINER: How an uninhabited island chain split Japan and China China's State Oceanic Administration, which oversees the country's Coast Guard, put out a statement late Monday saying the three ships \"cruised within China's Diaoyu Islands territorial sea.\" China's Defense Ministry, which is separate from the Oceanic Administration, posted a statement on its website confirming the Coast Guard ship movement. Japan's Coast Guard said the Chinese vessels spent two hours in Japanese territorial waters. It was the fourth time Chinese ships have entered Japan's waters this year, the Japanese Coast Guard said. There were 36 such incidents in 2016, it said. Despite the frequency of the Chinese sailings, experts said having one so soon after Mattis' visit to Japan sent a subtle message to both Tokyo and Washington. \"It is both a signal that China won't be intimidated from defending its interests/claims and a test to see how the new (Trump) administration responds,\" said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center. Denny Roy, an Asian security expert at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said ship movements in disputed waters could result in a shooting incident. \"The danger is especially high considering military personnel on both sides are often eager to demonstrate their determination to defend what they consider national territory,\" Roy said. And a China-Japan military confrontation could bring US forces into play. During a press conference Saturday in Tokyo, Mattis said the US would defend the islands with Japan. \"I made clear that our long-standing policy on the Senkaku Islands stands -- the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and as such Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies,\" Mattis said in an appearance with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. The US position was reinforced Tuesday in a phone call between Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a statement from Japan's Foreign Ministry. \"The United States will be against any unilateral action made to damage the Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands,\" Tillerson stated during the call, according to the Japanese statement. China responded quickly on Saturday to the US stance on the islands, saying it brings instability to the region. \"Diaoyu and its affiliated islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. These are historical facts that cannot be changed. The so-called US-Japan security treaty was a product of the Cold War, and it should not harm China's territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement. \"We urge the US side to adopt a responsible attitude and stop making wrong remarks on the issue of the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands,\" Lu said. The US commitment to the Senkakus is not new. In 2014, the Obama administration also said the remote chain fell under the treaty. In late 2013, China-declared an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over much of the East China Sea, including the Senkakus, despite objections from Tokyo and Washington. Japan also has an ADIZ over the islands. Although the Senkakus are uninhabited, their ownership would allow for exclusive oil, mineral and fishing rights in the surrounding waters. While the Senkakus remain a source of friction in the US-China relationship, Mattis' visit seemed to have soothed relations a bit in another area, the South China Sea. Although the US defense chief said \"China has shredded the trust of nations in the region\" by fortifying disputed South China Sea islands, Mattis also said no increased US military maneuvers there were needed. Lu, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, on Monday welcomed that stance. \"As for Mattis' comment that there is no need for large-scale military operations in the area and the issue should be resolved through diplomacy, these remarks deserve our affirmation,\" Lu said.",

        "Text": "A suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a parking near the court in the Afghan capital, according to Basir Mojahid, spokesman for Kabul's chief of police. The attack at around 3:45 p.m. local time targeted Supreme Court employees as they were leaving for the day, Mojahid said. At least 35 people were wounded in the blast, according to Saleem Rasooli, head of Kabul hospitals. There have been no initial claims of responsibility. An eyewitness told CNN that he felt the explosion shake the ground as he was leaving his office, opposite the Supreme Court. Nimatullah Mati said the area is home to several residential apartments and was crowded Tuesday afternoon with people who were heading home from work. Ambulances and firetrucks arrived on the scene within five minutes, Mati said. Afghanistan's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, expressed his condolences on Twitter. \"The blood of our people isn't cheap & won't be wasted,\" he said. NATO also condemned the attack. \"Anyone who seeks to destabilize the pillars of a functioning government are enemies of Afghanistan,\" Italian army Lt. Gen. Rosario Castellano, deputy commander of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement. The blast comes a month after at least 36 people were killed and dozens wounded in two suicide bombings near the Afghan Parliament in Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for those January 10 attacks. Tuesday's blast underscores the growing concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, where the country's security forces and its international allies have been fighting Taliban militants and other radical groups for years. A new report Monday from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said more than 11,000 people were killed or injured in 2016. That's the highest number of civilian casualties in a single year since the United Nations began systemically documenting those in 2009. The report also shows a record spike in the number of children killed in the long-running Afghanistan War. Of the 3,498 killed last year, 923 were children, the report said. Anti-government forces, mainly the Taliban, were behind almost two-thirds of the casualties, according to the report. ISIS militants have established a presence in the country, and their attacks particularly target Shia Muslims, the report said.",

        "Text": "The human rights group says as many as 13,000 people have been executed at Saydnaya prison, north of the capital Damascus in a \"hidden\" campaign authorized by senior regime figures. Amnesty's report, Human slaughterhouse, says prisoners are moved in the middle of the night from their cells under the pretext of being transferred. They are taken to the grounds of the prison, where they are hanged, likely unaware of their fate until they feel the noose around their neck, Amnesty alleges. The report is the culmination of a year-long investigation, including interviews with 84 witnesses including security guards, detainees, judges and lawyers, Amnesty says. Most of those hanged were civilians \"believed to be opposed to the government,\" the report finds. \"The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" Lynn Maalouf, the deputy director for research at Amnesty's Beirut office, said in a statement announcing the report. Amnesty International says there are two detention centers at Saydnaya prison. In the \"red building,\" the majority of detainees are civilians who have been arrested since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, according to the organization. In the \"white building,\" the detainees are mainly military officers and soldiers. CNN has asked the Syrian government for comment. The report contends that the executed detainees were given a sham trial by \"a so-called Military Field Court.\" \"The judge will ask the name of the detainee and whether he committed the crime. Whether the answer is yes or no, he will be convicted ... This court has no relation with the rule of law. This is not a court,\" a former judge said, according to Amnesty. Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty International researcher, elaborated on the horrific conditions prisoners allegedly face. \"They have been actually dying in massive numbers as a result of repeated torture in combination with the systematic deprivation of food, water, medicine and medical care,\" she told CNN. \"(The report) has gotten the attention it deserved,\" Waldman said. \"It's a big story. But for people who work on Syria, it was almost a test case for 'Does the world still care, not just about death but the fact that it was organized, systematic?'\" In light of its findings, she said Amnesty is calling for investigation without delay and for the UN to act immediately. \"I want to be very clear that these practices are unacceptable, and they have to stop. They have to be brought to an end. Mass killings of civilians and extermination so that people are dying of starvation, of illness, of treatable diseases must stop, and Russia has a very special responsibility to uphold peace and security in the world,\" Waldman said. \"We are calling on them to use their influence with the Syrian authorities to push for access to independent monitors to all of the prisons in Syria run by the government where these atrocities are taking place so the perpetrators can be held to account.\" Speaking at the UN, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Peter Wilson responded to the report's allegations. \"We have seen the report of Amnesty International on atrocities in Syria,\" he said. \"Our foreign secretary has said he is sickened by that report. We strongly condemn these atrocities, and we continue to effort to shine a light on what's happening in Syria and to hold people accountable for these actions.\" 'Just a headline' President Assad's regime has previously been accused of extrajudicial killings and war crimes during the country's civil war, which broke out in 2011. In 2014, CNN was given a copy of a report that found \"direct evidence\" of \"systematic torture and killing\" by the Syrian government, based on photographs leaked by a Syrian defector. One of the report's authors called it a \"smoking gun\" proving the use of torture. But Assad has steadfastly maintained that many of the accusations leveled against him are politically motivated. \"I'm just a headline -- the bad president, the bad guy, who is killing the good guys,\" Assad told a group of western visitors, including The New York Times, in November. \"You know this narrative. The real reason is toppling the government. This government doesn't fit the criteria of the United States.\" The UN estimates that about 400,000 people have been killed since the start of the war and another 4.8 million have fled the country.",

Nobody is retouched -- what you see is what you get,\" Schoeller explained to CNN Style show presenter Derek Blasberg. By treating each portrait in the same way, regardless of the subject, Schoeller attempts to find some truth in what he feels can be a very dishonest medium. \"I do think all photographs lie. I don't think there is one picture that is really honest. You can't describe a person in a split second, but maybe in the grand scheme of photography, I think there are some pictures that are more honest than others, you know? So I'm trying to steer to the little bit more honest side of the spectrum,\" he said. Out of the thousands of people he has photographed, who does Schoeller find the most challenging to photograph? \"Actors in general are difficult to shoot because they are always acting.

        "Text": "It's a chilling prospect and it's just the beginning of the men's downhill course in St. Moritz. The start hut is cut into a rock face and the slick slope is so steep -- 100% or 45 degrees -- TV cameramen must abseil into positions wearing crampons. But the one skier able to conquer their fear and harness this breakneck speed will be crowned world downhill champion for the next two years. The race is the highlight of the 2017 World Championships, which start this week in the chic Swiss town. St. Moritz, the jewel of the Engadin valley, has been a longtime destination for the jetset and draws a well-heeled international clientele to its fine-dining restaurants and five-star hotels.  Often dubbed the \"home of winter sports,\" St. Moritz has hosted two Winter Olympics and four previous World Championships. A total of 600 athletes from more than 70 countries will compete across six alpine skiing disciplines -- slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill, super combined (downhill and slalom) and the team event. Outside of the Olympics, it's the biggest event in the sport and carries more cachet than the World Cup circuit. \"It's winning, basically, the Olympics minus all the other sports -- that's what the World Championships is for us. It's big,\" Mikaela Shiffrin, who leads the World Cup overall and slalom standings, told CNN's Alpine Edge. The 21-year-old American is going for a third straight slalom world title after winning gold in Schladming in 2013 and Beaver Creek two years ago. She also won the Olympic slalom gold in 2014, and is aware she has set herself a very high benchmark. \"Not winning stinks -- it makes me feel like I've done something wrong,\" Shiffrin adds. But the headline attraction will be her compatriot Lindsey Vonn, the second most successful ski racer of all time -- male or female -- with 77 World Cup wins, behind only Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark (86). Speed queen Vonn, the 2010 Olympic downhill champion, won her only world title in 2009 and is back on the circuit following a broken arm and severe nerve damage to her right hand sustained in a crash shortly after returning from knee surgery. Vonn won in only her second race since returning to the circuit in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany in January, but crashed in a downhill at Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy this month. In St. Moritz Tuesday, she skied out during the opening run of the World Championships' first race -- the women's super-G -- after trying to regain grip on her pole. \"I just kind of lost my concentration there for a minute,\" Vonn, the 2015 bronze medalist, told reporters. \"I stayed on my feet, so that was the important thing.\" Austria's Nicole Schmidhofer won the gold medal from Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein and home favorite Lara Gut in perfect conditions, after two days of heavy snow had canceled the men's and women's downhill training sessions. Defending champion and Olympic gold medalist Anna Veith didn't make the second run after missing a gate. The women's downhill start is lower than the men's but still a considerable test of skill and stamina. Vonn's main rivals on Sunday will be World Cup overall champion Gut and Slovenia's Ilka Stuhec, this season's World Cup downhill leader. Another Slovenian Tina Maze, who has since retired, won the world title in 2015. The men's downhill takes place Saturday on the legendary \"Free Fall\" course, which was dreamed up by Bernhard Russi, the Swiss two-time downhill world champion and 1972 Olympic gold medalist. READ: Vonn crashes in Cortina READ: Vonn wins first race since comeback READ: Lindsey Vonn -- 'Hardest recovery of my career' Racers access the start hut via a steel staircase before plunging from 9,317 feet to 6,692 feet down to the Salastrains plateau above St. Moritz. Switzerland's Patrick Kung is the defending champion, but Italy's Peter Fill won the 2015-16 World Cup title and leads the standings this season. Norway's Kjetil Jansrud and Italian Dominik Paris, the winner in Kitzbuhel, are second and third in the World Cup standings. Former wold junior champion Beat Feuz triumphed at St. Moritz last year and the 29-year-old Swiss skier could improve on his World Championship bronze from Beaver Creek in 2015. The men's slalom on February 19 is likely to be a shootout between Austria's Marcel Hirscher and Sweden's Henrik Kristofferson. Hirscher, 27, has won four World Championship golds and a record five overall World Cup titles, while 22-year-old Kristofferson is last year's World Cup slalom champion. It is worth keeping an eye on Briton Dave Ryding, who has been making waves after scoring his country's joint best result in a World Cup race with a second place in the slalom in Kitzbuhel last month. He equaled the achievement of Konrad Bartelski in a downhill in Val Gardena, Italy in 1981. Ryding followed it up with 10th in the Schladming night slalom and sits fifth in the World Cup slalom standings.

        "Text": "There is art in science -- the artistic precision of the scalpel, the cool aesthetics of the laboratory, and the intimate observations undertaken by scientists to discover new materials and microbes living unseen in the world. Bio-art, an artistic genre that took hold in the 1980s, solidifies, extends and enriches this organic relationship. According to the artist and writer Frances Stracey, it represents: \"a crossover of art and the biological sciences, with living matter, such as genes, cells or animals, as its new media.\" Bio-artists might use and incorporate imaging technologies within the artistic space; bringing living and dead matter into the gallery. They draw upon biology metaphors to imbue artwork with healing and wounding propensities. In BioCouture, for example, fashion, art, and biology are weaved together, blossoming new materials into existence. As author Suzanne Anker has noted, \"Donna Franklin and Gary Cass have invented dresses made from cellulose generated by bacteria from red wine. Suzanne Lee composes 'growing' textiles produced by sugar, tea and bacteria to fashion jackets and kimonos.\" Lee makes jackets out of cellulose produced by bacteria in baths of green tea and sugar. Bio-art includes the skins and cells of celluloid and digital video, the membranes of sound, and the liquids and fluids of body parts and eyeballs. To take another example, in Christian B?k's The Xenotext, a \"chemical alphabet\" is used to translate poetry into sequences of DNA for subsequent implantation into the genome of a bacterium. When translated into a gene and then integrated into the cell, the poetry constitutes a set of instructions, all of which cause the organism to manufacture a viable, benign protein in response. Writes B?k: \"I am, in effect, engineering a life-form so that it becomes not only a durable archive for storing a poem, but also an operant machine for writing a poem \"-one that can persist on the planet until the sun itself explodes...\" Scientists and artists work together in what become teeming new spaces of co-creation. Together, they often set Bio-art within current debates and concerns about what constitutes life, what counts as a sentient being, and who gets to determine what lives are saved, exploited or destroyed. Bio-art draws together the hopes and concerns of scientists and artists as we hurtle into an age where human life and everyday living seems to be undergoing radical and sometimes dangerous transformations. As author Sheel Patel suggests in relation to Bok's work: \"If a living cell can be cultured to spit out and produce novel poetry, could we eventually live in a society where humans are no longer needed to produce new thoughts, and works of literature?\" Arts and disease In the interactive art-science exhibition Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts, actual and metaphoric communicative diseases are employed to explore the often toxic relationship between human and non-human life. The exhibition explores the thin doorway that exists between life and death in a vexing age of species and habitat destruction, and the increasingly permeable tissues of contemporary bodies. The discourses of science in particular train us to see and to look for disease in every location. Science's microscopic and bio-technological powers allow it to reach into every atom. Of course, dominant discourse also communes that some spaces, things, and objects are more diseased than others. We are taught to see disease in the homes of outsiders and the nests of insects, in the fabric of pariah nation states and the tissues of certain religions and philosophies. At the same time, new materialism and animal philosophy question the very parameters of what life is, where it can be found, and they turn the question of disease onto humankind, whose activities are seen to infect all that it touches and taints. There is a frightening collision, then, between the possibilities and limitations of human and non-human life: caught as it were between nightmare and dream. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is composed of 11 artistic works, with each piece using a different media or art form to explore the chaos of the world it draws upon. Each artist imagines disease differently, and yet within the terror of their imaginings there is great beauty, and much hope. In Drew Berry's video projection, infectious cells are \"set free\" so that the very connective tissue of the exhibition room teems with the droplets of life and death. Herpes, influenza, HIV, polio and smallpox bacteria are projected onto the gallery wall as if they have taken flight. Magnified and chaotic, those entering the space are hit by their scale and size. Lienors Torre's multimedia and glass work on degenerative vision explores how our view of the world is metered and tainted by digital technologies. We see two large glass eyeballs, a liquid animation, and a glass cabinet full of jars filled with water in varying degrees of opacity, with engraved eye images on them. Eyes quickly become raindrops as the liquidity of vision is brought to watery life. There are tears and scars that reflect across the eyes of this exquisite art-piece. In Alison Bennett's touch-based screen work, the viewer is presented with a high-resolution scan of bruised skin. Viewers can use the touch-screen to manipulate the soft and damaged tissue before them, and their eyes become organs of touch. What does it feel like to touch a bruise and be bruised? The gallery is thus, both laboratory and studio. In all its variant forms, and with a scalpel and a paintbrush to hand, Bio-art fashions the world anew. Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is currently exhibited at the RMIT Gallery until February 18, 2017.",

        "Text": "Wheelchair-bound and barely able to talk in his later years, the South Africa legend passed away Monday aged 45. Motor neurone disease had left him a shadow of the gladiator who helped the Springboks win the World Cup in 1995, but his contribution to the game will never be forgotten, says former teammate Cobus Visagie. \"Joost basically created the new requirements for a modern No. 9,\" the former South Africa front-row prop told CNN's World Sport show Tuesday. Van der Westhuizen was 6 foot 2 inches tall, but played at scrumhalf -- a position traditionally occupied by the game's smallest players, providing the link between teams' backs and forwards. \"Some days I looked down when we were standing in a circle and saw a man with boots three sizes bigger than myself -- a scrumhalf!\" added Visagie, who played alongside van der Westhuizen at the 1999 World Cup and won 29 caps for his country. \"He had incredible speed, he had incredible bravery -- he's very well known for the tackles he made in the crucial 1995 World Cup, but also in all other games.\" In the 1995 World Cup final against New Zealand, van der Westhuizen stopped a rampaging Jonah Lomu when the giant winger had broken through the South African defense. The Springboks went on to win 15-12 in extra time, in the first major sporting event to be staged in South Africa after the end of Apartheid rule. The '95 side has achieved iconic status, notably through the Hollywood film \"Invictus.\" \"Who could forget that '95 World Cup tackle?\" former Springboks forward Alistair Hargreaves told CNN. \"He was fearless, and for a scrumhalf he certainly broke the mold. As a young boy, he epitomized what South African rugby was all about. We idolized him.\" READ: Blitzboks star leaves sevens on a high READ: Scotland stuns Ireland in Six Nations opener READ: Van der Westhuizen vows to fight motor neurone disease Courage on the field -- and off it Van der Westhuizen was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011, having retired from international rugby in 2003 with what was then a record 89 caps for the Springboks. Also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, the condition causes muscles to weaken and waste away over time. In 2014 the \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" became a worldwide phenomenon, with millions of people helping to raise awareness and funds to research the disease. Although he never played alongside van der Westhuizen, Hargreaves -- who left South Africa in 2012 to play domestic rugby in England -- was fortunate enough to met his childhood hero later in life. \"I met him after his career and I probably met him at a time that his illness really kicked in,\" Hargreaves said. \"If he was resilient on the field, he certainly proved to be resilient and even more courageous when he found out about the terrible circumstances he found himself in. \"What a brilliant battle he fought. You can only respect the man for what he did.\" After his diagnosis, van der Westhuizen set up the J9 Foundation, a charity dedicated to helping sufferers of motor neurone disease. \"It is incredibly sad, but Joost fought a long battle,\" Hargreaves added. \"He was aware of the struggle he faced and I presume there is a certain amount of relief at the end of it. \"The guy has achieved so much, he's done so much for rugby, I'm sure they're going to hold him up as a real legend of the game.\" Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos A public memorial service will be held on Friday at Loftus Versveld Stadium in Pretoria, South Africa, the home ground of van der Westhuizen's provincial side the Blue Bulls.",

        "Text": "In 1499 AD, Michelangelo completed the Pieta, a transcendent marriage of classical ideals and divine imagination long considered one of the finest works ever freed from stone. In 2017, a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that looks like a dead gorilla was put up for sale on the internet. Well, we had a good run. We're going to choose NOT to believe the Cheeto -- which \"looks like Harambe the Gorilla\" in the way any given Cheeto looks like anything -- sold for almost $100,000 after a 132-episode bidding war. That's what the eBay page says, but if you believe that, then you are admitting the flame of human innovation dies here, snuffed out under an amorphous log of cornmeal and monosodium glutamate. The seller of this foul totem does, however, appear to be legit. The account has been active since 2008 and has enough buyer and seller feedback for there to be a dim possibility that someone doled out a luxury cars' worth of cash on a Cheeto. CNN has reached out for comment. Really, we did. To salt the wound, there are now dozens of Harambe Cheeto-related items polluting the eBay listings, a cruel burlesque at the nadir of consumerism and irony and possibly humanity itself. If you want one, you can buy one with your hard-earned money. Or, you could open up any bag of Cheetos and squint. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters anymore.",

        "Text": "But nature is not always kind. Fifty percent of the world's lion population lives in East Africa -- and lions like to eat livestock. Historically the Maasai would use deadly force to protect their herds, often heading out in revenge parties to hunt and kill lions. There were ritual killings also, known as \"Ala-mayo.\" Killing a lion, a symbol of strength and power, was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into \"Morani,\" the warrior class. Armed with a spear, these youths became men in the process, returning to the tribe to be treated with new-found respect. The Tanzanian government banned ritual killing in the 1970s, but certain pockets of activity were silently condoned. In Ngorongoro Crater, north west of Tarangire National Park and a conservation area since 1959, the practice was judged sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence. In the 1960s the tribe claimed no more than 10 animals per year, but as with so much of the world in the 20th century, the Maasai's population grew in Ngorongoro. Forty lions, if not more, are now under threat annually in the conservation area, and all over Tanzania lion numbers are declining. Conservationists know the problem needs to be addressed, and in a remarkable turnaround they've enlisted the very best gamekeepers to patrol the Maasai Steppe: the Maasai themselves. At around 5am the Maasai \"Wildlife Warriors\" rise to birdsong, nature's alarm clock. A bowl of porridge and cup of chai to start the day. Slipping on a pair of sandals, their soles recycled from old car tires, the Warriors head out of their \"kraal,\" a small sheltered community, to begin tracking. These Maasai have traded in their hunting ways for a life of conservation. Part of an initiative run by the Tanzania People and Wildlife Fund, an organization specializing in human-animal conflict, the Warriors are spread across communities in Tarangire and the surrounding rangeland, using their skills, their lifeblood, to protect what was once their adversary. Beyond the \"boma,\" a low wall surrounding the \"kraal,\" tracks line the dirt. They betray the lions, hyenas and wild dogs who visit in the night, drawn to livestock and, in the dry season, the community's water supply. On an uneventful day, Warriors might take a car owned by the Fund and conduct an animal headcount, circling the Steppe in the early morning. But sometimes tracks start inside the \"boma,\" suggesting a big cat. When big cat footprints are involved, they usually lead to a kill. The next step is crucial. \"People are becoming more and more angry towards wildlife,\" says Wildlife Warrior Lucas Lengoje. In the past a carcass resulted in retribution. The head of cattle per person has decreased among the Maasai in recent years, meaning the pain of every loss is felt all the more. \"The community finds it very difficult to comprehend the importance of the wildlife,\" Lengoje adds. \"It takes time to calm them down and for them to believe you, as they care more about their livestock than wildlife.\" Some of the reprisals have become extreme. Aside from spearings, Maasai have begun poisoning carcasses between a lion's initial gorge and second feed. This not only kills the lion, but anything that feeds on the lion's subsequent carcass. Wildlife Warriors intercede, dissipate the situation, and ultimately provide solutions for their communities and those around them. One of their primary concerns is to document the attack and location, using GPS to map the incident on the Fund's database. They'll also warn neighboring herders of the dangers nearby, and sometimes provide contact details so Maasai can claim compensation from the government. Then begins the long-term approach to preventing cattle loss. \"Living Walls\" (African myrrh trees joined by chain link fences) are being used by the Fund and built in collaboration with the Maasai, and have been rolled out across communities. \"The difference between the 'boma' and the Living Wall is that the living wall uses chain link,\" explains Elvis Kisimir, from the Fund. 'Bomas' contain dried twigs from the thorny acacia bush, but chain link is infinitely more effective, especially when fortified with living, fast-growing thorny trees, which only become more impassable with age. In the wet season these walls reach over 12 feet high. \"We currently have more than 700 'bomas,' and the Living Wall is a program that has safeguarded 99% of our livestock at night,\" says Kisimir. This immediate success is being supplemented with education programs fronted by Maasai Wildlife Warriors, aimed at neutralizing any antagonism between man and his fellow predators. \"If we decided to do this on our own, we wouldn't achieve much,\" admits Kisimir. \"Community is everything.\" Laly Lichtenfeld, executive director of the Fund, describes this as \"the next step,\" and a way to help create a self-regulating environment in which both Maasai and lions can prosper. \"The Maasai people are absolutely critically integral to the conservation process in northern Tanzania,\" she adds. \"This is their land, and their livelihoods are so dependent on wise environmental stewardship. \"Healthy grasslands mean healthy livestock. And the livestock, the cattle, are core of their being -- who they are. It's their pride, it's their identity; it's their economic wellbeing. And so if they can manage to really keep these ecosystems intact and healthy, then everything in the system benefits.\"",

        "Text": "But when you are the Dalai Lama, the deepest lines on your 81-year-old skin are laugh lines. His Holiness knows how to find joy in nearly everything and everyone, largely because of his sense of humor. It is something he uses regularly to quickly win over crowds and something he thinks everyone should embrace in order to have a better life. When he presided over the Emory-Tibet Symposium in December at an imposing temple owned by the Tibetan community in exile in Mundgod, India, he showed his teasing nature right away. Gathered were thousands of saffron-robed nuns and monks, world-renowned scientists, Tibetans and many interested followers, eager learn how to \"bridge science and Buddhism for mutual enrichment.\" The crowd looked as serious as the topic. As they waited in the temple, they murmured quietly and shifted in their seats. Finally, the low moan of a guttural chant began, and everyone quieted and sat up a little straighter. When His Holiness finally emerged from a side door, the sound of scraping plastic chairs echoed throughout the hall as the crowd stood and applauded. Some prostrated themselves on the ground. His Holiness walked in slowly, surrounded by monks in traditional robes and bodyguards in Western dress. Two monks gently guided him down a small set of steps. At the bottom, the Dalai Lama smiled with great joy, laughing and waving at the friends gathered in his honor. \"When you smile, I notice everyone around you smiles. I notice it is very contagious as well,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical correspondent, in an interview with His Holiness after the event. \"Basically, we are social animal,\" the Dalai Lama replied. \"We need friend. In order to develop genuine friendship, trust is very important. For trust, if you show them genuine sort of respect, genuine love, then trust come, so here I think the expression of genuine warm feeling smile I think part of that, that's genuine smile.\" But it is clear that joking around is also key to winning over a crowd. At the event, the Dalai Lama finally sat in his floral chair, against what looked like a pillow one of the monks must have grabbed from his bed, hoping to make him more comfortable. The crowd quieted, leaning forward to hear what His Holiness had to say. But instead of a prayer or a gentle word of wisdom, he decided it was the perfect time to wipe his brow. He took his time and then, rather than putting the white washcloth on the table next to him, he immediately put it on his head, where it rested like an absurd floppy hat. Giggling, he wore it through first part of the meeting, for about an hour. Then, he reached with some ceremony for a glass jar of candy on the low table in front of him. \"This is not decoration,\" he joked, holding it up. He pointed to himself -- \"eat\" -- and promptly unwrapped the gold foil to pop a hard candy into his mouth. His impish behavior, laughing and joking did the trick. The solemn and respectful crowd began laughing with him, warming up immediately. Everyone seemed ready to listen to a discussion of heavy topics such as \"What are the fundamental constituents of the universe, and how did it originate?\" and \"How is knowledge established and what constitutes valid reasoning?\" When Gupta later asked His Holiness about why he decided to wear the washcloth so comically, the Dalai Lama admitted it was, in part, because he is practical and gets hot. But he also hinted that there was something deeper: It's important for leaders, particularly spiritual leaders, to \"act like a human being\" and to be playful. Often, \"everyone too much formal,\" he said, \"That is self-torture.\" And though he knows he must respect those leaders, despite \"no word, no movement\" from them, he has sometimes developed \"a strange thinking\" and often hopes something unexpected will happen to make that leader act more \"like a human being.\" \"I had this experience (in) 1954 when I was in Peking,\" His Holiness said. \"Some Indian ambassador, he call on me, come to my room, then as usual, some Chinese foreign ministries officials come. \"Everyone too much formal like that,\" he said then mimed being stiff. \"Then somehow they brought some fruit, somehow dumped over, and then everyone acted like a human being,\" he said, laughing and miming people scrambling around, as he saw them do around on the floor. His Holiness suggests everyone let themselves be playful and find the funny in life. In his book \"My Spiritual Journey,\" he calls himself a \"professional laugher\" and writes that he comes from a cheerful family that is always \"amusing ourselves, teasing each other, joking. It's our habit.\" A quick laugh and an ability to see humor in daily situations and to be playful have been shown to help adults lower stress levels, both for themselves and for those around them, studies show. By being playful and using humor, people also become more observant and more empathetic. They are often bored less, they learn more, they have more friends, and studies show that people who are willing to let out their playful side tend to have a better sense of all-around well-being.  His Holiness believes that no matter how difficult your life may be, this approach will bring you something much deeper. \"Thinking only of the negative aspect doesn't help to find solutions and it destroys peace of mind,\" he writes. \"I love smiles, and my wish is to see more smiles, real smiles. ... If we want those smiles, we must create the reasons that make them appear.\"",

        "Text": "Trump was defending the Russian President after Fox's Bill O'Reilly called Putin a \"killer.\" His response, \"You think our country is so innocent,\" reveals Trump's dismissive attitude toward the most fundamental democratic norms that America has aspired to embody. Clearly, the United States has made many grave mistakes throughout history, but the country's guiding principles have remained unchanged: the fierce defense of individual liberties and an unshakeable commitment to democratic ideals. In Russia, by contrast, Putin has decimated the opposition, imprisoned critics and taken control of all branches of government. The free press is a faint shadow of its former self, and Putin's critics, including journalists, continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances. One of Putin's most vocal critics, Vladimir Kara-Murza, remains in a Moscow hospital in \"grave condition\" after suffering a \"full organ failure\" that, as his lawyer told CNN, doctors agree is the result of a \"toxic substance.\" Despite Trump's comments and recent executive actions, Trump should expect push-back from a country committed to liberal democratic principles. This division between the President and the American people makes the United States the latest battleground in a worldwide clash of ideologies. When the wave of populist authoritarianism started, few would have expected the United States, the principal beacon of modern democracy for over 200 years, to fall under the spell of nativist politics. But fall it did. The many Americans who remain skeptical of Trump and now find themselves protesting on a weekly basis can take comfort in knowing they are not alone. On Sunday, while the American public was rapt in the Super Bowl, an astonishing sight came into focus in Romania. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest a government push to decriminalize corruption. The remarkable part was that protesters had already won. Demonstrations had begun six days earlier, after the government tried to quietly pass a decree that would have cleared the records and freed from prison people convicted of corruption for amounts less than $47,000. The government agreed to rescind the order. But the demonstrations only grew, with protesters saying they came out to protect their democracy. Romanians knew they had to fight for democracy because of their recent communist past and the onslaught in neighboring countries against liberal democracy, which requires separation of powers, a free judiciary, free and fair elections and, yes, freedom to protest. Sadly, now, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the surge of refugee arrivals, demagogic politicians have leveraged popular discontent, lashing out against foreigners, vowing to put their country's \"true\" residents first, and gradually dismantling the foundations of liberal democracy. Romanians seem to have won round one. But the forces defending democracy elsewhere, including in neighboring Hungary, have been losing. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban openly declared he's building an \"illiberal state,\" and is making strides in his quest to imitate regimes run by the likes of Putin. Democratic freedoms have suffered sharp reverses in recent years. Turkey is slipping into dictatorship, Venezuela remains mired in autocracy, as do countries in every continent. But what's ahead for the United States? Some veterans of the battle are pessimistic. When millions of mostly women took to the streets the day after Trump's inauguration, Julia Ioffe, whose family fled Russia, threw cold water on their jubilant movement, tweeting, \"The happy, feisty crowds, the clever signs - it all feels like the protests in Moscow in 2011. That went nowhere.\" It's true that protests have not achieved much against other authoritarian regimes. In Venezuela, the Chavista regime came to power in 1999, and despite every effort from a determined opposition, it remains in power. In Turkey, mass demonstrations, and even what seemed like electoral victories, have failed to stop Recep Tayyip Erdogan's march to de facto dictator. In Russia, Putin is all but unchallenged, with a quiescent legislature and near-complete control of the news Russians consume. But the story is likely to have a different outcome in the United States. Yascha Mounk, a Harvard expert in right-wing populism, observed that Trump is turning out to be \"more authoritarian than I feared,\" though the opposition is also proving \"more courageous than I expected.\" America has deeper democratic roots than any of the countries whose liberal democracies has been toppled. The national religion is freedom from tyranny. The day after Trump took office, Americans put on what may have been the largest national demonstration in the country's history. A week later, when Trump issued his travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries, spontaneous demonstrations materialized at major airports across the country. Lawyers filed legal briefs on the spot. While the Republican-controlled Congress has proven mostly silent in countering Trump's attacks on the independent media and the judiciary, the press appears determined to do its job and judges seem unintimidated by White House bullying. Even members of the executive branch are speaking out. Many Americans support Trump, but there are signs that his sharp break with democratic traditions, his attacks on judges, his fulminations against the media and against critics of all stripes -- from comedians to restaurant reviewers -- are producing a backlash. History is being written by two opposing forces -- those fighting for and those fighting against liberal democracy. President Trump's likening of America to Putin's Russia puts him on the illiberal side. But the American people have spent hundreds of years building a strong democratic system, and they are prepared to fight to defend it.",

        "Text": "\"Whataboutism\" was a favorite Kremlin propaganda technique during the Cold War. It aimed to portray the West as so morally flawed that its criticism of the Soviet empire was hypocritical. Any criticism of the Soviet Union (the war in Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, persecution of dissidents) was met with a list of Western abuses (supporting fascist dictatorships, trampling trade unions, racial oppression). It was well encapsulated in a joke about the fictional Radio Yerevan (a staple of Soviet-era humor) in which a caller asks what is the average wage of an American manual worker. The real answer would undermine Soviet claims to economic superiority, so after a pause, the pundit replies: \"Over there they lynch Negroes.\" By the time the system collapsed, that phrase had become a derisive synecdoche for Soviet propaganda as a whole. \"Whataboutism\" seemed to have died in the 1990s when Russia's official aim was to become like the West. But it made a comeback under President Vladimir Putin, whose propaganda machine specializes in spreading FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) in the West. If Americans, Britons, Germans and others can be made to believe that their rulers are crooks and idiots, and that legality and liberty are a sham, then they will be much less likely to take risks and make sacrifices in defending their own countries. To some extent, \"whataboutism\" is a sensible tactic in argument. Criticism delivered from a purported moral high ground deserves special scrutiny. We shouldn't take lessons from Russia about minority rights, say, given the way that the Kremlin mistreats its own indigenous populations -- Maris, Buryats, Komis and the like. But unlike Putin's Russia, the West is genuinely well placed to make such criticisms. We are not perfect. But we are self-critical and self-correcting. The cornerstone of our system is contestability. Of course, our elected representatives and government officials make mistakes -- but they are constrained and challenged for them. They risk civil and criminal legal actions, impeachment, media scrutiny, public protest and being tossed out of office into a lifetime of disgrace. These checks and balances are imperfect too, but they do work. President FranÃ§ois Hollande has misruled France only mildly by Russian standards. But whereas he won't get a second term, President Putin can stay in office as long as he wants. President Trump has made an outrageous mistake in his visa ban and has immediately run into legal obstacles. When was the last time a Russian court told Putin that his actions were illegal? All this is lost on Trump. He appears to wish that America were more like Russia. He finds legal constraints on executive power outrageous. That view is not just mistaken: it is dangerous. All over the world, people look to America as a beacon of freedom and justice. It sets a standard (albeit sometimes a theoretical one) by which other political systems are judged. That represents a huge store of political capital. Trump is squandering it with every word he utters. Moral relativism corrodes sentiment in the frontline states of the new cold war. In places like Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, pro-Western figures are feeling that their struggle is doomed. Why bother fighting for freedom when the leader of the free world has given up? Worse than this, the thinking will spread that maybe Putin is right: the world is all about power and money, and the political currency that really works is coined from lies and fear. If those are the real rules of the game, then better to play them. It seems to have worked for Trump, after all. Edward Lucas is a senior editor at The Economist, where he was the Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He is also senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.",

        "Text": "Let's hope these came in handy when he watched Melissa McCarthy parody the White House spokesman on \"Saturday Night Live\" over the weekend.  We all know his thin-skinned, humorless boss, President Donald Trump, has not taken kindly to SNL's countless spoofs, complaining on Twitter that SNL is \"unwatchable,\" \"totally biased\" and \"not funny.\" He's also said that Alec Baldwin's impersonation \"just can't get any worse.\" I happen to largely agree with that assessment. \"SNL\" has taken to merely mimicking Trump and his antics through Baldwin, rather than cleverly satirizing him. Despite plenty of material to work with, thus far, the Trump-SNL era has been, well, boring and predictable.  Until this weekend, that is. The difference between the usual Trump spoofs and McCarthy's take on Spicer is that hers was actually hilarious.  A podium-wielding McCarthy plays on Spicer's rocky start at the White House -- his oratorical stumbles, his new, Trump-like scorn for critical press, his equally Trumpian fact-manipulation -- with a well-studied ear for his tics and tone.  Exaggerating a White House spokesman might sound like inside-the-beltway kind of humor that average viewers won't appreciate or find funny. But in the theatrical, reality-television era of Trump, everyone around him is a character, too. And in this case, \"SNL\" writers didn't just mimic Spicer, they encapsulated a far bigger story: this is what it looks like when a normal, professional political operative becomes Trumpified. And if you didn't laugh out loud, you may have Trump's thin-skin disorder. But will Spicer follow his boss's lead, tweeting out how unfunny \"SNL\" is, or telling reporters that the show is biased and unwatchable? Not if he's smart, he won't.  If an \"SNL\" spoof is funny, there's only one way for the spoofee to handle it -- embrace it. At his next press briefing (Monday's was called off), where he will undoubtedly be asked about it, he should laugh it off, say he was flattered, and then make a joke at his own expense. He already took a crack at this approach in an interview with Extra on Sunday, telling AJ Calloway that McCarthy \"could dial back\" a bit, but also managing to call the show \"funny.\"  If he can keep this up, he'd be following a long tradition of politicos taking parody in stride.  In 1995, House Republicans invited Chris Farley, who'd been impersonating Speaker Newt Gingrich on \"SNL,\" to impersonate him to his face at the conference meeting while Gingrich laughed along.  After spoofing George H.W. Bush for four years, Dana Carvey was invited to the White House to meet him. After Bush lost to Bill Clinton, he had Carvey come cheer up his staff.  In October of 2008, after Tina Fey spent weeks perfectly portraying then Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Palin appeared on \"SNL\" alongside Fey and Alec Baldwin, who \"mistakes\" her for Fey -- his former 30 Rock co-star -- and asks how she could appear on the show with the real Palin, \"that horrible woman.\"  But that was all BT -- Before Trump. I know dozens of people in his new administration and many have become more like him, at least outwardly. They've become defensive, self-serious and aggressive, and they've adopted Trump's rhetorical penchant for hyperbole, bombast and fact-blurring. They say things publicly that I know they never would have said before. It seems like they're playing a part in a new Trump reality show. I wouldn't be surprised if Spicer reverts to Trump's lack of humor toward unflattering satire, just to stick to script. But that would make it infinitely worse. It's already problematic that the credibility of the White House and its staff is being lampooned only two weeks into the job. With the elevation of Trump political adviser Steve Bannon, some are wondering who are the cooler heads and saner voices surrounding the president. If the White House wants to allay these fears -- and perhaps they do not -- Spicer should be his cooler, saner, pre-Trump self, and play along with McCarthy's performance. Otherwise, the notion that Trump's White House can't take a joke gets a lot more serious.",

        "Text": "Although slavery is outlawed in every country, criminals earn more than $150 Billion every year from enslaving people.  But you can do something about it. On MARCH 14, 2017, we want YOU and your school to join us for #MyFreedomDay. We're asking students to organize events at their school on the day to highlight modern slavery and celebrate freedom. The schools that show the most spirit in fighting slavery will be featured on CNN TV, CNN.com and CNN Facebook. A few schools will even receive a visit from a CNN correspondent, who will report live from the school on the day. So how do you take part? We're encouraging students and teachers to come up with their own ideas, but here are some suggestions for the kind of thing you could do.  Film Screening - Look for movies or documentaries that deal with human trafficking. If you want to use a CNN documentary, we'll let you show it for free. You can watch the videos at cnn.com/myfreedom.  Art Show -- Create art work, in any media, and show it off at the school then post it to Twitter or Instagram using #MyFreedomDay. The theme can be anti-slavery and should include peaceful, hopeful messages; art work about survivors and traffickers, and any form of expression that highlights human trafficking in a way that will raise awareness to your community.  Stand for Freedom -- Students can stand for 45 mins (or 45 hours, if you're really dedicated!) to represent the 45 million victims of slavery in the world today.  Holi Day - The Indian Festival in March celebrates love and color to raise awareness and money. Festivities involve washable pigmented powders that can be thrown at each other. Add music and a booth for human trafficking information and you have a full day of fun for the community.  Panel Discussion -- Invite local lawmakers and anti-trafficking organizations to discuss the issue and what it looks like not just abroad, but in your hometown.  Day of Service -- Support a half-day of service where students volunteer at rehabilitation centers, visit their local lawmakers for a call to action, or collect items needed for survivors in conjunction with local organizations.  It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you do something. Let us know your plans by telling us on Twitter or Instagram, using #MyFreedomDay. (You must be aged 13 or older to post on social media).  Find out more at cnn.com/myfreedom. And you can use the same hashtag to tell us what freedom means to you. - It could be the freedom to see your friends or family - Freedom to be yourself - Freedom to do the job you choose - Freedom to travel - Freedom to express yourself the way you choose  Whatever freedom means in your life -- the important thing is the message, and encouraging people to think about the freedom they may take for granted.",

        "Text": "\"I used to blame myself for everything. But, like I, I would say I let them do that to me. I am dirty. It's my fault,\" says Chopek through tears. But Chopek is finally speaking out, determined to shake the guilt and shame that she knows should stalk her perpetrators instead of her. \"Now I see that I was just a child,\" says Chopek, now sitting serenely in a safe house, a healing lodge in rural Manitoba that cradled her in the love and protection she so needed when she escaped her life on the streets. Now 19, Lauren was just 14 when she was sexually exploited and trafficked for sex in her hometown of Winnipeg. But as an indigenous girl in Canada, her story is hardly rare. More from the CNN Freedom Project Canada's indigenous population is very small -- just 4% of the population -- yet more than 50% of all sex trafficking victims in Canada are indigenous. The reasons are complicated and varied but are ultimately rooted in a legacy of poverty, racism and abuse. \"I was actually making these bad choices for a reason,\" explains Chopek. \"You know when you experience sexual abuse it's really confusing. You never know if it's your fault or is it theirs.\" 'Targets of violence and abuse' Diane Redsky runs Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre, which advocates for indigenous women and children, specifically sex trafficking victims. Her organization runs the rural healing lodge where Chopek stayed, as well as safe houses, rehabilitation and prevention programs throughout Manitoba. Read: Trafficked women tattooed by their pimps Redsky says the history of racism against indigenous Canadians feeds into the cycle of violence and exploitation against them. \"It's really difficult to be able to fight those stereotypes as indigenous women when a whole society is targeting indigenous women and girls, particularly for violence and abuse -- and that spills over into sex trafficking,\" says Redsky. Tanay Little's story shows how insidious the abuse can be. Little was just 11 when she was sexually exploited on the streets surrounding her family's home in Winnipeg. An older girl, someone who pretended to be her friend she says, was actually preying on Little, first luring her with drugs and then trafficking her for sex. \"I remember one time that she put me in a room and then two guys, one, not together, but one would come in and then I would have sex with him and then the other the other guy would come in. And then I'd get high after that,\" says Little. She is blunt about what would happen if she refused to have sex with anybody. \"If you're not beat up, then you would get raped by a few of them at once,\" explains Little. \"There is a debt bondage that's between $1,000 and $2,000 a day that these girls must bring, must hand in to their trafficker or else,\" says Redsky. These startling anecdotes have been heard in family homes, police stations and safe houses for years in Manitoba. The province is now taking the lead on an innovative approach to prevention and rehabilitation. Focus on the victims Redsky and others in Manitoba are now leading transformative programs to help identify the threats and risks so prevalent in indigenous communities. It is a new approach to help fight sex trafficking, one that focuses on the needs of the victims. Jennifer Richardson runs Tracia's Trust, Manitoba's strategy to combat sexual exploitation and sex trafficking of children. Crucially, Manitoba's government has committed more than $10 million Canadian a year to fund it, a huge sum for a population of only about a million people. \"Within a 10-year span Manitoba has really grown this massive strategy that is just recognized throughout Canada as being kind of the frontier leaders in this area,\" says Richardson. Read: 'I was raped 43,200 times' The program is different and revolutionary for Manitoba because it uses not only targeted funds, but also words, deeds, and training to fight human trafficking in a whole new way. Outreach on neighborhood streets is one strategy that is executed with the help of law enforcement officers. Almost daily, Winnipeg Police dispatch an elite unit on the streets to try and counter sexual exploitation and human trafficking. The approach is a departure for Winnipeg Police, who now say their efforts are firmly focused on helping victims. Outreach is conducted in a way to help victims and then bring their perpetrators to justice. Law enforcement officials acknowledge a history of bias and racism that in the past prevented police from truly understanding how and why indigenous girls are vulnerable and at risk. \"There is bias in the police service. We recognize it, that there's implicit bias. We certainly have taken steps to try to address that in a myriad of ways,\" says Danny Smyth, Winnipeg's deputy police chief. \"We have a team that's dedicated just to outreach. Just to being out there and trying to get to know who's out on the street, and trying to establish a relationship with them,\" adds Smyth. The legacy of years of abuse and racism though are making it difficult for Canada's indigenous community to heal and move on. Canada will soon launch an inquiry that will focus on why hundreds of indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been murdered over the years. Canadian and independent studies have revealed that indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to die in violent circumstances than non-indigenous women and girls. \"We're still in a society that targets indigenous women and girls. In fact the national task force concluded that there's a market for indigenous girls,\" says Redsky, adding, \"what that leads to is a society who views indigenous women as less than, and in fact of no human value.\"",

        "Text": "In the background of the photo, which was posted online, are products including prescription medication. But zooming in on that pill bottle makes the details unreadable. In a small, dark lab Jim Cole, special agent and supervisor of Victim Identification at the Homeland Security Investigations Cyber Crimes Center gets to work using the latest technology available. Using technology to identify abusers \"Utilizing some technology that hadn't even been released to the public yet we were able to take a look at the bottle and reverse out some of the motion blur,\" Cole said. They can now see the offender's first name \"Stephen,\" the first two letters of the last name and the first three digits on the prescription order. With that he applies to the pharmacy for the customer details of every person who fits that criteria. It narrows the list down to a man named \"Stephen Keating.\" But that's not all. The offender's fingers are also in the picture and incredibly this crack team manages to pull the fingerprints from the image. \"That was the first time we were able to do that,\" Cole said. The evidence was strong enough to put Stephen Keating behind bars for 110 years. Investigators rescued his 14 victims. No victim left behind Cole co-founded Project VIC: their aim is that no victim is be left behind. \"We strive to find these children as quick as possible,\" Cole said. \"The longer it takes us the longer that child is in harm's way.\" Read: Raid reunites trafficked sisters It's not an easy task when Cole says they are seeing 500,000 images a week: that's over 25 million a year. The Keating case ran for about three weeks and in the past it could have taken months -- or worse, the image may never have been uncovered at all. Using technology known as \"Photo DNA\" their computers can wade through the hundreds of thousands of photos fast, categorizing the ones they've already seen to allow his team to focus on the new victims. \"What used to take us nine months now takes us a month,\" said Cole. \"It helps us review video on a scale of about 100 times faster than previously,\" he added. \"It's been a complete game-changer for law enforcement and we get that feedback from the field all the time.\" Easing psychological burden The efficiency not only saves time, it helps ease the psychological burden on investigators. \"We definitely see a mental health benefit because the nature of our offenders is they are trading material we've seen hundreds of thousands of times in addition to the new material,\" Cole said. Read: Vietnamese girls smuggled in to China, sold as brides The technology helped investigators find a seemingly harmless photo of a known offender with her victim on vacation. The image showed the pair holding fish at a campsite. The fish were isolated from the image and sent to Cornell University, which provided investigators with a geographical area where those fish can be caught. The campsite image, with the child and perpetrator removed, was sent to every single campsite advertiser in that location. Upon tracking down the actual campsite they found the same photo posted in the reception room. \"Within four hours we had her identified,\" Cole said. The child was rescued and the woman is now serving a 25-year sentence. On another image of an offender with a young girl, the Project VIC team noticed a company logo on the man's sweatshirt but they couldn't decipher what was written. Some cutting edge technology helped make the logo almost completely readable. An online search for names that might match the letters led investigators to a plumbing business. The offender, a former employee, was tracked down and four victims were rescued. Global problem The number of images like these being shared online is on the rise. Last year the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) received 4.4 million reports to its CyberTipline. That's a nearly 800% increase in reporting since 2013. Tip-offs come from the public, and also companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, who are mandated by U.S. regulations to report any such images. According to Lindsay Olson, director of the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC, 94% of the cases last year were outside the United States. \"The CyberTipline receives reports of child porn, online enticement of children for sexual acts, online sex trafficking, child molestation; any type of child exploitation can be reported to the cyber tip line,\" said Olson. \"We make reports available to law enforcement in about 100 countries and we also work with Europol and Interpol.\" Swedish based company Griffeye was one of the founding partners of Project VIC. Director Johann Hofmann says it donates its software to be used in child exploitation cases. \"As more and more crime is becoming more and more digital as data is being distributed online,\" he said. \"You see a new type of police officer that is behind a computer screen and with the right tools they can crack these cases.\" The Internet has no borders so law enforcement agencies need to overcome traditional geographic boundaries to work together. Project VIC is now being used by Interpol, Europol and agencies in 35 countries including the United Kingdom and Canada, and it's about to be rolled out in Australia. In the United States the results speak for themselves. \"We've been absolutely floored by the success we've seen with Project VIC,\" said Cole. \"Going back a few years we were seeing victims in the low hundreds and in this past year we've rescued over 1,000 victims just in HSI (Homeland Security Investigations -- a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)). alone and we've seen similar results in other agencies as well.\"",

        "Text": "Lan remembers the night that changed her whole life. While preparing for university along the border in northern Vietnam, a friend she met online asked her to a group dinner. When she was tired and wanted to go home, the people asked her to stay and talk and have a drink. Next thing she knew, she had been smuggled across the border to China. \"At that time, I wanted to leave,\" says Lan. \"There were other girls there in the car but there was people to guard us.\" The villages along the Vietnamese-Chinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers. Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged, then spirited across the porous border by boat, motorbike or car. Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China, where the one-child policy and long-standing preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio. To put it simply, Chinese men are hungry for brides. \"It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman,\" explained Ha Thi Van Khanh, national project coordinator for the U.N.'s anti-trafficking organization in Vietnam. Traditionally, Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding. \"This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries, including Vietnam.\" Diep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam. She says that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of $3,000 to the end buyer and that they are often considered desirable because of cultural similarities to the Chinese. Nguyen was just 16 when a friend's boyfriend drugged her and smuggled her into China. She tried to resist a forced marriage. For three months, she refused, even though her traffickers beat her, withheld food and threatened to kill her, she says. Finally, she relented. She says her husband was kind to her, but she never stopped missing her family in Vietnam. \"My desire to go home was indescribable,\" Nguyen said. \"I agreed to marry the man but I could not stay with a stranger without any feelings for him.\" When her mother-in-law realized Lan was never going to warm to the marriage, the family returned her to the traffickers. They got their money back, Nguyen says, after which she was forced into a second marriage. A refuge for escaped women The Pacific Links Foundation runs a shelter for trafficking victims in the city of Lao Cai, northern Vietnam. The young women stay for an average of two to three years. They go to school or get vocational training. They do art therapy. They learn to cook and sew and keep a big garden. Surrounded by other woman with similar experiences, the shelter helps them get back on their feet and then to find jobs to support themselves. \"Once that whole investment process can happen with these young women then it is much easier for them to have their own lives,\" says Diep. Her organization also does community outreach to try and stop more girls from falling into the hands of traffickers. About once a month, a group of trafficking victims visits the market at Bac Ha, a regional hub for buying food, fabric and livestock. On this day, on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers, they talk about their experiences, take questions and play games with the crowd. When they ask people to share personal experiences concerning trafficking, more than 20 people come forward. \"I think awareness is the only tool,\" Diep says. Ha from the U.N. agrees that the top priority is to spread awareness, especially in the poor, rural regions along the border. She also believes reducing poverty will help stop women going to China seeking work, another common way traffickers lure victims. Saved at the border During CNN's trip to the border, the government called and told us the police had just rescued five girls as they were about to cross the border with a trafficker. We met the girls, who are just 14 years old. They said they were promised $600 to go to work in China by a neighbor from the same village. They didn't tell their parents they were going. The neighbor is now under arrest. The Vietnamese police are sometimes able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China, by enlisting the help of Chinese authorities. Nguyen Tuong Long, the head of the government's social vice prevention department in Lao Cai, says last year they rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims. \"Because of cooperation between the Vietnamese and the Chinese police, we have found and caught trafficking rings,\" Nguyen says. \"We've found women far inside China, at brothels where they're forced to become sex workers.\" Trafficked women who aren't rescued in raids have to find ways to get out on their own. Some of them say they were able to contact their families from China, but they couldn't get help from police because they didn't know exactly where they were. Lan and Nguyen ended up in the same town in China. After two years, together they managed to slip out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station. The whole time they were afraid their husbands' families would find them. The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam. The women were free of their forced marriages, but they paid a high price. Both left their babies in China. Lan says if she saw her daughter again, she would apologize for leaving her behind. \"I hope she'll have a better life there,\" she says. Both Lan and Nguyen say in school their teachers had talked to them about trafficking. At the time, neither believed it could happen to them.",

        "Text": "All of this is not good for the Trump brand, which only two years ago was synonymous for many with success, luxury, wealth, and elegance -- so much so that his children had successfully leveraged it to foster ventures in the wine and fashion industries. Wearing a Trump branded suit made a statement. The brand didn't appeal to everyone, but it had a generally positive association. Today, however, the brand has a completely different meaning. It makes a very different statement, with associations of racism, sexism and xenophobia. And now that statement is blowing back onto the Trump children's businesses too. Given the polarizing nature of the Trump brand, Nordstrom's decision last week to drop the Ivanka Trump line shouldn't come as a surprise. It's a reflection of the state of the whole Trump brand today. Nordstrom claims that the decision was driven purely by sales results. A company spokesperson explained the move, noting, \"Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season.\" I suspect Nordstrom's decision was a bit more complex, and that ultimately both results and branding played a role in phasing out the line. The Trump brand currently is so polarizing that Nordstrom was probably eager to drop it. The brand is too hot to handle. Nordstrom doesn't want to be seen as supporting the new administration strongly, a wise move given that some people intensely dislike the Trump brand. On the other hand, Nordstrom doesn't want to be opposed to the Trump brand either. It is never smart to publicly provoke a president. It is a very delicate balance, made all the harder when selling the line of products. By dropping the Trump brand due to sales trends, Nordstrom was simply attempting to back away from a conflict. Of course, things are rarely simple when dealing with Donald Trump. He attacked Nordstrom on Twitter, writing \"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person ... terrible!\" Donald Trump is not the first president to defend his family. Back in 1950, music critic Paul Hume wrote a negative review of performance by President Harry Truman's daughter. Truman sent off a frosty letter on White House stationary: \"Someday I hope to meet you. When that happens, you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes.\" Still, Trump's habit of criticizing individuals and companies such as Nordstrom on social media raises the stakes for brand leaders. It's worth dwelling on the flap between President Trump (as a father and a businessman) and Nordstrom, because more brands are following Nordstrom's lead. Most firms want to be politically neutral -- there is no reason to side with one party or the other and risk turning away customers. As Nordstrom noted in a November Twitter post, \"We hope that offering a vendor's products isn't misunderstood as us taking a political position.\" Unfortunately, with the Trump brand, it is seen that way. Supporting Trump in any fashion is making a statement. All of this means that the Trump brand, including the Ivanka Trump line, will have a challenging time going forward. For the Trump brand team, there are two keys for success with the Donald in the White House. First, plan for a soft year. Assume sales will drop, so manage expectations down. Proactively make moves that might logically explain a sales drop, and scale back and conserve resources. Second, work to reduce polarization. The Trump brand will rebound if it can get some early wins and become more broadly appealing. For retailers and licensees, it will be important not to be seen as taking a stand on the Trump brand. In most cases, this means just backing away from ties. The goal is not to be against Trump -- this can result in a Twitter attack from the President, which is not desirable (as Nordstrom experienced). The idea is to just not be seen as a supporter. With retailers such as Nordstrom abandoning the Trump brand, it is clear that a repositioning is in order. Until then, most brands will keep a safe distance away.",

        "Text": "Trump and his top aides are well aware that his travel ban would benefit from public approval, so Trump made the case Wednesday that he knows more about terrorism than most. He suggested that Americans -- at least those who don't get classified briefings -- don't understand the terror threat against the United States. \"Terrorism is a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand,\" Trump told a gathering of sheriffs in a Washington hotel. Seemingly hinting at information gleaned from his classified briefings, the President added: \"Believe me. I've learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\" Ari Fleischer, who served as Bush's White House press secretary during 9/11, said all presidents use \"realistic, worse-case scenarios\" to push their agendas. He cautioned the tactic could be abused and result in undermining an administration. \"Like anything, you can go too far. You can exaggerate, you can get facts wrong, you can hype it to a degree where you lose credibility,\" he said. \"But it is been a time honored tradition in American politics to use a worst-case scenario to drive an agenda.\" It's also a tactic that's worked for Trump. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump urged his supporters to worry about terror and pushed them to do so by painting the world as an increasingly dangerous place. \"People are scared,\" Trump said in his June Republican National Convention acceptance speech. \"The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\" More Americans said terrorism was a pressing concern in 2016 than any point since 2003. According to a CNN poll released in 2016, 71% of Americans said further acts of terrorism are very or somewhat likely in the United States over the next several weeks, a number that has not been that high since March 2003. The strategy Trump's strategy as President is twofold. Alarmist language could help sell the travel ban to a skeptical public. Trump is also suggesting he knows more about the need for the ban than the judges overseeing the legal challenges, who are not privy to confidential briefings. Americans are largely split on Trump's executive order, which bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Voters generally disapprove of key aspects of Trump's order, according to a Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday. It found 51% of the public oppose suspending travel to the US for 90 days from seven countries, 60% oppose suspending all refugee immigration for 120 days and 70% oppose indefinitely suspending the Syrian refugee program. Trump's order went before a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals three-judge panel on Tuesday where lawyers from Trump's Justice Department squared up against the states of Washington and Minnesota. The court is expected to rule on Trump's order by the end of the week. The President knocked the arguments against his travel ban Wednesday, telling the same group of sheriffs that \"even a 'bad high school student' \" could understand the language of his order and find in his favor. Words of reassurance In contrast, after high-profile attacks in San Bernardino and Paris, President Barack Obama said: \"the threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.\" \"Let's be vigilant, but not afraid,\" Obama said in his final speech as President. \"(ISIS) will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight.\" Even George W. Bush, whose administration did, at times, stoke fear in the run up to the Iraq War and around homeland security, was measured in the face of the 9/11 attacks. \"Now, the American people have got to go about their business. We cannot let the terrorists achieve the objective of frightening our nation to the point where we don't conduct business, where people don't shop,\" Bush said after 9/11, the deadliest terrorist attack in US history. Bush, in his final speech as president, said the United States was a nation \"that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom.\" \"This is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger, and compassion in the face of suffering,\" he said. A good example of Bush using fear: His push to establish the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. At the time, Fleischer said, Bush would regularly read his morning \"threat matrix\" -- a document about produced by the Department of Homeland Security on possible threats -- and use it publicly at times to push his plan to fight terrorism. \"With a vast nation to defend, we can neither predict nor prevent every conceivable attack,\" Bush said before establishing the new government agency. \"And in a free and open society, no department of government can completely guarantee our safety against ruthless killers, who move and plot in shadows. Yet our government will take every possible measure to safeguard our country and our people.\"",

        "Text": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee, told him he found Trump's attack on a federal judge on Twitter \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" Within a half-hour, Gorsuch spokesman Ron Bonjean, who was tapped by the White House to head communications for Gorsuch, confirmed that the nominee, Gorsuch, used those words in his meeting with Blumenthal. Several other senators, including Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, later relayed similar accounts of Gorsuch forcefully criticizing Trump's public attacks on the judiciary branch. Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch calls Trump's tweets 'disheartening' And on Thursday, Blumenthal said on MSNBC Gorsuch specifically told him he \"should feel free to mention what I said about these attacks being disheartening and demoralizing.\" But none of that stopped Trump from firing off a shot against Blumenthal -- and at the same time raising questions about the coherence of the White House's messaging. Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch calls Trump's tweets 'disheartening' \"Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. Gorsuch's criticism came in response to Trump's recent criticism of federal judges who have ruled against his immigration ban or appear poised to do so, in particular in reference to one of the President's tweets slamming one of those judges as a \"so-called judge.\" \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" Trump tweeted last Saturday. On Wednesday, Trump pressed forward with his criticism, arguing that the judiciary has become too political and suggesting that judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals might rule against his appeal to reverse a temporary stay on implementing his travel ban because of political considerations, instead of the law. Blumenthal stood by his accounting of Gorsuch's comments, telling CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" Thursday morning he \"absolutely and accurately\" stated what Gorsuch told him. \"I think that the President needs to hear from Judge Gorsuch about exactly what he is saying to myself and Senate colleagues,\" Blumenthal said. \"Maybe he simply hasn't been informed and that's the reason for his tweet.\" Former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is helping shepherd Gorsuch's nomination on the Hill said in a statement Thursday Gorsuch has told senators \"he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.\" Ayotte added the judge has made clear he \"could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters.\" Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska also confirmed Thursday that Gorsuch criticized Trump's attacks on the federal judge in a meeting with him as well. Sasse said Gorsuch \"got pretty passionate\" about the topic, particularly when he asked Gorsuch about Trump's \"so-called judge\" tweet. \"This is a guy who welled up with some energy. He said any attack on any brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges. He believes in an an independent judiciary,\" Sasse said Thursday morning on MSNBC. Military service Trump's dig at Blumenthal's military service is a reference to Blumenthal's past misrepresentations about his service during the Vietnam era. Blumenthal obtained multiple military deferments to avoid getting drafted into the Vietnam War and ultimately landed in the Marine Corps Reserve and never deployed to Vietnam, though he claimed multiple times he had served in Vietnam. Blumenthal apologized for misrepresenting his service in 2010. While Blumenthal enlisted in the Marine Reserve after multiple deferments, Trump -- who was also eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War -- never enlisted, instead obtaining multiple student deferments and ultimately a medical deferment for a bone spur to avoid the military draft. Democrats and Gorsuch Sen. Chris Coons said in his personal meeting with Gorsuch, he plans to ask the nominee about his commitment to judicial independence given some of the President's recent comments about judges. \"I don't think it's constructive for President Trump to weigh in on this and to level accusations against sitting senators,\" the Delaware Democrat told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" \"I frankly think the more he stays out of this the better for his judicial nominee.\" \"But this simply highlights why judicial independence is going to be so important for me and for other Senators as we go through the process of meeting Judge Gorsuch and considering whether or not he should serve on the Supreme Court,\" he added. Trump's Thursday tweet could complicate the upcoming hearings for Gorsuch, who is certain to face questions about Trump's tweets from Democrats. Liberals, already concerned with Gorsuch's record, have also asked how he will demonstrate independence from the President. The President is also set to meet with red state Democrats for lunch, in hopes of wooing their support for Gorsuch. CNN's Ashley Killough, Jeff Zeleny and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two in Arizona, has been deported to her native Mexico, Carlos Garcia, director of the advocacy organization Puente Arizona, said Thursday. Garcia de Rayos was taken into custody Wednesday and ordered to be deported during her yearly check-in with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. Immigration officials said she was detained \"based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review which became final in May 2013.\" [Original story, published 11:39 a.m.] Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two, said a prayer before her yearly check-in with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. But her meeting Wednesday with immigration officials ended differently than others over the last eight years: She was taken into custody and ordered to be deported. \"Lupita has been doing yearly check-ins with ICE and nothing happened,\" said Lucy Sandoval, an activist who has been working with Garcia de Rayos' family. \"But this is a different time.\" Immigration advocates said they believe the woman's detention reflects the Trump administration's hard line on illegal immigration. She could be the first Arizonan to be deported under President Donald Trump's new executive order focused on removing undocumented immigrants with a history of arrests, Garcia's attorney told CNN affiliate KNXV-TV. Any undocumented immigrant convicted or simply charged with a crime who hasn't been adjudicated could be deported under a new Trump administration policy announced last month. Under the Obama administration, only undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors were considered priorities for deportation. In 2008, Garcia de Rayos was arrested in a workplace raid, convicted of felony impersonation and served six months in ICE detention before being released later that year, according to CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK-TV. Originally from Mexico, she was in the country illegally. Immigration officials said she was detained \"based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review which became final in May 2013.\" \"Relevant databases indicate Ms. Garcia De Rayos has a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation,\" the ICE statement said. Activists said the woman's conviction stemmed from a false Social Security card she used for employment. 'She wanted to confront this' Garcia de Rayos prayed before her meeting Wednesday with ICE, Sandoval said. Activists warned her of the possibility of her detention and offered her sanctuary, but she decided to show up, Sandoval said. \"She wanted to confront this,\" the activist said. \"She was brave. ... She's a woman of faith. Yes, they were praying. They were hopeful that there would be some consciousness and some heart.\" On Wednesday evening, seven people were arrested outside the Phoenix ICE office when protesters attempted to block an agency van from taking Garcia de Rayos away. It was unclear if she was to be deported immediately or if she would be held at a detention center. Wednesday's protests were mostly peaceful, but police said on Twitter that \"despite repeated warnings, some engaging in criminal acts\" refused to stop. Garcia de Rayos' husband and teenage children joined the protesters outside ICE headquarters. Asked what she would ask Trump if she could, Garcia de Rayos' daughter Jaqueline told KNXV: \"I'd ask him, 'Why he would want to take her from me?' She hasn't done anything wrong and I'm not scared of him.\" Rights group blames Arpaio's crackdown Immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said that Garcia de Rayos is a victim of the policies of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Enforcing identity theft laws was one of Arpaio's most well-known tools to crack down on illegal immigration in the border state. Puente sued Arpaio, saying the workplace raids -- such as the one where Garcia was arrested nine years ago for using a fake Social Security number -- were unconstitutional and amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. It lost the case on appeal, but Arpaio disbanded the task force that conducted the raids. A crackdown on illegal immigration The immigration executive orders signed by Trump could amount to a vast expansion of authority for individual immigration officers and a dramatic increase in efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. The order lays out a series of categories of undocumented immigrants that immigration law enforcement officials should prioritize for removing from the country, a reaction to what was criticized by the right as lax enforcement of immigration law by President Barack Obama. The Obama administration had prioritized expulsion of undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity, committed serious felony offenses or were habitual misdemeanor criminal offenders. Trump's order goes far beyond that, using a sweeping definition of \"criminal\" and giving a single immigration officer the ability to make judgments on threats to public safety. The order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who \"have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.\"",

The statement said Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces, expressed his condolences to Turkish Gen. Hulusi Akar for the men \"killed as a result of unintended attack by a Russian plane.\" \"The heads of the General Staff agreed to a closer coordination of the joint actions and to exchange information about the situation on the ground,\" the statement said. Turkey and Russia have clashed over other deadly incidents involving the military. In November 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, killing one pilot and injuring another. The two nations disagreed on whether the plane had violated Turkish airspace. Tensions were further strained in December when the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated at an art gallery in Ankara. Ambassador Andrey Karlov's shooting was captured in real time in photos and video that quickly spread through the Internet worldwide. But Turkey and Russia have also worked to broker ceasefires in the Syrian civil war.",

        "Text": "The discovery upends a decades-old theory in the archaeological community that Dead Sea Scrolls were only found in certain caves at the Qumran cliffs, which are managed by Israel in the West Bank. \"Until now, it was accepted that Dead Sea Scrolls were found only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave,\" said Dr. Oren Gutfeld, one of the project's lead archaeologists. Pottery shards, broken scroll storage jars and their lids -- even neolithic flint tools and arrowheads -- littered the cave's entrance. Farther in, there appeared to be a cave-in. After a bit of work with a small pickax, the team made a monumental find: an unbroken storage jar with a scroll. It was rushed to Hebrew University's conservation lab, where it was unfurled in a protected environment. It had no writing; it was placed in the jar to prepare it for writing. But the effort was not in vain. Scientists soon discovered the cave-in was intentional and it hid a tunnel about 16-20 feet in length. \"At some point hidden in the tunnel, we found a few [three] broken storage jars with the lid,\" said Gutfeld. The team also found the cloth coverings and the leather strap that bound the scrolls the jars once held. The team thinks looters ransacked the cave around the 1950s, pointing to pickaxes left in the tunnel as evidence. \"I imagine they came into the tunnel. They found the scroll jars. They took the scrolls,\" said Gutfeld. \"They even opened the scrolls and left everything around, the textiles, the pottery.\" Over the last few years, researchers believe Dead Sea Scroll fragments made their way onto the antiquity black market. According to Gutfeld, that resurgence led authorities and researchers to embark on the task of surveying all the caves at Qumran in the Judean desert. This is likely just the first in a series of Dead Sea Scroll discoveries, said Gutfeld; they have hundreds of caves and many years to go. \"It's a big project. It's a big operation,\" he said by phone. \"We are very optimistic after 60 years we still find new caves with materials that shed new light on the scrolls.\" According to a news release from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the excavations are part of \"Operation Scroll,\" a joint effort by the university, the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria.",

        "Text": "Doctors at Bangalore's Narayana Health City described the complexities of the case to local reporters at a news conference Thursday. The boy, who has not yet been named, was born with polymelia -- a rare congenital birth defect that results in extra limbs or organs, which are usually deformed. \"These are problems that happen from time to time and (are) irrespective of socio-economic status,\" said Dr. Sanjay Rao, a senior consultant pediatric surgeon at Narayana Health City who performed the procedure. Rao told CNN the boy's parents gave him permission to discuss the case publicly. 'Parasitic twin' Polymelia is a genetic disorder, which can be caused by chromosomal abnormalities or environmental agents, according to a paper in the Journal of Clinical Imaging Science. The condition can occur when an embryo develops into conjoined twins, but then one twin stops growing but continues to develop extra limbs or organs, which remain attached to the other twin. This was the case for the boy in Bangalore, according to Rao, and it's referred to as \"parasitic twins,\" according to a press release from the hospital. The presence of an extra twin made the surgery, which took place last week, all the more complex, Rao told CNN. The procedure required a team of 20 doctors, nurses and technicians. \"Because the anatomy is not typical, a lot of work had to be done before the operation to clearly define the anatomy, what structures are shared between the parasitic twin and the main baby, the blood vessels need to be identified to control blood loss so there was a lot of pre-operative work to build a road map that would help us during the operation,\" he said. The exact number of cases of polymelia to date, or the likelihood of them occurring, is unknown but Rao said it's uncommon. It's the fourth case the hospital has dealt with in the past decade-- including one in 2008 on a baby girl, Lakshmi Tatma, born in the northern state of Bihar with four legs and four arms. Tatma's story garnered widespread attention. Thousands of religious devotees flocked to see her because they believed she was a reincarnation of Laxmi, the four-armed Hindu goddess of wealth. The journey The boy was born on January 21 in a government-run rural health center in Puladinni village, located in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. Though the birth went smoothly, doctors realized the extra limbs meant the boy would immediately need specialized medical care. He was transported to a local hospital before traveling over 200 miles with his parents to Narayana Health City the day after he was born. The arduous journey took a severe toll on the infant; when he was admitted on January 24 -- at 3 days old -- he was dehydrated and required oxygen support. Superstitions Superstitions and stigma are often synonymous with cases like these in India, especially if the children represent Hindu deities -- like the case of the girl in Bihar. But the boy's parents, Lalitamma and Chennabasava, were quick to recognize that this was a medical condition that required immediate attention. \"Times are changing. Young parents are now more aware about superstitions,\" said Rao. The baby is expected to be discharged within the next week. His follow up care, like the corrective surgery, will be provided for free by Narayana Health City, something his father who works as a farmer is grateful for. There may be cosmetic issues going forward that could require minor procedures, but he'll have a normal childhood, Rao says.",

        "Text": "It is the second time in two years that Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, has been hospitalized in grave condition, and his wife, Evgenia, claims the Kremlin is to blame. \"The Russian government and President Putin are responsible for what happened to my husband two years ago, and now, one way or another, I'm not saying that they're the ones who did that, but they've created such a climate in our country, that actually encourages this kind of behavior,\" Evgenia said. CNN cannot independently confirm her claims, and Russia has denied any connection to Kara-Murza's illness. \"It's pure nonsense to make any connection of this unfortunate case with President Putin,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN. Doctors in the hospital where Kara-Murza is being treated say they still \"have no real idea\" what caused his illness, but agree that it was triggered by a \"toxic substance,\" his lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told CNN. He said he has no direct proof his client was poisoned. Doctors have diagnosed Kara-Murza with \"acute intoxication by an unidentified substance,\" Evgenia said, adding that the risks are now more serious due to his previous illness in 2015. Kara-Murza is still too weak and ill to speak, but has been communicating by blinking his eyes, Evgenia said. As of Thursday, he began breathing on his own. Evgenia 'terrified' every time husband returns to Russia Kara-Murza, who lives with his wife and three children in Virginia part-time, was in Russia to promote a documentary on the assassination of his late friend, the former leading opposition figure Boris Nemtsov. Nemtsov was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin as he walked home from a restaurant in February 2015. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. Evgenia told CNN that she is \"absolutely terrified\" every time her husband goes back to Russia to do opposition work, but that he is a \"Russian patriot\" committed to his cause. Deputy leader of the Freedom Party, Kara-Murza is also part of the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists who call for open elections, a free press and civil rights reforms. 'My major organs began to fail' CNN spoke to Kara-Murza in 2015, months after his illness nearly killed him. \"I fell into a coma, all of my major organs began failing, one after another. It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver,\" he said at the time. He said he believed his 2015 suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack. \"Frankly there is no other possible reason,\" he said. \"I don't have any money dealings. I don't have any personal enemies. I didn't steal anybody's wife.\" US lawmakers urge investigation Kara-Murza's hospitalization has triggered an outcry from US lawmakers. US Sen. Marco Rubio urged the White House and the State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. \"Vladimir Putin does not deserve any benefit of the doubt here, given how commonplace political assassinations and poisonings have become under his regime,\" said Rubio, a frequent Putin critic. \"I am praying that Kara-Murza's condition improves.\" Speaking about Kara-Murza on Tuesday, US Sen. John McCain delivered a thinly-veiled rebuttal to recent comments by US President Donald Trump that appeared to draw a moral equivalence between the US and Russia. \"Vladimir (Kara-Murza) knew that Putin is a killer. And he's a killer. And he might very well be the next target. Vladimir knew there was no moral equivalence between the United States and Putin's Russia,\" said McCain, who has been a fierce critic of Trump's rhetoric on Russia. McCain's remarks were made after Trump appeared to defend Putin in an interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, who described Putin as a \"killer.\" \"There are a lot of killers,\" Trump said. \"You think our country's so innocent?\" Putin's spokesman called on Fox News to apologize. O'Reilly responded by telling the Kremlin to \"check in with me around 2023.\" The incident comes amid chatter that a potential meeting between Trump and Putin may be on the cards. \"There's nothing certain,\" Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists on a conference call Thursday. \"There is a common understanding that the priority can be and should be the fight against terrorism and the Islamic State. As for other issues, we will work on them after we understand the format of the meeting,\" Peskov said.",

        "Text": "Several nights of clashes have broken out after four police officers purportedly forced a 22-year-old man to the ground, beat him, and anally raped him with a baton at a housing estate in the northern Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois. The officers were suspended pending an inquiry into accusations that they used excessive force while arresting the young man, identified only as Th¨¦o, during an identity check last week. All four officers involved in the February 2 incident have been charged with aggravated assault, while one was also charged with rape, according to the Interior Ministry. Victim describes the incident Th¨¦o said that he was walking with his headphones on when he was approached by the police. \"When I realized how violent their tone was, I said to myself 'they seem pretty serious.' So I stood against the wall, and then, one of the policemen beat me,\" Th¨¦o told France's BFM television channel on Tuesday. \"I saw one of them take his baton and stick it into my bum. As soon as he did that, I fell on my belly. I felt weak. It was as if my body had given up on me. Then, they handcuffed me.\" Th¨¦o appealed for calm, telling BFM he had faith in the justice system. \"I call to calm my city because I love it very much,\" Th¨¦o said from his hospital bed. \"Violence is not the way to support me. Justice will do its job.\" 'Justice for Th¨¦o' The incident has roiled the working class Paris suburb where Th¨¦o was allegedly assaulted, igniting racial tensions. Another night of violence gripped Seine-Saint-Denis, a region northeast of Paris with a large migrant population, on Wednesday. Twenty-six people were arrested, a spokesperson for the local prefecture told CNN. A few miles away, near Paris' M¨¦nilmontant metro station, several hundred demonstrators gathered to protest police violence. Authorities say 17 people were arrested in Aulnay-sous-Bois on Tuesday night, after protesters torched garbage bins and vehicles. Videos shared on social media showed clashes between riot police and youths as fires burned in the streets. Police fired warning shots into the air to disperse the crowd, according to French reports. On Monday, hundreds of peaceful protesters marched in the same northern suburb. Demonstrators carried banners reading \"Justice for Theo\" past a nearby building that had \"police, rapists\" written on it in graffiti. People shared images of the young man with the hashtag #JusticePourTheo on social media, and a photograph of Th¨¦o with bruises under his eyes and a bandage on his cheek was also circulating online. Bruno Beschizza, the mayor of Aulnay-sous-Bois, released a statement about the violence on Facebook, saying that he was not worried about a repeat of riots in 2005, which were sparked by the death of two teenagers while being chased by police in the nearby neighborhood of Clichy-sous-Bois. \"Obviously we are angry,\" the Mayor's office said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Sometimes the anger was expressed peacefully, sometimes not.\" Beschizza, who had called for a strong reaction from the government, said President Francois Hollande's visit to Aulnay-sous-Bois on Tuesday showed that the state supported the community. Hollande visited Th¨¦o at the suburban hospital where he has been treated since the incident. In a photo shared by Hollande on Twitter, the President can be seen standing at Th¨¦o's bedside. In the tweet, Hollande said Th¨¦o \"reacted with dignity\" and urged him to trust in the justice system. Benoit Hamon, the Socialist presidential candidate, has demanded a diligent and transparent investigation. In a tweet he stated that police \"represent the Republic that protects\" and said that \"trust must urgently be restored.\" Th¨¦o: A fun-loving soccer fanatic Friends have described Th¨¦o as a fun-loving person who never spoke out of hate. \"He is a sociable person, who loves to laugh with everyone,\" Hicham, who has played soccer with Th¨¦o, told CNN. Th¨¦o, who plays at the Institute of Private Football in Aulnay-sous-Bois, is a soccer fanatic. That athleticism runs in the family. Th¨¦o's sister, Aur¨¦lie, is a professional handball player on Le Havre AC, a French women's club. In an interview with BFM on Tuesday, Aur¨¦lie said her brother is still in critical condition. It is still unclear what the consequences of the attack may be, she says, but doctors are talking about incontinence.",

I don't think I will ever feel great because it's three back surgeries, four knee operations,\" Woods told former R&A chief executive Peter Dawson in a video interview for Dubai's Vision Magazine at the Burj Al Arab hotel. \"I'm always going to be a little bit sore.

Speaking in east London at the launch of \"Andy Murray Live 2017,\" the Olympic champion said it would be \"incredible\" for tennis fans in Scotland to watch Federer, 35, play at the SSE Hydro on November 7. \"All of us involved in this event are very, very lucky that he's agreed to do it. I'm really looking forward to it,\" added the 29-year-old, who first staged \"Andy Murray Live\" last year. \"He's just really popular everywhere. He said a few years ago that he wants to try to go to places where he's not been so that all his fans can watch him.\" READ: 18 reasons to love the Swiss champion READ: Federer savors \"extra special\" win READ: Federer beats Nadal to win 18th grand slam 'Incredible what Federer did' As well as a singles match between Murray and Federer, this year's event will also feature Murray and his brother, Jamie, taking on former British number one Tim Henman and showman Mansour Bahrami in a doubles match. All proceeds will go to charity. Having offered Federer culinary advice, Murray said he would also learn from Federer's Australian Open triumph and consider taking longer breaks from the sport. Despite having not played competitively for six months as he recovered from injury, Federer won his 18th grand slam in Melbourne last month, beating Rafael Nadal -- another player whose season was hampered by injury last year -- in the final. Murray, by contrast, who had a busy but successful end to 2016 was defeated in the fourth round by world No. 50 Mischa Zverev, the lowest-ranked player the Briton had lost to at a major since 2006. \"It is incredible what he [Federer] did in Australia after such a long break,\" said Murray, who ended 2016 as the world number one following five title wins between October and December. \"In tennis we play so much for a lot of the year that actually sometimes coming into events fresh can also be a huge advantage. \"Roger and Rafa were both coming back after a pretty significant period of time out and they both played extremely well, so maybe that's something that we can all learn from.\" Murray insisted that he did not regard this year's early exit from the Australian Open, where he was regarded as favorite following Novak Djokovic's second-round loss, as a missed opportunity. \"The end of last season was tough,\" he told CNN. \"I played a lot of tennis in a short period of time. I needed to reflect on that. \"I've never been in that position before, competing in the latter stages of nearly every tournament for four months. \"A lot of people think Roger is the best player of all time. Rafa is also one of the best players of all time and Stan Wawrinka was also in my section of the draw. Had I got through the fourth round, Roger, followed by Wawrinka followed by Rafa would've been tough anyway.\"",

        "Text": "Bill Gates is a man on a mission. The 61-year-old co-founder of Microsoft, who has an estimated fortune of nearly $85 billion according to Forbes, is well known for his philanthropic work. In an interview with CNN, recorded in October, Gates talked about his commitment to tackling disease and famine. \"Our foundation focuses on the diseases of poor countries such as malaria, HIV, diarrhea and pneumonia,\" Gates told CNN. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is investing millions in combating mosquito-borne diseases in Latin America. \"In every one of those cases, we've made huge progress. We've cut the number of children under five with diarrhea from 13 million 25 years ago to six million today.\" With his brief laid bare, we asked Gates for advice on tackling some of the biggest challenges facing the globe. How to save the world from disease ... \"We'll never get it to zero,\" said Gates on how to rid the planet of disease. \"But the science today should give us tools to solve a lot of the big killers.\" He said disease could still be \"cut in half,\" eventually reaching a point where \"a child in a poor country doesn't have a dramatically increased chance of dying compared to other children.\" So how do we inspire this scientific innovation in the next generation? \"Understanding what the problems of the world are, I think that stimulates people,\" said Gates, before rushing off to another appointment to spread his message -- and money -- further. ... and famine \"It's about increasing food productivity,\" said Gates matter-of-factly, when asked how to save the world from famine. \"We have one-fifth the productivity in Africa that we have in Europe and the United States. So better seed varieties, access to fertilizer... and the use of cell phones so that market information is more available.\" Gates added that African countries could learn from the way some Asian countries had pulled themselves out of famine and dramatically increased crop production. It's going to be OK While there are still huge challenges facing society, Gates has an optimistic outlook. \"The trend is good,\" he said. \"The reduction in violence, the understanding the science, you know, the treatment of women. We have a lot more to do, but, you know, certainly, 30 years ago, it was a lot worse than it is today.\"",

        "Text": "But thanks to new technology and sophisticated architecture, modern cellars can mimic Mother Nature almost anywhere. Whether high on a hilltop or built into a bunker, beautiful wine storage solutions can now be found in some surprising places. \"Today, putting a wine cellar in your 33rd-floor apartment is just as easy as in an underground cellar,\" says James Molesworth, senior editor of Wine Spectator. Molesworth points to ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc, in Bordeaux, as an exemplary above-ground wine cellar. \"For me the key is combining both visual eye candy with actual practicality and efficiency,\" says Molesworth. Above ground Designed by Christian de Portzamparc, ChÃ¢teau Cheval Blanc's undulating white facade appears at home on a hilltop in the French countryside, complete with its own grassy rooftop. Stretching across 19,685 square feet, the avant-garde cellar streams natural light across artfully lined rows of concrete white vats. \"All the vats are cement and pear-shaped, corresponding to parcel sizes on the vineyard,\" says Molesworth. Carefully labeled with the plot number, capacity, grape variety and date planted, these vats allow Cheval Blanc to manage fine details within a vast vineyard. \"By devoting individual vats to each plot, the winemaking team can pick each parcel when they wish, and then manage smaller and smaller vinifications before eventual blending,\" says Molesworth. \"In essence, they are handling the vineyards at its smallest pixilation, then assembling the final picture -- or blend -- from that,\" says Molesworth. Precision storage Another unconventional cellar -- albeit subterranean -- is Hong Kong's Crown Wine Cellars in Shouson Hill, discretely hidden on the south side of Hong Kong Island. Buried 60 feet underground inside a network of former military bunkers, the cellars are accessed through a concrete tunnel that opens into a series of 1,000-square-foot chambers, each of which are protected by 3-foot-thick reinforced concrete walls. While it appears rugged on the outside, the cellar's interior features state-of-the-art climate-control technology to protect its clients' rare vintages stored inside. \"Temperature and humidity are the two key things -- a quiet, stable environment too, with no vibration,\" says Molesworth of an ideal cellaring environment. \"You wouldn't put a wine cellar under train tracks, basically.\" The perfect conditions? Approximately 70% humidity, stable temperatures between 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit, and little to no light. \"Ideally, wine should be stored in a dark space as ultraviolet light destroys wine -- hence colored glass bottles,\" says Adam Bilbey, a wine specialist with auction house Sotheby's. \"And wine should be kept lying still at a perfectly horizontal angle.\" Contemporary classics Of course, even with an influx of contemporary cellars, the classics aren't going anywhere. Take US billionaire William Koch's now famous Palm Beach wine cellar in Florida, which pays homage to traditional European cellars of days gone by. One of three extraordinary facilities he maintains -- the other two are in Aspen, Colorado and Cape Cod, Massachusetts -- its underground labyrinth of Austrian red bricks and custom-built arched doorways houses a selection of the wines from his 20,000-bottle collection, one of the largest in the US. \"An incredible attention to detail was needed to create this masterpiece. With Koch's legendary collection of wine, it was fitting it should be cellared in such a beautiful way,\" says Bilbey. Explore some of the world's most beautiful wine cellars in the gallery above.",

        "Text": "Women with male characteristic brains are three times more likely to have autism than women with more \"female\" brains, the researchers say. Yet the reverse was not been proven true; no evidence indicates that men with more female-trait brains are less at risk for autism than men with typical brains. Autism is considered a neurodevelopmental condition, which means symptoms begin early and children fail to achieve typical milestones of maturity at appropriate ages. Common symptoms include difficulty with communication and repetitive behaviors. In the United States, about one in 68 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The term \"spectrum\" refers to the fact that symptoms, levels of disability and positive skills may vary from person to person. For example, some people along the spectrum cannot make eye contact or follow simple directions, while others may be exceptional at math. And, as they age, some children with autism will learn to function more or less normally, while others will require substantial support to perform basic activities. Autism spectrum disorder is two to five times more common in males than in females, according to Christine Ecker, lead author of the new study and a professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Though some researchers say sex differences in symptoms account for different rates of diagnosis, others hypothesize that sex-related variations in brain anatomy may contribute to the higher risk among males. Gender differences For the new study, Ecker and her co-authors examined whether brain anatomy differences led to a higher probability of autism in males. Specifically, they looked at cortical thickness: the depth of gray matter across the surface of the cortex. \"For example, it is known from previous studies that females tend to have a thicker cortex than males in various regions of the brain,\" Ecker wrote in an email. Previous studies have also shown thickness to be significantly altered in people with autism. Study participants included 98 high-functioning adults with autism (49 of them men) and 98 adults without autism (51 of them men). Both groups were roughly within the same age range: mid-20s, on average. The researchers excluded anyone with a history of psychiatric disorders, head injuries, certain genetic disorders or other medical conditions affecting brain function, such as epilepsy. People taking mood stabilizers and other medications were also excluded. The researchers conducted MRI brain scans on each participant and then derived cortical thickness patterns for each using a software program. After anonymizing this information, Ecker and her colleagues made predictions about which participants were male or female based on cortical thickness and overall physical characteristics, also referred to as the \"brain phenotype.\" \"We found that brain phenotype ranged from being typically female to typically male, and that there is variability between these extremes,\" Ecker said. This is true of all of us: Regardless of sex, our brains fall somewhere along a continuum, with extreme male and extreme female at either end. The variety in the middle is healthy and normal, said Ecker. Among the study participants, 68.1% of the biological female brains fell closer to the female extreme while 74.5% of biological male brains fell closer to the male extreme. Hope for earlier diagnoses Cortical thickness did not unfailingly identify female or male brains, but the researchers found a constellation of sex-related brain structure differences, and based on this, they were able to separate males from females in most cases. \"Overall, our approach was approximately 74% accurate in predicting biological sex based on brain anatomy,\" Ecker said. Further analyzing the data, Ecker and her colleagues discovered that the probability of autism increased significantly among the participants, whether male or female, whose brain phenotype was more typical of males. In fact, female participants with brain anatomy more typical of males were three times more likely to have autism than females with a more typical brain. With this approach, autism risk could be estimated \"for individuals based on how characteristically female or male their brain is,\" Ecker explained. Though she and her colleagues have examined only adult brains so far, Ecker said \"in future research, we are hoping to apply our approach to younger age groups as well.\" Early use of this method in a child's life could offer earlier diagnosis among those who might then benefit from earlier intervention, she said. Early training is known to have the best results for normalizing children with autism. According to Dr. Tuong-Vi Nguyen, an assistant professor at McGill University in Montreal, the new study is \"provocative\" with \"good methodology.\" Nguyen, who was not involved in the current study, has investigated the sex-specific effects of testosterone on brain structure between ages 4 and 24. \"Given that the authors' predominant theory is that a male-typic brain represents a predisposition to autism, their results only partially confirm this,\" she said. She suggested a more conservative rephrasing of the new study's main finding: \"Female, high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (a very small portion of the overall autism spectrum disorder population), have an increased likelihood of showing a male-typic pattern of brain structure, more specifically, male-typic patterns of cortical thickness.\" She cites the fact that \"there was no significant decrease in autism spectrum disorder risk if males had a more female-typic brain structure.\" \"It is definitely too early to say if these neuroimaging tools could be used clinically to predict\" autism spectrum disorder, she said, adding that \"no change to current clinical management can be derived from the results of this study.\"",

It will kick off a series of high-profile sporting events in Asia over the next four years, with Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the host city for the Winter Olympics in 2022. READ: Ski like a South Korean To avoid any potential confusion with North Korea's capital Pyongyang, the PyeongChang resort -- which is 50 miles south of the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries -- has changed its name for the Games, capitalizing the C for the first time. A record 102 gold medals will be up for grabs in 15 disciplines at PyeongChang 2018, while four events will be making their Winter Olympic debuts, with the introduction of Big Air snowboarding -- athletes performing tricks after launching from large jumps -- giving the Games a youthful vibe. A $78 million, 50,000-capacity temporary Olympic Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies, is set to be completed in September. It's one of six new venues being built. In total, 13 venues, split between PyeongChang and neighboring city Gangneung, will be used during the 17 days of the Games. Impeachment & political scandals Yet, as the 12-month countdown begins, South Koreans have been distracted by other events. The country's Constitutional Court is deliberating a motion to impeach President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal which sparked weeks of protests in the capital Seoul. It is a far cry from the deafening cheers which greeted the 2011 announcement that the ski resort of PyeongChang, about 180km east of Seoul, would host the Winter Olympics. READ: South Korea presidential scandal - what you need to know Companies have reportedly been reluctant to sign up to sponsorship deals, leaving the organizing committee with a shortfall. The total cost for the Games is said to be just over $10 billion, a contrast to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics which cost five times more. Lee Hee-beom, president of PyeongChang 2018, told reporters this week: \"Some part was affected by the political scandal, and some part by the situation of the economy.\" He said he's hoping the Games can help shake off the \"negative image\" that came from what he called \"a series of unsubstantiated rumors\" associated with the political scandal. \"Some even went as far as saying we should give up on hosting the Olympics,\" he said. \"But, fortunately, the prevailing opinion is that we should all try to restore our national pride with the Olympics. And we're concentrating only on holding a successful Olympics. \"I know that we are criticized for little public awareness of the 2018 Winter Olympics. I expect the one-year countdown event will add momentum to boost public awareness worldwide.\" 'North Korea is not the exception' The Games are being held in a province which witnessed fierce battles during the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce not a peace treaty. South Korea had rejected the North's suggestion to co-host the Games by holding some of the skiing events at its Masik resort, in Kangwon, east of the capital Pyongyang. North Korea has previously sent teams to participate in recent international sporting events held in the South and Lee urged North Korea to send athletes to the Games. \"The basic principles of Olympics is peace,\" he told reporters. \"Anyone who loves peace should participate, have the right to participate. There is no exception. North Korea is not the exception.\"",

        "Text": "Do you have a boyfriend? How much money do you make? When will you get married and have children? Why don't you move home and work for Big Uncle? And why, why, why are you so fat? The pressure to settle down and start popping out offspring can be such that many young Chinese people rent actors -- for upwards of $200 a night -- to pretend to be their romantic partner through the Spring Festival holiday period, which ends Saturday, and help them stave off awkward questions. \"Young people are delaying marriage, but their parents still use the old standard to ask them to get married and have children 'on time',\" said Yue Qian, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia. These pressures lie behind the success of a viral video in the run up to the vacation. \"A Spring Festival Survival Guide,\" has attracted more than a million views on various platforms in the past month, including over 300,000 on YouTube, which is blocked in mainland China, showing that family pressures don't care about international borders. The song is both a pastiche of traditional Spring Festival stresses, and a rip-roaring anthem to individualism, ending with the defiant chorus: Encore The success of \"Survival Guide\" -- called \"What I Do Is For Your Own Good\" in English -- is even more surprising given its source, not some Chinese popstar or viral video factory, but a traditional chamber choir. The Rainbow Chamber Singers (RCS) were founded in 2010 by conductor Jin Chengzhi and a small group of his fellow students at the prestigious Shanghai Conservatory of Music. The choir puts on a concert every six months, performing old favorites and newly written traditional-style choral pieces. Since 2016, Jin has also been mixing it up with his own compositions, which mix serious music with comedic lyrics and social commentary. \"Where On Earth Did You Leave the Key, Zhang Shichao?\" a kazoo-heavy castigation of ungrateful roommates, was the choir's first major hit, Jin said. They followed it with \"So Far, the Sofa is So Far,\" an anthem for China's \"overtime dogs,\" the millions of underpaid millennials working long hours for abusive bosses. The choir's music deals with stresses common to young people, said Eric Fish, author of \"China's Millennials,\" and growing levels of rebellion against them. \"Young people are steadily pushing back against pressures to get married quickly and gun for the most stable and lucrative job,\" Fish said. Jin -- who describes himself as a \"rational optimist\" -- said that his work comes from his own experiences and anxieties, but that he hopes the songs \"can bring people understanding and hope for life.\" \"Though 'So Far, the Sofa is So Far' describes the miserable overtime life of working young people, the core of the song is that you should choose your own lifestyle,\" he said. \"These conflicts are worth discussing because they are happening right now in our daily lives. No matter if it's working overtime or the generation gap, I think we are responsible for society and can make young people's voices heard.\" Diversity Choral music in China can be quite conservative, with many people's experience being limited to groups that sing so-called \"red songs,\" music that dates back to the founding of the People's Republic or the Cultural Revolution and which is often heavy on Communist ideology and references to Mao Zedong. The Rainbow Chamber Singers, on the other hand, are keen to reinvent the genre. \"Good music must be diverse,\" Jin said. \"If you stick to something for no reason, the art will lose its original charm.\" Their approach has proved a hit with audiences of all ages. \"Once after a performance, four old ladies in their seventies from Anhui were waiting backstage for my autograph,\" Jin said. \"That moved me a lot.\" Speaking out As they become more assertive and influential, China's millennials are producing and consuming pop culture that speaks to their concerns and helps spread a feeling of solidarity about certain issues. \"There have been all sorts of media articles, personal accounts and memes in the past few years relating to overbearing family pressure,\" Fish said. \"I think these reflect a growing frustration among young people with antiquated attitudes towards life.\" In this sense, he added, the choir's song acts as \"a rallying cry to stand up and resist.\" \"Underlying the growing visibility of the pressures (placed on them) is also the young generation's growing self-expression,\" said Yue. \"It's not necessarily rebellion. I think the younger generation want to communicate with the older generation and hope (they) can understand their worldviews and life choices.\" And at least in Jin's case, one family has gotten the message: \"My relatives all heard 'What I Do Is For Your Own Good.' So I had a very comfortable Spring Festival.\"",

        "Text": "For investigators attempting to track down sex traffickers and their victims, these online advertisements can contain critical clues. The smallest of details in a room could give away its location, but there are too many ads for law enforcement to scan each of them for clues. That's where TraffickCam comes in. It's a simple phone app that uses crowdsourced snapshots of hotel rooms to help law enforcement locate victims and prosecute sex traffickers. Any travelers pit stopping at a hotel can turn on their phone's GPS location and upload photos of the room from four different angles to TraffickCam's database. The idea is that law enforcement agencies can then check adverts featuring suspected trafficking victims in hotel rooms against TraffickCam's database of photos. Stand up to modern slavery on March 14 -- #MyFreedomDay TraffickCam's image analysis tools transform the photos into a number of data points, using features such as patterns on the carpet, paintings on the wall and landmarks out of the window. The various data points in the photos play an important role in matching the location. TraffickCam is the brainchild of Exchange Initiative and a team of researchers at Washington University. Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph provided a $100,000 matching grant to begin development of the app, and private donations are made through the non-profit St. Louis Community Foundation. \"This is an easy way for citizens to take a stand against sex trafficking by simply taking photos,\" Kimberly Ritter, director for development for Exchange Initiative, tells CNN. Since launching in June 2016, Ritter says that more than 150,000 hotels have been added to the TraffickCam database. \"We have over 100,000 people using the app right now, and we're hoping that more will join us to take action and fight this fight,\" she says. Tracing the traffickers But even if the database identifies the location of a hotel room, Ritter says it is \"luck of the draw\" whether the victim is still there. This is because traffickers often post photographs from one location to advertise services in another, she explains. Another strategy is for traffickers to base themselves in a central location and post ads in multiple cities. They then drive the girls to different cities, depending on where they get responses to the ads. \"Local girls that are working locally with local pimps will be using local photos, the majority of the time,\" Sergeant Adam Kavanaugh, supervisor of the St. Louis County Multi-Jurisdictional Human Trafficking Task Force, tells CNN. In these cases Kavanaugh imagines TraffickCam could help investigators identify the hotel to prepare an effective sting operation. But when it comes to tracking down what Kavanaugh calls the \"travelers\" -- trafficking victims that are moved all around the United States -- the app may be more useful in showing movement across state lines. \"We can then make a federal case because of the inter-state commerce,\" says Kavanaugh. This could result in a longer sentence for a convicted trafficker. Putting TraffickCam to the test Before the app can be rolled out to law enforcement agencies across the United States, it is being tested by Kavanaugh and the St. Louis County Police Department. \"Right now we're just beta testing the St Louis area, and we're getting positive hits,\" he says, referring to ads that match hotel room photos in the database. Following initial testing in this small area, Kavanaugh feels optimistic about the role TraffickCam can play in identifying both hotel rooms and routes traffickers are using. \"Technology drives everything we do nowadays, and this is just one more tool that law enforcement can use to make our job a little safer and a little bit easier,\" he says. Ritter hopes the app will be available to all law enforcement in the US by Spring 2017, and will eventually be available worldwide. \"With this being such new and cutting-edge technology, we need to perfect it here in the States and then we'll look to making it globally accessible,\" says Ritter. Global users can already download the app and upload photos to the database. Ritter says that all photographs uploaded on TraffickCam from all over the world are being stored for future use. Why hotels? The US National Human Trafficking Hotline found hotels and motels to be a common venue for sex trafficking, with nearly 10 percent of known trafficking cases reported to them in 2016 taking place in a hotel or motel -- although Polaris, which operates the hotline, believes the real figure is much higher. Just under 10 percent of cases were commercial-front brothels, and in nearly eight percent of cases the venue was unknown. Less than five percent of cases were street-based. The app will only be able to narrow in on exact locations if enough photos are added to the database, but Ritter firmly believes people will continue to add them. \"It's amazing how many people are interested in fighting this atrocity,\" she says. \"The more of us that join together to fight this crime, the better the opportunity we have to eradicate it.\"",

        "Text": "It was a dreadful start in NASA's quest to reach the moon. January 28 marked 21 years since space shuttle Challenger broke up 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven aboard. Last week, NASA commemorated the lives of seven crew members who perished 14 years ago when space shuttle Columbia disintegrated above Earth during its re-entry. Even on successful missions, crews face a multitude of issues in space. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station are exposed to radiation levels 10 times that of Earth, leading to increased cancer risks. Seventy-nine percent of astronauts are affected by space motion sickness. The heart deconditions; the immune system weakens; bones lose minerals and density at a rate of 1% per month. Fluids redistribute themselves around the body and away from the legs, and for older astronauts, near vision deteriorates. It goes without saying that astronauts are made of stern stuff. Now retired, Capt. Scott Kelly and Shuttle Commander Mark Kelly are two of a select bunch to leave our planet and put everything on the line in doing so, not for the betterment of themselves but for mankind. For that reason, above all, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has chosen the identical twins for the CNN series \"My Hero.\" \"It's easy to look at it in retrospect and say 'that was a really cool thing that you did,' but the reality is that they had to take a lot of chances,\" Gupta said. \"They had to take a lot of risks. They had to say goodbye to their family and friends and with not the clear understanding that they'd ever see them again. \"That's a really hard thing to do in the pursuit of trying to learn something for all of humanity.\" Mark Kelly was selected as an astronaut in 1996, flying in four missions from 2001 to 2011 aboard Endeavor and Discovery. He visited the ISS four times and clocked over 50 days in space. Kelly's final mission, the last flight of the space shuttle Endeavor, took place as his wife, then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, recovered from an assassination attempt in January 2011. Also selected for the space program in 1996, Scott Kelly took part in four missions from 1999 to 2016, the first and second aboard NASA shuttles, the third and fourth on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He totaled 520 days off Earth, the second highest of any astronaut. It was Scott's last mission that would unite the twins, who never went into space at the same time. In November 2012, Scott was chosen to participate in the One-Year Mission, a year-long stay aboard the ISS with cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko. The purpose of the mission, to discover more about the long-term effects of space on the human body, required extensive testing of Scott aboard the ISS. But to strengthen the results, the test also required a control subject. Enter Mark. Part of NASA's Human Research Program, the Twins Study was formed of the Kelly twins along with ten researchers, who analyzed samples from Mark and Scott taken before, during and after the mission. Their initial findings, first released January 26, have begun shedding light on the transformations the body undergoes when in space. At a biological level, the team found a decline in bone formation during the second half of Scott's mission, as well as altered gene expression and increased levels of a metabolite in his gut. But the body's response to a flu jab remained the same in orbit, while a \"space gene\" -- a hypothetical change to Scott's genome sequence, triggered by space -- continues to elude scientists (they're still looking). Part of the Twins Study involved tests measuring body response, posture and dexterity. The thrust behind the move is to see how the human body will fare on a six month journey to Mars -- and how fit astronauts will be when they reach the planet. The Functional Task Test found no substantial difference between the results of astronauts in space for six months and a year. However reaction time and accuracy decreased in microgravity. Ahead of a full report due this year, John Charles, chief scientist at the Human Research Program, said in a statement that the results \"have not identified any show-stoppers for longer human spaceflight missions.\" The race for Mars is well and truly on. \"Probably the biggest impediment to just going (to Mars) is the cost,\" Scott said in September, adding that if that could be overcome, the technology would follow. He also said he'd put himself forward for the three-year mission. With a bevy of data on Scott's body in space, it would be hard to discount the retired astronaut. As well as an exploratory mission, the venture could lay the groundwork for something more profound. \"NASA believes in redundant systems, and Earth is a system, so if at some point it became feasible to maybe make Mars somewhat like Earth, then there would be a lot of value to that,\" Scott said. \"We don't know how climate's going to affect this planet that we live on,\" Gupta argued. \"We need to start thinking about other places in the universe that we may have to live one day. In order to understand how to do that, we've got to understand what it's going to do to us first.\" That's why, in the long term, the Twins Study -- and the sacrifices of Mark and Scott Kelly -- is so important. When the full report comes out this year, we'll be one step closer to the Martian surface -- and perhaps a new home for us all.",

        "Text": "Every woman has experienced something like this: being ignored in a meeting, not included in a client dinner, interrupted while speaking, told she's being \"emotional\" when she disagrees or feels strongly about something, passed over for opportunities, or asked to grab the snacks for the meeting. I recently listened to a panel of female CFOs warn an audience of thousands of women about these daily hits a woman can face as she climbs the ladder. One executive in her late 50s, the CFO of a $400 million company, recounted the time she was asked to take notes during a meeting with her male colleagues. It happened last year. (\"I laughed and said no,\" she said.) If you think this type of behavior is a fast receding relic of an earlier time when older white men ruled the country, you'd be wrong. It's actually a sign of the times: Listen to Sen. Lindsey Graham crow that silencing Warren was \"long overdue.\" Or former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee tweet about \"Sen. Warren aka 'scold.'\" This kind of everyday sexism is not getting scrubbed from the culture as we \"advance\" -- it's getting worse and girls internalize this at a very young age. Recent research showed that at the age of five, girls were more likely to guess that a story about a \"really, really smart person\" was describing a female. By age six, just one year later, girls were more likely to predict that the story was about a male. And if that shift isn't alarming enough, consider that one of the researchers noted that in the past, girls were at least seven before they made this shift. The key to reversing this is teaching confidence to girls and women, who too often silence themselves with the habits of hesitation and self-doubt. Confidence is one of the most important skills you can have in life. Notice, I said skill. For a long time I misunderstood confidence. I thought it was a personality trait or a feeling. It's neither. It's a skill that you develop through deliberate action -- something to be actively encouraged in colleagues and friends, daughters and sisters. Confidence is the ability to \"hear\" your own ideas and lean into them -- to raise your hand, raise your standards, raise your concerns and raise your voice. To persist -- knowing that whether you succeed or fail, are criticized or applauded, you'll survive. The more you act, the more competency builds and it gets easier to put yourself out there the next time. Research shows that it's the most confident people who are the most admired, listened to, and highly regarded. For women, this is acutely important. In one study, managers cited \"lack of confidence\" as the primary reason not to promote a woman, yet they didn't feel comfortable telling her. Elizabeth Warren is a woman who displays tremendous confidence. As a senator, she is fearless and unwavering in her questioning and an excellent example of one of my favorite quotes from activist Maggie Kuhn: \"Speak your mind -- even if your voice shakes.\" Warren is one of the few people who isn't afraid of crossing Donald Trump, at every turn. Perhaps that's why it struck such a chord to see her get interrupted, berated and silenced by McConnell as she tried to read from Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor. Yes, she apparently violated an arcane rule, but why then were her male colleagues able to read from the letter uninterrupted? Sen. Tom Udall read it in its entirety. Of course, the line from Mitch McConnell says it all -- she was warned and \"nevertheless, she persisted\" --giving rise to the trending hashtag #ShePersisted. But persist is exactly what we and all of our daughters need to do to succeed. Despite what they say about you or how much you doubt yourself, persist. On a practical level here is how to do this: Speak, even when your voice shakes. No one can take your confidence away from you. Only you can do that. You don't have to feel ready or think you're the kind of \"person who would do such a thing.\" You can. Just ask Rosa Parks. She gave a remarkable interview on Pacifica radio a month after her historic act of civil disobedience. She was described by all as a quiet and shy woman, and in fact viewed herself the same way. In the interview she said she didn't think she was \"capable of doing such a thing.\" She sure was. Take the action -- and your mind will follow. That's confidence -- the decision to bet on yourself. Warren may have been shut down on the Senate floor, but she didn't shut up. She spoke up. \"The Republicans took away my right to read this letter on the floor -- so I'm right outside, reading it now,\" she said in a Facebook live video immediately after McConnell silenced her -- and then she did what he tried to prevent her from doing: Read the letter from Coretta Scott King. The video has almost 7.5 million views -- crushing the number of people who watched the Sessions' hearing on C-Span. Thanks to her confidence, everyone is now talking about this topic. That is the message that should be heard by women everywhere -- if it matters to you, persist. Confidence isn't about what other people say or do. It's about what you say and do. We women and all of our daughters need to say and do a lot more, and a lot more often.",

        "Text": "In this young presidency, there seems to be a new slogan: The buck stops ... there. Or anywhere else, actually. If the White House loses its immigration case before the courts, blame the judges. And if there's some sort of attack, it's their fault, too. Trump tweets: \"If something happens, blame him (the Washington state judge) and court system.\" Likewise, if there was confusion at airports worldwide, don't blame the President's hastily arranged travel ban rollout, blame a Delta computer outage, protesters and, of course, the tears of Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer. And what about the actual decision to sign the executive order? Instead of owning it, the President made it clear that, well, he wanted to take more time on implementation, but \"the law enforcement people\" told him otherwise. \"So I wanted to give like a month, then I said, well what about a week? They said well then you're going to have a whole pile of people -- perhaps, perhaps -- with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions. So there it is folks, it's as plain as you can have it.\" In other words, don't look at me; I'm just the President. And speaking of presidents, when was the last time one went out of his way to stoke fear about a possible terror attack? How about Wednesday, when Donald Trump made the case that he knows much more than the public does (as one would expect) and therefore knows we should be very afraid, especially without the travel ban. \"Believe me,\" he said at a session with law enforcement officials. \"I've learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\" Spreading fear may be a part of a deliberate strategy to encourage support for the ban, but that's a campaign strategy. It doesn't sit well in the oval office. Perhaps there is much more to learn. After all, the President's connection to government, and public service, isn't a long thread. Previously, his link to politics has been buying the favor of public servants, as he told us many times during the campaign. What's more, he has not even been the CEO of a publicly held corporation. He's been the chairman of a private family business, surrounding himself with those indebted to him, and blood relatives. (Paging: Ivanka Trump and Nordstrom) Suddenly, the President finds himself in a world in which he faces co-equal branches of government and foreign leaders who are responsive to public opinion in their own countries, rather than to his opinion. (Exception: Friend Vladimir Putin) In business, Trump is king. So while he may understand the separation of powers, he simply rejects the notion. In his view, the 9th Circuit judges were \"disgraceful\" when they interrogated lawyers. In fact, the very idea that the branches of government don't simply salute when the President wants to do something is anathema to him, considering what he has known his whole life. It's not disgraceful; it's democracy. Just ask Judge Gorsuch.",

        "Text": "\"The dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions,\" the new US ambassador to the United Nations said. \" ... The United States stands with the people of Ukraine who have suffered for nearly three years under Russian occupation and military intervention. Until Russia and the separatists it supports respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territory integrity this crisis will continue.\" Haley went on to say that the US Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine. The statement came as a horrific spike in violence was taking place in eastern Ukraine, killing dozens and bringing more than 11,000 explosions in one day alone along the front line, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Haley's tough talk could have come straight out of the Obama administration playbook. But whether the harsh tongue-lashing against Russia reflected the views of the newest occupant of the White House is not entirely clear. Indeed, fast-forward to Sunday and Vice President Mike Pence was telling George Stephanopoulos in an interview that aired on ABC's \"This Week\" that the Trump administration will decide in the coming months whether to lift sanctions against Russia in return for joint action against ISIS and international terrorism. The diplomatic mixed signals could not have happened at a worse time and have left Ukrainian diplomats scrambling for more clarification from the Trump White House. In Kiev, the feeling is that Russian sanctions are the only remaining hammer left in an increasingly ineffective diplomatic toolbox. And should Washington withdraw support for sanctions, it could very well trigger a chain reaction, whereby European Union states such as Italy and Greece follow suit. There are already hints that the Trump administration will lift sanctions, but in a step-by-step process. As violence began to flare in eastern Ukraine, the White House announced it is loosening sanctions imposed by Barack Obama on Russia's Federal Security Service. Could the next step be a reversal of the expulsion of Russian diplomats ordered by Obama in the last days of his presidency? Whatever future action taken by the White House, one thing is abundantly clear: Tensions along the front line in eastern Ukraine have never been higher, and the prospect for a full-blown escalation is real. Both sides have moved plenty of heavy weaponry out of storage and in close proximity to each other. Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, proscribed by the Minsk agreement, are also back in action. The human toll is almost incalculable: Several dozen deaths in the past days have brought the total death toll since the conflict began in 2014 close to 10,000. Most of the action has taken place in the flashpoint industrial city of Avdiivka, home to about 20,000 people and the location of a coke and chemical plant that not only provides heating to the surrounding community but also the raw material for Ukraine's vital steel industry. Alexander Hug, the Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said that continued shelling, especially at the coke plant, could trigger a humanitarian and ecological disaster. Also worrisome is that fighting has resumed in previously quiet areas, including those close to the strategic port city of Mariupol. Though the Ukrainian side is far more battle-ready than when the conflict first began, there are real fears the rebel side is positioning to take more ground. After the humiliating fall of Debaltseve, it is unlikely that Kiev will ignore increasing belligerence from the rebel side. If sanctions are lifted, they will likely have no choice but to move toward escalation. This could also lead to anxious and unpredictable actions on the part of Kiev. The clear signal I picked up during a recent visit to Ukraine is that its people are feeling increasingly abandoned and can no longer rely on traditional, international security guarantees. As Ukrainian parliamentarian Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska says, Ukraine needs to hear from the \"guarantors of the Western order\" that it will not be left alone in its battle against outside aggressors. Few people would disagree that the Minsk agreements have had little impact in bringing peace to the battle-weary people of eastern Ukraine. But they are the only markers, signed by all sides, that set standards of behavior in a conflict that has displaced about 3 million and could force many thousands more to flee. Contradictory messages by the White House on Russia could ignite the fuse that pushes this grinding conflict beyond the point of no return.",

        "Text": "But the country shrugged off suggestions it should be doing more to intervene in the rogue state's military affairs, pinning the test down to Pyongyang's testy relations with Washington and Seoul. North Korean state media hailed the Sunday test as a success, claiming a previously unpublicized part of the country's arsenal -- a Pukguksong-2, an intermediate-range missile -- was launched under the supervision of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea is prohibited from carrying out ballistic missile launches under UN Security Council resolutions aimed in part at curbing the country's development of nuclear weapons. China's Foreign Ministry said that his country was opposed to launch activities in violation of the resolutions. \"Under current circumstances, relevant sides should not provoke each other or take actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing Monday. \"As I have pointed out repeatedly in the past, the root cause to the North Korea nuclear missile issue is the conflicts between North Korea and the United States, as well as between North and South Korea.\" North Korea's relationship with China -- its most important ally -- has kept Pyongyang afloat as sanctions have crippled and isolated it from the rest of the world. But in recent years, China has taken a tougher line on the North Korean nuclear program, voting in favor of UN sanctions and issuing condemnations when it conducts provocative military tests. Russia's Foreign Ministry also spoke out against the test, the first since US President Donald Trump's inauguration, saying in a statement that it was in \"defiant disregard\" of UN resolutions. Russia and China were both members of the Six Party Talks -- a diplomatic attempt to curb North Korea's nuclear program that started in 2003 -- along with the US, Japan, and North and South Korea. 'Clear provocation to Japan' The United Nations Security Council said it plans to hold consultations on an \"urgent basis\" Monday afternoon regarding North Korea, according to the US Mission to the UN. The meeting was requested by the US, South Korea and Japan -- whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting President Trump in the US when the missile was fired and landed in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. Abe said that the test was \"absolutely intolerable,\" while President Trump said that the United States \"stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%.\" Japan's chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the fact the launch came as Abe met with Trump made it \"a clear provocation to Japan and the region.\" Tokyo has already lodged protests against North Korea via its embassy in Beijing, he said. What can the Pukguksong-2 do? Sunday's test has stoked concerns that Pyongyang may be getting closer to a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile than previously thought. The Pukguksong-2 is nuclear-capable, state media claims, and can travel from 3,000 to 5,500 kilometers (1,864 to 3,417 miles). A US official said the missile tested traveled 500 kilometers (310 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan and that it was launched from North Pyongan province. It is believed to have used a solid-fuel propelled engine which enables faster launch and increases the mobility of the launch process, according to a spokesman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman. The Joint Chiefs also believe that Pyongyang employed a cold-launching system, in which the missile is lifted off the ground using pressure and then ignited mid-flight, as opposed to igniting it on the ground -- which is said to be less stable, the spokesman said. Kim expressed satisfaction over \"the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means, which adds to the tremendous might of the country,\" state media reported.",

        "Text": "In his previous US visits, Trudeau found a leader almost exactly aligned with his liberal worldview and youthful image. In return, then-President Barack Obama met with Trudeau often, counseling his younger ally on how to best advocate for the progressive agenda he championed. Now, Trudeau is arriving to a very different White House. He will balance the need to maintain close ties with a mandate from anxious Canadians to press Trump on his more controversial views. The meeting is Trump's third official visit from a head of government at the White House. In his first three weeks in office, he's also welcomed the British and Japanese prime ministers, and will host Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday. Trump's previous bilateral sessions were marked by comity and a focus on shared priorities. But in Trudeau, Trump will encounter a leader further apart from him in both age and global outlook than his previous two visitors. Aides both in Washington and Ottawa insist Trump and Trudeau will seek to emphasize neighborly bonds during their first face-to-face meeting, but their stylistic approaches will be on full view during a midday news conference. Disputes between the US and Canada rarely veer into anything resembling combativeness, though disagreements do exist, including on the import of softwood lumber and, under Obama, the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Canada supports (Trump took action early in his term to restart the process of building the oil pipeline). Under Trump, however, the differences between the two countries could become more plain. Trudeau, a 45-year-old liberal, has made a point of actively welcoming refugees fleeing war in Syria, even visiting the Toronto airport in 2015 to greet a planeload of migrants. When Trump signed his controversial executive order barring Syrian refugees entry into the country, Trudeau wrote a pointed message on Twitter: \"To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength. #WelcomeToCanada.\" The message was accompanied by a photo of the Prime Minister greeting a young girl during his 2015 visit to the airport. Even then, though, Trudeau refused to actively criticize the immigration order, which is currently mired in legal challenges and, for now, on hold. He said Friday he planned to discuss \"all sorts of things that we align on\" with Trump, but would also confront areas of disagreement \"in a respectful way,\" Refugee policy isn't the only divide between Trudeau and Trump. The leaders have expressed vastly differing views on climate change and economic policy as well. Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, the US, and Canada, though detailed talks about what's to be included in a new accord weren't likely to be hashed out Monday.",

Russia's Defense Ministry released a statement Monday saying they have detected \"an upsurge in truck movement\" near the ancient site that indicates that ISIS is planning to cause even more damage to the ancient complex. \"We have detected an upsurge in truck movement near the ancient city amid Syrian troops' successful advance on Palmyra,\" the statement reads. \"This indicates that Daesh (ISIS) wants to bring in explosives to deal maximum damage to the remaining architectural relics before they leave.\" ISIS' enemies line up to take Raqqa, but when -- and how? Footage shows wrecked sites Footage from a Russian Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) shows the uptick in movement from ISIS' trucks in the region, showing \"ISIS intentions to deliver explosives in order to cause maximum damage to the leaving architectural monuments before their retreat.\" The same footage, the statement claims, also shows the destruction already wrought by the group, including the facade of the Roman theater and Tetrapylon column -- a square building erected in 270 AD -- along with the Triumphal Arch, Lion of Al-lÄt, Temple of Baalshamin, Temple of Bel and other sites. Russian topographers and archeologists from the Institute of Material Culture History at the Russian Academy of Sciences worked with the Defense Ministry to conduct a photo survey of the site, obtaining high definition 3D metric models of the terrain and architectural objects, which show greater detail than current satellite photos, the statement said. \"All this allows to imagine comprehensively and complexly what the ancient city used to be like before the barbarian(s') destruction,\" the statement added. Is ISIS going broke? Almost two years of destruction ISIS fighters destroyed part of the historic Roman amphitheater in the ancient city in January after recapturing the historic city in December of last year. The amphitheater has also been used by the jihadist group for numerous executions. In August 2015 ISIS also beheaded Khaled al-As'ad, a university professor and the former general manager for antiquities and museums in Palmyra. He had refused to reveal location of valuable antiquities to the militants. The jihadist group first seized control of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in May 2015. Syrian regime forces managed to briefly push the militants out of the city last year. But Palmyra fell to ISIS again in December when Syrian troops pulled out and over 4,000 militants returned.

        "Text": "The dam, which is the nation's tallest, remains intact. But the emergency spillway, which helps to ensure that the water does not rush over the top of the dam when the levels are high, was eroding Sunday. The damage prompted a mandatory evacuation for cities and counties near Lake Oroville amid fears it could endanger communities living downstream. Those orders remain in effect and Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said he did not know when they would be lifted. \"I'm not going to lift the evacuation order until I have better idea of what that means and what risk that poses,\" he said in a press conference late Sunday night. California Governor Jerry Brown issued a state emergency order to help local authorities with the situation and evacuations. What led up to the Sunday emergency This winter, heavy rainfall in Northern California has filled Lake Oroville to the verge of overflow. The lake also gets water from the northern Sierra Nevada mountain range which is experiencing one of its wettest seasons. This has triggered concerns over whether the water could overflow the dam and flood nearby communities. The Oroville Dam provides flood control for the region and is located about 75 miles north of Sacramento. The dam has two spillways -- the primary and the emergency spillway -- to prevent that from happening. These are channels to leak water out of the lake. And right now, both have major problems. Last week, the primary spillway was \"damaged by erosion,\" according to the California Department of Water Resources as photos showed a massive hole on the lower part of the structure. Of the two, the emergency spillway is a last resort. At Oroville Dam, the emergency spillway is only used if water levels reach 901 feet in elevation. It hasn't needed to be used in its 48-year history -- until this weekend. Why evacuation order was made A light flow of water began washing into the emergency spillway Saturday and the volume of water began to increase. Around 3 p.m. local time on Sunday, authorities learned that the dam's emergency spillway was eroding, Honea said. The erosion of the emergency spillway is dangerous because \"when you start to erode the ground, the dirt and everything else starts to roll off the hill,\" said Kevin Lawson, California Fire incident commander. \"It starts to undermine itself. If that is not addressed, if that's not mitigated properly, essentially what we're looking at, is approximately a 30-foot wall of water,\" he said. Evacuation orders on Sunday sternly warned residents that the erosion could result in \"large, uncontrolled releases of water from Lake Oroville.\" Honea's office used the most urgent of language -- \"This is NOT a drill\" -- in imploring residents to evacuate ahead of an impending disaster. Residents were told that the emergency \"spillway is close to failing.\" The evacuation order included \"all Yuba County on the valley floor\" and the city of Marysville, authorities said. About 35,000 people from Butte County, 65,000 from Yuba County, 76,000 from Yuba City and 12,000 from Marysville City evacuated, according to California Fire. Stores closed. Shelters opened. Local gas stations were swarmed with cars as residents tried to leave town. Evacuees waited in traffic trying to get out of low-lying areas. Sean Dennis, who lives 30 miles south of Oroville, spoke to CNN from his car after spending 4.5 hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic. \"It was pretty scary, just because of how fast everything was developing,\" he said. \"Me and my wife managed to throw as much of stuff as we could into garbage bags, whatever we could find. We got both of our cars loaded down pretty well. We're not taking any chances.\" Police said that despite rumors, there were no reports of looting. Watching the damage After issuing the evacuation orders, authorities noted significant decreases in the water coming over the emergency spillway. The flow of water on the emergency spillway eventually stopped Sunday night as the Department of Water Resource withdrew more water from the other spillway. The primary spillway is releasing water at 100,000 cubic feet per second in an effort to reduce the amount of water traveling down the emergency spillway, authorities said. Normal flows down the main spillway are about 55,000 cubic feet per second. \"The goal is to get the lake to drop 50 feet. If we can continue to do that, that brings a little bit of calm to what we're trying to accomplish here,\" said Cal Fire's Lawson. So far, there have been no repairs on the emergency spillway, because teams have been unable to reach the damaged area. Teams will take a look and assess the situation Monday morning, Bill Croyle, the acting Director of Department of Water Resources said. Authorities will have to act fast as more rain is in the forecast for Wednesday.",

        "Text": "The modern musical walked away with five awards -- more than any other movie -- at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards Sunday, including best film and individual honors for Emma Stone and director Damien Chazelle. \"La La Land\" had been up for seven awards. Its BAFTA success came one day before the final Oscar ballot opens up, further consolidating its position as frontrunner for top honors at the 89th Academy Awards, which are being held on February 26. In the last decade, the recipient of the BAFTA for Best Film has gone on to win the Oscar for Best Picture six times. \"Lion\" was another big winner, picking up trophies for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Dev Patel. The Best Supporting Actress category once again belonged to Viola Davis for her role as long-suffering wife Rose in \"Fences\", continuing her unstoppable awards streak headed into the Oscars. At a news conference after the ceremony, Davis voiced her skepticism over the perceived idea that black filmmakers and actors have had more success since the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. She said that while African-American actors had seen a lot of success in the last year, it could easily be an anomaly. \"I believe what still is a deficiency is that we one year have a plethora of African-American movies and then the next year nothing,\" Davis said.

        "Text": "\"In the heat, the whales can explode, but we've taken steps to prevent that,\" Trish Grant, a spokeswoman for New Zealand's Department of Conservation, told CNN. \"Our staff has been puncturing the dead whales, using an implement that releases the gas (inside their carcasses) that someone local has built for us.\" Excavators will be used to move the dead whales further up Farewell Spit in Golden Bay, which is on the tip of New Zealand's South Island, to a location in the nature reserve that's not open to the public. From Friday to Sunday, around 400 whales died on Farewell Spit, the conservation department said in a statement. It's the third largest mass beaching of whales in the country's history. Hundreds of whales dead after mass stranding Mass stranding Grant told CNN that the department had spent Monday monitoring a pod of whales still in the Golden Bay area from the coastline amid concerns that they would also beach themselves. \"We've finished for tonight, but we'll resume our searches tomorrow. The whales are still in the Golden Bay area relatively close to shore and there's a risk that they could strand overnight,\" Grant said. Whales were first spotted in the water late on Thursday night, by a department staffer, before being found on the beaches of Farewell Spit Friday morning. Hundreds of volunteers joined the rescue effort. Whale trap Farewell Spit is considered to be a whale trap due to its shallow water, said Grant. The largest whale stranding event in New Zealand took place in 1918, when 1,000 whales stranded themselves on the Chatham Islands. The second largest was in Auckland in 1985, when 450 ended up on a beach. Grant said that many factors can be involved in whale beachings. \"Sometimes it can be caused by a diseased member among them - because they have strong social bonds, if one of them gets in trouble, the rest can follow,\" explained Grant.",

        "Text": "A White House statement described their conversation as \"extremely cordial.\" Most importantly for Xi, Trump affirmed US commitment to the \"One China\" policy. This phone call, together with a personal letter from Trump to Xi two days earlier, which expressed US interests in seeking \"constructive relations\" with China, removed many of the uncertainties generated by Trump's earlier comments that the \"One China\" principle was negotiable. Trump's challenge to the \"One China\" principle and his threat during the election to slam 45% import duty on Chinese goods had caused widespread concerns that the two countries were on a collision course. Domestic setbacks One plausible explanation of Trump's apparent return to the \"One China\" principle could be his rising setbacks on the domestic front. When Trump threatened to link the \"One China\" principle with Chinese concessions in a number of issue areas, he was rolling with a sense of invincibility after the election. Foreign leaders were falling over each other to court him. At home and abroad, Trump looked mighty. However, after assuming the office, Trump has encountered massive domestic frustrations. His multiple new policy initiatives have run into fierce criticism and opposition by the public, media, and other branches of the government. According to a poll by CNN/ORC, a majority, 53%, disapprove of the way Trump handles his job, marking the highest disapproval for a new elected president since polls began to track these results. The result has been that Trump has become increasingly frustrated and vexed by domestic challenges. The last thing Trump needs is a major fight with China, which would promise to be very nasty with uncertain outcomes. It is therefore highly likely that Trump opted to return to the \"One China\" principle after a rethinking about the relative priorities of the domestic and foreign policy agendas of his administration. China courts the Trumps Trump's return to the \"One China\" principle may also be an outcome of China's successful diplomatic efforts, through both conventional and unconventional tactics. In public, China has been firm in sending out a consistent message to Trump that the \"One China\" principle involved its fundamental core interests and it will to take a stand and fight to the end. It has simultaneously pursued unconventional, backdoor approaches to shape his China policy. Beijing is keenly aware that Trump relies closely on a very small group of advisers to guide him on policy issues, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump. As such, China has tried to directly influence the first family to smooth relations with Trump. In fact, soon after Trump's election, Kushner attended a dinner hosted by Chinese business tycoon Wu Xiaohui, who presides over Anbang Insurance Group that has an asset of US$285 billion and close ties to the ruling elite of China. Then on February 1, Trump's daughter Ivanka paid a surprise visit to China's embassy in Washington to attend a Chinese New Year reception. Behind closed doors, China may have succeeded in proactively shaping Trump's position on the \"One China\" policy through both deterrence and accommodation. Ways forward While Trump's stated commitment to the \"One China\" principle has at least removed a short-term obstacle to Sino-US relations, the future of the bilateral relationship remains challenged. Multiple issues, ranging from trade, the South China Sea or North Korea's nuclear challenge, may still lead both countries down the path to conflict. The US and China can do a number of things to minimize conflicts and maximize cooperation. While the US should refrain from using the \"One China\" principle to pressure Beijing on the trade front, the latter must consider serious concessions. The Trump administration does have a legitimate complaint given the massive trade deficit on the US side. China thus needs to address the \"fair trade\" issue. Likely concessions include greater access by US firms to the Chinese market. On the South China Sea issue, the Trump administration's recent statements have been encouraging. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, during on a recent trip to Japan, expressed that there is no need for the US military to \"take drastic\" moves in the South China Sea. Moreover, he said that the US would primarily rely on diplomacy to resolve the South China Sea disputes. China must not read this as a sign of weakness. Instead, China should refrain from further actions that may escalate the South China Sea conflict with the United States. Finally, China should make more sincere efforts in containing the nuclear ambitions of North Korea. Greater efforts by Beijing will not only contribute to regional stability but also strengthen Sino-US cooperation on the issue. Such efforts can convince the Trump administration that China is indeed doing its best to help the United States with this thorny security issue.",

        "Text": "Trump held court during a news conference that lasted an hour and fifteen minutes, carving out a stunning moment in modern American political history. He displayed a sense of anger and grievance rarely vented by a President in public -- let alone one who has been in office for just four weeks. \"I have never seen more dishonest media, frankly than the political media,\" Trump said, later slamming leaks to the press from the intelligence community -- some of which led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. \"The leaks are real. The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake,\" Trump said. While it was a marked contrast with the normal dynamics of a presidential news conference, the East Room show was vintage Trump. He touted his own poll numbers, victory over Hillary Clinton and discussed cable TV ratings and panel discussions. \"I'm here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.\" That was the kind of message -- directed at large numbers of voters disgruntled with the performance of Washington's political establishment and delivered in a plainspoken, unvarnished manner -- that helped Trump win the presidency against all odds. But his manner is also likely to offend or alarm other voters and may do little to alleviate skepticism towards Trump among political elites in Washington. Trump in fact predicted how his animated and unorthodox news conference will be interpreted in the press. \"Tomorrow, they will say: 'Donald Trump rants and raves at the press,'\" Trump said. \"I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But -- but I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.\" The general impression was of a president who is deeply frustrated at the way his new White House is being portrayed and who had decided to take matters into his own hands with a dramatic intervention. The news conference was not scheduled until Thursday morning, but aides said Trump was itching to get out and defend himself. A senior administration official told CNN's Jeremy Diamond that Trump walked into the Oval Office this morning and told his top aides: \"Let's do a press conference today.\" The news conference was \"the President's idea, 100%\" the official said. \"I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration,\" Trump said, after quickly announcing his new pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta. \"We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done,\" Trump said. And saying he resented picking up newspapers and turning on the television to hear reports that his White House was in chaos, Trump said, \"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.\" Trump's appearance betrayed apparent deep frustration not just with the media coverage of his White House and a desire to talk directly to the American people but also possibly dismay with aides charged with defending him. \"I don't mind a bad story if it's true,\" Trump said, but complained much of what was reported about his administration was unfair. The President lashed out, for instance, at coverage of his temporary travel ban on nationals of seven mostly Muslim nations that caused a weekend of chaos at the nation's airports before being suspended by a federal court. \"We had a very smooth roll out of the travel ban. But we had a bad court,\" Trump said. \"We had a bad decision, that is the only thing that is wrong with the travel ban.\" But the President also said a new executive order would be tailored to the court's ruling to ensure that it could legally go into force. Trump also accused holdovers from the Obama administration of leaking out information about his alleged contacts with Moscow to hammer his administration. Trump was repeatedly pressed on whether his campaign staff had been in contact with Russia, as a widening drama over his alleged connections with Moscow dominates news coverage. \"Nobody that I know of. How many times do I have to answer this question? Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years,\" Trump said. \"I own nothing in Russia, I have no loans in Russia, I don't have any deals in Russia,\" Trump said. \"Russia is fake news.\"",

        "Text": "The nomination comes one day after Andy Puzder, Trump's first pick to lead the department, withdrew his nomination. Trump said that Acosta \"has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed.\" The comment was an apparent reference to his administration's struggle to get all of their nominees through the Senate. \"I have wished him the best, we just spoke and he is going to be a tremendous secretary of labor,\" Trump said. Acosta was not at the event with the President. Acosta, who is currently the dean of the Florida International University School of Law, is a former member of the National Labor Relations Board, a position he was nominated to by former President George W. Bush. If confirmed, Acosta -- the son of Cuban immigrants - would be the first Hispanic member of Trump's Cabinet. NBC News first reported Acosta as the pick. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito when he sat on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and practiced law at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington. Puzder, Trump's first pick to leader the Labor Department, withdrew his nomination Wednesday after Republican senators began telling the White House that they would not back the nominee. Puzder, the CEO of the company that owns the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast food chains, faced fierce opposition mostly from Democrats in part related to his position on labor issues as well as the fact that he employed an undocumented immigrant housekeeper. But Republicans, too, had grown weary of the range of liabilities facing Puzder, and senior GOP officials informed the White House Tuesday night and Wednesday that Puzder lacked a viable path for confirmation. The turbulent nomination process wore on Puzder, too, with aides close to the nominee telling CNN that he was taken aback by the harshness of politics.",

        "Text": "\"The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision,\" said Trump during a news conference, referring to a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked his travel ban earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Justice Department filed a 47-page brief Thursday telling the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that it does not need a larger panel of judges to rehear its failed emergency challenge to a lower court's temporary suspension of Trump's executive order on immigration at this time because a new order is on the way. The Justice Department wrote at length about the \"seriously flawed\" Ninth Circuit ruling from last week, but neverthless said: \"(r)ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.\" \"In so doing, the President will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially time-consuming litigation,\" it added. Questions have swirled over what the Trump administration would do this week after a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit refused to lift a federal judge's temporary restraining order on Trump's executive order barring foreign nationals from Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and all refugees from Syria indefinitely. Last Friday, an unidentified judge on the Ninth Circuit requested that the full court vote on whether to rehear the decision reached by the three-judge panel. Such requests are not uncommon, but the call for a vote came at time when the Justice Department's position on pursuing the appeal was uncertain. The states that brought the lawsuit -- Washington and Minnesota -- said in their court filing on Thursday that there is no basis for rehearing the case, as the opinion from the three-judge panel is \"firmly grounded in precedent.\" And while the nation waits on a new or modified executive order on immigration from the Trump administration, at least one federal court is barreling ahead on litigation over the original one. US District Court Judge James Robart in Seattle -- the judge who originally halted the key provisions of the travel ban -- denied a request from the Trump administration earlier this week to postpone any further proceedings in his court, which means the parties will now proceed to the discovery phase of the case.",

        "Text": "Trump has since named Ret. Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg, who worked under Flynn until the latter was asked to resign, as the acting national security adviser. Asked if there was a candidate for national security adviser in sight, a White House official told CNN, \"Not that I'm aware of.\" \"Since retiring, I have the opportunity to address financial and family issues that would have been challenging in this position,\" Harward said in a statement. \"Like all service members understand, and live, this job requires 24 hours a day, 7 days a week focus and commitment to do it right. I currently could not make that commitment. My thoughts and prayers are with those that carry such heavy burdens and responsibility for taking care of our country's national security concerns. God bless this great country of ours.\" A friend of Harward's said he was reluctant to take the job because the White House seems so chaotic. Harward called the offer a \"s*** sandwich,\" the friend said. A Republican official told CNN that Harward made it a condition of taking the job that he could form his own team. In the end, he didn't feel that was the case. And a senior Republican familiar with the process added that \"a question of clarity regarding the lines of authority\" was central in Harward's decision. \"I wouldn't call it a disagreement as much as questions that could not be resolved to his comfort level,\" the senior Republican said. Harward served as Mattis's deputy when he was commander of US Central Command, which oversees US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Flynn was forced to resign his position in the Trump administration after reports said he discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador before Trump was inaugurated and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation. The White House said Flynn's omission about the details of his conversation led to an erosion of trust between Flynn and the President, prompting Flynn's exit. Following a more than 30-year military career, Harward became chief executive of defense giant Lockheed Martin's United Arab Emirates division. Harward was already familiar with the role of national security adviser and the work of the National Security Council, having previously worked on the NSC's counterterrorism office from 2003 to 2005 during President George W. Bush's administration. After Flynn's resignation, Harward's name floated to the top of lists for potential replacements, alongside acting adviser Kellogg and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to mishandling classified information after he shared sensitive material with a woman with whom he was having an affair. Ret. Army Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks, a CNN military analyst, called Harward an \"incredibly talented guy\" in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on \"OutFront. Marks said he didn't want to speculate why Harward turned down the job, but said turmoil in the White House was likely a contributing factor. \"I'm sure Bob looked at this, Adm. Harward looked at this, and said, 'Look there's a lot of forming and storming going on right now.'\" But Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, dismissed suggestions that White House chaos led to Harward's decision to not accept the role, calling it \"hearsay.\" \"Am I surprised, 72 hours after Flynn resigns, that we're still in the process of doing a turn for that? No, I'm not,\" he told Burnett.",

        "Text": "Though he is seeking to reassure key allies such as Germany of US resolve on Russia and other issues that have rattled Western leaders, he himself faces questions about how much he's been looped in on President Donald Trump's thinking on the Kremlin. On Monday, Trump ousted his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for misleading Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Pence, who had previously gone on television and repeated Flynn's prevarications, only discovered he was misinformed last Friday -- a full two weeks after Trump himself learned the Justice Department was looking into the matter. Even as Pence seeks answers about why he was hoodwinked, Trump himself has expressed little concern about the compromised position of his vice president. Instead, he's cast Flynn -- whom he asked to resign -- as unfairly brought down by illegal leakers of classified intelligence. \"The first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?\" Trump said at a news conference Thursday. \"You know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.\" The incident frustrated and dismayed Pence. It also raised questions about how much the vice president can act as a credible interlocutor for Trump in Europe, where the top concern is the very subject upon which Pence was frozen out: US intentions concerning sanctions on Moscow. Pence, traveling abroad for the first time since taking office, will attend the Munich Security Conference and huddle with Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel before traveling to Brussels for meetings with key European leaders. \"I expect Pence to express the same views he presented in the vice presidential debate last year: a fairly conventional tough stance on Russia and commitment to Europe,\" said Derek Chollet, executive vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \"But this will still leave allies wondering how much he is speaking for Trump.\" White House aides said Thursday that Pence and Trump had discussed the trip, which will also include talks with the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan. Those aides said Pence would work to calm US allies during his trip abroad and dismissed concerns that he may be regarded as an unreliable voice for Trump. \"I don't think any of our allies will question for a second whether the vice president is speaking on behalf of the administration, in conjunction with the President, on any matter,\" said a senior White House official, speaking anonymously to preview Pence's trip. Pence arrives in Europe at a moment of deep unease for leaders, who are eying Trump with skepticism. Few believed he could win November's election and made little attempt to mask their disregard for the billionaire real estate developer as he plodded forward with his brash campaign. The frenetic first month of Trump's presidency has only deepened European leaders' concerns. Flynn's resignation this week led to some optimism among Western diplomats who had been chagrined about the former national security adviser's desire to establish closer ties to Moscow. But widespread uncertainty about what steps Trump may take to begin cooperating with Russian President Vladimir Putin remains. Western diplomats and US officials who have met with Trump administration envoys describe mixed messages about the future of US policy toward Russia. While some officials -- including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN ambassador Nikki Haley -- have insisted that US sanctions will remain in place on Russia for its incursion into Ukraine, others have been less committal. The future of a separate set of US sanctions punishing Russia for its election cyber-meddling is also uncertain. Flynn's phone call to the Russian ambassador came the same day the Obama administration put those sanctions in place, and Trump has remained open to lifting them. That's a concern for some in Europe, who fear the same Russian cyber intrusions could affect important upcoming votes in France and Germany. European capitals were also unnerved by Trump's campaign trail dismissals of NATO, which he's largely tempered since taking office. As a candidate, Trump lambasted the defense collective as \"obsolete\" and chastised member countries for not meeting the minimum requirements on defense spending. But last month during remarks at US Central Command in Florida, he said that his administration strongly supported the alliance. Pence will seek to offer a steadier message during remarks in Munich and during talks in Brussels with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and other European leaders. It was already reinforced by European trips by Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis, who attended the NATO ministerial meeting, this week. He'll offer a foreign policy message that hews more closely to established US policy, insisting that Russia adhere to the Minsk ceasefire agreement in Ukraine and vowing support for NATO as a bulwark of western security. \"We're stronger together. So (we) just want to reaffirm that,\" said a senior White House adviser on foreign policy. \"If there are fissures, either through the media or perceptions otherwise, he wants to reassure folks.\"",

The expected appointment is rankling some inside the White House, with longtime Trump loyalists inside and outside the West Wing saying they would have preferred a veteran from the campaign. \"Dubke and his Crossroads friends did everything they could to kill the Trump movement and failed,\" one loyalist said. Former Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller was originally tapped to serve as communications director for the White House, but Miller stepped aside before Inauguration Day to spend more time with his family. Dubke did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Dubke, founded Crossroads Media in 2001 and brought it to a level of national prominence during the 2008 presidential campaign. It is \"the premier Republican media services firm,\" according to a description on its website. And Dubke has \"a unique understanding of the relationship between political strategy and public policy development,\" the website explains. Relief for Spicer The appointment is expected to take some of the heat off embattled Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who has endured a rocky start to his tenure as the official spokesman for the administration. Until now Spicer has served as both White House press secretary and communications director for the new administration. Those roles are typically filled by two staffers.",

        "Text": "The meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Bonn, Germany, comes at a time of strained US-Russian relations and turmoil in Washington as the new Trump administration finds its feet. Tillerson's remarks, made in a brief on-camera statement after the meeting, may go some way to reassure US allies. \"As I made clear in my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people,\" Tillerson said. \"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. As we search for new common ground, we expect Russia to honor its commitment to the Minsk Agreements and work to deescalate the violence in the Ukraine.\" The White House and the Kremlim have engaged in back-and-forth commentary in recent days over Crimea, the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014. Speaking a short time before, Lavrov said the two \"had plenty of issues to discuss,\" with the topics reflecting those of the January 28 phone conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. Asked by a reporter whether the upheaval in Washington could affect US-Russian relations, Lavrov replied: \"You should know we do not interfere in the domestic matters of other countries.\" Election interference? Lavrov's comments came at the same time as US Defense Secretary James Mattis said there was \"very little doubt\" that Russia had interfered -- or attempted to interfere -- in a number of democratic elections. Speaking after a NATO conference in Brussels, Belgium, Mattis described Russia's general actions around the world as \"aggressive\" and \"destabilizing.\" Mattis played down the idea of closer military ties with Russia, saying: \"We are not in a position right now to collaborate on the military level, but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground.\" Flynn resignation Tillerson's trip to Germany comes as the Trump administration is seeking to reassure skittish allies in Europe the US has their backs, all while exploring new areas for cooperation with Russia as advocated by Trump over opposition from some members of his own party. The White House is in turmoil after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's resignation this week over questions of the nature of conversations with Russia on sanctions before taking up his administration role. Congress is now investigating various aspects of Russia's alleged interference in the US election, while members question Trump's own relationship to the country.",

        "Text": "Selangor Police Chief Abdul Samah Mat said without DNA from a next of kin, they won't hand over Kim Jong Nam's body or release the autopsy report which could reveal the cause of death. Kim Jong Nam died after being attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday. South Korean officials claim he was poisoned. Three people have been arrested so far in relation to Kim's murder: an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and another woman carrying Vietnamese identification. Four days after the killing many questions remain unanswered. Here's what we know so far. What happened? Kim was on his way to catch a flight Monday morning to see his family in Macau, where he's lived since his departure from North Korea years ago. The Chinese territory, a short ferry or helicopter ride from Hong Kong, is a popular gambling destination with mainland Chinese. The exact details of Kim's murder are sketchy but Selangor State Criminal Investigations Department Chief Fadzil Ahmat told Reuters Kim \"felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind.\" Kim felt dizzy and immediately went to an airport customer assistance counter, seeking medical help. They were concerned enough to take him to the on-premises clinic. An ambulance was called but it came too late. Kim died on his way to hospital. How was he killed? No one is exactly sure how Kim died. Initially, local media put forth reports of poison needles and deadly sprays, but it wasn't even clear whether Kim was killed or had a heart attack. Then on Wednesday, South Korea's Lee Cheol Woo, the chairman of the country's National Assembly Intelligence Committee, publicly declared Kim had been murdered. Lee stated the former North Korean heir had been killed with poison by \"two Asian women.\" He didn't reveal how South Korea had discovered this or what poison had been used in the killing. The autopsy of Kim's body might have revealed more but despite having been finished on Wednesday, no results have been released. As of yet, Deputy Prime Minister Hamidi said no next of kin had come forward to claim the body. Was North Korea involved? No motive for the killing has been revealed, nor any explanation of how he was poisoned. South Korea's Lee told lawmakers on Wednesday that North Korea killed Kim but, again, he didn't explain how he knew it. \"Pyongyang has been attempting to assassinate Kim Jong Nam for the past five years,\" a South Korean legislator, Lee Chul Woo, told reporters Wednesday. He didn't provide any evidence. When asked about rumors that North Korea had been involved in Kim's death, Malaysia Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi told a press conference Thursday it was \"only speculation.\" North Korea has requested Kim's body but Malaysia authorities said they wouldn't release it until investigations are complete. Who did it? Grainy security camera from the airport at the time of Kim's killing showed two young female suspects. One of the women is seen wearing a blue skirt and white t-shirt with \"LOL\" written on it. The first woman was arrested on Wednesday morning at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, two days after the attack. She was carrying Vietnamese documents, which said her name was Doan Thi Huong and gave her age as 30. Later that evening, 26-year-old Malaysian Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin was taken into custody. Police said he was arrested to assist in their investigations. At 2 a.m. on Thursday, Jalaluddin led investigators to his girlfriend, 25-year-old Indonesian Siti Aishah, who was then arrested on suspicion of being involved in Kim's death. No charges have been laid. Who was Kim Jong Nam? If things had gone differently, Kim Jong Nam could have been the leader of North Korea. Born in 1971, he was the first son of then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. His mother was one of the dictator's favored mistresses, actress Song Hye-rim, and for a while Kim Jong Nam was the most public of his father's sons. But in 2001 he reportedly lost the elder Kim's favor when he tried to use forged documents to visit Tokyo Disneyland. His half-brother, Kim Jong Un, was born to a different mistress, Ko Yong Hui, who was politically ambitious and enthusiastic to see her son succeed Jong Il as leader. But author Yoji Gomi, who worte a book in 2012 called \"My Father, Kim Jong Il, and Me\" said Kim Jong Nam thought his younger brother wasn't fit to run the country.",

More 200 people were injured in the attack, and many had been transferred to bigger hospitals in other cities of Sindh province, he said. Thousands of worshipers, including families with their children, had gathered at the more than 800-year-old shrine for the Sufi ritual of Dhamal, which involves music, chanting and prayer. The Islamic State Khorasan, ISIS' affiliate in Afghanistan and Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to CNN. The Amaq news agency, which is affiliated with ISIS, reported the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber in an explosives vest. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called the attack \"brutal.\" \"I have directed all the state institutions to mobilize all resources for rescue and relief after this brutal terror attack on Lal Shahbaz Qalandar's shrine,\" the Prime Minister said in a statement. The spokesman for the Pakistani military blamed operatives from Afghanistan for a recent spate of attacks on the country. The spokesman, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, tweeted: \"Recent Ts (Terrorist) acts are being exec (Executed) on directions from hostile powers and from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. We shall defend and respond.\" In another tweet, he urged the country to remain calm: \"Your security forces shall not allow hostile powers to succeed. We stand for our nation.\" He later announced on Twitter that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was \"closed with immediate effects till further orders due to security reasons.\" The attack comes days after a bomb exploded during a protest in Lahore, Pakistan, on Monday, killing at least 14 people and injuring 59 more, according to government spokesman Malik Ahmad Khan. Jamat-ul-Ahrar, a splinter group of Pakistan's Tehreek-i Taliban (TTP) -- also known as the Pakistani Taliban -- claimed responsibility for that attack in a statement emailed to CNN.",

New Zealand calls a 1.8 million square mile land mass known as Zealandia home. This new continent also includes New Caledonia, along with several other territories and island groups. The idea of a potential continent in this area has been around for some time. Geophysicist Bruce Luyendyk coined the term Zealandia in 1995. The dedicated study of this area over the past 10 years has determined it is not just a group of continental islands and fragments but that it has a continental crust large and separate enough to be officially declared a separate continent. Previously, New Zealand and New Caledonia were grouped with Australia under the moniker Australasia. While most of us would call this the eighth continent, geologists often consider Europe and Asia as one continent called Eurasia. The publication by The Geological Society of America comes barely a week after scientists found a \"lost continent\" under the Indian Ocean.",

        "Text": "He lashed out personally against reporters, he resumed fighting over the outcome of the election and his loss in the popular vote, and continued steadfastly refusing to admit to facts that are beyond dispute. While it is true that many of his supporters still see the person who \"tells it like it is\" and isn't afraid to punch back against his critics, this is not a way to conduct the presidency. The style that we saw on display at this news conference highlighted many parts of President Trump that are causing deep concern, certainly among Democrats, but also with some Republicans. When he continues to traffic in false statements about massive voter fraud, he demonstrates his willingness to circulate false information from the highest levels of power. When he continues to insist he would have won the popular vote, if not for fraud, and that he enjoyed the biggest Electoral College victory since Ronald Reagan (which he was challenged on, and had no adequate reply), it is dangerous for the body politic and fuels support for legislation that could suppress the vote. He still seems obsessed with the Hillary Clinton email scandal, even as more and more stories about his own lax security practices are on the front pages of the news. Despite the flood of reports about the connections between the Russians and top members of his campaign, Trump did nothing to indicate he was taking this seriously and that he was bothered by what was revealed. His showed his thin skin with his disparaging remarks about reporters and news organizations, to the point that he couldn't contain his desire to insult. He mocked networks' ratings instead of answering the questions. Rather than offering answers to how he will deal with the \"mess\" he said he \"inherited,\" he remarked instead about the \"dishonest media\" that was not giving him the credit he deserves. It is easy to see he is a President who is not surrounded by advisers willing to push back on his most egregious behavior. This is a President who makes up his own worldview, defends that worldview, and is unable to incorporate real data that comes his way. On foreign affairs and domestic policy, such an outlook can be devastating. It is also clear from his remarks that the President continues to be in a \"war\" with the media, and journalists need to be at the top of their game to monitor and push back against a White House and Oval Office that seems to have little interest in sharing serious information about what they are doing. As President Richard Nixon learned, this kind of worldview can ultimately consume a President whose paranoia, pettiness and anger can push him into unethical or illegal behavior in an effort to protect his hide. When President Trump said, seemingly in impromptu fashion during Wednesday's news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that he was open to a one-state solution, he threw many decades of diplomacy initiatives into the garbage and made the kind of statement that could easily instigate violence rather than judicious discussions. Americans could have very different views about what this President is doing and many certainly might like a lot of his style. But there are limits. When a person is President, the ramifications of poorly thought out statements and vicious, off-the-cuff attacks can have dangerous consequences. The kind of disorganization that seems to grip the White House can allow powerful actors, like Michael Flynn, to behave badly. This is what President Ronald Reagan discovered as members of his National Security Council conducted illegal activities in Nicaragua. Simply at the level of being a role model for the nation, this also sets a tone about how politics should be conducted that fuels, rather than dampens, the partisan anger that has afflicted this nation. The question is whether anyone sitting near the Oval Office is going to try to restrain this President and, equally important, if there is anyone in the congressional wing of the Republican Party who will start to take a more defiant stand about how he is conducting himself. The withdrawal of Andrew Puzder as secretary of labor, as well as some Republicans openly calling for an investigation into the possible Trump-Russia connection, are the very first signs the otherwise solid Republican Party might be breaking up, at least a bit. As Republicans on the Hill watch Trump squander more of his time on these kinds of petty fights rather than sending them legislation, they will grow increasingly anxious about the kind of impact this can have on their future majority. If Trump pushes them to that particular tipping point, it would be the most dangerous political moment the administration would have to face. President Trump loves to boast about his ability to make a deal and get things done. As Bloomberg reported Thursday, so far he isn't doing much. His legislative record is pretty barren compared to other presidents at this moment in their term. Most of his still young presidency has been about the kind of public fireworks we saw Thursday rather than real governance. Indeed, even a Trump supporter must be disappointed at the sloppy manner in which the White House handled the executive order on immigration, which left the measure dead in the courts. There is time for Trump to recover, and given the strong partisan incentives of the GOP, to make this moment of divided government work, Democrats certainly shouldn't be too confident about this challenging moment. Yet Tapper's remarks were right on target, and that basic thought \"?the impression Trump makes \"?will continue to sink deeper and deeper into the minds of voters and legislators who are watching these events and wondering just what kind of President we have.",

        "Text": "Trump has used a series of executive orders to chip away at the barriers to deportations and hire new law enforcement officials to spearhead the effort, using the Department of Homeland Security to live up to the President's tough talk on undocumented immigration during the 2016 campaign. \"We're getting really bad dudes out of this country, and at a rate that nobody's ever seen before,\" Trump said Thursday. \"And they're the bad ones. And it's a military operation.\" He added: \"You see what's happening at the border. All of a sudden for the first time, we're getting gang members out. We're getting drug lords out.\" A White House spokesperson said Trump did not misspeak by calling deportations a 'military operation,' but clarified the President meant \"military\" as an \"adjective.\" \"The President was clearly describing the orderly and professional manner in which his executive orders are being implemented, and the administration's emphasis on removing serious criminals here in the US illegally,\" the spokesperson said. Trump, though, is not using the military to deport undocumented immigrants. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told reporters in Mexico City Thursday that there would be \"no use of military force in immigration operations, none,\" and Trump's administration has gone to great lengths to deny reports that the National Guard would take the lead on deportations. \"Not true,\" Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, tweeted earlier this month after The Associated Press reported that the Trump administration was considering mobilizing the National Guard. \"100% false.\" The guidelines outlined by the Trump administration, however, do expand the number of undocumented immigrants who are subject to deportation. \"Everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time,\" Spicer said. \"That is consistent with every country, not just ours. If you're in this country in an illegal manner, that obviously there's a provision that could ensure that you be removed.\"",

        "Text": "\"We do not agree on the different measures that recently were stated by the government of the United States (that) affect Mexico,\" Osorio Chong said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were in Mexico to try to smooth the relationship and address some of the differences that have emerged between the United States and its neighbor. Their visit to Mexico City follows months of charged rhetoric from President Donald Trump and US immigration measures announced this week that have dramatic implications for the country, including potentially sending significantly more migrants back over the southern border. \"We have expressed our concern about the increase of deportations,\" Osorio Chong said of meetings he and other Mexican officials had Thursday with Kelly and Tillerson. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, speaking ahead of Osorio Chong, was also quick to raise some of these tensions, telling reporters that there was a perception in Mexico that the Trump administration was pursuing \"policies that might be hurtful for Mexicans.\" Pointing to the issue of illegal migration, he said, \"Our concern, to respect the rights of Mexicans living in the United States more, specifically the human rights.\" He added that it would be \"a long way to go\" to be in agreement with the United States and that \"facts\" were needed in order to \"overcome the negative feelings that are prevailing now.\" RELATED: Huge stakes for Trump immigration do-over Tillerson, for his part, noted that \"two sovereign countries from time to time will have differences.\" Standing with Videgaray, however, he focused more on shared concerns in his public comments. \"We listened closely and carefully to each other as we respectfully and patiently raised our respective concerns,\" he said. \"There's no mistaking that the rule of law matters on both sides of our border,\" Tillerson said, pledging to work with Mexico to stem the flow of cash and weapons from the US. But his message in meetings, according to a senior administration official speaking after the top US diplomat's arrival in Mexico Wednesday night, was a little more forceful. \"Tillerson will make, he will acknowledge this, that if we are gonna to have a relationship that works, on border that works, it goes both ways,\" the official said. Ahead of their remarks, President Donald Trump said Thursday that he told Tillerson the visit to Mexico was \"going to be a tough trip.\" Trump, speaking to manufacturers at the White House, said the trip would be difficult \"because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico.\" As Tillerson arrived Wednesday, Videgaray said publicly that he wanted to \"make it clear, in the most emphatic way, that the Mexican government and the people of Mexico do not have to accept measures unilaterally imposed on a government by another government.\" US administration officials said Kelly and Tillerson's trip was meant to allow the new Cabinet secretaries to establish relationships and coordinate on bilateral issues that range from counterterrorism, border security and trade amounting to $1.5 billion a day. They also met with President Enrique Pe?a Nieto and Mexican military officials. But the top US officials make their Mexican debut under a cloud, as Trump has introduced policies meant to back up campaign rhetoric that painted Mexico and Mexicans as a security threat and economic drain on the US. On Tuesday, the Trump administration issued guidance that broadens the scope of deportations from a previous focus on criminals to apply to every undocumented immigrant in the US. It also enables state and local law enforcement to act as immigration officers. Another change to asylum procedures would make it easier for immigration officers to send non-Mexican migrants to Mexico if they came through the country on their way to the US. The change could potentially send tens of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, gangs and drug cartels back into Mexico. A Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters ahead of Thursday's meeting, told CNN that Kelly and Tillerson would hear from Pena Nieto, Videgaray and other officials that Mexico would not take deportees who are not Mexican nationals. A second official pointed out that no bilateral agreement requires Mexico to take these immigrants and that Mexico isn't bound by any US presidential order. There is nothing the US can't do to force the matter, this official said. And Mexico has some leverage, the second official said. The country has been stopping Central American migrants before they reach the US for more than two years, the official said, adding that if Trump doesn't stop his \"orders,\" it will make it more difficult for Mexico to continue this cooperation. Trump may be trying to figure out his own ways to apply pressure to get Mexico to pay. He has suggested putting a 20% tariff on Mexican goods entering the US and his campaign has floated the idea of seizing remittances from Mexicans in the US sending money home. The President has also ordered Cabinet agencies to inform him of the total direct and indirect aid the US gives Mexico, a move that some see as an attempt to amass some leverage in the debate over the border wall that Trump insists will be built and that Mexico will pay for. Mexican officials have repeatedly said they will do no such thing. Under the Merida Initiative, the State Dept has given Mexico $2.6 billion since 2008. That's to strengthen rule of law, counter narco-trafficking, support judicial reform and police professionalization. It doesn't include aid from other State Department programs. Mexico also gets funding from the departments of Defense, Energy, Labor, Health and Human Services, Interior, the Peace Corps, the US Agency for International Development and DHS. Kelly distributed an implementation memo on February 21 asking his staff to calculate how much direct and indirect aid DHS gives Mexico. That process is still underway.",

        "Text": "Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly described the status of the case against Sen. Leila de Lima. A court has ordered her arrest, but she is not yet in police custody. Sen. Leila de Lima is accused of having abetted the illegal drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison when she was justice secretary from 2010 to 2015. A judge in the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court on Thursday afternoon found \"sufficient probable cause for the issuance of the Warrants of Arrest\" against de Lima and two others. A team from the Philippine National Police headed to the embattled lawmaker's residence south of Manila and then to the Senate, where de Lima sought refuge upon learning the warrant would be served Thursday evening. At the Senate, the sergeant-at-arms agreed to serve the warrant Friday morning, in line with an earlier televised request of the senator. \"The haste is deplorable,\" her fellow party members in the Senate said in a statement. A graphic reading \"One for Leila\" circulated on social media. A close ally, Sen. Kiko Pangilinan, asked social media users to \"please share (it) as a sign of our outrage against political persecution.\" A few hours after the arrest warrant was issued, de Lima told reporters at a press conference that she would not run away from the cases against her. De Lima has consistently insisted she is not involved in the illegal drug trade. Allegations of payoffs Duterte first raised the allegations against de Lima in a speech in August. She's accused of receiving payoffs from convicted drug lords who were able to continue their illegal operations from behind bars while she was justice secretary. The prison facility is managed by the Bureau of Corrections, an arm of the Department of Justice. Duterte won the presidency on a platform of cracking down on crime, particularly illegal drugs. Since taking office in June, his police force has waged a bloody war on drug dealers and users, resulting in the deaths of thousands of suspects at the hands of police and vigilantes. De Lima became the subject of probes launched by Duterte's political allies after the senator initiated a Senate inquiry into alleged state-sanctioned killings in the course of Duterte's bloody war on drugs. A Senate committee, led by an ally of Duterte's, decided in October to drop its inquiry into the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and users during the leader's first few months in office. In December, Duterte admitted to killing drug suspects during his time as mayor of Davao City. Ex-Davao Death Squad leader: Duterte ordered bombings Duterte: De Lima must 'face the music' Felons from the prison facility have directly linked de Lima to the penitentiary drug trade. But de Lima said the government pressured those convicts to testify and have an \"ax\" to grind against her. As justice secretary, de Lima conducted a raid at the New Bilibid Prison maximum security area that shocked the nation, revealing a luxurious lifestyle of high-profile inmates who are now among the witnesses against her. Duterte denies throwing person from helicopter De Lima has said she will take legal action to protect herself from what she says is political persecution. Last week, Duterte said he was confident the Justice Department's case against de Lima was airtight. He said the senator \"will have to face the music\" and the charges.",

North Korea has furiously denied any involvement in Kim's death, publishing a strongly-worded article on Thursday in the country's state media, KCNA. It quoted a spokesman for the Korean Jurists Committee who said responsibility for Kim's death lay with Malaysia, as he had died on their territory, and criticized the investigation. \"If you look at Malaysian police's investigation from crime investigation perspective and legal perspective, everything is full of weak points and contradictions,\" it said.

Malaysian police have previously said the four suspects who are the subject of the alert are believed to be back in Pyongyang. In addition to the four suspects, three North Koreans are wanted for questioning by Malaysian police, including Hyong Kwang Song, the 44-year-old second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Malaysia, and Kim Uk Il, an Air Koryo staff member. Both are believed to still be in Malaysia. Bakar said the North Korean embassy wouldn't be searched as they had diplomatic immunity. Suspects 'trained for murder' Indonesian Siti Aishah and Vietnamese woman Doan Thi Huong have already been taken into custody in connection with the alleged murder. Bakar said at a press conference Wednesday the two women were trained to wipe a liquid substance on Kim's face, then immediately wash their hands. He dismissed their earlier claims that they believed they had been on a prank show. \"They knew it was toxic. Of course they knew,\" Bakar said. Aishah's boyfriend, Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin, who was taken in for questioning, was released on bond on Wednesday. Poison reports false: North Korea Diplomatic ties between North Korea and Malaysia are growing increasingly frayed as the rogue state continues to condemn Malaysia's handling of the investigation. Malaysian Prime Minister recalled his ambassador from Pyongyang after the North Korean ambassador accused their country of conspiring with \"hostile forces.\" In the article published on KCNA, North Korea accused South Korean conservative media of publishing a \"false report\" that Kim had been poisoned. The article also fiercely rebuked Malaysia for its continued refusal to hand over Kim's body without DNA from a next of kin. \"This proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicize the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality and thus attain a sinister purpose,\" Thursday's article said.",

        "Text": "\"So many Christians are like this, and these people scandalize others,\" Francis said during morning Mass at Casa Santa Marta, according to Vatican Radio. \"How many times have we heard -- all of us, around the neighborhood and elsewhere -- 'But to be a Catholic like that, it's better to be an atheist.' It is that: scandal.\" \"But what is scandal? Scandal is saying one thing and doing another.\" In the Catholic Church, causing scandal also a grave offense. Examples of such sins abound, the Pope said, from money launderers to business owners who take beach vacations while stiffing their employees. Francis' sermon, as is customary, was an extended riff on Thursday's Mass readings, which include a passage from the Gospel on Mark. In it, Jesus says it is better to be drowned than to cause others to sin. Drawing on that passage, the Catholic Catechism says scandals include business leaders who encourage fraud, teachers who agitate students and manipulators who turn people away from moral values. In other words, anyone who leads others to do wrong, directly or indirectly, is responsible for the evil he has encouraged, the church says. So when Francis compares hypocritical Christians to atheists, he's not being flip; he's trying to protect his flock. In the United States, some Catholics have cited the church's teachings on scandal to argue that priests should not distribute Holy Communion to politicians who support abortion rights. Francis, a sharp critic of capitalist excesses, turned his scorn instead on greedy businesspeople. Fake Christians While many of this Pope's pronouncements are often assumed to be novel interpretations of Christian doctrines, Francis was also touching on an ancient debate: Is salvation open to all believers, or only those who do good while on earth? The Pope suggested the latter, in characteristically blunt language. He imagined a wealthy Christian knocking at the gates of heaven and saying, \"Here I am, Lord! ... I went to Church, I was close to you, I belong to this association, I did this... Don't you remember all the offerings I made?\" To which Jesus may reply, according to the Pope: \"Yes, I remember. The offerings, I remember them: All dirty. All stolen from the poor. I don't know you.' That will be Jesus' response to these scandalous people who live a double life.\" Thursday's sermon is far from the first time Francis has targeted Christian hypocrites. In a sermon last February, the outspoken Pope called out the \"fakeness\" of Christians who talk piously, but do little to help others. \"To be a Christian means to do: to do the will of God -- and on the last day -- because all of us we will have one -- that day what shall the Lord ask us? Will He say: 'What you have said about me?' No. He shall ask us about the things we did.\" It isn't the first time the Pope has mentioned atheists, either. In 2013, he raised questions for saying that heaven is open, potentially, to all people. \"The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone. \"'Father, the atheists?' Even the atheists. Everyone!\" Francis continued, \"We must meet one another doing good. 'But I don't believe, Father, I am an atheist!' But do good: we will meet one another there.\" The Vatican later issued a note clarifying that the Pope was simply saying that God's grace is free to all, even atheists, and urging Christians and non-believers to work together.",

        "Text": "\"I think one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history was his immediate withdrawal from TPP. It got us out of a trade deal and let our sovereignty come back to ourselves,\" he said, referring to the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. That decision, which he called just a first step in re-imagining US trade policies, was just one of three Bannon pointed to as the most important steps Trump has taken since becoming president just over a month ago. On the national security front, Bannon highlighted Trump's executive orders on building a border wall and beefed up immigration enforcement policies. And thirdly, he stressed the importance of Trump's moves to begin a \"deconstruction of the administrative state\" by appointing individuals from the private sector to key economic Cabinet positions who will help strip down federal regulations. Bannon joined White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus onstage at CPAC, which Bannon credited with helping launch Trump's political career. The two men discussed Trump's electoral victory, the administration's agenda and railed against the media together as they worked to dispel notions that they are rivals competing for power and influence within the West Wing. \"Well, in regard to us two, I think the biggest misconception is everything that you're reading,\" Priebus said. \"If you look at the opposition party,\" Bannon said, referring to mainstream media outlets, \"and how they portrayed the campaign, how they portrayed the transition and now how they're portraying the administration -- it's always wrong.\" The two sang each other's praises as they insisted their working relationship could not be closer. (\"We share an office suite together. We're basically together from 6:30 in the morning until about 11 o'clock at night,\" Priebus said.) While Priebus called Bannon \"incredibly loyal\" and \"extremely consistent,\" Bannon said he admired Priebus' \"determination\" and noted that he is \"always kind of steady.\" The forum also provided a rare public view of Bannon's thinking, one filled with dark portrayals of the news media, visions of a \"new political order\" and grand plans to reimagine the US's posture abroad. \"That is why I am proudest of Donald Trump. All the opportunities he had to waver off this, all the people who have come to him and said, 'Oh you've got to moderate.' Every day in the Oval Office, he tells Reince and I: 'I committed to this with the American people, I promised this when I ran and I am going to deliver on this,' \" Bannon recounted. And while Priebus and Bannon worked to show a united front on Thursday, Bannon acknowledged that they don't always agree, which he called a main reason they are \"good partners.\" The joint appearance was the latest attempt by the two men to shoot down reports of division, instead claiming in a series of recent interviews that they enjoy a chummy, symbiotic relationship. Bannon told The Hill newspaper last week that Priebus \"is doing an amazing job.\" \"We are executing on President Trump's agenda in record time. That's because Reince is getting the job done,\" Bannon said. \"We are a completely united team dedicated to enacting his bold agenda to bring back jobs and keep this country safe,\" Priebus echoed in the interview. And in an interview with New York magazine, the two men joked about giving each other back rubs and said they speak all day long \"until somebody falls asleep.\" White House sources have also backed up their account in recent weeks, but a source who spoke separately with both men last week told CNN that while Bannon had nothing negative to say about Priebus, the White House chief of staff badmouthed Bannon over the phone. The two men's professional backgrounds could not be more different. While Priebus has long been a creature of establishment Republican politics -- rising to Republican National Committee chairman before becoming chief of staff -- Bannon spent most of his professional career amassing wealth in the private sector before taking on a role as the head of the bomb-throwing, establishment-bashing Breitbart News site. After Trump was elected, their new positions atop the West Wing roster were jointly announced atop. The two men would work together as \"equal partners,\" Trump said in the release.",

        "Text": "But a White House official said late Thursday that the request was only made after the FBI indicated to the White House it did not believe the reporting to be accurate. White House officials had sought the help of the bureau and other agencies investigating the Russia matter to say that the reports were wrong and that there had been no contacts, the officials said. The reports of the contacts were first published by The New York Times and CNN on February 14. The direct communications between the White House and the FBI were unusual because of decade-old restrictions on such contacts. Such a request from the White House is a violation of procedures that limit communications with the FBI on pending investigations. Late Thursday night, White House press secretary Sean Spicer objected to CNN's characterization of the White House request to the FBI. \"We didn't try to knock the story down. We asked them to tell the truth,\" Spicer said. The FBI declined to comment for this story. The discussions between the White House and the bureau began with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on the sidelines of a separate White House meeting the day after the stories were published, according to a US law enforcement official. The White House initially disputed that account, saying that McCabe called Priebus early that morning and said The New York Times story vastly overstates what the FBI knows about the contacts. But a White House official later corrected their version of events to confirm what the law enforcement official described. The same White House official said that Priebus later reached out again to McCabe and to FBI Director James Comey asking for the FBI to at least talk to reporters on background to dispute the stories. A law enforcement official says McCabe didn't discuss aspects of the case but wouldn't say exactly what McCabe told Priebus. Comey rejected the request for the FBI to comment on the stories, according to sources, because the alleged communications between Trump associates and Russians known to US intelligence are the subject of an ongoing investigation. The White House did issue its own denial, with Priebus calling The New York Times story \"complete garbage.\" \"The New York Times put out an article with no direct sources that said that the Trump campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies, basically, you know, some treasonous type of accusations. We have now all kinds of people looking into this. I can assure you and I have been approved to say this -- that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate, but it's grossly overstated and it was wrong. And there's nothing to it,\" Preibus said on \"Fox News Sunday\" last weekend. CNN has previously reported that there was constant communication between high-level advisers to then-candidate Trump, Russian officials and other Russians known to US intelligence during the summer of 2016. Several members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees tell CNN that the congressional investigations are continuing into those alleged Russian contacts with the Trump campaign, despite Priebus' assertion that there is nothing to those reports. It is uncertain what the committees will eventually find and whether any of the information will ever be declassified and publicly released. But the push to investigate further shows that Capitol Hill is digging deeper into areas that may not be comfortable for the White House. The Trump administration's efforts to press Comey run contrary to Justice Department procedure memos issued in 2007 and 2009 that limit direct communications on pending investigations between the White House and the FBI. \"Initial communications between the [Justice] Department and the White House concerning pending or contemplated criminal investigations or cases will involve only the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, from the side of the Department, and the Counsel to the President, the Principal Deputy Counsel to the President, the President, or the Vice President from the side of the White House,\" reads the 2009 memo. The memos say the communication should only happen when it is important for the President's duties and where appropriate from a law enforcement perspective. A Department of Justice spokesman said Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reviewing the memos and that \"the Department is following the guidelines in its communications with the White House.\" The effort to refute the CNN and New York Times stories came as increasing numbers of congressional members were voicing concern about Russia's efforts to influence individuals with ties to Trump. On February 17, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a briefing with Comey. It's unclear what was said, but senators suggested there was new information discussed about Russia. \"Every briefing we go through we gain new information,\" said Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a member of the committee. Lankford declined to be more specific about the briefing. Sen. Angus King of Maine also declined to reveal what was discussed during the Comey briefing. In response to a question on Priebus' strong denial of the claims, King said he was \"surprised\" that Priebus would be \"that categorical.\" Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the goal of his panel's inquiry is to follow \"leads wherever they go even if they may be uncomfortable to Republicans.\" \"The American public will want to know if the President had personal or financial ties to the Russian government,\" Swalwell said. UPDATED: This story has been updated to reflect new information and comment from the White House.",

        "Text": "Malaysian police said in a statement Friday that tests on Kim's eyes and face revealed the presence of the substance. Nerve agents are the most toxic and fast-acting substance known in chemical warfare -- and VX is the most potent of all of them, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Kim, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, died on February 13 before he was scheduled to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau. Malaysian police claim two women wiped his face with some sort of liquid at the instruction of four North Koreans. He started to feel dizzy minutes later and died shortly after on his way to the hospital. North Korea rejects that version of events, saying that the women would be dead if they had put a lethal chemical on their hands. It vehemently denies any involvement in Kim's death. There are binary versions of chemical weapons, including VX, which aren't lethal until two compounds are mixed, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Binary systems are usually employed for the safe storage of chemical weapons. How it works VX inhibits the operation of an enzyme that helps the body's nervous system function, causing paralysis and suffocation. \"VX is probably the state-of-the-art nerve agent,\" CNN military analyst Rick Francona said. \"It is probably the most lethal of all the nerve agents ever designed.\" Symptoms can appear after a few seconds, and even small doses -- as little as 10 mg on the skin -- can affect people. Larger exposure can lead to convulsions, paralysis and deadly respiratory failure. VX is most dangerous when inhaled, rather than absorbed through the skin, according to Nial Wheate, a chemical weapons health expert at the University of Sydney. \"It's not (meant as) a skin agent. It's a thing that you aerosol through the air,\" he said. The nerve agent is listed in the top tier of deadly substances in the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea has not signed. Despite its lethality, it's not particularly difficult to make, Francona and other experts say. Pyongyang has had the capability to produce and use nerve agents for some time. A 2009 report from the International Crisis group estimated that the country possessed 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons at the time, which could be delivered using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles, among other weapons. But the blast from a delivery system like missile would likely destroy much of the VX, said Wheate. It's more meant for aerosol use in close quarters. \"There's no one weaponizing this stuff, this is old school,\" he said. The suspects Malaysia authorities have named 11 people in connection with their investigation, though not all are considered suspects. Three are currently in custody. One is a North Korean man, and two are the women who police believe wiped Kim's face: Siti Aishah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam. Indonesian police said last week that Aishah believed she was participating in a prank for a TV show, but that was adamantly shot down by Bakar at his Wednesday news conference. \"These two ladies were trained to swab the deceased's face,\" he said. \"They knew it was toxic.\" Denials and diplomatic fallout Diplomatic ties between North Korea and Malaysia are growing increasingly frayed over the investigation. North Korea has accused Malaysia of being unduly influenced by South Korea's early claim that Kim was poisoned by the North. Pyongyang's ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, accused his host country of conspiring with \"hostile forces,\" prompting the Malaysian Prime Minister to recall his ambassador to North Korea and summon Kang. An article published in North Korean state media Thursday fiercely rebuked Malaysia for its continued refusal to hand over Kim's body without DNA from a next of kin. \"This proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicize the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality and thus attain a sinister purpose,\" Thursday's article said. Bakar, the Malaysian police inspector-general, accused North Korea of impeding the investigation. He said Wednesday that the North Koreans had neither responded to requests to hand over the four suspects in Pyongyang, nor had they helped police find three North Koreans believed to be in Malaysia -- including an embassy employee -- who are wanted for questioning. If the three who police think are still in Malaysia do not come forward, they will seek arrest warrants, Bakar said. The Malaysians have requested help from Interpol, asking the international police organization to put out an alert for the four suspects believed to have trained Aishah and Huong and then returned to Pyongyang.",

        "Text": "VX nerve gas was first developed in the UK in the 1950s as a deadly chemical warfare agent, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Experts say the formula has been replicated in the past by the US, Russia, Syria and Iraq. Here's what we know: What is it? VX nerve agent is an oily liquid that's amber in color, but it's both odorless and tasteless. Nerve agents, like VX, are the most toxic and deadly chemical warfare agents -- they're chemically similar to pesticides, although far stronger. VX is the most potent of all nerve agents, including Sarin, which was developed in Germany in 1938 as a pesticide. As a highly lethal chemical substance that can potentially kill large numbers of people, VX is considered a weapon of mass destruction. How does it work? VX, if in vapor form, is the quickest and deadliest form of the killer gas. As a liquid, it could potentially be released into a water supply or used to poison someone's food. Like all nerve agents, VX stops a vital enzyme from working -- which eventually leads to the body tiring, and no longer being able to breathe. VX is not only the deadliest nerve agent, but also the most persistent in the environment -- it evaporates slowly, especially in cold conditions, making it both a long- and short-term threat. What are the symptoms? Depending on how much a person was exposed to, symptoms will start occurring either immediately or up to 18 hours later. Large doses of the nerve gas can cause convulsions, loss of consciousness, paralysis and death, because of respiratory failure. Smaller, non-fatal doses can cause a wide range of symptoms that include increased heart rate, blurred vision, nausea, diarrhea, drooling, pain and weakness. Even just small doses of the gas can cause confusion and drowsiness. There are antidotes for VX exposure available and they are most effective when administered immediately. Is it banned? As a chemical weapon, VX is banned under a number of international agreements including the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. The 1925 Geneva Protocol came about after the use of poisonous gas in World War I, which was later extended by the 1993 Convention to include a ban on their development, production, stockpiling, retention and transfer of chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention classifies VX as a Schedule 1 chemical, which means it poses a \"high risk\" to the convention and is rarely used for peaceful purposes. Signatories are only permitted to keep Schedule 1 chemicals in small quantities for research, medical, pharmaceutical of defensive use, according to the Arms Control Association. Both the US and Russia have in the past admitted to keeping stockpiles of VX, and under the Convention are obligated to destroy them. Who has it? VX nerve gas was first used during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. It's part of the same family of toxic substances as Sarin, which was used in the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway. In the attack, members of the Aum Supreme Truth cult released Sarin nerve gas that killed 12 people and sickened more than 5,500 commuters. VX is said to be relatively easy to produce in a reasonably sophisticated laboratory. \"Any country with a sophisticated chemical weapons effort can produce VX. The formula has been around since the 1950s so its nothing new it just has to be made, the political will and determination that we are going to build this weapon,\" said CNN military analyst Rick Francona.

        "Text": "The Olympian-turned-reality star, who is perhaps the most high-profile face of the transgender community, at first was quiet after the Trump administration withdrew Obama-era guidance on transgender bathroom use in public schools. But she broke her silence over 24 hours later in a tweet and video message. Clad in a pink \"pussy bow\" blouse, Jenner spoke directly to the camera. \"I have a message for President Trump from well, one Republican to another. This is a disaster. And you can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community,\" she said, holding up her hand like a mock telephone. \"Call me.\" After Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee in June, Jenner told STAT she believed he would be better for women than Hillary Clinton. \"Everybody looks at the Democrats as being better with these [LGBT] issues. But Trump seems to be very much for women. He seems very much behind the LGBT community because of what happened in North Carolina with the bathroom issue. He backed the LGBT community. But in Trump's case, there's a lot more unknowns. With Hillary, you pretty much know what you're gonna get with the LGBT community,\" Jenner said at the time. She was spotted attending an inauguration eve dinner at Washington's Union Station alongside House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"Republicans need help understanding LGBTQ issues and I'm here to help!\" she tweeted. Jenner, who came out as transgender on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in 2015, documented her life after transition in two seasons of the E! docuseries \"I am Cait.\" The show often got political; Jenner frequently discussed transgender rights and featured LGBT activists in nearly every episode. Her video Thursday also included a message for transgender kids -- and bullies, even taking a shot at Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \"I have a message for the trans kids of America. You're winning. I know it doesn't feel like it today or every day, but you're winning. Very soon we will win full freedom nationwide and it's going to be with bipartisan support. You can help by checking out the National Center for Transgender Equality and letting Washington hear you loud and clear,\" she said. \"Now I have a message for the bullies: You're sick. And because you're weak, you pick on kids, you pick on women or anyone else you think is vulnerable. Apparently even becoming the attorney general isn't enough to cure some people of their insecurities.\" Jenner is not the only celebrity to speak against the new policy: singer Jackie Evancho, who performed the national anthem at Trump's inauguration and has a transgender sister, tweeted the President on Wednesday evening asking for a meeting. Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres also weighed in on Twitter, writing, \"For anyone who feels scared or hopeless, know that we will never stop fighting for your rights.\"",

        "Text": "But the Florida Republican stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena those returns. Gaetz, a first-term congressman from the Sunshine State's panhandle, has stood by Trump, campaigning with him over the past weekend and closing his raucous one-hour town hall at the Oops Bowling Alley here Thursday night by saying he wanted to \"make America great again.\" But he surprised the audience when he said, \"Absolutely, Donald Trump should release his tax returns.\" Donna Waters, a 56-year-old lawyer from Pensacola, became emotional Thursday night as she pressed Gaetz for an answer. \"I'm the descendant of an immigrant, he came to America in 1607 to a town called Jamestown, and my family's been here ever since,\" Waters said, noting that her family members have fought in every major US war, including both sides of the Civil War. \"Whenever there's a threat to this country, my family has stepped forward,\" Waters said, tearing up. \"There are allegations that a hostile foreign country is committing acts of undeclared war by infiltrating the highest levels of our government.\" Waters continued: \"You are on the Judiciary Committee. You have said they are going to investigate the Russian allegations. Yes or no, Yes or no -- let me ask my question -- will you call for the release of President Trump's income tax returns?\" As Gaetz took back the microphone, the crowd immediately began screaming, \"Yes or no! Yes or no!\" Then Gaetz said, \"If you hear me out, you'll like my answer,\" and called for Trump's returns. The line garnered some rare applause from the crowd that was otherwise mostly livid over Gaetz's push to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency and a string of other issues. During his presidential campaign, Trump became the first major-party nominee since 1972 not to release his tax returns -- citing ongoing IRS audits and saying he would do so once those audits were completed. But last month, top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said the President will not release his returns. Conway later sought to clarify her remarks, asserting there had been no change in position from the campaign and that Trump's business advisers had urged him not to release the documents. Throughout Gaetz's hour-long town hall here just outside of Pensacola, protesters booed, chanted, yelled over him and jeered Gaetz. At one point, a questioner asked Gaetz if he would vote to impeach Trump, to which the crowd began chanting, \"Impeach Trump! Impeach Trump!\" \"I do not agree with President Trump on every issue, I do not agree with any human being on Planet Earth on every issue, but I support President Trump and I'm going to back him up,\" Gaetz said. Gaetz often spoke directly with the protesters. Outside a meeting with constituents at the Santa Rosa County Building, Sarah Coutu, a mother of eight from Milton and member of Florida Panhandle Progressives, confronted him on his EPA bill. As he attempted to talk through his call to abolish the EPA, protesters screamed, \"Your last term!\" over him and he walked into the building. But Gaetz also tightly controlled access to his earlier events, holding an earlier meeting with constituents in a back room of a restaurant that had limited access. During a stop at Grover T's BBQ in Milton, Florida, Gaetz was ushered past more than 100 protesters by a group of sheriff's deputies and members of Bikers for Trump, who said they were providing security.",

        "Text": "Ranieri, who became the team's manager in July 2015, steered the club to one of the most unlikely success stories in sports history. The team won the league title after starting the season with 5,000-to-1 odds to do so. \"Domestic results in the current campaign have placed the club's Premier League status under threat and the Board reluctantly feels that a change of leadership, while admittedly painful, is necessary in the Club's greatest interest,\" the club said in a statement. Ranieri was awarded The Best FIFA Men's Coach award last month for leading the Foxes to the title. \"This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since (Thailand-based) King Power took ownership of Leicester City,\" the club's vice chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, said. \"But we are duty-bound to put the Club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be.\" The Foxes' Cinderella story hasn't carried over into this season. Right now, the team is only a point away from the drop zone, which would see the club relegated to a lower league next season. It would be the first time a defending champion dropped out of England's top league since Manchester City 79 years ago. Ranieri's sacking sent reverberations through the football world, drawing strong condemnation across the board from fans to rival managers. A tribute to Ranieri posted to Instagram by Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho had more than 100,000 likes in three hours. \"CHAMPION OF ENGLAND and FIFA MANAGER OF THE YEAR sacked... keep smiling AMICO. Nobody can delete the history you wrote,\" the post read. Ex-Manchester United and England defender turned TV pundit Rio Ferdinand expressed shock, while former Liverpool and Real Madrid striker Michael Owen called it a \"total and utter disgrace.\" \"I've lost a lot of love for the beautiful game today. The players and fans of Leicester have been massively let down,\" Owen tweeted.  Gary Lineker, a former England national team captain and Leicester's most prominent ex-player, called the move \"inexplicable, unforgivable and gut-wrenchingly sad.\" Leicester City said its board will now start looking for a replacement and will make no further comment until that process is complete.",

        "Text": "North Korea has lashed out at its only real ally, accusing China of \"dancing to the tune of the US\" over its decision not to import any more coal from the country. Without naming China, KCNA, North Korea's official state news agency, said Thursday a \"neighboring country\" had taken \"inhumane steps\" to block trade. On Friday, the Global Times, a provocative state-sanctioned tabloid, shot back. It said the ban had \"left Pyongyang reeling with pain and fury.\" \"Beijing routinely finds itself on the frontlines in terms of worldwide attention. Just as it does in the same calm and steadfast fashion with which it handles the Trump administration, Beijing will always be confident when it comes to tackling tough issues with Pyongyang,\" the Global Times said. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was more measured in its response, with a spokesman saying it was ready to work with North Korea \"for healthy and sound development\" of bilateral relations. China said Saturday it would halt all coal imports from North Korea through the end of 2017, with the statement coming on the heels of Pyongyang's most recent missile test. Analysts said the move showed that Beijing was fed up with the Pyongyang regime. Coal is North Korea's main export and an important source of foreign currencies for its fragile economy. Most of North Korea's exported coal is shipped to China -- its main ally and economic benefactor. \"This country, styling itself a big power, is dancing to the tune of the US while defending its mean behavior with such excuses that it was meant not to have a negative impact on the living of the people in the DPRK but to check its nuclear program,\" the KCNA report said. 'Utterly childish' China's Ministry of Commerce said the decision was made to comply with a UN Security Council resolution that China helped draft and pass last November. Resolution 2321 imposed some of the toughest sanctions yet against the North Korean regime, after it disregarded an earlier UN test ban, detonating what it said was a nuclear warhead in September 2016. The resolution included an explicit target of reducing coal imports by 62%, said Kevin Gray, a reader in international studies at the University of Sussex in the UK. Gray said the ban could also be read as a form of \"payoff\" for US President Donald Trump's recent acceptance of the One China policy. Trump has repeatedly called on China to take a tougher line on its unpredictable neighbor. In an interview with Reuters news agency published Thursday, Trump said that China has \"tremendous control\" over North Korea and could \"solve the problem.\" \"I have had a very good phone call with President Xi and I have had very good talks with him and the call is a start,\" Trump said in response to a question on China's coal ban. \"But we have a very big problem and a very dangerous problem for the world with North Korea.\" Analysts, however, say Trump may overestimate how much sway China has over its unruly neighbor. Relations between Pyongyang and Beijing have been frosty since Kim Jong Un succeeded his late father as dictator, promptly purging several key government figures -- such as his uncle Jang Song Thaek -- with strong ties to China. The murder of the Kim's older brother in Malaysia, who was living in China and advocated Chinese-style economic reforms, is likely to have further soured ties. However, North Korea appeared unruffled by China's latest move, saying the ban would have little effect on its nuclear weapons program. \"It is utterly childish to think that the DPRK would not manufacture nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic rockets if a few penny of money is cut off,\" the KCNA report said.",

        "Text": "Trump was asked in an interview on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends\" if he believed Obama was responsible for the town hall protests against Republicans this month. \"It turns out his organization seems to do a lot of these organizing to some of the protests that these Republicans are seeing around the country against you. Do you believe President Obama is behind it and if he is, is that a violation of the so-called unsaid presidents' code?\" Trump was asked. \"No, I think he is behind it. I also think it is politics, that's the way it is,\" Trump replied. Trump then discussed the leaks that have disrupted his first month in office. \"You never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes. You know, you're probably right or possibly right, but you never know,\" Trump said in the interview, a clip of which was released Monday night. \"No, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group, which are really serious because they are very bad in terms of national security. But I also understand that is politics. In terms of him being behind things, that's politics. And it will probably continue.\" Trump did not offer any evidence for his claim in the clip released by Fox Monday night. CNN has reached out to Obama's office for comment. A broad coalition of groups including Organizing For Action, the SEIU, MoveOn.org and the Center for American Progress have been working to help with grassroots organizing around GOP town halls. Organizing for Action, the group formed from Obama's campaign organization, has 14 professional organizers, for example, who are involved in teaching local activists skills to effectively vocalize opposition to the GOP's top agenda items. Earlier this month, Trump told Fox News that reports of his calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were caused by leaks from \"Obama people.\" Trump's administration has been beset by leaks within his administration to the media, and he has continually railed against those doing the leaking and the media since taking office. He has said the leaks are damaging to national security.",

        "Text": "In a statement released Monday evening, the firm confirmed that PwC managing partner Brian Cullinan \"mistakenly handed the back-up envelope for Actress in a Leading Role instead of the envelope for Best Picture to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway.\" \"Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner,\" the statement said, referring to PwC employee Martha Ruiz. \"Moonlight\" was eventually crowned best picture winner. Ruiz and Cullinan were the two employees charged with managing the envelopes containing the names of Oscar winners. At the ceremony, Ruiz and Cullinan alternated handing envelopes to presenters from opposite sides of the stage. PwC's statement added: \"For the past 83 years, the Academy has entrusted PwC with the integrity of the awards process during the ceremony, and last night we failed the Academy.\" The Academy also broke its silence on Monday evening. In a statement, it apologized \"to the entire cast and crew of 'La La Land' and 'Moonlight' whose experience was profoundly altered by [the] error.\" \"We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances,\" the statement said. \"To all involved --including our presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, the filmmakers, and our fans watching worldwide -- we apologize.\" The Academy added: \"We have spent last night and today investigating the circumstances, and will determine what actions are appropriate going forward. We are unwaveringly committed to upholding the integrity of the Oscars and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\" The statements come after revelations that Cullinan was tweeting shortly before the mistake was made. At 9:05 p.m. on Sunday, Cullinan sent a now-deleted tweet from his personal account that showed fresh-off-the-stage winner Emma Stone smiling with her new Oscar in hand. \"Best Actress Emma Stone backstage! #PWC,\" Cullinan wrote. The tweet is viewable in a cached page on Google. The social media post came just minutes before Dunaway and Beatty were inadvertently given the envelope containing the already announced best actress results. Cullinan has not responded to CNN's request for comment as of Monday evening. RELATED: It was 'Moonlight,' not 'La La Land': A timeline of a historic Oscars blunder PwC quickly apologized on Sunday night and said they were \"investigating how this could have happened.\" In the history of the Oscars, only one similar event has taken place. Back in 1964, Sammy Davis Jr. was handed the wrong envelope when presenting the best musical score (adaptation or treatment) category and accidentally announced the winner for original musical score. He corrected himself on stage after he was told he announced a winner who was not nominated in the category he was supposed to be presenting. PwC has several measures in place meant to prevent such occurrences. A 2016 Los Angeles Times story detailed one such precaution: the envelopes themselves. The names of the categories are printed on the outside to prevent confusion and the text used is \"large enough for a presenter and cameras to read easily,\" the piece noted. It's worth noting, however, that this year's envelope design was changed from gold paper with white labels to red paper with gold lettering -- considerably harder to read in dim backstage lighting. To the cameras capturing the action on stage, the misstep was clear. Photos from Sunday, examined in detail in the hours after the show, confirmed that Dunaway and Beatty had the wrong envelope on stage. Dunaway, who was the one to announce \"La La Land\" had won best picture, has declined to comment on the event. After the envelopes are stuffed with the winners' names, they are sealed by the only two people who know the results ahead of the ceremony -- in this case, Ruiz and Cullinan. Two sets of winner-containing envelopes are made, and Ruiz and Cullinan are tasked with taking them to the ceremony, flanked by guards. As an additional safety measure, Ruiz and Cullinan memorize the names of the winners. This is so they can be quick to respond in case the wrong name is read or share the winner with presenters in case something happens to the envelopes. A 2013 Vanity Fair story recalled a time when Sharon Stone and Quincy Jones were tasked with presenting two awards back-to-back but accidentally gave the second envelope to the first winner. The PwC representative on hand was able to whisper the winner to Jones off stage. Three \"La La Land\" producers spoke on stage before the error was announced to the Oscars audience. \"Moonlight\" ended up winning three Oscars on Sunday night. \"La La Land\" earned five.",

Police say the women rubbed a highly toxic VX nerve agent on Kim's face before running away. He died on his way to hospital less than 20 minutes later. Malaysia's Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali told CNN they will be officially charged on Wednesday. Murder can be punishable by the death penalty in Malaysia. Aisyah has denied she killed Kim on purpose, telling Indonesian officials she believed she was working on a prank show and was smearing Kim's face with baby oil. But Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar claims both women knew they were swabbing Kim's face with a deadly nerve toxin. A third suspect, Ri Jong Chol, a North Korean citizen, is still in custody. North Korean diplomats arrive A high-level delegation from North Korea arrived in Malaysia on Tuesday as Kim's murder continues to cause diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Malaysia has refused to release the body of Kim, who South Korean intelligence claims was killed on the direct orders of the North Korean leader. After arriving in the Malaysian capital, former North Korean Deputy UN ambassador Ri Tong Il said the delegation had come to negotiate the return of the body. He said that the delegation would discuss the \"question of the release of the DPRK citizen arrested by Malaysian police related to the above incident, (and) the development of friendly relations between DPRK and the Malaysian government.\" Malaysian authorities have consistently refused to release Kim's body until they receive DNA from his next of kin. North Korea has denied involvement in Kim's murder and blamed South Korea for attempting to tie Pyongyang to the killing.",

'False reports' \"The ministry controls and monitors the public and party officials. It was detected that false reports were made for Kim Jong Un,\" Lee Cheol-woo, another lawmaker who was present, added. \"Kim Jong Un was furious by this finding and put Kim Won Hong in a house arrest and ordered execution of his five people.\" He said the dictator also ordered the removal of a statue of his father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, from the Ministry's grounds as punishment. \"Kim Jong Un ordered the statue of Kim Jong Il to be removed from the National Defense Ministry because they don't deserve to have the statue.\" Although Pyongyang officially denies the prison camps exist, according to a US Treasury statement, Kim Won Hong directed and managed activities including \"beatings, forced starvation, sexual assault, forced abortions, and infanticide\" that took place in the system of prison camps. The Ministry for State Security reports directly to Kim. Removed from office In January, Kim fired Kim Won Hong, one of his top lieutenants, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. As Minister of State Security, Kim Won Hong oversaw the North Korean agency responsible for running the country's notorious prison camps, rooting out spies in North Korea and conducting counterespionage operations abroad. Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said Kim Won Hong was punished for \"human rights abuses committed during interrogations at the State Security Department\" among other things. Report: Hundreds executed A report released at the end of 2016 claims Kim has ordered 340 people to be executed since he came to power in 2011. The Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean think tank's report, \"The misgoverning of Kim Jong Un's five years in power,\" details how the North Korean leader uses executions to tighten his hold on power. Of those killed, about 140 were senior officers in the country's government, military and ruling Korean Worker's Party. The gruesome method of execution has also been used by the regime before -- in May 2015, Kim had his Defense Minister Hyon Yong Chol killed with an anti-aircraft gun at a military school in Pyongyang, in front of an audience. \"(It) would have torn his body apart,\" RAND Corporation senior defense analyst Bruce Bennett told CNN at the time. \"And of course Kim made sure the Defense Minister's family was there to see the execution.\" Kim Jong Un -- madman or mastermind?",

The UK-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or SOHR, told CNN al-Masri was killed Sunday in a strike targeting his vehicle near al-Mastoumeh village in Idlib. Several Syrian opposition activists also reported al-Masri was killed by a missile strike. Abdallah al-Muhaysini, a senior member of Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, acknowledged the death in a eulogy posted on his official Telegram channel. He said, \"May Allah accept Abu al-Khayr in His heaven. May Allah gather us together with him.\" Al-Muhaysini is a prominent inner-leadership member of Jabhat Fath al-Sham, which used to be known as Al-Nusra Front -- an al Qaeda affiliate. Al-Nusra Front in Syria split from al Qaeda last summer with the blessing of al Qaeda leader al-Zawahiri. SOHR said al-Masri, whose real name was Abdullah Muhammad Rajab Abd al-Rahman and who was an Egyptian national, was in a car near al-Mastoumeh camp when the strike took place. Syria Civil Defence in Idlib, also known as the White Helmets, reported the incident and posted pictures on its Facebook account. The group reported two people were killed in the strike without mentioning their names. In 2005, Abdullah Muhammad Abd Al-Rahman was designated by the US Treasury Department as a terror supporter. The department said he was responsible for coordinating al Qaeda's work with other terrorist organizations. In 2016 the UN Security Council put him, along with 81 others, on a sanctions list.",

        "Text": "It marks a dramatic turnaround from more than four decades of the country's one-child policy when there were harsh penalties for having more than one, including fines and forced abortions. Wang Peian, the vice-minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), said the commission is considering \"birth rewards and subsidies\" for second children, the state-owned China Daily reported on Tuesday. Wang made the announcement on Saturday during a meeting of the China Social Welfare Academy, a Chinese NGO that works closely with the government. A spokesperson for the organization declined commenting on Wang's speech to CNN. The announcement was in part prompted by a survey the NHFPC carried out in 2015, showing that 60% of families polled were reluctant to have a second child because of financial constraints, according to China Daily. One-child policy China overturned its one-child policy in October 2015, allowing couples across the country to have two children. Birth rates have risen since then, but the government is trying to meet higher birth rate targets as the population ages. Lu Jiehua, a sociology professor at Peking University, said that financial incentives for a second child are a \"positive signal.\" But how much the government can afford to subsidize -- in a country where the cost of living and education are skyrocketing -- will determine whether the potential bonuses will work, he said. \"The financial incentives would require more effort from other government agencies to cover the cost of raising a child, which is more important than giving birth,\" Lu said. In search of a baby boom The one-child policy was introduced in 1979 when the government feared a rapid increase in population size after the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s. The country's fertility rate fell dramatically, from a peak of almost six births per female between 1960 and 1965 to 1.5 per woman between 1995 and 2014. The two-child policy officially began in 2016 under a government program to jump start that declining birth rate -- especially because China faces a rapidly aging population and a shortage of working-age residents. China is home to 114 million people over 65, and up to 90 million people are expected to retire in the next three decades, leaving the labor force with even fewer people until newborns are old enough to work. By 2030, the government has warned China will have the most aged population on Earth, with more than 400 million people over 60. Waiting for the newborns So far -- when it comes to energizing China's birth rate -- the two-child policy is working, with or without subsidies. The number of babies born in 2016 jumped 7.9% from the previous year, according to government figures. A total of 17.86 million babies were born in 2016, an increase of 1.31 million over the total in 2015. The new total represents the highest annual number of newborns since 2000, according to government data. Challenges still remain when it comes to building up the country's newest workforce. Lu said that women in China who are now of child-bearing age were raised under the one-child policy. Having grown up under strict family planning policies, many are inclined not to have children -- let alone second pregnancies. \"It's hard to change their mindset,\" Lu said. Experts warn the impact of the two-child policy won't be felt until those new babies are old enough to join the workforce.",

I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\" On globalization Then: \"We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\" Now: \"America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\" On the American dream Then: \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.\" Now: \"A new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\" On leadership Then: \"We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action -- constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\" Now: \"Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.

        "Text": "The decision came late Tuesday night as positive reviews flooded in for Trump's speech, which struck a largely optimistic and unifying tone. Signing the executive order Wednesday, as originally indicated by the White House, would have undercut the favorable coverage. The official didn't deny the positive reception was part of the administration's calculus in pushing back the travel ban announcement. \"We want the (executive order) to have its own 'moment,'\" the official said. The sudden change of plans came as Trump and his top advisers returned to the White House after his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. Trump's original executive order, signed a week after he took office, banned citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US and temporarily suspended the entry of all refugees. A federal court issued a temporary stay that halted implementation of the travel ban earlier this month, a decision that was later upheld by a federal appeals court. The new travel ban will exclude legal permanent residents and existing visa holders from the ban entirely, sources familiar with the plans told CNN earlier Tuesday. While sources caution that the document has not yet been finalized and is still subject to change, there will be major changes:  The new executive order will make clear that legal permanent residents (otherwise known as green card holders) are excluded from any travel ban.  Those with validly issued visas will also be exempt from the ban.  The new order is expected to revise or exclude language prioritizing the refugee claims of certain religious minorities. Speaking in Munich, Germany, earlier this month, Department of Homeland Secretary John Kelly promised a \"phased-in\" approach to minimize disruption this time around. But what remains to be seen are the other key aspects of the new executive order, especially in terms of refugees, including:  What happens to the suspension of the refugee program for 120 days?  Will Syrian nationals still be barred indefinitely?  Will the cap on the number of refugees change? The first version of the executive order caps it at 50,000 for fiscal year 2017. Two sources also expect that the President will formally revoke the earlier executive order, despite repeated statements from White House press secretary Sean Spicer that the two orders would co-exist on a \"dual track.\" The administration could potentially argue that the existing challenges to the original executive order are moot, but the challengers tell CNN the legal battles will likely continue even after the new order is signed. \"Exempting lawful permanent residents and current visa holders will not cure the core legal problem -- that the ban was motivated by religious discrimination, as evidenced by the President's repeated statements calling for a Muslim ban,\" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt explained. \"That discriminatory taint cannot be removed simply by eliminating a few words or clever tinkering by lawyers.\"",

        "Text": "Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi looked far less than thrilled at President Trump's mention of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Pelosi, clad in white as an homage to women's suffrage, shook her head and pursed her lips. Other Democrats, like Rep. Jackie Speier, were very clear in their response to the idea of repealing Obamacare, giving it a thumbs-down. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan appreciated a reference President Trump made to negotiators needing to get better deals to repair the nation's infrastructure. Everyone knows a good deal is one of the President's favorite things. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Rep. Keith Ellison had some of the straightest faces of the night, remaining somber when the President mentioned crime in inner cities. Meanwhile, the President had the full support of Republican leaders Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Steve Scalise on the idea of putting \"America first.\" A standard at any Joint Session of Congress, the half up/half down crowd split between Democrats and Republicans was on full display. Republicans largely supported President Trump's thoughts on immigration, while the Democrats were noticeably less enthusiastic. However, there are a few things that were able to bring everyone to their feet, like supporting the troops and their families. Carryn Owens, the wife of Ryan Owens, a Navy Seal killed in a raid in Yemen, received more than two minutes of applause.",

        "Text": "Sessions did not mention either meeting during his confirmation hearings when he said he knew of no contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. A Justice official said Sessions didn't mislead senators during his confirmation. The Washington Post first reported on Sessions' meetings with the official. Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and spy-recruiters in Washington, according to current and former senior US government officials. Russian officials dispute this characterization. Sessions met with Kislyak twice, in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention, and in September in his office when Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Services committee. Sessions was an early Trump backer and regular surrogate for him as a candidate. Sessions responded swiftly Wednesday, strongly stating that he never discussed campaign-related issues with anyone from Russia. \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign,\" he said in a statement. \"I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\" Key Democratic lawmakers immediately called for Sessions' resignation after the news broke. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi characterized Sessions' comments in his confirmation \"apparent perjury,\" and said the attorney general should resign. Kislyak's potential proximity to Russian spying is one reason why Flynn's interactions with him, and Flynn's failure to disclose what he discussed with Kislyak, raised concerns among intelligence officials. In his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, Sessions was asked about Russia and he responded at the time that he \"did not have communications with the Russians.\" Sessions' spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said there was nothing \"misleading about his answer\" to Congress because the Alabama Republican \"was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.\" \"Last year, the Senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors,\" Isgur Flores said in the statement. A Justice Department official confirmed the meetings, but said Sessions met with the ambassadors \"in his capacity as a senator on the Armed Serviced Committee.\" A White House official said: \"This is the latest attack against the Trump Administration by partisan Democrats. (Attorney) General Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is entirely consistent with his testimony.\" In reaction to the report, Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, also called for Sessions' resignation. \"There is no longer any question that we need a truly independent commission\" to investigate potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Cummings said. \"It is inconceivable that even after Michael Flynn was fired for concealing his conversations with the Russians that Attorney General Sessions would keep his own conversations for several weeks.\" Cummings called Sessions' claim during his confirmation hearing that he did not have communications with the Russians \"demonstrably false.\" Minnesota Democrat Sen. Al Franken, who asked Sessions about Russia at the confirmation hearing, said if the reports of Sessions' contacts with Kislyak were true, then Sessions' response was \"at best misleading.\" \"It's clearer than ever now that the attorney general cannot, in good faith, oversee an investigation at the Department of Justice and the FBI of the Trump-Russia connection, and he must recuse himself immediately,\" Franken said. News of Sessions' contacts with Kislyak came as the New York Times reported Wednesday evening that officials under former President Barack Obama had sent information throughout government about potential Russian contact with Trump's associates and interference in the 2016 election. The officials did so, the Times reported, in order to preserve the information after Obama left office. Regarding the Obama administration efforts, Obama's spokesman Eric Schultz told CNN: \"This situation was serious, as is evident by President Obama's call for a review -- and as is evident by the United States response. When the (intelligence community) does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented.\" Two days before Trump's inauguration, the State Department sent Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a batch of documents related to Russian attempts to meddle in elections worldwide, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Cardin spokesman Sean Bartlett told CNN that the senator had received the classified documents on request and that they were shared with both Republican and Democratic committee staffers.",

But Graham deflected a question about a Washington Post report that Sessions twice spoke with the Russian ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying he needs to know more. \"If there were contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, they may be legitimate; they may be OK. I want to know what happened between the Trump campaign, the Clinton campaign and the Russians,\" Graham told CNN's Dana Bash at a town hall in Washington with Sen. John McCain.

The bottom line is that Putin is disrupting democracy everywhere,\" Graham said. McCain, who has called for a select committee to investigate Russia's attempts to influence the US election, said the country's efforts require more attention. \"Have no doubt, what the Russians tried to do to our election could have destroyed democracy,\" he said. \"And that's why we've got to pay a hell of a lot more attention to the Russians and the things they're doing in Europe -- and right now, they're trying to determine the outcome of the French election, and they're using cyber.\" Kislyak Is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and spy-recruiters in Washington, according to current and former senior US government officials.",

        "Text": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke twice with the Russian ambassador to the US, the Justice Department said Thursday, adding to the suspicion over Russia's ties to the current administration. During his confirmation hearings in January, Sessions, however, did not mention his conversations with Sergey Kislyak. At the time of the hearings, some Americans considered Russia an antagonist because of numerous reports of its interference in the US election. Here's how Sessions answered questions during his confirmation hearings on interacting with Russian officials: ------------------------------ SEN. AL FRANKEN: \"If there was any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this (2016) campaign, what would you do?,\" the Minnesota Democrat asked. SESSIONS: \"I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\" DATE: January 10 -------------------------- SEN. PATRICK J. LEAHY: Several of the President-elect's nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\" the Vermont Democrat asked in a questionnaire. SESSIONS: No. DATE: January 10 --------------------------- Sessions was a senator and a top Trump surrogate when he met the ambassador twice -- in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention and in September when he was a member of the Senate armed services committee. In a statement Thursday, he said reports that he met Russian officials are false. \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about,\" he said. US intelligence officials consider Kislyak a top spy and spy recruiter, according to current and former senior US government officials. Russia's foreign affairs ministry denied the characterization. Kislyak is the same man who met Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Flynn, before the President took office. Flynn resigned from his post after 23 days over his communications with Russia.",

French law prohibits the distribution of violent images or incitement of terrorism. Announcing the result of the vote on whether to lift the immunity, Parliamentary President Antonio Tajani said a \"clear majority\" of members backed the motion. As an MEP, Le Pen, leader of the National Front, enjoys immunity which covers freedom of speech -- but that immunity can be lifted if a request is made by the authorities of a member state. Under French law, the maximum penalty for distributing violent images is three years in prison and a fine of up to 15,000 ($79,000). The lifting of her immunity relates to this case only and any action is unlikely to occur before the first round of voting on April 23. Le Pen is already under scrutiny over allegations that members of her staff were paid for non-existent jobs at the European Parliament. Le Pen initially admitted they had been paid while not working, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) said. She later denied having said so.",

        "Text": "The outings were usually so brief the two men, both 32, were home with their families before anyone had time to ask where they had been. Still, the bar was where the friends laughed and were able to unwind after a hard day's work. It was a place where people knew them, a place where they felt comfortable. Now, burdened with a memory he is struggling to come to terms with, Madasani's words are heartrending. \"I just wish we didn't go there that night.\" Last Wednesday night, as a University of Kansas basketball game played on the bar's big screen television, Madasani remembers that he and Kuchibhotla were talking on the nearby patio. They weren't really watching the game, he said. That day the two friends were engaged in their own conversation. \"We were laughing. We were talking.\" \"Something is wrong\" Minutes into their first beers, around 6:15p.m., a stranger approached. It was a man they had never seen before. He was pointing a finger at them. \"And all of a sudden, this elderly looking gentleman with anger on his face -- you know that something is wrong the way he approaches you,\" Madasani said. Madasani recalls that he didn't speak to the man, but his friend Kuchibhotla did to be polite. \"He said, 'No sir, we are here legally, we are on H1B, we are from India.'\" After the exchange, Madasani got up from a chair on the patio and went into the bar. \"I had no reason to engage that gentleman in conversation,\" he said. Madasani was surprised at the randomness of the encounter. \"Typically, those things happen after two, three hours and people see you, you've been hanging around for awhile, they come to you and start a conversation. It was a half an hour that day when this happened. It was just out of the blue; we didn't even talk to him or say anything that can provoke it.\" Madasani and his friend were speaking English rather than their native Telugu. Kuchibhotla made it a point to speak English in public, Madasani said. By 6:45 p.m. the stranger left. \"The sunlight is going away, and you're in that relaxed zone,\" said Madasani, \"and we see him leaving. Everyone on the patio was watching because it was not just us he was disturbing. He was disturbing everyone around because they were there for a peaceful evening. When somebody creates drama it affects the people around us.\" \"I heard a loud pop right next to my ear\" The peacefulness was short-lived. Within 30 minutes, the friends had heard other patrons saying the man had returned with a gun. Madasani recalled how what happened next was almost too fast to react to. \"I heard a loud pop right next to my ear, kind of a loud pop.\" He then dropped to the ground and started crawling. \"I wanted to survive,\" said Madasani, who is expecting a child with his wife. \"To see the kid -- that's what [was] running through my mind.\" As he crawled toward the door he tried to stand. It was then he realized he had an injury to his leg. He fell to the ground once, managed to get himself out to the patio and fell again. He said he couldn't move. \"It was just too much pain, and a lot of blood.\" On the patio, patrons tended to Madasani's injury. As one tied a shirt over his leg, Madasani could see his friend, Kuchibhotla, motionless on the ground. Shooting suspect remains in jail The alleged shooter, Adam Purinton, 51, was arrested hours later at an Applebee's restaurant in Clinton, Missouri, 70 miles from Olathe. He faces one charge of first-degree murder and two charges of attempted first-degree murder. Purinton remains jailed on a $2 million bond A motive has not yet been established, and the FBI is looking into the case to determine whether the shootings would be considered federal hate crimes. Days after the shooting Madasani continues to wrestle with why he and his friend ended up at the bar that night. \"I could have said, 'No,' but when Kuchibhotla asks you go because it's him. This guy, Mr. Perfect, who doesn't drink during the weekdays because he wants to work. That's the kind of guy he is, and when he asks, you go.\" Madasani said that night, before they went out, he was the one still working. \"I was emailing with a co-worker in California. I could have told Srinivas that I had work to do -- 'Let's postpone this, we can do that on Friday.' I should've done that.\" Madasani said his friend rarely got angry, didn't gossip or talk behind people's backs and that everyone around him was happy. \"He was the kind of guy I wanted to be. He made me a better person.\" A mix of emotions Madasani knows the violence that took the life of his best friend is not isolated. \"Other things go on in this country, in the world, here in Kansas. I can say with confidence what happened is not what this country believes in and what this community believes in.\" He says his friends, white, black and Hispanic -- have all expressed sympathy for his loss and he is proud to say that he has family members who have lived in the United States for 50 years, some longer. But coupled with the support he has received, the events of the past week still prove unsettling. \"I still feel this this is not reality,\" he said. \"It's still not sunk in. I still don't want to believe what's happening.\" ",

        "Text": "Police don't have sufficient evidence to charge Ri Jong Chol, Malaysian Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali told CNN. He will be deported to North Korea after his release, Ali said. Kim, the older half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was killed February 13 before he was supposed to board a flight to the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau. Two women have been charged with the murder of Kim, who police said was killed by smearing VX, a deadly nerve agent, on his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Ri was the only North Korean to have been detained in the case, but investigators have named four North Korean suspects who are believed to be back in Pyongyang. Three other North Koreans are wanted for questioning, but police say the North Koreans would not help make their citizens available and were impeding the investigation. They are believed to be in Malaysia. South Korea has pinned the death on Pyongyang, accusing the country of recruiting the women. North Korea strongly denies responsibility, and its state media blamed Seoul and Washington for \"resorting to political chicanery to bring down the social system in the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea).\" Malaysia bans visa-free travel for North Koreans The brazen public kiiling has also frayed diplomatic relations between North Korea and Malaysia. Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi announced Thursday that North Koreans would now need to get a visa to travel to the country starting March 6, according to Bernama, Malaysia's state news agency. Malaysian nationals are currently the only people in the world who can enter North Korea without a visa. The diplomatic row began when North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, said February 17 the country would reject the results of a \"forced\" autopsy on one of its citizens and demanded the immediate release of the body. Kang later accused Malaysian officials of officials of conspiring with \"hostile forces\" during the investigation, eliciting a harsh rebuke from his host country. \"The statement by the ambassador was totally uncalled for, it is considered diplomatically rude on his part,\" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said in response. \"Malaysia is not the pawn of any country and we will never be the pawn of any country.\" VX VX is the world's most potent nerve agent and one of the most dangerous chemical weapons ever manufactured. It's banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. It works by inhibiting an enzyme that regulates muscle function, causing paralysis and suffocation. It's lethal in doses as small as 10 mg. \"VX is probably the state-of-the-art nerve agent,\" CNN military analyst Rick Francona said. \"It is probably the most lethal of all the nerve agents ever designed.\"",

        "Text": "\"There is a bomb in one of the children's backpacks and it's going to detonate shortly,\" one said. Some callers made anti-Semitic statements. \"The Jews will be decimated,\" a voice warned. The calls targeting Jewish community centers and school in nearly 33 US states and two provinces in Canada have sparked alarm and panic. President Donald Trump has denounced them. The FBI and the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division are investigating possible civil rights violations. There have been no reports that authorities found devices at any of sites. Conversations with Jewish community centers and leaders in more than a dozen states and in Canada offer a glimpse into the calls. The sex of the callers varied. The details in the calls were vague, indicating some callers didn't know about the targeted locations, according to officials at some centers. People at several Jewish community centers were trained to deal with the calls. One receptionist tried to keep a caller talking, following printed guidelines next to the phone. The questioning agitated some callers. Here is a sampling of information leaders at Jewish community centers gave about the phone calls. California: 'You're asking too many questions' An employee of the Merage Jewish Community Center of Orange County said the caller had a \"male voice. Very robotic.\" The receptionist at the center in Irvine, California, followed center procedures, the employee said. At one point, the caller said to the receptionist, \"You're asking too many questions,\" said the employee. \"I'm sorry,\" the receptionist said, and continued to ask more questions. The receptionist wanted to know where the bomb was, the employee said. \"The answers provided were nothing specific. Nothing to tell us they knew anything about our location,\" the employee said. In Los Angeles, Brian Greene, executive director of the Westside Jewish Community Center, said the caller's voice was \"mechanical\" and distorted. It sounded like a woman but it may not have been, he said. The caller said there was a bomb in the building and they had an hour to get out. The caller was asked the location of the bomb, Greene said. \"The caller said that's not important, just get everyone out of the building,\" Greene said. Maryland: Jewish souls would be destroyed The automated bomb threat that came into the Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland, said Jewish souls would be destroyed, according to Laurie Ehrlich, the school's director of marketing and communications. Ehrlich said the front-desk receptionist who answered the call managed to get a callback number, which she gave to police. The chief marketing officer of another Jewish community center in Maryland said the caller on January 9 sounded like an older woman but it could have been automated. The person at the center tried to engage the caller but they didn't respond and hung up. Michigan: 'There is a bomb in one of the children's backpacks' The person who called in a bomb threat on Monday to the Hebrew Day School of Ann Arbor in Ann Arbor, Michigan, sounded like a man who had disguised his voice, said David Shtulman, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Ann Arbor. \"There is a bomb in one of the children's backpacks and it's going to detonate shortly,\" is what the caller said, according to Shtulman, who spoke to police and the person who took the call. There were no demands issued and there was no conversation with the caller, Shtulman said. \"This person was off the phone pretty quickly.\" The school also received a threatening call in May 2016. \"That was much more frightening because it hadn't happened anywhere else,\" Shtulman said. The caller then said his brother had put a bomb in a backpack. He hung up initially but stayed on the line when the school called him back. \"Why are you arguing with me when you should be getting out!\" the caller said, according to Shtulman. New York: 'They evaded any questions' There was a bomb in the lobby, claimed the person who made the call to the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo in Buffalo, New York. \"They evaded any questions we had for them and it was clear to us they didn't know our building specifically,\" said Rick Zakalik, the center's executive director. He said the person who answered the phone referred to the guidelines posted next to the phone, and they \"responded perfectly.\" Zakalik addressed parents at a Tuesday night meeting. \"This is like duck and cover from nuclear bombs in elementary school that you all experienced,\" he told them. Bomb threats are not uncommon, and it's rare for them to be genuine, he said. \"For Jewish institutions, being a target is nothing new,\" Zakalik said. \"We have been a target for thousands of years.\" Connecticut: Additional training The Mandell Jewish Community Center of Greater Hartford refreshed its training to deal with bomb threats in case the center was targeted, said David Jacobs, the center's executive director. The center, in West Hartford, Connecticut, received it's one and only bomb threat the day after training, he said. Arizona: Kept the caller on the phone The caller's voice was hard to make out, said Todd Rockoff, chief executive officer of the Tucson Jewish Community Center. Based on what he knows it \"probably sounded more muffled than clear,\" Rockoff said. \"The person that answered the phone was able to ask some questions that kept the caller on the phone,\" he said. Delaware: 'Strong in the face of this adversity' The caller threatened the Siegel Jewish Community Center with a bomb, said Executive Director Ivy Harlev, who declined to give additional details. His community, in Wilmington, Delaware, refuses to let the threat cripple them, Harlev said. \"I can tell you that my community has been incredibly strong in the face of this adversity,\" he said. \"This affects more than just the Jewish community.\"",

        "Text": "As CNN first reported Tuesday, the military is seeking to increase US intelligence-gathering raids in Yemen similar to one undertaken in the first week of the Trump presidency. It's not yet clear if this adjustment in the approval process could be used for those operations. \"It is a philosophy more than a change in policy,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday of the discussions about the authorization process. President Donald Trump \"believes these are the experts in this field.\" At the same time, Spicer said that \"the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off,\" and that \"there are certain decisions that have to be signed off by the President,\" so that the degree of change might not end up being that sizeable. A senior defense official emphasized that this does not mean that the President would not be briefed. Defense Secretary James Mattis and senior military commanders could brief the President at any time and seek his specific approval. Since these are fundamentally judgement questions, the senior defense official said, the goal is to see if there could be a more efficient approval process for time-sensitive missions.- Military analysts warned, though, that pushing decision-making authority below the President for high-risk missions could create problems. \"The risk in greenlighting missions at a lower level than the President is one where the President assumes all the responsibility if something goes wrong, and he would really find it difficult to do that if in fact he was not part of the approval process,\" retired Col. Cedric Leighton said.-\"That element of decentralized control -- which the military loves in many cases, and in theory that the President loves -- but the problem that you have with that is, if something goes terribly wrong, you are going to end up with a lot of political fallout for something you didn't really approve or understand the minute details of.\" He continued, \"From a political standpoint it may be good for somebody who wants to wash their hands of it or something, but from a military standpoint it really abrogates the authority that the commander in chief has inherent in his position.\" Leighton said that authority can be particularly essential for difficult operations: \"What you really need is a commander in chief who is involved in the approval process, especially for politically sensitive missions like Yemen. Under the Obama administration, the White House retained significant control over authorizing high-risk missions where significant opposition forces were expected; new military techniques were being used; or highly specialized units like SEAL Team Six or Delta Force might be employed. Several defense officials told CNN that President Barack Obama had been cautious about these types of missions, and wanted in many cases to be able to review and approve them.",

I can only quote what the media said today -- this all looks like a witch hunt.\" Citing current and former senior US government officials CNN reported that Kislyak is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and spy recruiters in Washington. But Russia's Foreign Ministry has angrily rejected allegations that its top diplomat in Washington is a spy amid controversy over meetings he held with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Thursday insisted Kislyak was \"a well-known, world-class diplomat.\" \"He was deputy minister of foreign affairs in Russia, who has communicated with American colleagues for decades in different fields, and CNN accused him of being a Russian spy ... of recruiting? Oh my God!\" Sessions recuses himself on Russia inquiry Sessions on Thursday recused himself from any investigation related to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Sessions made the decision after it emerged that he had failed at his Senate confirmation hearing to disclose two pre-election meetings with Kislyak to Washington, at a time when Russia was accused of interfering in the presidential race. Pressure for Sessions to recuse himself from any involvement in a Justice Department probe into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow grew Thursday as prominent Republicans broke ranks with the administration. He is also facing calls to resign. But shortly before Sessions' recusal announcement, Trump backed his attorney general. He said Sessions did not make any misleading statements under oath during his confirmation hearings, but that he could have been more accurate in his responses to lawmakers. \"Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional,\" Trump said. \"This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election and now, they have lost their grip on reality. The real story is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. It is a total witch hunt!\" 'Total misinformation' Speaking at a press briefing Thursday, Zakharova dismissed media reports about the encounters between Sessions and Kislyak as \"shameful,\" an \"attempt at total misinformation\" and a kind of \"vandalism.\" Zakharova also defended the role of Russian diplomats, saying: \"Everyone knows how diplomats work and their work consists of making contacts.\" Asked to respond to the characterization of Kislyak as a spy, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, \"Nobody has heard a single statement from US intelligence agencies' representatives regarding our ambassador. Again, these are some depersonalized assumptions of the media that are constantly trying to blow this situation out of proportion.\" Peskov also insisted that Russia has never interfered in the domestic affairs of another country and has no plans ever to do so. He said the current \"overly emotional environment\" was affecting the prospects of a future meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"This emotional atmosphere builds up a certain resistance to the idea of developing a relationship with Russia. That's true. The negative effect is obvious here,\" Peskov told journalists on a conference call. Kislyak's interactions with Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Flynn's firing last month. Two meetings Sessions met with Kislyak twice last year, in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention, and in September in his office when Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Services committee, according to the Justice Department. Sessions, then a Republican senator for Alabama, campaigned on behalf of Trump throughout 2016. Sessions did not mention either meeting during his confirmation hearings when he said he knew of no contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. In response to reports of his meetings with Kislyak, Sessions' spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said there was nothing \"misleading about his answer\" to Congress because he \"was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign -- not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee.\" Sessions also strongly denied ever discussing campaign-related issues with anyone from Russia. \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign,\" he said in a statement. \"I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\" The House Intelligence Committee signed off this week on a plan to investigate Russia's alleged interference in the US elections, which includes examining contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, and looking into who leaked the details. Democrats have called for an independent investigation. Russia has consistently denied allegations that it meddled in the US election campaign. ",

        "Text": "Kushner and Flynn sat down in December at Trump Tower with Sergey Kislyak, according to a senior administration official, who described it as an \"introductory meeting\" and \"kind of an inconsequential hello.\" The meeting lasted for about 10 minutes, the official added. Who is Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States? Flynn was fired from his role as a national security adviser after he misled the administration about his conversations with Kislyak, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday said he would recuse himself from investigations into the Trump campaign relationship with Russia after news emerged that he too had spoken privately with the ambassador. Kushner's involvement in a meeting was first reported by The New Yorker, and Flynn's by The New York Times. The administration official disputed the idea that accepting a meeting with the Russian ambassador could be cause for concern in light of the discussion about Russian meddling in the US election, characterizing the meeting as merely an attempt to meet key international players during the transition to power. The official added that Kushner met with dozens of other ambassadors. Another national security adviser to the Trump campaign, J.D. Gordon, also disclosed Thursday that he had met with Kislyak, this time during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. That meeting was first reported by USA Today. Gordon told CNN that along with national security advisers Carter Page and Walid Phares, Gordon stressed to the Russian envoy that he would like to improve relations with Russia. Gordon added that at no time did any inappropriate chatter come up about colluding with the Russians to aid the Trump campaign. \"This is not any different than anything I said publicly and on panels,\" Gordon said. Gordon had advocated for language in the GOP platform that the Ukrainians not be armed in their battle against pro-Russian separatists, an effort was ultimately successful. But Gordon says he was simply advocating what Trump himself had expressed -- that he did not wish to see major war break out over the situation in Ukraine. In a statement to CNN, Page said he would not comment on any meetings and added that he \"never did anything improper\" with regard to Russia. Page did confirm that he met with Kislyak in Cleveland, however, in an interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes on Thursday night. \"I do not deny that,\" Page said.",

He's wanted for questioning over the death of Kim, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's estranged brother, who was killed with a VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13. A request has also been sent through the Foreign Ministry seeking the cooperation of Hyon Kwang Song, second secretary at the North Korean embassy, in relation to the investigation, Bakar said. On Friday, Ri Jong Chol -- the only North Korean man held in connection with Kim's death -- was released from custody, under heavy police escort, on his way to being deported. Police don't have sufficient evidence to charge Ri , Malaysia's attorney general told CNN Thursday. Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Ri will fly from Malaysia to Pyongyang, via Beijing, accompanied by two officials from the North Korean embassy. Malaysia's Director General of Immigration, Seri Mustafar Ali, said he's been blacklisted from re-entering the country. North Korea has vehemently denied any connection to the murder. Mysterious murder Two women have been charged with Kim's murder. Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong have both said they are not guilty. If found guilty, they will face the death penalty. According to authorities from their home countries, both women have maintained they thought they were participating in a TV prank show. Aisyah thought the substance she rubbed on Kim's face was \"a kind of oil, baby oil, something like that,\" said Andreano Erwin, Indonesia's deputy ambassador to Malaysia. Malaysian authorities said the substance was VX nerve agent, a deadly chemical weapon banned under international law. After the women wiped Kim's face with the liquid, he started feeling dizzy and died shortly afterward on his way to the hospital, Malaysian police said. VX is the world's most potent nerve agent and one of the most dangerous chemical weapons ever manufactured. It's banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention.",

        "Text": "May, addressing the Scottish Conservative Party conference in Glasgow, insisted there would be no benefit to Scotland going it alone when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. Uncertainty over Brexit has led to speculation that the Scottish National Party could call for a second independence referendum: in last year's referendum, 62% of voters in Scotland wanted to remain in the European Union. May accused the SNP, which controls the devolved administration in Edinburgh, of holding an \"obsession\" with independence and neglecting other domestic issues. She said that a \"tunnel-vision nationalism, which focuses only on independence at any cost, sells Scotland short.\" She said the UK government would negotiate a deal with the European Union that would protect Scottish interests after Brexit. \"I am determined to ensure that as we leave the EU, we do so as one United Kingdom, which prospers outside the EU as one United Kingdom,\" May said. \"That means achieving a deal with the EU which works for all parts of the UK -- England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- and for the United Kingdom as a whole.\" Sturgeon: UK on different path Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly argued that Scotland should stay in the European Single Market, even after the rest of the United Kingdom has left. In a speech Tuesday, she accused the UK government of ignoring Scotland's views and failing to compromise as it prepares to trigger Article 50, kicking off the formal process of leaving the European Union. If Scotland doesn't secure a special deal in Britain's negotiations with the European union, Sturgeon said, then \"proposing a further decision on independence wouldn't simply be legitimate, it would arguably be a necessary way of giving the people of Scotland a say in our own future direction.\" \"It would offer Scotland a proper choice on whether or not to be part of a post Brexit UK - a UK that is undoubtedly on a fundamentally different path today than that envisaged in 2014.\" In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, 55% voted in favor of remaining in the United Kingdom. 'Hard' Brexit The devolved Scottish government published a report in December which set out ways for Scotland still to maintain its current position in the single market -- which guarantees the free movement of goods, services and people within the bloc -- even if the rest of the UK leaves. May indicated in a key speech in January that the UK government will pursue a \"hard Brexit,\" leading to the UK withdrawing from the single market and European customs union.",

        "Text": "The US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said the 13 members of La Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13, face offenses including seven murder charges, racketeering, attempted murder, assault, obstruction of justice and arson in the 41-count indictment unsealed Thursday in federal court in Central Islip, New York. \"Law enforcement was determined that these brutal murders wouldn't turn into cold cases,\" US Attorney Robert L. Capers told reporters. Two of the students -- Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16 -- were beaten with baseball bats and a machete, Capers said. The girls attended Brentwood High School in Brentwood, a working-class community in Suffolk County, about 45 miles east of New York City. At the time, police said there appeared to be gang involvement in the girls' deaths and the deaths of two others, whose skeletal remains were found after they had been missing for months. Police have not announced arrests in the latter two deaths. \"The Brentwood family has spent the last six months in mourning, but today marks the beginning of the healing process for this beautiful and resilient community,\" Suffolk County Police Commissioner Timothy Sini said. Kayla was involved in a \"series of disputes\" with MS-13 gang members and associates months earlier, authorities said. She and friends then became involved in an altercation at Brentwood High a week before the girls' deaths, authorities said. MS-13 members vowed to seek revenge. On September 13, gang members went looking for rival gang members to kill in Brentwood, authorities said. Prosecutors said gang members, including one man who was indicted, saw the two best friends. The girls had gone for a walk that night, News 12 Long island reported. They recognized Kayla, and got permission to kill the girls from two gang leaders, who were also indicted, authorities said. A passerby found Nisa's body on a Brentwood street on September 13, the eve of her 16th birthday, Sini said. The next day, Kayla's body was discovered in the backyard of a nearby home. \"My message to the people of Brentwood and all of Suffolk County is that although we are keenly aware that nothing will ever undue the heartbreaking loss of Nisa and Kayla, we can take solace in the fact that their savage murderers will be held accountable,\" Sini said. Authorities said a third Brentwood High School student, Jose Pena, 18, was killed on June 3, 2016. His skeletal remains were discovered on October 17, 2016, in a wooded area that served as a burial ground for MS-13 victims, Capers said. Pena was killed because he was suspected violating gang rules, federal authorities said. \"His bones bore marks of repeated stab wounds and beatings with a bat, a blunt force instrument,\" Capers said. Sini said Suffolk police have cracked down on gangs. Police have collected intelligence on MS-13 members and created a list of gang members to put under surveillance. Officers have arrested members for various crimes, he said. Since September 2016, Sini said, 125 MS-13 members have been arrested. \"We are going to eradicate MS-13 from these communities,\" Sini said. MS-13 is one of the largest criminal organizations in the United States, according to federal authorities. An international criminal organization, it has more than 6,000 members in the United States, including a presence in at least 46 states and the District of Columbia, officials said. More than 30,000 members operate mostly in El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala, federal authorities said. MS-13 is the largest and most violent street gang on Long Island, the US Attorney's Office said. Capers said two of the suspects are US citizens. A third suspect is a legal permanent resident and the rest are undocumented immigrants, Capers said. If convicted, the defendants could face up to life in prison or the death penalty.",

        "Text": "A government act on Thursday reintroduced compulsory military service in the country for the first time since 2010, and for the first time on a gender-equal basis. Peter Hultqvist, Sweden's minister of defense, cited Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014 as one of the triggers for the decision. \"After the Russian annexation of Crimea against international law, and their increased military exercises close to the border, we have a new security situation,\" Hultqvist said. Hultqvist added that Sweden is \"strengthening its military cooperation with Finland and with the NATO partners.\" Sweden is not a NATO member but it has contributed to NATO-led operations and enjoys bilateral ties with the alliance through the Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The country suspended conscription in 2010 and instead adopted a recruitment system which relied on volunteers. The decision to boost defense spending by $720 million over five years was taken in February 2015 -- but Sweden is lacking suitable numbers for its defense forces. According to government figures, the armed forces were 1,000 troops short in terms of full-time squad leaders, solders and sailors. The new plan aims to ensure there are 6,000 full time members serving with 10,000 available on a part-time basis. New recruits According to Marinette Nyh Radebo, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense, those born between 1999 and 2000, along with marginally older volunteers, will undergo testing on July 1 to see if they are eligible. Radebo explained that 13,000 men and women will be drawn from around 100,000 which fit into the correct age category. They will then undergo physical and psychological assessments. It is the first time that Sweden has conscripted women. Not every person will be required to sign up, with only 4,000 people a year set to be conscripted until 2019. Radebo told CNN that while there will not be a quota system in terms of the ratio between male and female recruits, the \"gender equal\" policy for the 1999 generation should mean there will be an increase in the number of women in the armed forces. She said the new recruits will take part in their first military exercises on January 1, 2018. Conscripts will spend between nine to 11 months in training before choosing whether to pursue a career in the military or join as a reserve soldier. 'More active' \"We see that we have more military activities in our neighborhood, and also that the illegal annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is of course part of it,\" Radebo told CNN. \"We react to the activities and we don't talk about threats, that's why we have a parliament decision with a 70% of the parliament behind the present defense decision to strengthen military capacity and increase cooperation with the countries around us.\" Sweden, which is a neutral country, has stepped up its defensive efforts in recent months. In September, it sent 150 troops to the island of Gotland, which sits between the mainland and a number of former Soviet Baltic states amid rising tensions with Russia. A Swedish government report says that a full battalion will be established on the island by 2018.",

        "Text": "Army units \"in cooperation with the allied and backing forces\" inflicted heavy losses on ISIS forces in operations supported by Syrian and Russian air forces, the report said. Palmyra was seized from regime forces by ISIS in December after hundreds of the jihadist group's militants launched a coordinated attack in and around the city. Palmyra is seen as strategically important to both sides in Syria's more than five year civil war. Located in Homs province, in central Syria, it is around 225 kilometers (140 miles) from Raqqa, considered ISIS' headquarters in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Syrian government forces completed their operation with the help of Russian airpower, reported Russia's state news agency TASS. Control over the city has passed from the regime to ISIS and back again a number of times. Syrian forces recaptured the city from ISIS last March, after it was seized the previous May, when ISIS started demolishing ancient ruins in the city. Syrian rebel leaders gathered in Geneva for peace talks with the government refused to congratulate the regime. Nasser al-Hariri, a member of the Syrian Coalition, said the struggle for Palmyra was like watching a cartoon. \"This is the second time we've seen the handover [of Palmyra] and this is obviously being used for political reasons,\" said al-Hariri in a press statement Thursday. \"if we want to follow the game of (Syrian President) Assad and Palmyra, it will be like watching Tom and Jerry.\" In the past, the Syrian army has boasted that the capture of Palmyra would be \"a launchpad to expand military operations\" into Raqqa and Deir Ezzor provinces. Monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed Palmyra's recapture. Rami Abdulrahman, the founder of SOHR, said the city had been taken after \"heavy clashes between ISIS and the regime forces erupted on Wednesday.\"",

        "Text": "After expressing concern about Wikileaks' release of documents allegedly revealing CIA surveillance techniques, Spicer quickly muddled his message. He connected the latest WikiLeaks document dump to surveillance efforts under the Obama administration, days after President Donald Trump's leveled his unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama tapped the GOP candidate's phones during the 2016 campaign. And then he took to arguing forcefully that there was a \"double standard\" when it comes to the level of outrage elicited by different leaks. 'I love Wikileaks' The White House has repeatedly argued that too much public and political attention has been devoted to the investigation into contacts between Trump campaign officials and suspected Russian operatives and not enough to the leaks of that confidential information. \"It's interesting how there's sort of a double standard with when the leaks occur, how much outrage there is,\" he said. Spicer's comments came as he relayed Trump's \"concern\" about the leaks and said Americans should be \"outraged\" by the release of classified information. \"This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our country, our security and our well-being,\"Spicer said. Spicer's claims Wednesday came as he faced questions about a double standard on the President's part in condemning this leak while he praised WikiLeaks' publication of emails related to his rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. \"I love WikiLeaks!\" Trump proclaimed on the stump last year as he took to reading before crowds of cheering supporters hacked emails that the site released. Spicer said Wednesday that there is a \"massive, massive difference\" between the two disclosures. \"There is a big difference between disclosing Podesta -- John Podesta's Gmail accounts about a back-and-forth and his undermining of Hillary Clinton and his thoughts on her on a personal nature, and the leaking of classified information,\" Spicer said. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly lauded WikiLeaks for releasing emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's email account, several of which portrayed Clinton in an unfavorable light. The US intelligence community concluded those emails were hacked and released to WikiLeaks by Russian sources as part of a campaign to hurt Clinton. But Trump's comments about hacking when he was on the campaign trail weren't limited to praising of WikiLeaks, which has engaged in publishing classified national security information since 2006, and its dump of Clinton emails. Trump also applauded the hack of the Democratic National Committee and downplayed the seriousness of the various election-related hacks, at one point urging Russia to find and release the 33,000 emails allegedly deleted from the private email server Clinton used while secretary of state.' Leaks Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, slammed Spicer's claim that there was no comparison between Trump's praise of WikiLeaks' campaign-related document dumps and the latest leak of CIA documents. \"The reality is, yes, there's a difference between the hacking and the leaking through WikiLeaks during the campaign -- but both were wrong, both were serious injuries to our national security,\" Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, arguing that the Democratic document release was part of the Russian campaign to undermine US democracy. \"Both should be condemned.\" Spicer's decision to mix politics with his condemnation of WikiLeaks' latest dump broke with a simpler approach followed by his predecessors -- who stuck to their role of voicing the government's concerns about leaks, without drawing in tangential issues. It's the approach White House press secretary Robert Gibbs took in 2010 when WikiLeaks published classified diplomatic cables. \"By releasing stolen and classified documents, WikiLeaks has put at risk not only the cause of human rights but also the lives and work of these individuals,\"Gibbs said, without delving into any broader political discussion. \"We condemn in the strongest terms the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security information.\"",

He made the remark as he discussed the rise of encryption since 2013 disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed sensitive US spy practices. \"Even our communications with our spouses, with our clergy members, with our attorneys are not absolutely private in America,\" Comey added. \"In appropriate circumstances, a judge can compel any one of us to testify in court about those very private communications.\" But, he also said Americans \"have a reasonable expectation of privacy in our homes, in our cars, in our devices. \"It is a vital part of being an American. The government cannot invade our privacy without good reason, reviewable in court,\" Comey continued. In the last four months of 2016, the FBI lawfully gained access to 2,800 devices recovered in criminal, terrorism and counterintelligence investigations and the FBI was unable to open 43% of those devices, Comey said. Americans' desire for privacy and security should never be viewed as incompatible, he said. \"We all value privacy. We all value security. We should never have to sacrifice one for the other,\" Comey said. \"Our founders struck a bargain that is at the center of this amazing country of ours and has been for over two centuries.\" Comey's leadership of the FBI has been marked by controversy in the wake of the bureau's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email controversy and President Donald Trump's baseless accusations that President Barack Obama ordered the wiretapping of phones at Trump Tower. He did not address the wiretapping claim nor WikiLeaks' recent claim that it obtained internal CIA documents. Comey did, however, say he plans to finish out his 10-year term. \"You're stuck with me for about another 6 1/2 years, and so I'd love to be invited back again,\" he said.",

        "Text": "Having lost the first-leg 4-0 in Paris, few had given Barca a chance of reaching the last eight given no side had previously overturned such a deficit in the history of the competition. But Luis Enrique's side made a barnstorming start to the match and early in the second half a Lionel Messi penalty gave them a 3-0 lead in the Camp Nou. RELATED: See fans go wild The home side were coasting, but just past the hour Uruguayan striker Edison Cavani's volley seemingly put PSG back in control, with Barca needing to score three more times, given the French side now had a crucial away goal. However, with two minutes of normal time remaining Neymar's exquisite free-kick gave Barca renewed hope and two goals in stoppage time completed the most incredible of comebacks. 'Unbelievable' Those five minutes of stoppage time almost defy description. In the 91st minute Luis Suarez, who had given Barcelona an early lead, won a penalty, which Neymar converted. With time running out Barcelona threw everyone forward -- even their goalkeeper Marc-Andr¨¦ ter Stegen. And almost with the last kick of the game Barca's sixth goal came from the most unlikely of sources -- not their famed strikers -- Messi, Neymar or Suarez -- but defender Sergio Roberto, who was born in Catalonia and is a product of Barca's youth academy. Bayern Munich's French international Franck Ribery, who played for the German club in Tuesday's 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal, described the game as \"unbelievable.\" Former Bayern and Chelsea star Michael Ballack tweeted: \"That's Champions League,\" followed by a series of fire emojis. In the 2005 Champions League final, Liverpool came back from a 3-0 deficit to beat AC Milan on penalties, but Barca's victory is arguably the greatest comeback in the history of the Champions League, given those frantic and frenetic final seven minutes. READ: David Villa -- from broken legs to breaking records READ: U.S. soccer stars must stand for national anthem READ: Is Tottenham's Harry Kane 'world class'? Historic Barca's president Josep Maria Bartomeu said on the club's Twitter feed it was an \"historic achievement that will be remembered forever.\" Ahead of Wednesday's game, Enrique had remained quietly confident that his team could achieve the unthinkable. \"We arrive in good form and we have to be confident,\" Enrique told reporters, referring to Barca's two previous league victories, where his team had beaten Sporting Gijon 6-1 and Celta Vigo 5-0. \"We are in the middle of the tie, we have nothing to lose and a lot to win -- if they scored four, we can score six,\" added the strangely prophetic Barca coach. PSG's English Twitter feed had just one word to sum up the French club's defeat: \"gutted,\" while its website used the word \"speechless\" for its headline for a report of the defeat. In June 2016, PSG's Qatari owners had appointed Spanish coach Unai Emery, who had led Sevilla to three consecutive Europa League triumphs. INTERACTIVE: Build your Ultimate Football Player The hope was that Emery's tactical nous would help PSG's billion dollar fueled quest to win the Champions League and in the first leg the French club had run ragged a strangely subdued Barca. Luck certainly wasn't on PSG's side on Wednesday -- Barca's second goal came from a Layvin Kurzawa own goal, Cavani hit the post, while the home side's first penalty derived from Thomas Meunier's slip, causing Neymar to tumble over the Belgian and win a foul. Even so the French side will be left wondering just how they exited the Champions League given their commanding performance and lead they had established in the first leg. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos \"I haven't spoken to the players yet, it's not the right time,\" PSG's CEO and chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi told the club's website.\"Everyone is annoyed, it's normal. We're going to calm ourselves down.\" \"In five minutes, we lost everything,\" said Emery. \"We weren't able to defend. It's an experience. A negative experience, but an experience all the same. I'm learning for the future.\" The scenes in the Nou Camp press area looked as chaotic as events on the field, with journalist Reshmin Chowdhury tweeting a video of his astonished media colleagues trying to come to terms with what they had just witnessed -- let alone report it. \"This is a crazy, unique sport,\" said Enrique after the game. \"I dedicate this win to all BarÃ§a fans who kept faith in us. \"No one stopped believing,\" added the Barca coach. \"The team were spectacular. We were rewarded in the end.\" In Wednesday's other quarterfinal Borussia Dortmund beat Benfica 4-0 to win their tie 4-1 on aggregate.",

        "Text": "During the hour-long meeting, sources said Trump chastised the groups -- including Club for Growth, the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks and the Tea Party Patriots -- for calling the House GOP proposal \"Obamacare lite,\" warning the tea party activists, \"you are helping the other side.\" In true Trump fashion, the President jumped into salesman mode, sources at the meeting said. \"This is going to be great. You're going to make it even greater,\" the President told the group. \"I'm going to work hard to get it done.\" The meeting between Trump and the conservative leaders also included White House senior advisers Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway and Marc Short, as well as other top West Wing staff. Sources at the meeting said White House aides showed some openness to one aspect of the House GOP plan that has become an irritant to tea party aligned groups: the provision that pushes back an overhaul of the expansion Obamacare Medicaid funding until 2020. The conservative groups at the meeting asked that the date be moved up to January 1, 2018. White House aides said they were \"open to discussing\" it, sources said. Concerns were also raised about the tax credits in the House GOP plan which allow lower-income Americans to buy health insurance, financial assistance that tea party groups see as subsidies. \"They counter-punched hard on that,\" a source at the meeting said of the White House response. Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney, a former member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, gave an impassioned defense of the tax credits, a display that surprised attendees from the conservative groups. \"He was very defensive about it,\" one attendee said about Mulvaney. Confident that the health care plan will pass the House, Trump laid out his strategy for winning passage in the Senate, telling the meeting he will campaign heavily in red states featuring vulnerable Democrats up for re-election. \"Trump said he will have football stadium events in states where he won by 10-12 points and he is going to dare people to vote against him,\" a source at the meeting said. As for prominent Republican opponents of the health care plan, Trump sounded optimistic. On Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the President was effusive about his one-time primary rival. \"I love him. He's a friend. He's going to end up voting for it,\" the President told the group. A source at the meeting was astonished as to how White House staff could have been so blindsided by the initial conservative opposition to the GOP plan. \"We telegraphed it for weeks,\" one tea party official at the meeting said. A WH official at the meeting said: \"It was a legit policy meeting -- real discussion about specifics.\" \"The president expressed that he was open to things that could improve the bill, but was also clear that this is the vehicle -- this is the chance to repeal and replace.\"",

On Wednesday, CNN affiliate WEWS' reporter John Kosich asked the vice president a yes or no question: Did he believe Trump's allegation? Pence skirted the question and tried to steer the discussion to health care, as the Trump administration has been pushing to replace Obamacare.  John Kosich, WEWS: The President has alleged that the former President committed a felony in wiretapping Trump Tower. Yes or no \"?do you believe that President Obama did that? Mike Pence: Well, what I can say is that the President and our administration are very confident that the congressional committees in the House and Senate that are examining issues surrounding the last election, the run-up to the last election, will do that in a thorough and equitable way. They'll look at those issues, they'll look at other issues that have been raised. But rest assured, our focus is right where the American people are focused, and that's on bringing more jobs here to Ohio, creating a better healthcare system built on consumer choice.",

They were among 11 Malaysian citizens who became trapped in the country after North Korea announced a ban on Malaysian departures. They included four embassy staffers and their family members. Kuala Lumpur quickly announced its own ban to stop North Koreans leaving Malaysia. Officials declined to say how many North Koreans were inside the country. Relations between Malaysia and North Korea have deteriorated since the murder of Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, on February 13. Kim was poisoned with the highly lethal VX nerve agent as he was checking into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau, according to Malaysian police. Two women, one from Indonesian and another from Vietnam, have been charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted. Police are currently seeking seven North Koreans over the murder. Four are suspects who are believed to be back in their home country. Police want to speak with three others who are thought to be holed up in the North Korean embassy in Malaysia. Kim's family is believed to be in hiding. His son, Kim Han Sol, appeared for the first time since the murder in a video Wednesday. ",

        "Text": "Attorneys for the state filed a new 40-page request just before midnight on Tuesday, asking a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order blocking implementation of the new executive order. Trump signed a new executive order Monday banning foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and banning all refugees for 120 days. In a statement, Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin said the filings ask the court to declare sections 2 and 6 of Trump's executive order contrary to the constitution and laws of the United States. \"Sections 2 and 6 of the March 6, 2017 Executive Order violate the Immigration and Nationality Act by discriminating on the basis of nationality, ignoring and modifying the statutory criteria for determining terrorism-related inadmissibility, and exceeding the President's authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\" Chin said in a statement. The executive order is affecting the economy, the state's attorney aid. \"The new executive order is resulting in the establishment of religion in the state of Hawaii contrary to its state constitution; it is inflicting immediate damage to Hawaii's economy, educational institutions, and tourism industry; and it is subjecting a portion of the state's citizens to second-class treatment and discrimination, while denying all Hawaii residents the benefits of an inclusive and pluralistic society,\" attorneys for the state argued in court filings. \"The executive order means that thousands of individuals across the United States and in Hawaii who have immediate family members living in the affected countries will now be unable to receive visits from those persons or to be reunited with them in the United States.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the filing, but will have an opportunity to respond to the state's amended complaint against the travel ban on March 13. \"The entire history and culture of Hawaii is based upon nondiscrimination either in its constitution as well as its laws,\" Chin told CNN affiliate KHON. \"Hawaii has 20% foreign-born residents and 100,000 people who are not citizens as well as 20% of our workforce that are not foreign born.\" US District Court Judge Derrick Watson approved the expedited briefing schedule the parties proposed in order for the case to be heard before the new executive order goes into effect on March 16. Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued Monday that the ban was necessary because \"we cannot compromise our nation's security by allowing visitors entry when their own governments are unable or unwilling to provide the information we need to vet them responsibly, or when those governments actively support terrorism.\" Hawaii had previously sued over Trump's original travel ban, but the case was put on hold temporarily while a different federal judge's nationwide temporary restraining order halting the original ban remained in place. Watson granted the state's request to lift that hold on Wednesday in light of the new executive order. \"To be sure, the new executive order covers fewer people than the old one,\" Neal Katyal, one of the lead attorneys for Hawaii and former acting US solicitor general, explained in an interview with CNN. But in his view, the new travel ban still \"suffers from the same constitutional and statutory defects.\" The state's amended complaint asserts a number of different claims, but primarily emphasizes the new executive order's alleged discriminatory intent and effect, as well as the harm to Hawaii's economy. Hawaii is also joined in the lawsuit by an American who is the imam of the Muslim Association of Hawaii and says he has lived in state for over a decade with his wife and children, but now his Syrian mother-in-law cannot visit them because she does not currently hold a visa to enter the US. While many immigrants' rights groups and state attorneys general expressed deep reservations about the new order when it was released Monday, none had filed new lawsuits or amended their original filings until now. The Justice Department filed a flurry of notices in federal courts Monday -- including in this Hawaii case -- alerting the judges to the new order and arguing that the new order \"falls outside of\" injunctions that blocked the original ban. The government cited the significant changes to the new order, including the fact that it does not apply to green card holders or those with valid visas.",

        "Text": "The US-backed fighters are preparing to move in the coming weeks to assault the city of Raqqa, ISIS' self-declared capital, according to the officials. The Pentagon and the Marine Corps have declined to confirm the deployment because of security concerns in the region. They have also declined to specify the exact location of the forces or how many are there. The Washington Post was the first to report the deployment of the Marines. The deployment does not come as a surprise. Military commanders have discussed for weeks the possibility of putting artillery forces into the area, with the goal of accelerating the capabilities of the US-backed Arab and Kurdish forces there. A similar deployment last year near Mosul, Iraq involved several hundred Marines equipped with artillery guns that fire shells to provide covering fire for advancing forces. Because Marines were already deployed to the region, the movement into Syria did not have to be specifically approved by President Donald Trump or Defense Secretary James Mattis -- but both the White House and Pentagon were aware of the plan, officials said. The Marines deployed from ships in the Persian Gulf region. This is the second major expansion of US ground forces in northern Syria in days. The US has also deployed approximately 100 Army Rangers in and around Manbij, Syria. US officials have taken the unusual step of publicly talking about the Ranger deployment and where they are located to protect against them inadvertently coming under fire from forces fighting in the region or Turkish, Russian or Syrian forces. The US troops in Manbij are trying to deter hostilities due to their visible presence, rather than the typical mission of training, advising and assisting local forces. It is also not clear if the deployment of the Marines and Rangers violates the current cap on US forces in Syria. That cap broadly restricts the US to having more than 500 forces there at any one time. Until now, troops in the area have largely been Special Operations Forces. The US believes the pressure on ISIS in Raqqa is working. A US official told reporters Wednesday that intelligence indicates some ISIS leadership and operatives continue to try to leave the city. There is also US intelligence that indicates the city is laced with trenches, tunnels, roadside bombs and houses and buildings wired to explode, the official said. If correct, it indicates that the US has likely been able to gather intelligence from both overhead surveillance aircraft and people on the ground. However, the official also noted that \"Raqqa will probably not be the final battle against ISIS,\" and added that the group still has some personnel dispersed in areas south and east of the city. ISIS could have as many as 4,000 fighters in Raqqa, according to very rough US estimates, the official said.",

        "Text": "Namely, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump wasn't referring to wiretapping when he tweeted about wiretapping. \"I think there's no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election,\" Spicer said. \"The President used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities.\" Wiretapping is a narrowly defined surveillance activity that involves tapping into \"a telephone or telegram wire in order to get information,\" according to Merriam-Webster dictionary. Spicer also said that Trump was referring to the Obama administration broadly -- and not accusing Obama of personal involvement -- when he tweeted that \"Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower\" and accused Obama of being a \"bad\" or \"sick guy.\" Spicer's comments came on the same say as the deadline for the Justice Department to provide evidence to the House Intelligence Committee to back up Trump's claim. The White House has so far refused to provide any evidence, and numerous former officials have denied the existence of any warrant to wiretap Trump Tower. A week earlier, Spicer said Trump's tweet \"speaks for itself\" and declined to provide any further explanation. But Monday, Spicer was open to providing an interpretation for Trump's tweet, saying the President told Spicer he was referring to means of surveillance beyond wiretapping in his tweets accusing Obama of doing just that. Spicer doesn't reject concept of 'Deep State' But in each of the four tweets Trump fired off leveling the accusation, Trump referred specifically to phone tapping -- and only used quotation marks in two of those. \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory,\" Trump said in his first tweet. \"Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president?\" he asked in the next. Then, Trump tweeted that Obama \"was tapping my phones in October\" and had stooped low \"to tapp (sic) my phones during the very sacred election process.\" But Spicer was not the only White House official to provide an alternative definition of the word \"wiretap\" despite Trump's clear language. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway also addressed the wiretapping claims in an interview Sunday with the Bergen County Record, suggesting that other covert surveillance methods used by the CIA -- as revealed by Wikileaks last week -- could have been used in Trump Tower by the Obama administration. 5 memorable moments from Kellyanne Conway on \"New Day\" \"Do you know whether Trump Tower was wiretapped?\" Bergen County Record columnist Mike Kelly asked Conway on Sunday. \"What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,\" Conway said, before suggesting that surveillance could take place through phones, TVs or \"microwaves that turn into cameras.\"",

        "Text": "The House Intelligence Committee has set a Monday deadline for the DOJ to provide the evidence, a source familiar with the matter has told CNN, and has sent letters throughout the intelligence community this week to obtain records related to Russia. Former President Barack Obama has denied the allegations through a spokesman, and his former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, also has publicly denied them. Sources have told CNN that FBI Director James Comey also pushed back against Trump's claim. Trump has not publicly provided any evidence for his allegations, first made more than a week ago. Sunday night, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to the President, appeared to expand the allegations by suggesting to the Bergen Record there could have been even wider spying of the Trump campaign, including the use of microwaves and television sets. Like the President, however, she did not provide any evidence, and later said she was speaking generally about surveillance. As Congress' deadline looms, calls for Trump to produce evidence have grown louder, including by some in his own party. \"The President has one of two choices: either retract or provide the information that the American people deserve,\" Sen. John McCain told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" \"I have no reason to believe that the charge is true, but I also believe that the President of the United States could clear this up in a minute.\" Two congressmen privy to sensitive intelligence information said this weekend that they, too, had no information currently to support Trump's claims. The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, said on ABC's \"This Week\": \"I don't expect we'll see evidence of this.\" And House Speaker Paul Ryan, asked directly on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" if he had seen evidence of the wiretaps, said: \"No.\" Conway said Sunday that \"surveillance\" could go beyond the tapping of phones. \"What I can say is there are many ways to surveil each other,\" Conway told the Record. \"You can surveil someone through their phones, certainly through their television sets \"?any number of ways.\" She went on to allege that the spying could have been done with \"microwaves that turn into cameras,\" adding: \"We know this is a fact of modern life.\" Conway also reiterated Trump's request that an investigation into the wiretapping claims be included into a congressional investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election. Pressed on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Monday morning about her comments to the Record, Conway said she was speaking about \"surveilling generally\" and \"wasn't making a suggestion about Trump Tower.\" \"I have no evidence,\" Conway said, \"but that's why there is an investigation in Congress.\" She later tweeted that the Record's headline -- \"Kellyanne Conway suggests even wider surveillance of Trump campaign\" -- was \"just wrong.\" \"Response to Bergen Record was about surveillance articles in news & techniques generally, not about campaign. Headline just wrong,\" Conway said. This story has been updated.",

        "Text": "\"Why this time am I a terrorist? Are the Turks living in this country terrorists?\" asked Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview Monday with CNN's Connect the World amid a row between the two countries. The decision to refuse him permission to fly to Rotterdam to address the rally over the weekend was followed by a refusal by the Dutch to let Turkish family affairs minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kayafrom enter the Turkish consulate in the city. She was escorted out of the country. Violent clashes in Rotterdam followed the decision to halt the two ministers from addressing the rallies. No explanation, Minister complains Cavusoglu told CNN he had been given no explanation from the Dutch as to why they had public order and safety concerns over his visit -- the reason they gave for blocking it. \"Is there any one single Turkish Turk radicalized? They say no. So what is the security problem then? They don't give me any detail, I am the Foreign Minister of Turkey. I am not a terrorist this is just excuse, unfortunately, to hide the real reasons,\" he said. Cavusoglu suggested that a rise in racism, Islamophobia and xenophobia in the Netherlands and other European countries is to blame. He also claimed the Netherlands and other European countries wish to \"obstruct\" the yes campaign for a referendum on the Turkish constitution to be held on April 16 that would grant new powers to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan . Cavusoglu was visiting Rotterdam to rally support among Turkish expatriates in the Netherlands who can vote in the referendum. Nazi comments echoed After the foreign minister's visit to Rotterdam was blocked, Erdogan reacted angrily, comparing the Dutch government to Nazis. In response, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Erdogan's remarks were inflammatory and demanded an apology. The Netherlands lost more than 200,000 of its citizens when it was occupied by Nazi Germany in World War II. Appearing to defend Erdogan's inflammatory remarks about Nazis, Cavusoglu said: \"Such attitudes such policies and the violations of the European standards and the values and the Vienna conventions never happened since World War Two. It didn't happen even during the World War Two and it didn't happen maybe even during the Nazi (era)... so that is why we are making the comparison.\" Action against Dutch government Cavusoglu said he has made recommendations for action against the Dutch government in protest at what happened at the weekend. He declined to say what this will entail. On Monday, the Dutch issued travel advice via Twitter for Dutch citizens presently in Turkey telling them to \"avoid demonstrations and be alert\" amid the bitter row between the two countries. But Cavusoglu told CNN: \"We will not target the Dutch people and we will not harm them because it is not their mistake. And the Dutch people are friends of turkey and so many tourists are coming to Turkey and we have been friends for 400 years.\"",

        "Text": "That set off ugly diplomatic feuding, name-calling and popular unrest. The spat erupted as citizens prepare to cast their ballots in votes that could radically alter the political landscape in both countries. What's going on? How did the quarrel begin? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been intent on rallying the roughly 4.6 million expatriate Turks living in western Europe to vote in an upcoming Turkish constitutional referendum. If passed, the referendum would transform Turkey's parliamentary system into a presidential one, effectively consolidating the power of three legislative bodies into one executive branch under Erdogan. Germany, Austria and Switzerland sought to prevent referendum rallies taking place on their soil -- citing security and overcrowding concerns. On Saturday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu attempted to enter the Netherlands to address a rally in the port city of Rotterdam. The Dutch barred the diplomat from entering, also pointing to security concerns. Another minister was barred from entering the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam. How did the Turks react? Protests broke out in both countries. Cavusoglu has promised \"tenfold\" retaliation against the Netherlands According to Turkish state-run news, Dutch diplomatic missions in Ankara and Istanbul had been closed off due to security concerns. The Turkish foreign ministry has told the Dutch ambassador, who is presently on leave and out of the country, he need not return \"for a while.\" Erdogan said the Netherlands is \"sacrificing Turkish-Dutch relations.\" He accused the country of Nazism and likened the Netherlands to a \"banana republic.\" He also called for sanctions. \"Nazism is still widespread in Europe, \" he said. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the remarks were inflammatory and demanded an apology. Turkey's \"current rhetorical attacks\" against the Netherlands led Denmark's Prime Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen to postpone a meeting with his Turkish counterpart. Is the Dutch move tied to its domestic politics? The dispute comes ahead of the Netherlands' general election Wednesday, with immigration from Muslim countries a key issue. The election campaign has pitted two party leaders against each other, liberal incumbent Prime Minister Mark Rutte and populist far-right figure Geert Wilders. As leader of the Freedom Party, Wilders wants to stop immigration from Muslim countries, close mosques, ban the burqa and imprison radical Muslims who have committed no crimes on a \"preventative\" basis. Rutte appears to have pushed himself to the right to compete with Wilders, in January writing an open letter in which he said immigrants who did not assimilate in the Netherlands should \"behave normally, or go away.\" Freelance journalist David Chesal told CNN the Dutch government's move was effectively \"election-time grandstanding.\" \"Prime Minister Rutte could not possibly allow a huge Turkish campaign to take place in the city of Rotterdam or anywhere else in the Netherlands,\" Chesal said. Meantime he said Erdogan was trying to show Turks that he had the power to influence Europe. \"So clearly Erdogan is making full use of this to position Europe as an enemy of Turkey to try to gain as much possible support for his referendum for more political power,\" Chesal told CNN. How do European governments view Erdogan? European governments have been critical of Erdogan's commitment to basic freedoms since a failed coup attempt earlier this year. Since then, Erdogan has cracked down on opposition, particularly journalists, academics and the public service sector. Also, nearly 140 media outlets have been shuttered, more than 41,000 people have been arrested and about 100,000 workers have been dismissed from public service positions. The country, a NATO member, jailed more journalists than any other country in 2016, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Critics call the referendum proposal anti-democratic and say it's indicative of Erdogan's drift toward authoritarian rule. German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned last week that Turkey's approach to democracy and the rule of law are \"deeply problematic\" to the country's future cooperation with the European Union.",

        "Text": "He fills an outsized global role these days and any hint of humiliation at not getting his way in the Netherlands will not sit well at home -- where he generally does get his own way. When rebuffed by Germany a week and half ago and by the Netherlands this week, he accused both of Nazi inclinations. His incendiary words brought sharp rebuke from both countries, the Dutch reminding him of the 200,000 people killed by Nazi forces. This weekend his ministers were due to address expat Turks in the Netherlands to get their support for a Turkish referendum that will transfer and consolidate Turkey's powers in Erdogan's hands alone. But in attempting to further eclipse democracy in his country, Erdogan appears to have overlooked Holland's impending elections where immigration is a key issue. The Netherlands -- where his Foreign Minister and Minister of Families were denied permission to address rallies -- goes to the polls on Wednesday. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he doesn't think Erdogan was intent on upsetting the Dutch elections but that his ministers tried to force their way in to his country against the direct wishes of the Dutch government. According to Rutte, his government was in negotiation with Foreign Minister Mevlet Cavusoglu to speak at a small gathering in Rotterdam. During the negotiations Cavusolglu threatened unspecified action if he didn't get his way. For Rutte that was a red line: \"we stopped talks ... when the Turkish Foreign Secretary started threatening us with sanctions.\" That's when Cavusolglu was denied permission to land at Rotterdam airport. Hours later, undaunted, another of Erdogan's ministers tried to make it to Rotterdam to give a speech. Families Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kayafrom drove in from Germany but was later escorted back to the border by Dutch police. Populist nationalist Geert Wilders, who campaigns on an anti-Muslim agenda, has been neck and neck with Rutte's People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. Over the weekend, he sought to gain advantage from the discord, tweeting to the Families Minister to \"go away and never come back\" and to \"take all your Turkish fans from The Netherlands with you please.\" If he could, Wilders would take the Netherlands out of the EU and close down its open borders that allowed Erdogan's minister to drive unhindered in to Holland from Germany. At any other time this might have been a small diplomatic skirmish, but this is not a normal time. Post Brexit, post Trump, Europe faces a round of elections where populist nationalists like Wilders thrive on immigration issues and pose an existential threat to the EU. Erdogan has emerged as an increasingly influential leader, a key global partner on counter-terrorism, a necessary ally for the US in Syria as well as new partner for Russia in the same conflict, not to mention a vital floodgate holding back refugees from pouring in to Europe. All this against a backdrop of increasing European unease at Erdogan's political reforms in Turkey that appear to many European diplomats to benefit only him and his cronies, taking him farther from his stated goal of EU membership. Since the coup attempt last July, Turkey has shut down nearly 140 media organizations, arrested 41,000 people and thrown about 100,000 others out of their jobs. Now the stage has slowly been set, Erdogan has his hands on levers that are already triggering tremors across the continent; however uncomfortably that sits with European governments. Brexit was won on the issue of immigration, fueled by images of refugees streaming into Europe and compounded by fears of radical Islamist terror attacks. UK to Europe: We're out Today the same fears fuel the populist narrative all across northern Europe. Not just by Wilders in the Netherlands but French Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, whose country goes to the polls next month, and where she too has vowed to lead the country out of the EU if she wins. Across Europe in the coming months more countries go to the polls and in most established parties face an erosion of support to nationalist populists in one shape or another. To a degree, Erdogan holds the key to Europe's status quo: halting refugees crossing into Europe from Turkey (albeit as the result of a 6 billion euro deal with the EU) and cooperation around counter-terrorism stemming ISIS' insidious incursion into Europe to show the strength of his hand. Yet in his handling of this recent diplomatic spat, Erdogan appears to show a brittle side to his personality. His actions reinforce European concerns that he is becoming increasingly autocratic.",

        "Text": "\"It's a big, fat, beautiful negotiation,\" Trump declared during the first meeting of his Cabinet at the White House. \"Hopefully we'll come up with something that's going to be really terrific.\" Earlier in the day, Trump appeared to lower expectations for an immediate drop in health insurance costs after a replacement bill is passed. He told a White House gathering of Americans who say they've been negatively affected by the Affordable Care Act that it could take several years before a drop in prices. \"More competition and less regulation will finally bring down the cost of care, and I think it will bring it down significantly. Unfortunately, it takes a while to get there because you have to let that marketplace kick in,\" Trump said. \"It's going to take a little while to get there,\" Trump added. \"But once it does it's going to be a thing of beauty. I wish it didn't take a year or two years. But that's what's going to happen.\" The President's remarks came as Republicans awaited a closely watched score from the Congressional Budget Office on their health care replacement plan, which was unveiled and debated last week. Democrats argue the measure, called the American Health Care Act, will force millions of Americans off their insurance plans while increasing costs. The CBO score is expected as early as Monday. Trump, in his meeting, expressed frustration that Obamacare seems to be rising in popularity among Americans. Indeed, polls show that more Americans favor the current health law, which was passed in 2010. Republicans brace for CBO report He placed blame for the rise on the media, which he claimed were focusing on Obamacare's success stories without highlighting those Americans who have seen their premiums spike or their preferred insurance canceled. \"The press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden.

He argued that Americans' views of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, were also improving now the Democratic leader has left office. \"When he left, people like him. When he was here, people didn't like him so much. That's the way life goes. It's human nature,\" Trump said.",

        "Text": "At least 652 children died in the last 12 months, a 20% increase on 2015, the organization said in a damning new report published Monday. Nearly half of those children were killed in or near school. The report includes only verified figures, meaning the death toll could be much higher, the report said. \"I wanted to become a doctor but perhaps I won't become anything because our school was attacked,\" 6-year-old Ahmad is quoted as saying. \"We used to play a lot in the schoolyard but now I'm afraid of coming here.\" At least 850 children were recruited to fight in the conflict in 2016 -- more than double the number the year before, the report said. Increasingly, children were being used to fight on the frontlines and in combat roles, \"including in extreme cases as executioners, suicide bombers or prison guards.\" \"Each and every child is scarred for life with horrific consequences on their health, well-being and future,\" Geert Cappelaere, the UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa speaking from Homs, Syria, said in a statement. 'Toxic stress' Nearly six million children now depend on humanitarian assistance, says UNICEF, 12 times the number in 2012. Additionally, UNICEF says it can't even access some of the harder to reach parts of the country, where it estimates 280,000 children are living under siege \"completely cut off from humanitarian aid\" and \"dying in silence often from diseases that can otherwise be easily prevented.\" Last week, British charity Save the Children published a report which stressed that Syria's children were suffering from \"toxic stress\" brought on by the sheer brutality of the ongoing civil war. At least three million Syrians under the age of six \"know nothing but war,\" said Save the Children, adding that prolonged exposure could lead to a number of problems, including self-harm and suicide attempts. In the report, one father named Firas recounted how his 3-year-old, Saeed, had been affected. \"My son wakes up afraid in the middle of the night,\" he said. \"A child was slaughtered in front of him, so he started to dream that someone is coming to slaughter him. When a child witnesses a beheading, how could he not get afraid?\" Since the war began in 2011, an estimated 400,000 Syrians have been killed in what the United Nations is calling the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II.",

        "Text": "The addition of the Izumo helicopter carrier, which specializes primarily in anti-submarine missions, marks a rare show of naval force from Japan amid growing tensions across Asia and highlights the Trump administration's intention to maintain a cooperative military presence in the region. The Malabar military exercises have taken place on a rotational basis in the West Pacific and Indian oceans since Japan became a regular participant in 2007. To get to the Indian Ocean, the shortest route will take the Izumo through the contested South China Sea. China has already made its dissatisfaction with the exercises clear. In December, a Global Times editorial said the exercises would \"jeopardize the peace and stability in the (region).\" The 2017 exercises comes at a time of high tension in the Asia region. North Korean missiles that fell in waters off Japan last week brought new fears in Tokyo about what Kim Jong Un's regime has planned. North Korea said the tests were carried out by the military unit tasked with taking on US military bases in Japan. Japan and China have locked horns over the Senkaku Islands, the Tokyo-administered chain claimed by Beijing, which refers to them as the Diaoyu Islands. Then there is the dispute in the South China Sea, particularly Beijing's continued building of man-made islands that has ratcheted up tensions with US allies in the region. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have also been critical of China's actions in the South China Sea. \"Building islands and then putting military assets on those islands is akin to Russia's taking of Crimea. It's taking of territory that others lay claim to,\" Tillerson said in his confirmation hearing. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands (is) also not going to be allowed.\" Secretary Tillerson will visit Asia this week, with stops planned in South Korea, China and Japan. Next month, Trump plans to host Chinese President Xi Jinping for a summit at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, a senior administration official told CNN Monday. The US also announced Monday that it will permanently station attack drones in South Korea, a move that comes just days after South Korea received the first parts of the controversial US-made THAAD missile defense system. \"The US wants to, and I think it needs to, be seen as responsive to developments in the region,\" said Yvonne Chiu, a professor at Hong Kong University. Reuters first reported the Izumo's addition to the large-scale exercises. Japan's pacifist constitution limits its offensive firepower, but the 816-foot Izumo is one of Japan's few tools that allow it to project military power beyond the defense of its own territories. The addition of the Izumo to the already large-scale exercises underscores that Japan's anti-submarine warfare capabilities are key to attempting to deter Chinese expansion in the region, some analysts said. \"Subsurface detection and reaction is a Japanese strength in both technological and operational terms, and a Chinese weakness, even if (China) quantitatively has a larger subsurface fleet,\" said Corey Wallace, a security analyst at Freie University in Berlin. Japan has excellent submarine hunting vessels, helicopter carriers and sub-hunting aircraft and a surprisingly long history of using them, Wallace said, even helping the US keep the Soviet Pacific subsurface fleet \"bottled up\" in the North Pacific during the Cold War. Despite plans for the Izumo to train with US ships as part of Malabar, the US Navy declined to comment on whether the Japanese vessel would be deployed to the contentious South China Sea. \"The US Navy does not comment on Japanese Navy movements,\" a Navy official said. The Japanese government did not respond to a request for comment. Japan does not have any claim over the disputed waters, but China's growing military presence has fueled concerns in Tokyo and prompted a pledge to increase patrol and training activities in the area. The South China Sea dispute will likely be discussed during Tillerson's trip to Asia this week and when Xi visits Trump in Florida.",

        "Text": "The announcement came a week after North Korea shot off four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, and while the US and South Korea are conducting their annual joint military exercises. \"The stationing of this company, which will be assigned to the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, directly supports the US Army's strategic plan to add one Gray Eagle company to each division in the Army,\" USFK said in a news release. \"The UAS adds significant intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability to US Forces Korea and our ROK (Republic of Korea) partners.\" The Gray Eagle Unmanned Aerial System is capable of staying in the air for 24 hours and is equipped with Hellfire missiles, according to a profile on the US Army website. The system has upgraded reconnaissance and surveillance technology over that of the Predator drones, which the US military has used widely in operations around the globe, said Corey Wallace of the Graduate School of East Asian Studies at Freie Universit?t Berlin. It can also integrate with Apache helicopters, which could help when it comes to avoiding bad weather on the Korean Peninsula. The US military began rotating 24 AH-64D Apaches into South Korea earlier this year. \"The US and its regional partners see the importance of demonstrating that they also have the upper hand in conventional deterrence and readiness, and not just as a reaction to a full DPRK (Democratic Republic of Korea) attack,\" Wallace told CNN in an email. Trouble on the Peninsula The move is likely a show of force in reaction to increased provocations from North Korea, said Daniel Pinkston, a professor at Troy University in Seoul. Pyongyang has conducted a series of test missile launches in recent months, a worrying development for the US and its allies in the region because it means that North Korea is likely refining its missile technology. \"If North Korea thought they could continue their accelerated pace of weapons testing and deployment without a response, they certainly were wrong,\" Pinkston told CNN. \"(With) the recent North Korean behavior, and with the Foal Eagle exercise going on, I think it's a good time (to deploy).\" This is the first time US forces have made the news of the drone movement public, according to USFK spokesman Christopher Bush. And that's no accident, said Yvonne Chiu, a professor at Hong Kong University. The US wants to make sure that Pyongyang -- and to a lesser extent Beijing -- has no doubts that Washington is a major player in Asia. \"The US wants to, and I think it needs to, be seen as responsive to developments in the region,\" Chiu told CNN. \"And you want North Korea to know that.\" Park out Though the timing is likely a reaction to North Korea's missile launches and threatening posture, it also came amid political upheaval in South Korea. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of now former President Park Geun-hye Friday, who was ousted in the aftermath of a corruption scandal. Park took a hard line when it came to dealing with Pyongyang, but the man currently leading in opinion polls for the race to succeed her -- Liberal candidate Moon Jae-in -- has historically favored improving relations between the two. \"It could be that the announcement is made to ensure a future government doesn't walk it back -- like with the THAAD acceleration, there may be some concerns that a future left-leaning government might be less willing to face the DPRK directly,\" said Wallace. THAAD is an acronym for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, a US-built defensive missile system that Park's government agreed to deploy in South Korea. At a rally celebrating the impeachment ruling Saturday, balloons could be seen reading \"No THAAD! Yes peace!\" The THAAD element THAAD is designed to take down incoming missiles from North Korea, and the first pieces of it arrived in South Korea last week. But its deployment is highly controversial despite its defensive nature. RELATED: How would missile defense systems work against North Korea? South Koreans are split in their support for THAAD. Some see it as way to protect themselves from provocations by North Korea, though it's not a foolproof system. Others are angry that THAAD's deployment has damaged diplomatic relations between Seoul and Beijing. China opposes THAAD because it sees it as a threat to its own security interests. Among other things, Beijing worries that THAAD's advanced radar system could be used for surveillance purposes. Many in the Chinese foreign policy establishment see THAAD as just as big a threat to China as Pyongyang's nuclear program, according to professor John Delury of Yonsei University. Though THAAD is just a defensive system, the radar and surveillance capabilities worry the Chinese. Now they'll have to worry about attack drones parked in their backyard, too. \"The US has a reputation -- at least in China -- for not being particularly strong or interested or really wanting to or have the ability to defend its interests,\" says Chiu. \"So Beijing is going to react badly to this.\"",

        "Text": "The bill also imposes a 24-hour waiting period if a guy wants a colonoscopy or a vasectomy, or if he's in the market for some Viagra. Rep. Jessica Farrar, a Democrat, knows her bill isn't going to get very far. But she proposed it last week to make a point and give male lawmakers a taste of their own medicine. Farrar has long been an advocate of women's health in a state that has made it extremely difficult for women to get abortions. And the bill, by pointing out a sexist double standard, is meant to shine a light on the obstacles women deal with when it comes to their health care. \"Let's look at what Texas has done to women,\" Farrar told CNN. \"What if men had to undergo the same intrusive procedures?\" Even the name is a jab Farrar's bill would penalize men for masturbation because such behavior is a failure to preserve the sanctity of life and \"an act against an unborn child.\" Even the bill's name -- \"A Man's Right to Know Act\" -- is a jab at a pamphlet Texas doctors are required to give women seeking abortions. That pamphlet, \"A Woman's Right to Know,\" has long been criticized for being inaccurate, ideologically influenced by religion and designed to discourage women from getting abortions. One section of the pamphlet says breast cancer and abortions are linked. Scientific studies have found no cause-and-effect relationship between the two. \"We have real lives to deal with,\" said Farrar, who pointed out that Texas has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world. And she's right \"?the rate of women who died from pregnancy-related complications doubled from 2010 to 2014, according to a recent study. Backlash from political opponents Republicans have lashed out at Farrar's bill. \"I'm embarrassed for Representative Farrar. Her attempt to compare to the abortion issue shows a lack of a basic understanding of human biology,\" said Rep. Tony Tinderholt in a statement. \"I would recommend that she consider taking a high school biology class from a local public or charter school before filing another bill on the matter.\" Tinderholt recently proposed a bill that would charge abortion providers and women receiving abortions with murder. Access to abortions in Texas Texas has quite a one-two punch to keep women from getting abortions. One: strict laws. Two: Lack of clinics. Texas doesn't allow abortions for women past the 20-week mark unless their life is endangered. Under this law, women who are pregnant with an unviable fetus are forced to carry to term. Additionally, women must receive state-directed counseling, must have an ultrasound and a provider must describe the image of the unborn child to the woman. As of 2014, some 96% of Texas counties had no clinics that provided abortions, and roughly 43% of women lived in those counties, according to the Guttmacher Institute. And since 2014 the number of facilities providing abortions in Texas has plummeted from 44 to18 after the state passed restrictions on abortion doctors and clinics. The restrictions were eventually struck down by the Supreme Court, but the damage was done. Today, Texas women can only get abortions in seven cities and an entire swath of the state -- the panhandle and much of west Texas -- is an abortion clinic desert.",

        "Text": "The $38 million was in addition to \"paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes,\" a White House official said. Journalist David Cay Johnston published the return information ahead of an appearance on MSNBC. \"You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,\" the official said Tuesday. Trump had promised during the presidential campaign to release his returns -- which every presidential nominee in modern times has made into a precedent -- after the conclusion of a routine audit, but the White House has not spelled out when exactly that would be. More recently, aides have suggested that since he won the election, he would not release his returns. Hillary Clinton and Trump's Republican rivals during the presidential election sought to turn the returns into a campaign issue, but failed to create enough pressure to force their release. In October, The New York Times obtained a single year's return anonymously that showed that Trump declared a $916 million loss and lists tax benefits he used after a turbulent financial period for him in the early 1990s. The paper, citing tax experts, said Trump could have used his loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income for nearly two decades.",

        "Text": "With the first round of the French presidential election just over a month away and Germany headed to the ballot box later this year, the Dutch battle is being closely watched for clues to wider political trends. Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte is facing a tight battle with far-right rival Geert Wilders, whose anti-immigrant, anti-Islam tirades have landed him in court -- but also won him widespread support in a country that is increasingly polarized by austerity and immigration issues. Rutte's Party for Freedom and Democracy, the VVD, leads the latest Peilingwijzer poll of polls by Leiden University, but Wilders' Freedom Party, the PVV, is hot on its heels. The Dutch political landscape is splintered, with 28 parties on the ballot, and the country's system of proportional representation means some form of coalition government is almost guaranteed. What you need to know about the Dutch election Poll position but no gold Rutte will be looking to secure a third term in office; should his lawmakers form the largest group in the 150-seat House of Representatives, he is expected to form a new coalition government with at least three other parties. But maintaining the status quo is exactly what many Dutch voters have tired of, and Wilders has rated strongly in pre-election polls thanks to his no-nonsense rhetoric and often controversial views. Other parties -- including Rutte's VVD -- have lurched to the right in response. Musician and actor Ron Mesland, from Amsterdam, said he was concerned about the wider impact of Wilders' popularity: \"I'm worried about Geert Wilders, but mostly about the effect he has on the other parties,\" he said. \"Most other parties seem to adopt his speech and his ideas, and that really worries me.\" Ruud Koole, politics professor at the University of Leiden, said that in the event Wilders secures the most seats in the House of Representatives, the country's political system would likely make it extremely difficult for him to govern. \"We always have coalition governments,\" he said. \"If Wilders' party were to become the biggest ... he'll have to make a coalition with other parties. The problem for Wilders is that other parties do not want to enter a coalition with the PVV.\" Lawyer to high school dropout: Meet the would-be MPs Losing steam on final lap? Koole said Wilders is popular because he speaks to the specific concerns of part of the electorate, \"concerns about unemployment, about health care, but especially about the Dutch national identity, which lead to foreigners, immigrants, asylum seekers, also refugees. \"Voters for Wilders don't really believe that he has the solutions to solve these problems, but at least he expresses their concerns and that is why he polls rather high in this campaign.\" But Wilders' popularity has waned in recent weeks and one expert suggested his decline could be down to US President Donald Trump. \"[Wilders is] well under 20% and his support has been slipping in the recent weeks,\" said Quentin Peel, associate fellow at Chatham House. \"I think one of the reasons it's been slipping, funnily enough, is the election or arrival in power of Donald Trump.\" He continued: \"I think that very well-grounded middle-of-the-road solid Dutch citizens have been a bit concerned about what has been happening in Washington. \"The trouble is [the results] are very difficult to predict. You've got no less than 28 parties running in this campaign, and you're probably going to ... end up with a very complicated coalition and Mr. Wilders is not going to be part of it.\" Geert Wilders: Why voters are flocking to Dutch Trump Key issues for voters Given the bellwether nature of Europe's first election this year, the Netherlands has been thrust into the global spotlight. According to preliminary Eurostat data, the country's economy grew by 2.1% last year, and investors have remained reasonably calm throughout the campaign. But Rutte's tough austerity measures aimed at combating the 2011-2012 recession have hit the country's poorest the hardest and that has weighed on their minds as they prepare to visit the ballot box. \"My biggest concern is that the working class is being put down,\" said delivery driver Tony Regnerus. \"The immigrants are all coming in, and they get a better life than the working man. They're not pushed to do anything with their life, they're not pushed to get a job. \"Every day, I go to big cities like Rotterdam and Gouda and Delft, they're all wearing Canada Goose jackets -- 100, and I can't pay it -- [but] I'm a working man. It's gotta be the other way around.\" The Netherlands' relationship with the European Union has been another hot topic on the campaign trail. The Dutch were founding members of the union, but attitudes have cooled in recent years, and Wilders has pledged a Brexit-style referendum on whether to leave the EU. Worse than Wilders? Why refugees fear status quo Fisherman Jan de Boer said he is concerned about the future of his industry -- which he says is threatened by EU regulations -- and this will be at the forefront of his mind when he comes to fill out his ballot on election day. \"The rules are very bad for the fishermen of the Netherlands,\" he said. \"We want fishing and our children want fishing.\" Until now, de Boer has always voted for the Christian Party -- but this time around, he said, that will change. \"Geert Wilders' ... is the only party that fights European rules, and for me that's important.\" But bus company worker Leonard Schaab said he didn't believe Wilders will do as well as expected: \"The polls are always a little bit off, and when the real elections [take place] most of the time people will vote for other parties.\" \"The man doesn't have the skills to do it,\" he added. \"The only thing Geert Wilders does is shout about all kinds of problems ... he creates problems, but he never has solutions.\"",

        "Text": "With high-level diplomatic relations between Turkey and the Netherlands already frozen, Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the Dutch for failing to prevent the killing of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims when Bosnian Serb forces overran the town in 1995. In a reference to Dutch United Nations peacekeepers who were on the ground and failed to prevent the mass killing, Erdogan said Tuesday: \"We know the Dutch and the people in Holland from the massacre of Srebrenica. We know them, how they massacred people in Srebrenica full well. We don't need anyone to give us a lesson on civilization.\" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte responded to the remarks, accusing Erdogan of \"a disgusting falsification of history.\" In an interview with Dutch broadcaster RTL, Rutte said: \"[Erdogan] continues to push the limits. This is of unbelievably low quality and style. We are not going to reduce ourselves to this level. This is very unacceptable and extremely irritating.\" Adding fuel to the fire The Turkish president's incendiary comments -- made during a speech in Ankara -- came amid an escalating row sparked by Turkish officials being blocked from addressing political rallies in the Netherlands. Over the weekend, the Netherlands refused to allow Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to visit Rotterdam for a political rally. Shortly after Cavusoglu was refused entry, the Dutch stopped Turkey's Family Affairs Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya from entering the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam. She was later escorted out of the country. Violent clashes erupted after the action against the two ministers who had hoped to drum up support for an April 16 referendum to give greater powers to Erdogan. Erdogan has already made angry remarks against the Dutch since the incidents in Rotterdam -- comparing the current government to Nazis. The Netherlands lost more than 200,000 of its citizens when it was occupied by Nazi Germany in World War II and Rutte has demanded an apology. On Monday, Turkey announced that it would not allow the Dutch ambassador to Ankara to return to Turkey and suspended high-level diplomatic relations between the two countries. The deepening diplomatic row has also prompted threats from Turkey to pull out of the EU-Migrant deal, designed to stem the flow of migrants to Europe. Tension ahead of votes The growing tensions come ahead of the Dutch general election on Wednesday; far-right candidate Geert Wilders' anti-Islam, anti-EU Party for Freedom (PVV) is expected to make a strong showing. Wilders has sought to gain political advantage from the discord between the Netherlands and Turkey. Meanwhile, it has also been suggested that Erdogan is seeking to show his strength as a leader on the world stage. His Srebrenica comments -- given during speech on healthcare -- drew loud applause from the audience. Erdogan also implored Dutch voters of immigrant backgrounds not to cast their ballots for Wilders, who he described as an \"extreme racist\" or Prime Minister Rutte in Wednesday's election.",

        "Text": "He'll need it on his first trip to Asia, which begins Wednesday, as tensions flare in the volatile region. North Korea's missile program is getting quicker and smarter, threatening the United States and its two key East Asian allies -- Japan and South Korea. The latter is reeling after the ouster of its president. Tillerson will need to convince both that it's in their best interests to remain committed to the United States, and its controversial missile defense system. However, his diplomatic skills will get their biggest test on the last leg of his trip when he becomes the first Trump Cabinet member to visit China and seeks to tap the country's perceived leverage over the North Korean regime. Here, CNN's Asia correspondents detail the challenges Tillerson faces on each stop: South Korea | China | Japan Tokyo (CNN) -- Tillerson's most pressing issue in Japan -- like the region as a whole -- is the growing nuclear threat from North Korea. The country's provocative leader Kim Jong Un test-fired a ballistic missile during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit with US President Donald Trump in Florida, the timing of which led some analysts to believe it was a message for Tokyo. And last week, when Kim launched four ballistic missiles simultaneously, North Korean state media implied the launch was practice for striking US military bases in Japan, where around 52,000 US service members are based. Tillerson will meet with Abe and his counterpart Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, with Japan seeking reassurance from the United States that it remains Washington's closest and most trusted ally in the Asia-Pacific. Though Trump frayed nerves on the campaign trail by calling into question US alliances in the region, the new administration has mostly dialed back that rhetoric. Tensions between Japan and the US' other big ally in the region, South Korea, could provide a challenge for Tillerson as he seeks to rein in North Korea. The Japanese ambassador was recalled from Seoul in January over a controversial statue depicting the \"comfort women\" who were forced into sexual servitude by Japanese forces before and during World War II. With deft, old-fashioned diplomacy, Tillerson has to find a way to encourage Japan and South Korea to resolve their issues so all three countries can focus on the growing threat Pyongyang poses to regional and global security. From CNN's Will Ripley Seoul (CNN) -- The main challenge for South Korean officials when Tillerson arrives is to convince him it's business as usual, when it's anything but. Park Geun-hye has just been ousted from office, the country is bitterly divided and the government has been effectively paralyzed since the corruption scandal broke months ago. But those holding the fort will work hard to get the assurances they want from the top US diplomat. Tillerson will meet acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn for the first time and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, whom he met in February at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Bonn, Germany. When US Defense Secretary James Mattis visited last month, he said what South Koreans wanted to hear -- that Washington promised an \"overwhelming\" response to any attack mounted by North Korea. Officials will be looking for statements along the same lines from Tillerson. Tillerson also arrives at a time when Seoul claims Beijing is punishing it economically for agreeing to install THAAD, the US missile defense system that Washington says is needed to counter the North Korean missile threat. With Park now out of the picture, he'll also be seeking assurances that South Korea's new leader honors the agreement. Snap elections will be held by the end of May. The first elements of THAAD arrived in South Korea last week, the official line is it could be fully operational by July at the earliest. From CNN's Paula Hancocks Beijing (CNN) --Tillerson's first priority during scheduled meetings in Beijing Saturday will be to iron out the details of a tentative Florida summit scheduled in April between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. It would be the first meeting between the two men, in what many argue is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. There is no shortage of items that should be discussed. High on the list will be the ongoing crisis in North Korea. Since the beginning of 2016, two nuclear tests and dozens of ballistic missile tests have ratcheted up tensions on the peninsula. The Trump administration wants China to do more to curb the threat. China will likely want to talk about the THAAD anti-missile defense system and Gray Eagle attack drones in South Korea. Beijing has expressed its strong disapproval of both, and Tillerson will likely leave China with that fact fully communicated. Tillerson will also likely raise Beijing's build-up in the South China Sea. At his confirmation hearing, Tillerson suggested that Beijing should be denied access to the artificial islands it's built in the disputed waters. Despite fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail, President Trump and his administration have taken a relatively hands off approach to China so far. Trump has not followed through on campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator or impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. He also endorsed the \"One China\" policy, which has governed relations between the US, China and Taiwan for decades, after questioning its legitimacy shortly after his election. The Secretary of State's visit to China has the potential to set the tone for the upcoming Xi-Trump meeting. It could be the opening salvo in the Trump's administration's previous promises to \"get tough\" on China, or it could be a continuation of the relatively calm period we've seen since inauguration day.

        "Text": "The Rhode Island Democrat said that Comey made the promise in a March 2 meeting with him and Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina. According to Whitehouse, Comey assured them he would confirm if an investigation exists \"and the scope of their Russia/Trump investigation because he had not been able to at that point say that there was one.\" Whitehouse and Graham both asked the Justice Department last week to provide any evidence that would support Trump's claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. The two are leading one of three Congressional investigations into Russia's interference in the US elections. The FBI has not responded to a CNN request for comment on whether Comey will respond by Wednesday. Graham expressed frustration Tuesday that the Trump administration has not yet provided any evidence of wiretapping and said he plans go \"tough\" on the administration during Wednesday's hearing. The White House has vacillated on Trump's claims in the last two days. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Monday that Trump did not mean literally that Obama had him wiretapped. But on Tuesday, Spicer said Trump was \"extremely confident\" he would be vindicated by the evidence. \"I think there's significant reporting about surveillance techniques that existed throughout the 2016 election,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, without providing any examples. \"He feels very confident that what will ultimately come of this will vindicate him,\" Spicer said. Democrats from the Senate Intelligence Committee -- whose investigation is separate from the one Graham and Whitehouse are a part of with the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- said Tuesday they doubt Trump has evidence he was wiretapped, but the issue could easily be settled. \"It can all be put to bed with one phone call,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, before heading into a hearing of the group Tuesday afternoon. \"I have seen absolutely no evidence of President Trump's claim about President Obama.\" Warner said he expects the first public hearing from the Senate Intelligence Committee on Russia later this month. The Virginia Democrat said he wanted to hear from Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser whose contact with \"Guccifer 2.0\"-- the online persona who claims responsibility for hacking the Democratic National Committee -- also had Sen. John McCain wanting to question him. \"If we are investigating Russian interference, here is someone who has acknowledged that he has been in contact with the Russians,\" Warner said of Stone. Stone has described his contact with Guccifer as limited to a \"brief exchange with him on Twitter\" and any suggestion otherwise, he told CNN, is \"a fabrication.\" The House Intelligence Committee scheduled its first hearing for Monday, and has invited a slate of current and former intelligence chiefs to testify. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said Monday that he has asked the \"appropriate people\" for information about Trump's wiretap claims and said their answers have been \"sufficient.\" But Senate Democrats on the Intelligence Committee said they have not seen any evidence yet. \"I've heard nothing. But I'm strongly of the opinion there was no wiretapping,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a veteran member of the panel. Warner also said he was not satisfied with the response to requests for information from the administration, saying, \"I'm not sure why this is taking any time.\"",

        "Text": "The woman told the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), that she was sleeping and listening to music about two hours into the flight when she heard an explosion. \"As I went to turn around I felt burning on my face,\" she told the ATSB, which issued a statement Wednesday as a warning to other passengers. READ: Lithium-ion batteries banned on passenger planes \"I just grabbed my face which caused the headphones to go around my neck,\" she said. The woman, who was not identified, said she tore off the headphones and threw them to the floor, where she saw they were shooting off sparks and small flames. \"As I went to stamp my foot on them the flight attendants were already there with a bucket of water to pour on them. They put them into the bucket at the rear of the plane,\" she said. They couldn't remove all of the headphones however -- both the battery and cover had melted into the aircraft floor. \"People were coughing and choking the entire way home,\" the passenger told the ATSB, adding the cabin reeked of melted plastic and burnt hair. In a statement, the ATSB said it was likely the batteries inside the headphones had caught fire, rather than the headphones themselves. However, a spokesman wouldn't reveal what type of batteries or headphones were involved. He said the incident had occurred on February 19. Only a day before the incident, an Airbus A320 that took off from China reportedly had to make an emergency landing in Nagoya, Japan, after a portable power pack started a fire inside an overhead locker. Lithium batteries have been known to cause fires on board planes. Last year, US authorities banned Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from all US flights after its lithium battery was found to spontaneously ignite. The ban extended to shipping the phones as air cargo. Samsung blamed faulty lithium-ion batteries, which it was said were overheating and causing the device to catch fire. Attempts to fix the problem failed and it later permanently halted production. Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority has seen a sharp rise in incidents around electronic devices in recent years, from only three in 2011 to 106 in 2015, according to Flight Safety Australia. He declined to say what brand of headphones or batteries were involved.",

        "Text": "Estimates project the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is followed by a three-way tie for second: Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV), Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and and D66 (Democrats). Wilders, a far-right firebrand, tweeted: \"PVV voters thanks. We won seats, first victory is in. Rutte hasn't got rid of me yet.\" Other parties expected to win seats are: GroenLinks (Green left), the Socialist Party and the Labour (PVDA), led by Deputy Prime Minister Lodewijk Asscher. The vote was widely seen as a test of just how far populist sentiment has spread across Europe, in the wake of US President Donald Trump's victory and the Brexit referendum vote in the UK. Controversial anti-immigrant, anti-European Union figure Wilders had run on a \"de-Islamification\" platform, calling for Islamic schools to be closed and the Quran and burqa to be banned. That message struck a chord with many ordinary Dutch voters who have been hard hit by the government's austerity measures, and who feel the country has taken in too many refugees and migrants. \"The Netherlands is full,\" Wilders supporter Jack told CNN outside a polling station in Volendam on Wednesday. \"If it were up to me I would have stopped all [Turkish people] at the border.\" Others were disturbed by the tone of the campaign, and said they had voted tactically, to keep the far right out of power, or for parties they trusted to fight for causes they cared about, irrespective of the current political climate. \"I thought it was important and so I voted strategically,\" said Amsterdam resident Kathie Somwerwil. \"I usually vote a little more left of center but at least now with this Wilders, I think this is not the Dutch way ... so I voted VVD for Mr. Rutte.\" Author Bert Nap said he had voted for the progressive PvdA party because it had had the guts to go into government with Rutte's party, despite that making it \"very unpopular\" with many supporters. \"I want to sustain a party in our political system that has acted very strongly ... They will be decimated in this election but they have to be able to come upright for the next election and so you have to sustain it,\" he said. Coalitions take a while to form The splintered political landscape in the Netherlands -- there were 28 parties on the ballot -- and the country's system of proportional representation mean coalition government is the norm. But it can also lead to lengthy periods of political instability and uncertainty. The average time taken to form a coalition cabinet in the post-war era has been 89.5 days, according to the House of Representatives website. In 1977, it took 208 days for Dries Van Agt's Christian Democrats to reach a power-sharing deal. Voters say they are expecting a protracted period of talks before the make-up of the next government becomes clear. \"I think there will be a lot of negotiations,\" said research analyst Robin Vanstraalen. \"Given the whole fragmentation and the polls showing it will be a long process. And eventually it will end up in the middle -- which is where we have been for the last few years already.\" Factors that boosted support for leader At one stage, Wilders and Rutte were neck-and-neck in the Peilingwijzer poll of polls by Leiden University, but in recent days Rutte had taken the lead. He had moved to the right in response to Wilders' popularity. Andre Krouwel, political scientist at the Free University Amsterdam, and owner of election website Kieskompas, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ongoing war of words with the Dutch government appeared to have boosted support for Rutte. Tensions between the Netherlands and Turkey have been high since the Dutch government refused to allow Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to visit Rotterdam for a political rally last weekend; Erdogan retaliated by blaming the Netherlands for the Srebrenica massacre in 995. Voter turnout in the Netherlands is traditionally high -- almost 75% at the last election in 2012 -- and there are indications that Wednesday's polls are no exception. A CNN reporter in The Hague State saw long queues forming at polling booths in the city's central station as commuters returned home from work. And NOS reported that by 5:45 p.m. local time, 55% of the electorate had voted -- up from 48% at the same time in 2012. Amsterdam polling station volunteer Hanneke Spijker told CNN large numbers of people had been coming out to vote since early Wednesday morning. \"It's incredible,\" she said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it will be a record turnout ... there were lines, and we never have lines.\"",

        "Text": "Tillerson will deliver this message on his first official trip to Asia, a three-country tour that promises to be a tightrope walk of diplomatic tensions -- and nowhere more so than in Beijing, North Korea's closest ally and protector. While Tillerson will tell Beijing that the US is tired of Chinese companies helping facilitate Pyongyang's weapons program, he'll also seek to engage Chinese support for a broader attempt to rein in North Korea -- resembling the international coalition that created the Iran nuclear deal. He'll do this as he lays the groundwork for Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the US in April. Tillerson will also engage on the usual areas of US-Chinese tension, including the country's claims to contested waters in the South China Sea; trade; the status of Taiwan; and the recent US deployment of a defensive missile system and drones to South Korea. RELATED: Tillerson looks to global effort on Iran as model for North Korea But none of these issues are as fraught or potentially dangerous as the situation with Pyongyang, which seems to have accelerated its nuclear program in the last few months with the aim of perfecting a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver it as far as the US. \"China has been part of the problem rather than part of the solution,\" said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who describes North Korea as a global military threat. China has \"acted like North Korea's lawyer at the UN Security Council. They deny evidence of North Korea wrongdoing, they insist on loopholes, they insist on watering down what would otherwise be more effective resolutions\" at the United Nations, Klingner said. \"And whenever North Korea does some kind of a provocation or violation,\" he continued, \"they have this value-neutral response of calling on both Koreas not to raise tensions, when it is only their Korea which is doing so.\" Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner said discussions between Tillerson and his Chinese counterpart about dealing with North Korea have already been taking place. They are looking at \"what are next steps we can take to really put pressure on the regime to make them feel and pay a price for their behavior,\" he said. He acknowledged that the US wants to see China do more. \"We're always cognizant of China's influence over North Korea, and we're always encouraging it to play a more forceful role in that regard, whether it's through a more thorough implementation of the sanctions regime that exists, or through other ways,\" Toner said Monday. \"So that's a leverage that China brings to the table, and that's certainly something we want to see them take more advantage of.\" The Chinese Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. RELATED: Chinese firm fined $1.2 billion for violating US sanctions on Iran- Given that China represents 90% of North Korea's economic activity, Beijing has leverage, Klingner said. Chinese firms that do business with the isolated country can operate as front companies that allow it to sell weaponry and other items overseas, and import goods. US officials said that the administration is considering targeting Chinese firms with sanctions for economic engagement with North Korea, given evidence that some of them are helping the country import and export weapons. \"We can influence the Chinese banks and businesses that are dealing with North Korea.-It has worked in the past,\" he said. He noted that in the mid-2000s, the Bank of China defied the Chinese government and cut off its interaction with North Korea to avoid the risk of US sanctions. \"So regardless of what Beijing wants,\" Klingner said, \"we can influence the behavior of those Chinese entities that are engaging in economic activity with North Korea.\" The Trump administration has already dipped a toe into sanctioning Chinese companies and by doing so is looking to expand a policy that the Obama administration began last year. The Commerce Department last week announced that a Chinese tech firm, ZTE, would pay a $1.2 billion fine for violating sanctions by selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. In September, the Obama administration targeted a Chinese company called the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd for ties to North Korea -- the first time the Obama administration hit a Chinese firm with sanctions for dealing with North Korea and supporting its nuclear program.-On the same day, the Justice Department unsealed four indictments for money laundering by te same firm and four individuals on behalf of Pyongyang.",

        "Text": "The hack, which the DOJ said was initiated in January 2014, affected at least 500 million Yahoo accounts. Some of the stolen information was used to \"obtain unauthorized access to the contents of accounts at Yahoo, Google and other webmail providers, including accounts of Russian journalists, US and Russian government officials and private-sector employees of financial, transportation and other companies,\" the DOJ said in a statement. Hackers stole data that included names, email addresses and passwords -- but not financial information, according to Yahoo's announcement regarding the breaches. The officers of the FSB -- Russia's successor to the Soviet Union's KGB -- were identified as Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin, 43, and Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, 33. The two allegedly conspired with Russian national Alexsey Alexseyevich Belan, aka \"Magg,\" 29, and Karim Baratov, aka \"Kay,\" \"Karim Taloverov\" and \"Karim Akehmet Tokbergenov,\" 22, who is a resident of Canada. Dokuchaev was arrested in a Russian sweep in December and accused of spying for the US, a lawyer for one of the men charged with Dokuchaev said. A Justice Department official said the agency has not confirmed it is the same person and declined further comment to CNN. Baratov was arrested Tuesday morning \"without incident\" in Ancaster, Ontario, Toronto police spokesman Mark Pugash told CNN. \"The criminal conduct at issue -- carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBI's point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime matters -- is beyond the pale,\" acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord said at a news conference in Washington. Hackers are selling Yahoo data on the dark web Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer publicly thanked US authorities Wednesday, saying she was \"very grateful\" to the FBI and DOJ. The San Francisco FBI office has scheduled a news conference for later Wednesday afternoon on undisclosed topics. Yahoo has been breached at least twice, and the company previously said a September 2014 breach was state-sponsored but declined to identify who it believed was responsible. Strained US-Russia relations The announcement of another cyberintrusion by Russian hackers comes at a time of delicate relations between the US and Russia. The Yahoo hack is the latest cyberattack that US authorities have blamed on Russia, a nation with which President Donald Trump's new administration has sought to foster warmer relations. Previous attacks US authorities have said Russian hackers perpetrated exposed the emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, and the internal workings of the Democratic National Committee. Russia's cybercrime underground has long been seen as more focused on financial crime than economic espionage, and Wednesday's indictment followed a series of indictments of Russian cybercriminals as the US has sought to diminish the thriving cybercrime organization in Russia. But the indictment is the first to link that cybercrime operation to the government's intelligence apparatus -- a link that has long been alleged by cyberexperts but not explicitly accused by the federal government. The DOJ's national security division has long said that regular government-to-government espionage was not criminal but economic espionage crossed a line, though it maintained that governments have a right to try to block traditional spying. Wednesday's indictment seemed to go further to link government espionage with cybercrime more broadly. Russia has also declined to extradite or cooperate in the arrest of cybercriminals indicted in the US, though the DOJ has been able to apprehend many of them as they vacationed around the world. The Department of Justice has once before brought a detailed indictment against state-sponsored hackers -- against alleged Chinese military hackers in 2014. That indictment focused on economic espionage allegedly directed by China -- the theft of corporate secrets. The US has long called on China to cease its sponsoring of economic espionage against American companies. The Chinese military hackers have remained at large, and the DOJ has said it does not expect to be able to arrest those individuals unless Beijing chooses to give them up or they travel abroad. The indictments were part of a broader name-and-shame effort to signal that the US is aware of the cyber activity and willing to call it out. This story has been updated to reflect new developments.",

        "Text": "One adviser to a senator present at the meeting said the acknowledgment was simply that \"they don't have the votes to pass this in current form,\" a reference to whether the House GOP bill in its current form could survive in the Senate. The meeting included a handful of conservative senators who have expressed deep concerns with the bill. According to multiple aides, Vice President Mike Pence made a short visit to the closed-door briefing with lawmakers. Another senior Republican aide to a senator in the room said that the White House is \"definitely looking at pretty big changes to the Ryan bill.\" \"There is no possible way a bill can be drafted by an individual or a handful of people and shoved down the throats of 535 people. It doesn't work that way,\" a Republican senator told CNN, noting that changing the bill is a normal part of the process. One of the senators who attended, Ted Cruz of Texas, said talks are \"productive.\" \"The conversations continue to be productive and they're moving forward well. The conversations are ongoing with the White House, the administration and the House and the Senate,\" Cruz said Wednesday. \"The House has a current bill that personally I don't think gets the job done. I think we need more work on the House bill,\" Cruz said later at the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce legislative summit. A senior administration official said in the meeting of the claim the House bill cannot pass the Senate as currently written said, \"I think they made that claim. We didn't rebut it.\" This official confirmed that the White House has continued to advocate for changes to the bill that will help secure conservative votes in the House -- but also some tailored to moderates' concerns. \"I think we made a lot of progress in changing language that's going to be appealing,\" the official said. The official declined to elaborate on which changes have been made already, but confirmed that the White House's position privately is still to call for an earlier sunset of the Medicaid expansion. House bill in peril The House legislation has run into trouble in recent days. After the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office warned Monday that 24 million Americans could lose insurance coverage over the next decade if the House bill was passed, moderate Republicans Reps. Leonard Lance and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen have come out publicly opposed to the legislation and others have been vocal about their concerns. Moderates are only a piece of the puzzle, however. House conservatives -- especially members of the Freedom Caucus -- have been vocal in their opposition to the bill in its current form, and House Speaker Paul Ryan can only afford to lose 21 of his own members on the bill. If House leaders address conservatives' concerns by rolling back Medicaid expansion sooner than 2020, they risk losing moderates. If they try to win over moderates by making tax credits more generous for older Americans, they could lose more conservatives. Emerging as another top concern from the White House is the question of whether the House bill can even make it through the Senate under reconciliation rules or the so-called Byrd Rule. Lawmakers have long agreed that the best way to repeal and partially replace Obamacare is through the process of budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority vote in the Senate. However, budget reconciliation comes with a whole host of requirements. Members cannot just pass anything through reconciliation. According to one senior Republican aide to a senator in the room Tuesday, there is growing recognition that some aspects of the House bill may not even be fully accepted under those rules. In that case, the Senate parliamentarian could rule that pieces of the legislation aren't allowed under reconciliation. Some conservatives are arguing to the White House that the Senate should override the parliamentarian, but if they are going to take that political risk, they should do it with a bill they believe will lower premiums in upcoming years, not the Ryan bill. The Republican aide to a senator in the meeting said some senators are pushing for a more robust package that would allow states to sell insurance across state lines, make additional changes to Medicaid and help lower drug prices instead of overriding the parliamentarian to pass through the House package.",

The body was discovered in a pool of blood with severe head injuries, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Sammy Tavares. The case is being investigated as a murder, Tavares added. One person has been arrested in connection with her death and police are investigating whether she was sexually assaulted, authorities said. The suspect had marks on his face \"which could have been made by the victim while trying to fight back,\" Police Superintendent Kartik Kasyap told CNN. The results of a post-mortem have yet to be released. Police said the woman was carrying a British passport. \"We are supporting the family of a British-Irish woman following her death in Goa, India.

Police initially said the 15-year-old drowned on after taking drugs, but her mother rejected that account. She launched a campaign for a second autopsy, and investigators eventually confirmed Keeling was sexually assaulted before her death. Local media and a state minister said at the time that police covered up the killing to protect Goa's tourism industry.",

        "Text": "Prime Minister Mark Rutte took to the stage in the Hague Wednesday night to claim victory, amid wild cheering and whistling from his jubilant supporters. \"This night is a night for the Netherlands -- after Brexit, after the American elections -- where we said stop it, stop it to the wrong kind of populism,\" he said. Voter turnout was 81%, according to state broadcaster NOS, the highest in three decades. With 94% of the vote counted, Rutte's VVD party is projected to win 33 seats out of a total 150, ahead of Wilder's PVV party which won 20 seats, only one more than the mainstream Christian Democratic Appeal and D66 parties. Despite the celebrations, Rutte's party won eight fewer seats than in the 2012 vote, when it claimed 41. The election was widely seen as a test of populist right-wing sentiment in Europe, ahead of the French Presidential election in April and the German national vote in September. Wilders, who is staunchly against mass immigration and the European Union, made a defiant speech Wednesday night claiming he was \"part of the winners.\" \"Rutte uses terrifying words when he says that the elections have put a halt to the wrong type of populist ... (He) has not got rid of me yet,\" he said. Relief in Europe During his speech to supporters, Rutte said many European leaders had already called to congratulate him on his victory. French President Francois Hollande issued a statement Thursday morning, calling it a \"clear victory against extremism.\" \"The values of openness, respect for others, and a faith in Europe's future are the only true response to the nationalist impulses and isolationism that are shaking the world,\" he said. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault posted on Twitter: \"Congratulations to the Dutch for preventing the rise of the far right,\" he said. \"Willing to work towards a stronger Europe.\" Germany's foreign ministry said, \"Large majority of Dutch voters have rejected anti-European policies... That's good news. We need you for a strong Europe!\" Italy's Foreign Minister Paolo Gentilioni tweeted that the \"anti-EU right\" had lost in the Netherlands. \"All together for change and revive the (European) Union.\" There was no response Wednesday evening from Wilders' anti-EU allies across the continent, including right-wing French Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is polling strongly ahead of the first round of voting on April 23. 'European spring' will come: Wilders The result is a blow for Wilders, who had been leading polls for much of 2016. The far-right politician was considered to have ridden the same wave of anti-establishment fervor that saw UK voters opt to leave the European Union, and the election of US President Donald Trump. A controversial figure, Wilders ran on a \"de-Islamification\" platform, calling for Islamic schools to be closed and the Quran and burqa to be banned. Speaking after the election loss, Wilders said he was still expecting to see a \"European spring\" for his supporters. RELATED: Geert Wilders -- Why voters are flocking to the Dutch Trump \"I think our influence has been enormous ... Our patriotic spring will continue, will really start. And if they need me or if they need the PVV for talks (on a coalition) then I am happy to take part,\" he said. \"If not, then they haven't seen the back of me yet.\" Netherlands 'deeply divided' Andre Krouwel, political scientist at the Free University Amsterdam, and owner of election website Kieskompas, said the only conclusion from the election result was the Dutch were \"deeply divided.\" \"It's very difficult to interpret this election result other than this is a very polarized result, people have abandoned the centrist parties but they have also abandoned the left-wing project ... the left together has 37 seats in the 150-seat parliament,\" he said. Krouwel also said Wilders, despite his slight gain of seats, now faced being almost powerless in the new political environment. \"The very vocal minority ... dominated the elections and everybody focused on Wilders. But in the end he's totally impotent to do anything. Nobody wants to coalition with him,\" he said. The election came as tensions between Netherlands and Turkey reached new heights, over the Dutch governments refusal to allow Turkish ministers to address political rallies inside their borders. Krouwel said the war of words between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Dutch government in the past month may have boosted support for Rutte as well. Coalition talks to begin The Netherlands has a complicated political landscape. More than 28 parties took part in the vote and, with no party winning a majority of seats, a multi-party governing coalition will have to be formed. Final results are not expected to be known until possibly Friday, the head of the ANP election service Mark Westerhoff said. There are 22 of 388 municipalities left to report. When the results are official, Rutte will begin negotiations to form government. Other potential coalition partners include the GroenLinks (Green left) Party and the Socialist Party, which according to initial results are poised to win 14 seats each. Support for the PVDA (Labour) party, which had been Rutte's previous partner in government, plunged from 38 seats to just nine. In his victory speech, Rutte appeared ready to negotiate. \"Now in the next couple of weeks and months it is important to unite the country, we have to make sure that we form a stable government so that the country for the next four years can be governed wisely,\" he said.",

        "Text": "In a 43-page ruling, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson issued a scathing rebuke just hours before Trump's revised travel ban was to go into effect Thursday. \"The illogic of the Government's contentions is palpable,\" he said of the ban, which would have temporarily barred travelers from six Muslim countries from entering the United States. Watson's ruling came after he heard Hawaii's case against the revised ban. The revised ban replaced the one Trump signed in January that was stopped by another federal judge. Here are five things to know about Watson: He was Obama's nominee The former President nominated Watson five years ago to serve on the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. At the time of his nomination, Obama issued a blanket statement describing him and six other nominees to US District Courts as qualified and ready to serve. \"These individuals have demonstrated the talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness Americans expect and deserve from their judicial system,\" Obama said at the time. The Senate unanimously confirmed Watson in a 94-to-0 vote. What you need to know about the travel ban He was born in Hawaii Watson was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He graduated in 1991 from Harvard Law School. Prior to that, he attended Harvard College, graduating in 1988. He's made history When Watson was confirmed, he was the fourth person of Native Hawaiian descent to serve as an Article III judge in the United States, according to the Congressional Asian Pacific Americans Caucus. \"Today, Judge Watson made history. I am confident he will serve Hawaii with distinction and honor. He has dedicated his life to the pursuit of justice and fairness in our legal system,\" Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said at the time. Article III judges serve on the US Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeals and district courts. A timeline of President Trump's travel bans He was partner at a law firm When it comes to the law, Watson is no rookie. Before becoming a judge at the US District Court, Watson was an assistant United States attorney in the District of Hawaii and Northern District of California. Before that, he was partner at a San Francisco law firm, where he focused on product liability and environmental cost recovery litigation. He also served as a US Army Reserve captain. He's done pro bono work During his confirmation hearing questionnaire, Watson said he spent hundreds of hours representing pro bono clients when he served in private practice. \"Together with one of my partners, we supervised a team of attorneys and paralegals who brought human trafficking...and wage and hour claims on behalf of two Mexican nationals against a chain of Bay Area taquerias,\" he wrote. \"After extensive discovery, much of which was done in Spanish, we recovered significant sums for both plaintiffs and their families.\" He also said he's worked on landlord/tenant cases, and partnered with a civil rights group to challenge a high school district's electoral system that prevented the election of a Hispanic member.",

        "Text": "The 297-foot (90.6 meter) MS Caledonian Sky crashed into the reefs at Raja Ampat on March 4. Raja Ampat is frequently included on lists of the the world's most beautiful coral reefs and is often described as an \"untouched\" beach paradise. \"The destruction of Raja Ampat coral reefs, which were developed by nature for hundreds of years, was done in less than one day by Caledonian Sky and its captain,\" Djoko Hartoyo, of the Information and Law Bureau of the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs, said in a statement. \"It is simply impossible to restore that part of Raja Ampat. Fish that were normally seen in that particular area were all gone.\" Nearly 140,000 square feet (more than 13,000 square meters) of reef were destroyed, Ketut Putra, the vice president of Conservation International Indonesia, told CNN. The ship crashed into one of the best diving areas, he said. Noble Caledonia, the cruise company that operates the vessel, apologized for the incident. It said in a statement that the ship went aground, but did not give a reason why. \"We are working with local experts to understand how we can assist with the regeneration of the reef. We value our relationships around the world with local people and we are sorry to have impacted the local community,\" the statement said. The company said it will establish a fund to help the local economy and help pay for repairs. But residents are outraged. \"The damage done to the reef is not only a disaster from an environmental point of view, but also due to the fact that the livelihoods of local communities depend upon healthy reefs,\" Doug Meikle, who runs a website supporting the work of the local Papuan community's tourist accommodation association, told CNN in an email. \"It's quite remarkable that the ship was so close.\" Ruben Sauyai, who owns the nearby Koranu Fyak Bungalows and is the president of the professional divers association in Raja Ampat told CNN he was about 200 feet away with some divers when the incident happened. \"You could hear it crush the reef,\" he said. Meikle believes there's a strong case to ban ships like this from the area. \"Quite apart from the risk of accidents, just anchoring such ships does incredible damage to reefs.\" Criminal charges coming? Though insurance could pay for some of the environmental damage, Indonesian authorities said they believe the captain committed a crime and could face prison time if convicted. \"Insurance company may be willing to pay the environmental damage, but it does not absolve criminal side of the case,\" authorities said. The company described the master on duty at the time of the crash as \"one of the world's leading expedition captains\" and said he had many years of experience. A symptom of a larger problem The crash could affect the local tourism industry and the economy. Putra told CNN the damaged reef won't attract as many tourists, and the number of fish in the area will be reduced because of their damaged habitat. \"I'm actually worried,\" he said. Cruise ships themselves are a source of dangerous pollutants that threat coral reefs -- especially in Southeast Asia, according to the industry website Marine Insight. The ships \"are often found flushing their enormous amount of sewage and food waste and oily bilge water as a suspension of insoluble particles, into the ocean.\" A 2016 study in the journal Nature found that the shipping industry also produced a significant amount of carbon dioxide in Asia. But coral reefs from around the globe remain under threat from environmental problems as well. The Great Barrier Reef suffered its most devastating die-off on record last year, according to a report from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. The report linked the rise in destructive bleaching events to warmer water temperatures.",

        "Text": "The National University of Singapore (NUS) was announced as the best college in Asia in the Times Higher Education supplement, beating out stiff competition from China, which otherwise dominated the top three. Phil Baty, the editor of the Times Higher Education Rankings, said the university had established itself as a role model for the continent, adding that in his view \"Asian universities can legitimately challenge the traditional Western elites of the US and the UK.\" The influential London-based guide to further education assesses universities on 13 performance indicators, including research performance and teaching environment. Peking University came in second and Tsinghua University third -- both are located in the Chinese capital Beijing. While there was little movement in the top five institutions -- Singapore's Nanyang Technological University and the University of Hong Kong came in fourth and fifth respectively -- there were some major movements elsewhere on the table. Good effort India more than doubled its representation on the influential list, from 16 institutions to 33, and Pakistan more than tripled its presence from two to seven. For the first year, Japan was the most-represented nation: 69 of the universities were Japanese, nearly one quarter of the 300-strong ranking. Thailand was the most represented country from Southeast Asia, with 10 universities ranked. But the researchers said that of all the emerging university nations Malaysia was showing the greatest potential. In its first showing on the list, Malaysia's University of Malaya took a top-60 position. The university said it had increased international enrollment and was now running programs in English to accommodate for this shift. However, Mohd Amin Jalaludin, vice-chancellor of the University of Malaya, told the Times he thought \"there should be distinctions between what smaller countries such as Malaysia could achieve compared with giants such as China.\" Star student This is the second recent victory for Singapore in the educational sphere. In December, the Program International Student Assessment (PISA) survey found that Singaporean teens were the best in the world when it came to math, science and reading. In all three subjects, Singapore students demonstrated knowledge and skills equivalent to almost two additional years of schooling compared to students in the US, France and Sweden.

        "Text": "Kim Jong Nam was killed February 13 in what Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has called an assassination attempt. Kim was at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on his way to Macau when two women wiped his face with the highly lethal VX nerve agent, killing him in 20 minutes, Malaysian police said. Both South Korea and Malaysia accuse Pyongyang of killing Kim. North Korea strongly denies the allegation. Malaysian authorities didn't publicly identify Kim's body until last week after obtaining a DNA sample \"from the child of the deceased,\" Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Wednesday. He declined to elaborate on how the DNA sample was obtained. Kim's family is believed to be in hiding. His son Kim Han Sol emerged publicly for the first time after his father's death last week in a 40-second video posted online by a group called Cheollima Civil Defense. It's not clear when the video was shot, but a South Korean National Intelligence Service spokesman verified the son's identity to CNN. The row over the body The decision to hold Kim Jong Nam's body -- and conduct an autopsy -- angered the North Koreans. They wanted the body and said Malaysia should hand it over because he was a North Korean national. But Malaysian authorities would only release it if a DNA match was provided. This diplomatic row culminated in both countries issuing dual travel bans -- Malaysians were prohibited from leaving North Korea and North Koreans couldn't travel out of Malaysia. Nine Malaysians are in North Korea. It's not clear how many North Koreans are in Malaysia, but police believe three people wanted for questioning in Kim's killing are holed up in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. There are four suspects at large, believed to be back in North Korea, and two people in custody regarding the case. Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam have both been charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted. Authorities from both countries have said the women believed they were participating in a prank TV show, but Malaysian authorities do not believe that's true.",

        "Text": "A group of dairy drivers argued that they deserved overtime pay for certain tasks they had completed. The company said they did not. An appeals court sided with the drivers, saying that the guidelines themselves were made too ambiguous by, you guessed it, a lack of an Oxford comma. This is what the law says about activities that do NOT merit overtime pay. Pay attention to the first sentence: The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: (1) Agricultural produce; (2) Meat and fish products; and (3) Perishable foods. That's a lot of things! But if we're getting picky, is packing for shipment its own activity, or does it only apply to the rest of that clause, i.e. the distribution of agricultural produce, etc.? See, all of this could be solved if there were an Oxford comma, clearly separating \"packing for shipment\" and \"distribution\" as separate things! According to court documents, the drivers distribute perishable food, but they don't pack it. Yes, this is the real argument they made. And they really won. \"Specifically, if that [list of exemptions] used a serial comma to mark off the last of the activities that it lists, then the exemption would clearly encompass an activity that the drivers perform,\" the circuit judge wrote. It did not, and since the judge observed that labor laws, when ambiguous, are designed to benefit the laborers, the case was settled. \"For want of a comma, we have this case,\" the judge wrote. The irony in this ruling is, there are actual state guidelines on how Maine lawmakers draw up their documents. And they do NOT include Oxford commas! The humanity! To be fair, there is also guidance on how to avoid unclear language that could, say, help an impressively pedantic group of drivers get what they were owed. (All of you Oxford comma purists out there, go ahead and gloat. We'll have you know CNN adheres by AP Style, which does not include the mark.)",

        "Text": "The paper's authors warn that the resilience of the planet's largest living structure is waning rapidly. Data from a series of aerial and underwater surveys shows that a heatwave in summer 2016, which saw sea temperatures in Australia reach record levels, triggered the most damaging and widespread coral bleaching event on record. Almost 50% of the reef is now \"extremely\" bleached and 91% shows at least some signs of bleaching, Sean Connolly, program leader of a government-funded coral reef center at James Cook University, Queensland and the paper's co-author told CNN. \"Coral cover [on the Great Barrier Reef] has halved over the last 27 years,\" Connolly said. \"[In the last three decades] coral cover went from 28% to 13%. Preliminary estimates [from last year's disaster] are saying we've lost half that amount again. To have that kind of mortality on that kind of scale is unprecedented,\" said Connolly. Ship crashes into 'pristine' coral reef Rising temperatures, diminished responsibility Coral bleaching happens when an increase in sea temperatures causes the expulsion of algae that grow inside coral, turning the reefs white and eliminating their main energy source. It's directly linked to global warming. Sustained bleaching will result in coral death. The bleaching during last year's heatwave was worse than expected and the episode's severity has raised serious concern for the future of the reef ecosystem. The study pointed to the bleaching of hardy, century-old reefs as a particular red flag. \"The severity and frequency of these [bleaching] events means slow-growing corals won't have time to come back,\" said Connolly. \"If all the coral bleaches and dies, it's no longer a coral reef. The coral skeletons are quickly colonized by algae which turns them dark in color,\" said David Baker, assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong's Swire Institute of Marine Sciences. Eventually those skeletons collapse, he added, and the natural habitat for fish and other marine life is completely lost. The paper's authors also concluded, whether bleached or not, the reef had not acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures over time. Connolly said that, as temperatures increase, reefs would eventually die off and be replaced with more stress-tolerant species such as seaweeds. \"We have known that things would go in this way for decades and unfortunately ... our international system of government and policy has utterly failed to take relatively inexpensive action to head off what could be potentially catastrophic climate change -- not just on reefs, but on other ecosystems we depend on.\" Around 275 million people globally directly rely on reefs for livelihood and sustenance, and globally reefs form the nurseries for around a quarter of the world's fish, according to the UN. The Great Barrier Reef is worth $3.7 billion annually to the Australian economy through fishing and tourism, and provides around 70,000 jobs, Connolly said. \"You're looking at some potentially unfolding human tragedy over the decades if reefs cannot provide the same source of livelihood,\" he added. Ongoing damage Last year's disaster was the third major mass coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef on record, and scientists suspect that -- less than a year on -- a fourth is already underway. The Great Barrier Marine Park Authority is currently conducting aerial surveys of the reef and, last week, Greenpeace released photos and video footage highlighting the ongoing damage. \"Greenpeace has just been on the Great Barrier Reef with a marine biologist to document the situation and it is heartbreaking,\" said Alix Foster Vander Elst, Campaigner for Greenpeace Australia Pacific. \"We should know in the coming days or weeks the exact impact of this year's disaster.\"",

        "Text": "Tillerson was speaking in Tokyo, ahead of stops in Seoul and Beijing, where Chinese leaders are expected to present their own plan to defuse escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula. \"The diplomatic and other efforts of the past 20 years to bring North Korea to a point of denuclearization have failed. So we have 20 years of a failed approach,\" Tillerson said at a news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. China will formally present its own proposal to Tillerson on Saturday, a senior Chinese diplomat told CNN Thursday. The Chinese plan calls for North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile tests and nuclear activities, and for the United States and South Korea to halt large-scale military exercises that annually antagonize Pyongyang. \"(North Korea) would like to see the Americans move first and take some actions first to show their sincerity, and vice versa,\" Xiao Qian, the director general of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN in an exclusive interview. \"So China's proposal is, why not do these things at the same time?\" This is the second time in as many weeks that China has floated this plan. A similar proposal by Foreign Minister Wang Yi was rejected by the US State Department last week. \"There's no equivalence between North Korea's illegal missile and nuclear activities and what is our lawful, longstanding joint security exercises with our allies in the region,\" said Mark Toner, the acting State Department spokesman, in response to Wang's initial pitch. The North Koreans don't seem to be buying it either. In a rare and hastily called press conference Thursday, Pak Myong Ho, the charg¨¦ d'affaires at the North Korean embassy in Beijing, also rebuffed Wang's proposal. \"Our stance is that since the US and its followers continue their nuclear threats and intimidation -- in the form of their annual military drills -- on the doorstep of DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), we will continue to strengthen our defense and preemptive strike capabilities,\" he said. The new path? Speaking side by side in Tokyo, Tillerson and Japan's Kishida reiterated their countries would stand united against North Korea's provocations. While Kishida said Japan would assume a larger responsibility in the alliance, Tillerson said it was time for the US to stop throwing money at a solution that's not working. \"The United States provided $1.35 billion dollars in assistance to North Korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway. That encouragement has been met with further development of nuclear capabilities, more missile launches, including those of the recent February 11th and March 5th,\" he said. Between 1995 and 2008, the US sent $1.35 billion to North Korea, mostly for food aid and energy assistance, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Analysts say when it comes to North Korea policy, there are few new options to try. \"Secretary Tillerson's comments on North Korea sound like a simplistic version of the past without a clear vision for the future,\" John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Affairs told CNN. \"The history of US policy toward North Korea is complicated. It cannot be reduced to a talking point like -- we spent $1.3 billion and got nothing for it.\" \"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,\" he added. The US, South Korea, Japan, China and Russia have tried repeatedly to negotiate a solution with Pyongyang during Six-Party Talks, which began in 2003. The sanctions currently levied against Pyongyang are among the most stringent ever enacted, but the pace of both North Korea's nuclear and missile programs appear to be speeding up. 'Face to face' In his interview with CNN, Xiao addressed criticisms that China can and should be doing more unilaterally to stop North Korea. The Trump administration has argued the China should use its vast economic leverage over North Korea to force the Kim Jong Un regime to cease its weapons development program. \"This is a rather complicated situation. You cannot solve the problem in a simple way,\" Xiao said. \"The DPRK has been saying all along that it is the threat from the US to make them choose other options, including nuclearization of their military capabilities. So it is, to a large extent, for the US and the DPRK to face to face, sit down and talk, and try to find a way to work out the problem,\" he said, using the abbreviation for North Korea's formal name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Xiao also denied claims that Beijing has been carrying out systematic economic retaliation against South Korean businesses as a result of its opposition to the THAAD missile defense system that the US and South Korea believe is necessary to protect against North Korean missiles. \"But if they continue to move on with this deployment, there will be consequences -- and those consequence will be borne by the Americans and ROK (Republic of Korea),\" he warned, without elaborating.",

In footage, which will be shown as part of a documentary in France, Loeuillet played down the systematic murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust. \"I don't think there were that many deaths,\" he said. \"There weren't six million\". In a statement on his Facebook page, Loeuillet denied the allegations and said he would take legal action against the journalists involved. French law strictly prohibits Holocaust denial. The party took swift action with Secretary-General Nicolas Bay issuing a suspension and announcing in a statement that Loeuillet will face a disciplinary hearing where he could face expulsion. History French presidential hopeful Le Pen has sought to push her party away from allegations of anti-Semitism since taking over the party's leadership in 2011. Her father and National Front founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was expelled from the party in 2015 after making comments denying the Holocaust. During his career, he referred to the gas chambers used by the Nazis to systematically murder the Jewish population as \"a detail of history.\" The expulsion of the party's founder by his daughter caused huge controversy with the two involved in a public falling out. Trouble brewing? Le Pen is already facing increased scrutiny ahead of the first round of the elections on April 23 over allegations several members of her staff were paid for non-existent jobs at the European Parliament. She initially admitted they had been paid while not working, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) said. She later denied having said so. Le Pen's fractious relationship with Europe was further exacerbated when MEPs voted to rescind her parliamentary immunity over a case involving violent images she posted on Twitter. An inquiry was opened under a French law banning the distribution of violent images after Le Pen tweeted images of killings by ISIS militants in December 2015. Under French law, the maximum penalty for distributing violent images is three years in prison and a fine of up to 15,000 ($79,000). The loss of her immunity only relates to this case only and not the one being investigated by OLAF.",

        "Text": "The President was asked by a German reporter why his White House had cited a Fox News report that claimed that the British surveillance agency GCHQ had been used to wiretap Trump Tower during the election campaign. He did not apologize to the British government after it said that the report of UK surveillance was \"ridiculous.\" Turning to Merkel, who was angry to find out after leaks by Edward Snowden that the US National Security Agency had tapped her phone, Trump said \"at least we have something in common\". Trump appeared to be irritated to be asked the question by the German reporter, in the latest twist of a two-week controversy ignited by early morning tweets by the President that claimed that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps against him last year. Senior members of the intelligence committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate have said that there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower. Trump also knocked NATO nations who do not pay their \"fair share\" for their defense, as he stood side-by-side with Merkel. He said that many nations owe \"vast sums\" of money in unpaid dues to the organization. \"These nations must pay what they owe,\" Trump said during the joint news conference between the two leaders. The President, however, also expressed strong support for the NATO alliance after raising questions about its utility and relevance during his election campaign. The German government fell well short of its NATO target of 2% last year, hitting 1.19%. Though it has committed to boosting defense spending this year, Germany will still fall short again. Trump welcomes Merkel after bashing her Trump also said that the US would respect \"historic institutions\" in what may have been a reference to the European Union, which has always been seen by the US as a bulwark of Western security but about which senior figures in Trump's government have expressed skepticism. In her remarks, Merkel also referred to past tensions with Trump, as she seeks to build a new relationship with the third US president she has encountered as German Chancellor. \"It's always much better to talk to one another than about one another,\" she said. She also said she was glad to hear Trump's support for NATO and said that Trump had committed to the Minsk process, designed to monitor a ceasefire in Ukraine and look toward an eventual solution to the crisis. Apart from the domestic political storms that are battering the White House, the news conference and Merkel's visit to the White House are coming at a crucial moment for US-German relations. The German Chancellor is trying to forge a relationship with Trump despite suspicion over his political views. She congratulated the President after his election win in a statement that also contained a defense of Western values -- amid concern in Germany that his stances on issues like immigration run counter to the principles that have sustained the Western alliance. Germany, the most powerful political force in the European Union, has also been deeply concerned by Trump criticisms of NATO and deep skepticism inside the White House about the EU itself. Friday's meeting will attempt to stir some personal chemistry between two leaders who seem far removed in temperament and instinct. Merkel, who takes a cautious, analytical approach to politics, was also one of the few world leaders who appeared to forge a deep connection with Obama, with whom she was something of a kindred spirit. Trump is more outspoken and improvisational and has little time for diplomatic niceties. He has, for example, heavily criticized Merkel's decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany, a move that is a key issue in her re-election race this year. But both sides are likely to try to move on from past tensions. The pragmatic Merkel is now on her third US president and appears to be looking to find a way to forge a relationship with Trump without buying into his political values. Another administration official said before the meeting that the President hoped to get Merkel's advice for dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who, according to US intelligence, ordered cyber-meddling in last year's presidential election and tried to help Trump. Merkel hoped to appeal to the President's focus on business, bringing with her to Washington the chief executives of Siemens and BMW with her to Washington. The two companies employ thousands of American workers, a point Merkel hopes will come through when the pair get to discussing trade issues -- including Germany's trade surplus, which has rankled the Trump camp.",

        "Text": "In an interview with the American magazine, the former businessman outlined his philosophy of life and his political ideas. If Angela Merkel can be characterized by one thing, it is her meticulous preparation and her willingness to understand her opponents. Meeting with Trump is unlikely to intimidate Merkel. She has dealt with alpha males with inflated egos before. Throughout her career, she has battled the likes of Vladimir Putin, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr?der and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. All of them have tried to intimidate her. Putin infamously allowed his dog Koni into the room when Merkel visited Russia in 2007 (Merkel is reportedly scared of dogs, though Putin claims that making her feel uncomfortable was not his intention). Merkel used small talk to neutralize the Kremlin strongman, and then later imposed economic sanctions on Russia that the country could ill afford. With nearly all the leaders above, she has responded like an older sister who is used to dealing with the naughtiness of her younger brothers. Merkel tends to be sweet, personable and charming when she meets with other leaders. While researching my book about her -- \"Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader\" -- I heard stories of how she had won over both David Cameron and Barack Obama by teaching them how to swear in German. She also, apparently, does a pretty accurate impression of the former Pope Benedict, which Putin was said to find particularly amusing. We all caught a glimpse of this more human side of her in 2012 when she broke up G8 talks on Syria to watch the penalty shootout of a Champions League final. But she is also obsessed by detail. The German Chancellor, who has a doctorate in quantum mechanics, is known for her obsessive attention to detail and for her patience. Unlike Trump, who likes to tweet in the small hours of the morning, Merkel often waits days or even weeks before she responds. When a problem emerges, she gathers facts before she makes a decision. By her own admission, she has turned \"cautious deliberation into an art form.\" Indeed, the Germans have even invented a verb for this: Merkeln -- which was the Youth Word of the Year in 2015 in Germany -- means to be indecisive or to not have an opinion on something. But she will not be rushed into anything contrary to Europe's interests and she is certainly not going to be intimidated by Trump's male bravado. In her eleventh year in office, the pastor's daughter who grew up under the communist dictatorship -- and who speaks Russian -- is not likely to welcome President Trump's desire for friendly relations with Putin. Nor is Germany, one of the largest exporters of goods, likely to be enamored by Trump's protectionism. Should he be worried? Should he accommodate his awkward German ally? Or could he simply ignore her? That would not be wise. Much as Trump would like to establish more friendly relations with Moscow, the European Union is one of the US' most important trading partners. Millions of jobs in the US depend on trade with the EU. Upsetting that relationship will make it difficult to bring back jobs to the American Rust Belt -- the area that elected Trump. The 45th President needs to develop a very different style if he is to establish positive relations with Germany. Upsetting Europe's strongest power is simply not an option.",

        "Text": "National security adviser H.R. McMaster spoke with his British counterpart on Thursday about press secretary Sean Spicer's comment from the White House podium about a Fox News report that said British intelligence helped wiretap Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, a White House official said Friday. The official described the conversation as \"cordial\" where McMaster described Spicer's comment as \"unintentional.\" McMaster also told his counterpart that \"their concerns were understood and heard and it would be relayed to the White House.\" The official said there were \"at least two calls\" from British officials on Thursday and that the British ambassador to the United States called Spicer to discuss the comment. \"Sean was pointing to the breadth of reporting, not endorsing any specific story,\" the official said. A senior administration official told CNN that Spicer and McMaster offered what amounted to an apology to the British government. White House officials later told CNN that it was British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May, who \"expressed their concerns to Sean Spicer and Gen. McMaster\" in two separate conversations on Thursday. \"Mr. Spicer and Gen. McMaster explained that Mr. Spicer was simply pointing to public reports, not endorsing any specific story,\" one official said. 'These claims are ridiculous' Earlier Friday, a spokesman for May said senior UK officials had protested to the Trump administration after the claims were repeated by Spicer. \"We've made clear to the US administration that these claims are ridiculous and should be ignored. We've received assurances that these allegations won't be repeated,\" May's spokesman said. At a Thursday press briefing, Spicer read out allegations originally made on Tuesday on Fox News by legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, that the UK intelligence agency GCHQ -- the equivalent of the US National Security Agency -- had spied on Trump. \"Judge Andrew Napolitano made the following statement, quote, 'Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command (to spy on Trump). He didn't use the NSA, he didn't use the CIA ... he used GCHQ,'\" Spicer told journalists. The strong language from Downing Street -- which followed a similar, rare statement from the UK intelligence agency GCHQ -- indicated that the British government was furious that the US had made such an incendiary allegation. GCHQ: Wiretap claims are 'nonsense' GCHQ said the claim was \"nonsense\" and should be ignored. The agency rarely comments on specific operations, and almost never in such blunt terms. Then, at a regular press briefing, Downing Street said it had sought and received reassurances that the allegations would not be repeated. \"This shows the administration doesn't give the allegations any credence,\" the Downing Street spokesman said. \"We have a close special relationship with the White House and that allows us to raise concerns as and when they arise, as was true in this case,\" he added. Britain is particularly sensitive to any suggestion that the US would use GCHQ to keep \"American fingerprints\" off the spying. UK intelligence agencies work closely with their US counterparts, as well as those in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as part of the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence sharing agreement. May's spokesman argued this pact precluded the kind of spying alleged by Napolitano, saying: \"I would add as a matter of fact that under the 'Five Eyes' intelligence agreement, we cannot use each other's capabilities to circumvent the law. It's a situation that simply wouldn't arise.\" Claims by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden led to questions over GCHQ's relationship with the NSA. It was censured by a UK tribunal in 2015 for not making enough information public about how it shares Internet surveillance data with its US counterpart. Concern over claims Susan Rice, national security adviser in the Obama administration, said Spicer's claims put the intelligence-sharing relationship between the US and UK at risk.\"The cost of falsely blaming our closest ally for something this consequential cannot be overstated,\" she wrote on Twitter. Tim Farron, leader of the UK Liberal Democrat party -- the junior coalition partner in the last British government -- described the White House claim as \"shameful\" and said it risked harming US and UK security. \"Trump is compromising the vital UK-US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment,\" he tweeted. The Senate Intelligence Committee had said on Thursday it had found no evidence Trump Tower had been under surveillance in 2016, contrary to Trump's previous claims. \"Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\" committee chair Richard Burr said. The same day, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN in an interview that he also hadn't seen any evidence of a wiretap or a surveillance order against Trump Tower. On Friday, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, told CNN's Manu Raju that Obama is owed an apology for Trump's \"reckless\" comment on wiretapping. And Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, warned that Trump's comments and the White House's decision to dig in on the claims are undercutting the President's credibility and sapping his political capital at a time when he's trying to push a budget and health care overhaul through Congress. Trump originally made the allegations against Obama on March 4 in a series of early morning tweets. \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" he said on his official Twitter account. Just under two weeks later, in an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, Trump appeared to walk back his original wiretapping allegations. \"Wiretap covers a lot of different things,\" Trump told Carlson on Wednesday. \"I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\"",

But during an appearance on CNN's Erin Burnett \"Outfront,\" Santorum warned that Trump's insistence on standing by his wiretap allegations poses a problem for the President. \"We're not in an election anymore, and it's not his opponent he's throwing off,\" Santorum said. \"I think it's him that he's throwing off.\" \"In this case, he has no opponent,\" Santorum said. \"And who he's hurting is not a rival, he's hurting himself, because he's now the president and it doesn't matter whether he blames Barack Obama or not. People don't care about Barack Obama anymore. They care about one person.

        "Text": "Speaking in Seoul at a joint press conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Tillerson said Washington's policy of \"strategic patience\" had ended. \"Certainly, we do not want things to get to a military conflict ... but obviously, if North Korea takes actions that threatens the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response,\" he said, in response to a question from CNN. \"If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe that requires action, that option is on the table,\" Tillerson added. Later Friday morning, President Donald Trump denounced North Korea, tweeting, \"North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!\" Tillerson's remarks come at a time when the US intelligence community and the Defense Department are increasingly anticipating that North Korea will soon undertake a new round of testing of its missile and nuclear program, half a dozen US officials have told CNN. The secretary of state is on a three-country tour to the region amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula following recent North Korea missile launches, and fears it's preparing for another nuclear test. In Tokyo Thursday, Tillerson said efforts over the past 20 years to halt North Korea's nuclear development had failed. He said it was time for a new policy on North Korea, but released no details. It is clear that he sees Beijing, where he will fly to Saturday, as a key part of Washington's new approach. A senior Chinese official told CNN this week that Beijing plans to present its own plan to Tillerson during his visit. However, Tillerson dismissed suggestions by Beijing that the US should drop joint military exercises with South Korea as a show of good faith to Pyongyang. Washington did \"not believe that conditions are right to engage in any talks at this time.\" \"Conditions must change before there are any scope for talks to resume, whether they are five party or six party,\" he said. Tillerson called on China to give up its opposition to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system or act to \"address the threat that makes THAAD necessary.\" The missile defense system is in the process of being deployed in the country's south. He also urged Beijing to drop any retaliatory action against South Korea, amid allegations businesses and the tourism industry is being punished for Seoul's stance on the issue. \"(Beijing's) economic retaliation against South Korea is inappropriate and troubling,\" Tillerson said. First visit Earlier in the day, Tillerson visited the demilitarized zone, the highly-fortified border between North and South Korea, becoming the most senior US official to visit the area since President Barack Obama in 2012. There he met some of the more than 28,000 US troops stationed on the peninsula, and toured the Joint Security Area, where North and South Korea soldiers stand facing each other. A Military Armistice Commission briefing room straddles the border. The relatively inexperienced Tillerson has waded into a political minefield in South Korea, where President Park Geun-hye was impeached a week ago and preparations are being made for a snap election on May 9. That election has raised questions over the future of the THAAD system, with some candidates calling for its deployment to be reviewed by the National Assembly. \"We look forward to a productive relationship with whoever the South Korean people elect to be their next President,\" Tillerson said. \"My expectation that the new government in South Korea will continue to be supportive of the THAAD system.\" New approach? Tillerson repeated Friday the US had spent too much money on a failed North Korea policy. \"America has provided $1.3 billion in assistance (to North Korea) since 1995. In return, North Korea has detonated nuclear weapons and launched ballistic missiles.\" After Trump suggested during his campaign that he would be willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, many speculated that talks would be forthcoming. However, Tillerson said that option was not being considered right now. He called on China to \"fully implement\" UN-approved sanctions against North Korea, and said Washington will be \"calling on everyone to join in\" future actions.",

        "Text": "\"I've been inside for 32 years, three months and 14 days. It's been that long,\" Wilson told CNN. Wilson has been in prison all those years. He went in at age 30 convicted of murder and now at 62 he is a free man because evidence had come to light that the prosecution withheld in the case all those years ago. Superior Court Judge Laura Priver ruled Wilson had been deprived of his constitutional rights to a fair trial, vacating his conviction and ordering his immediate release. One day later Wilson was free. \"I say it all the time, don't stop fighting. Don't give up. It seems like that's what the justice system wants you to do and I never gave up,\" Wilson said adding, \"By the grace of God I was put in contact with Loyola Law School.\" His attorneys and students from the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent worked to bring the new information to light. The information they found showed the prosecution had withheld information during the murder trial. Paying a heavy price Wilson had maintained his innocence since the day he was arrested for the stabbing death of a 21-year-old man in 1984. The man was sleeping in his truck when he was fatally stabbed. His girlfriend Saladena Bishop was also in the truck. Wilson's attorneys said the prosecution withheld key pieces of evidence concerning the main witness. According to the innocence project, Bishop picked Wilson out in a line up only after a police officer pointed to Wilson's photo asking: 'What about him?' Before Wilson's trial, police had deemed Bishop an unreliable witness because she had once filed a false police report accusing someone of kidnapping and attempted rape. Then there was Bishop's friend, who had revealed to the trial prosecutor that Bishop had stabbed her boyfriend in the past and was likely the killer. Loyola's innocence project says none of that evidence was handed over to Wilson's defense attorney. Wilson has paid a heavy price. Half his life has been spent in prison. He's missed 32 years of Christmas dinners, graduations, even the birth of his granddaughter, but he says he is not bitter. \"I'm past it. I just want to get something to eat right now and love my family,\" he said with a chuckle. What would he eat? \"Anything he wants,\" his sister Gwen Wilson chimed in. An emotional reunion He was clutching his daughter and sister's hand the entire time as he walked out of the LA County jail to a flurry of camera's and reporters. His daughter's eyes filled with tears when asked what it was like when she heard he was finally getting out. \"I couldn't breathe. I started crying.\" Wilson's daughter Catrina Burke said. \"I don't have words. I don't have words at all. But I still have a parent.\" Wilson's granddaughter snuggled under his arm tears dripping from her eyes while he talked. But his sister Gwen Wilson beamed saying she isn't going to focus on the wrong that was done to her brother who she idolized as a child. \"We just needed to love on him and keep him encouraged through it all. All we can do is keep our head up you know that's just it. We've always been a hopeful that one day...by the grace of God today is that day.\" Wilson's mother who is 96 years old had long fought for her son's release from her home in Missouri. She believed her son. And he knew he had better call her the moment he was out. \"I talked to her,\" He said smiling, \"My mother was the backbone. She's a 96-year-old pit bull.\" Wilson's sister Gwen chimed in with proof. She repeated the words of their no nonsense mother the moment Wilson called her as a free man, \"I didn't ask if you was alright. I said are you out?\" Indeed he was.",

        "Text": "Even now, as bipartisan agreement has emerged that no such thing happened, Trump has dug in, leaving Trump aides and allies fumbling for excuses and explanations -- like that spying microwaves are apparently a thing, according to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Friday news conference, Trump showed that he was not ready to quit the wiretapping story, giving it another boost, even if it meant embarrassing a world leader. Many people are saying -- that Trump drives conspiracies and gossip \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" Trump said, gesturing to Merkel, whose phone was once tapped by the National Security Agency. Trump's embrace of conspiracy theories is, of course, not new. He launched a kind of trial run for the White House in 2011 by embracing birtherism, laying the groundwork for his successful 2016 bid by aligning himself with the far right, talk radio wing of the GOP. Long after most had given up speculating about Obama's birthplace -- and years after Obama released his birth certificate -- Trump clung to the racially charged conspiracy theory, insisting that there were still more unanswered questions. It took him five years to finally let it go. Now, it seems, Trump may have landed on a conspiracy theory that has equal staying power. In fact, the contours of his recent Obama fixation have much in common with birtherism. With his wiretapping claims, Trump once again positions himself as the great unmasker of Obama, a fraudulent figure who isn't who he says he is -- or so the theory goes. For Trump's base, Obama is the ready-made villain, now recast as the embodiment of the \"deep state.\" But with Congress, the press, (even Fox News hosts), and intelligence agencies all casting doubts on his claims, Trump is a man on an island, a familiar and comfortable place. As with birtherism, it's Trump against almost everybody, a vantage point that allows him to constantly be the embattled, populist outsider, even as he sits in the White House. Justice Department provides wiretap documents to Congress Key to his birtherism claims were constant promises of the big reveal. Investigators had been dispatched to Hawaii, Trump claimed. Once that approach grew thin, Trump's relationship to birtherism devolved into a constant cliffhanger, which is precisely where things stand now with the wiretapping claims. Does Trump believe Obama wiretapped or spied on him more broadly at Trump Tower or anywhere? For now, Trump seems happy to tell the country what he said for five years about Obama's origins: stay tuned. Let the countdown clock 'til the big reveal begin.",

        "Text": "The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, spoke with knowledge of the classified report's contents. When asked if the DOJ's documents would confirm Trump's as of yet wholly unsubstantiated allegations, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes told CNN, \"I don't think so\" as he walked into a room to read the report. Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said he was \"absolutely confident\" the DOJ report would not back up Trump's allegation. \"There's really no question about this. The president's statements before, and his tweets since leading right up today, have no basis in fact,\" Schiff told CNN. The Justice Department declined to comment on the contents of the report, but earlier in the day a spokeswoman confirmed it had delivered the document. \"The Department of Justice has complied with the request from leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and Judiciary Committees seeking information related to surveillance during the 2016 election,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said Friday. The House Committee is set to hold a hearing Monday with National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and FBI Director James Comey. The Senate Intelligence Committee announced Friday it would hold a hearing on Russia's meddling into the US election on March 30. Nunes released a statement Friday evening confirming receipt of the report from DOJ and part of the information it requested from the NSA, which he said had committed to meet the full request by the end of next week. However, he added, \"the committee still has not received information requested from the CIA and FBI in our March 15 letter that is necessary to determine whether information collected on US persons was mishandled and leaked.\" Prior to receiving the classified documents from the DOJ, both Nunes and Schiff had already stated flatly that Trump Tower was clearly not wiretapped. But Nunes has left the door open to the potential that communications between Trump's aides and others were swept up in \"incidental\" collection. RELATED: Actually, Mr. President, wiretapping doesn't cover a lot of things \"We need to figure out what happened here, there's a lot of unanswered question. I just don't want anybody jumping to any conclusion on any side of this, other than the fact that we know that Obama didn't physically wiretap Trump Tower,\" Nunes told CNN Friday. \"But everything else is still ... there's a lot of unknowns.\" The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee have also stated that no surveillance of Trump Tower occurred during or after the 2016 election. Republican Rep. Will Hurd, in an interview Friday evening on CNN's Erin Burnett \"OutFront,\" said that while he had not yet had a chance to read the DOJ report, he believes \"it's been pretty clear that there's no evidence to suggest\" Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped. Trump has stood by his claim, repeating the allegation again Friday while standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" Trump said Friday, motioning to Merkel, a reference to how the US National Security Agency had tapped the German Chancellor's phone in the past.

The attacker was known to police and intelligence services, and was involved in a shooting at a police traffic stop north of Paris that morning, Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux said at a news conference. He fled the scene. A police officer injured in that incident is undergoing treatment, he said. At the airport, the attacker tried to tackle the soldier and grab her weapon, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. He was shot dead by two of the soldier's colleagues. This was the fourth attack against security forces deployed as part of France's Operation Sentinel, he said. The national security operation was launched following the Paris terror attacks in January 2015. Le Roux praised the swift response of security forces at the airport. No one else was injured in the airport incident, interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said. An investigation is underway. The airport was evacuated as an elite operations unit and bomb squad officers rushed to the scene. Local authorities said the bomb squad had finished its search for explosives. Air traffic at both Orly South and Orly West remains suspended, the president of Paris Airports Augustin de Romanet said, adding that he discouraged people from coming to the scene. The police also urged the public to avoid the airport, follow instructions and not to cross the security perimeter. With roads around the airport closed off, some travelers earlier tried to make their way to the airport on foot with their baggage. Air traffic has been suspended at the airport, with some flights rerouted to Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport. Paris Orly Airport is France's second-busiest airport, with international and domestic air traffic.",

        "Text": "The boat was carrying up to 160 people when an unknown assailant attacked it early Friday, IOM spokesman Joel Millman said. At least 24 of the injured were being treated at nearby hospitals but dozens more were unaccounted for, he said. According to the IOM, witnesses have given conflicting accounts of whether a helicopter or a motorized military vessel opened fire on the boat. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack. Civilians suffering 'disproportionately' Many of the victims were believed to have originated in Somalia, but it is not yet clear how many, the General Consul for the Somali General Consulate in Yemen Ahmed Abdi Hassan told CNN. The attack took place in a \"military area,\" he said. The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) said Friday that the refugees were being carried across the Red Sea en route to Sudan. On Saturday, the agency's spokeswoman in Yemen, Shabia Mantoo, told CNN that 39 people were understood to have been injured, some critically. \"Those injured are receiving treatment in hospitals and are quite shaken by this traumatic event. Our staff have visited them and are providing them with necessary support,\" Mantoo said. She said the ongoing conflict in Yemen meant that medical supplies for the survivors were limited. The UNHCR was working with authorities to determine where the Somali refugees would go next, Mantoo said, with the main priority making sure they received proper treatment, both physically and psychologically. The conflict Yemen has been in the grip of civil war since 2015, when Houthi rebels -- a minority Shia group from the north of the country -- drove out the US-backed government, led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and took over the capital, Sanaa. The crisis quickly escalated into a multi-sided war, which allowed al Qaeda and ISIS -- other enemies of the Houthis -- to grow stronger amid the chaos. The Houthis are backed by Iran, while a coalition led by neighboring Saudi Arabia supports of Hadi's government.  \"As conditions in Yemen deteriorate as a result of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis, refugees and asylum seekers are increasingly fleeing onwards, following established migratory routes, including across the Red Sea to Sudan with the intention of heading onwards to Europe. \"This tragic incident is the latest in which innocent civilians, including Yemenis, refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, continue to suffer and disproportionately bear the brunt of the conflict in Yemen,\" the UNHCR said in a statement Friday.

        "Text": "US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in the Chinese capital Saturday after issuing the administration's bluntest warning yet to North Korea, saying that no option was off the table -- including military action. For two hours, Tillerson met with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, who said the US should \"come back to the right track of a negotiated settlement.\" Tillerson said that North Korean tensions had reached a \"dangerous level\" and said China had agreed to work together to make Pyongyang \"change course,\" -- though he didn't give further details. Beijing was Tillerson's final stop on his first official trip to Asia after visiting Japan and South Korea. The trip follows a string of North Korea missile launches and comes amid fears it's preparing for another nuclear test. Beijing is North Korea's only real ally and its main economic benefactor, accounting for 70% of the country's trade. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on Beijing to use its leverage over its unpredictable neighbor -- and on Friday again singled out China, tweeting, \"North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!\" On Sunday, Tillerson will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who's expected to meet with Trump next month. Tillerson was expected to raise the prospect of financial penalties on companies and banks that do business in North Korea. \"The Trump administration is banking that threats of US military action in South Korea and tougher sanctions on Chinese entities will intimidate Beijing into changing its policies,\" said Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. On the trip, Tillerson has signaled a new approach toward North Korea, saying that Washington's policy of \"strategic patience\" had ended with efforts over the past 20 years to halt North Korea's nuclear development a failure. OPINION: The US might have a new North Korea policy Beijing irked Beijing, however, has been irked by calls that it isn't doing enough to lessen tensions in the region. Wang said China had made an \"important contribution\" to supporting US engagement with Pyongyang but stressed it was, at its core, an issue between the US and North Korea. An unbylined opinion piece in the Global Times, a state-run tabloid, Friday made a similar point. \"Washington and Seoul are trying to shift all the burden of solving the North Korean nuclear issue onto China and include China into their strategy toward Pyongyang,\" it said . \"But that way, China and North Korea will become enemies, further complicating the conflict. The North Korean nuclear issue is caused by Washington-Pyongyang confrontation, to which China has no obligation to shoulder all the responsibilities.\" Wang also said that he hoped the US would examine its plans to defuse tensions, although Tillerson has already dismissed the proposal that the US should drop joint military exercises with South Korea as a show of good faith to Pyongyang. He said Friday that Washington did \"not believe that conditions are right to engage in any talks at this time.\" However, on Saturday Tillerson didn't rule out negotations altogether: He said he would work with China to \"bring North Korea to a different place where we are hopeful we can begin a dialogue.\" RELATED: Tillerson only allows Fox News to cover meeting at DMZ Summit preparations Tillerson is also in Beijing to iron out the details of a tentative Florida summit scheduled in April between Trump and China's President. It would be the first meeting between the two men, in what many argue is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. Despite fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail and prior to his inauguration, Trump and his administration have taken a relatively hands off approach to China so far. Tillerson's visit has the potential to set the tone for the relationship. OPINION: Why Trump should strike a deal on North Korea Trump has not followed through on campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator or impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. He also endorsed the \"One China\" policy, which has governed relations between the US, China and Taiwan for decades, after questioning its legitimacy shortly after his election. Tillerson also will likely raise Beijing's build-up in the South China Sea. At his confirmation hearing, Tillerson suggested Beijing should be denied access to the artificial islands it's built in the disputed waters. North Korea to loom over Tillerson's first Asia trip",

        "Text": "The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency is reporting that the first batch of \"gunmen and their families\" are leaving the city's Al-Waer neighborhood. Al-Waer was the last opposition pocket in the city of Homs, and this signifies the end of another rebel enclave that has endured some of the worst bombardment and attacks. Known as \"reconciliation agreements,\" this is one of the Syrian government's local pacts that allow surrendering civilians and fighters to evacuate to other rebel-held regions. The initiatives are designed to help put an end to the country's long-running civil war and reestablish stability in what were war zones. Critics and opposition have described this as forcible displacement that is part of what they call the government's \"starve or surrender,\" where rebel-held areas are besieged and bombarded until deals like this are reached. In recent weeks, there have been reports of intensive bombardment of the area. Russian supervision The Syrian Arab Red Crescent, along with Russian and Syrian officials are supervising the Al-Waer evacuation. The Al-Waer reconciliation agreement was reached last week, state media said. Russia is an ally of Syria's Bashar al-Assad regime. The Homs Media Center, an activist group, is reporting that 2,000 residents including 400 rebel fighters have left Al-Waer and are heading to Jarablus in the Aleppo countryside. Sources with the monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say at least 10 buses entered the neighborhood. The reconciliation agreement comes as Syria enters the seventh war of its conflict and as the capital of Damascus endured deadly attacks in recent days, one at a courthouse and another targeting Iraqi Shiite pilgrims near a historic cemetery.",

        "Text": "Baratov, who has been indicted by a US grand jury in connection with a massive hack of Yahoo information, just last month wrote on Facebook that, while a teen, he managed to make lemonade out of lemons. Baratov wrote he was suspended from high school for \"threatening to kill my ex-friend as a joke.\" \"At first, I felt really upset as I have never got into trouble before,\" he wrote. \"But the time off allowed me to work on my online projects 24/7, and really move(d) my business to the next level.\" Baratov's social media showed a thrill seeker finding ways to entertain himself in the posh community of Ancaster, about an hour outside of Toronto. The Kazakh native describes being able to afford a BMW 7 Series while still in high school and to pay off the mortgage on his first house. \"By the time my suspension was done, I changed my whole life plan!\" wrote Baratov, now 22. It's unclear, though, the exact nature of Baratov's online work. Amedeo DiCarlo, a Toronto attorney, referred to his client as an \"entrepreneur.\" He wouldn't elaborate on the kind of work Baratov did, or how he was able to afford his lavish lifestyle. But federal prosecutors in Northern California have laid out how they believe the Canadian made at least some of his money. They say he was a hacker who worked with three other people -- including two Russian intelligence officers -- to get names, email addresses and passwords from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts. That allegedly helped them to gain access to accounts from other Internet companies, such as Google. DiCarlo maintains his client is innocent. A very public persona Baratov's Facebook and Instagram accounts have been made private since he was arrested by Canadian authorities on Wednesday. Postings on the accounts viewed before then show him posing with luxury cars, including an Aston Martin, in front of his home. The house, worth an estimated USD $700,000, is now listed for sale. Neighbors say they believe he lived there alone. His attorney concedes that Baratov \"was not a secretive person -- everything was open to the public.\" There are dozens of videos detailing Baratov's love for luxury and adrenaline on his YouTube page. One shows his cerulean Lamborghini Gallardo doing donuts on a snow-covered field at a park near his home. Other videos show point-of-view shots of him speeding his luxury cars through upscale neighborhoods. 'An attack by the US government' Authorities argue the four defendants should forfeit certain belongings if they are convicted. The forfeiture allegations cite a black Mercedes and a gray Aston Martin that has a license tag reading \"MR KARIM.\" The indictment, issued late last month, lists four charges against Baratov, including conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse and aggravated identity theft. He appeared briefly in Canadian court on Friday. A bail hearing is scheduled for April 5. US authorities claim the hack was initiated in January 2014. Some of the stolen information was used to \"obtain unauthorized access to the contents of accounts at Yahoo, Google and other webmail providers, including accounts of Russian journalists, US and Russian government officials and private-sector employees of financial, transportation and other companies,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. Baratov was paid a bounty to access a target's email account at other service providers, the indictment claims. He allegedly focused on Google accounts, including of a few officials within various parts of the Russian government. DiCarlo said he is in a \"political uphill battle\" to keep Baratov from being extradited to the United States. Baratov has not been charged with any crimes in Canada. \"This is an attack by the US government. It's a challenge by the US government,\" DiCarlo told journalists after the hearing in Hamilton. A search of domains registered to a Karim Baratov yields multiple sites, including one advertising \"email hacking on demand.\" The domain registrations include an Ontario area code and an email address that features aliases Baratov allegedly used, according to the indictment: \"Kay\" and \"Taloverov.\" DiCarlo would not directly respond to questions about those websites, saying only, \"Everything you've heard up to now has been unfounded.\" Tossing dollars to trick-or-treaters While Facebook and Instagram accounts show Baratov enjoying riches, accounts from friends and neighbors show he didn't just flaunt wealth, but shared it. One fellow auto enthusiast, who would go by only \"Dillon,\" owns an auto body shop called Autokloak that Baratov frequented. He calls Baratov \"generous.\" \"He is very polite, respected everybody, paid for a lot of people's outings,\" Dillon told CNN. Silvia, who lives around the corner from Baratov and would not give her last name, said that last Halloween, her grandson had gone trick-or-treating with a group of friends to Baratov's house. The young man answered the door and threw handfuls of American dollars at the children. \"He was throwing it on the street, 'Take it, take it, get off my property, take it!'\" Silvia, 66, said. \"It was windy and money was flying. It was weird. Why would somebody give money out, like throwing money out?\" Other posts show Baratov out with friends. In one YouTube video posted to Baratov's \"Mr Karim\" account in February 2016, Baratov is seen sitting at a restaurant table, telling a friend to record, as he grabs a knife from the table, nimbly stabbing it between the fingers spread out on his left hand. \"Is this a game that you've practiced?\" the friend who is recording asks. \"No,\" he responds. They laugh as he finishes the feat without injury.",

        "Text": "Prosecutors in Kiev said they have made seven separate appeals over the past two years for help in questioning President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, including letters to FBI Director James Comey and US Justice Department officials. Ukrainian officials said the US has not responded to those requests. Under a \"mutual legal assistance\" treaty, the two countries have agreed to regularly assist each other in law enforcement efforts, such as gathering statements and other evidence for prosecutions. US authorities confirmed to CNN that the requests were received but declined further comment. Manafort served as Trump's campaign chief until being pushed out in August 2016. The official requests from a special prosecution unit in Kiev started in December 2014, and involve a corruption case targeting Ukraine's former Justice Minister Oleksandr Lavrynovych. Manafort has not been charged with a crime. Prosecutors want him to testify, Ukraine's prosecutor for special investigations Serhiy Gorbatyuk said. Prosecutors allege that Lavrynovych illegally diverted more than $1 million in government funds to a prominent New York City law firm \"?Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Lavrynovych had hired Skadden to review the 2011 jailing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who had received a seven-year sentence for allegedly harming Ukraine's interests in gas supply negotiations with Russia. Tymoshenko was the main political rival of the Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort advised until Yanukovych was deposed in 2014. Tymoshenko was released from jail at the same time that Yanukovych was ousted. Many saw her sentencing as politically motivated by the pro-Russian government. In 2012, as a result of the sentencing, Ukraine faced the possibility of an unfavorable ruling from the European Court of Human Rights, and US lawmakers were considering sanctions. In response to the deteriorating international climate, Ukrainian prosecutors say, Manafort drafted a public relations strategy that included hiring Skadden to review the Tymoshenko case and show the conviction had a sound legal basis. But a spokeswoman for the US State Department in 2012 said the report Skadden eventually came out with \"was incomplete and doesn't give an accurate picture.\" Prosecutors told CNN that Ukraine's Justice Ministry had signed an agreement with Skadden to provide legal services for the equivalent of only $12,000, the legal limit above which it would have been necessary to hold a public competition to award a government contracting job. Prosecutors provided CNN with the details of a bank transfer that took place on May 30, 2013 to a Citibank account allegedly belonging to Skadden from a Justice Ministry bank account. The document shows the ministry wired Skadden more than $1 million -- $1,075,381.41. It is this payment that prosecutors charge was a misappropriation of government funds. \"We believe they wanted to avoid the time consuming competition they would have had to organize to hire the law firm legally, so they drew up the undervalued contract and probably arranged to pay the real fee in cash,\" Gorbatyuk told CNN, speaking in Russian. However, when Tymoshenko's legal team publicly pointed out that the government could not have secured Skadden's services for just $12,000, Skadden asked Ukrainian officials to draw up a second contract that reflected a more realistic fee, prosecutors allege. Asked to comment on its involvement in the matter, Skadden released a statement to CNN: \"We have been and will continue cooperating with appropriate requests.\" Members of Gorbatyuk's office showed CNN a record of seven separate occasions when they asked the US authorities for help. The first letter was sent in December 2014 to the US Justice Department's Office of International Affairs, and was a request to question Skadden partner Gregory Craig, who also served as a White House counsel in the Obama administration. In December 2015, Gorbatyuk's office sent another letter to the Department of Justice asking to question Manafort. The trigger for the request was two emails prosecutors found. The contents of those emails were provided to CNN: One between Craig and Manafort where Craig asked Manafort to help secure paperwork from Ukraine needed for Skadden's report, and another between a Skadden employee and a Ukrainian official that mentioned Manafort's presence at a meeting with the Justice Minister. Prosecutors also showed CNN documentation they sent to the DOJ in which they told the US authorities that their investigation had \"established that the well--known American political strategist Paul Manafort is implicated in the relationship between the Skadden Arps. firm and the Justice Ministry of Ukraine.\" Of Manafort, the letter said he \"was likely the person who advised representatives of the former Government of Ukraine to hire the law firm and was present during talks about this issue.\" Manafort declined to provide comment for this story. The final letter was dated September 2016: Ukraine's Prosecutor General, the equivalent of a US Attorney General, sent a letter directly to FBI director James Comey asking for clarification for why the US authorities would not help. Related: Ukraine lawyer seeks probe of alleged hacked texts of Manafort's daughter Some of the attempts to question Manafort coincided with a time period when the FBI grappled with the issue of whether to subpoena Manafort in its separate investigation surrounding his business dealings in Ukraine, last summer. Comey has faced criticism for taking a different approach on legal matters relating to the Hillary Clinton campaign after he controversially sent a letter to Congress announcing the FBI's renewed interest in her use of a personal server during her time as Secretary of State just 11 days before the election. Manafort currently faces an FBI investigation over millions of dollars' worth of payments he allegedly received while working for Yanukovych. Manafort has denied those claims.",

        "Text": "Those are among the requirements for the US-Mexico border wall released by the federal government late Friday, kicking off a bidding process that will lead to one of the largest government construction projects in US history. \"The wall design shall be physically imposing in height,\" Customs and Border Protection outlined in the notice for contractors. That means 30 feet tall, although the officials wrote that \"designs with heights of at least 18 feet may be acceptable.\" The wall must also be impossible to climb without a ladder, and should make it difficult to use \"common and more sophisticated climbing aids,\" like grappling hooks. In addition, the wall must resist attempts to penetrate through or under it. The request specifically mentions it must successfully endure for at least 30 minutes -- but ideally more than four hours -- attempts to bore through it with a \"sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools.\" Among the requirements is that the wall be \"aesthetically pleasing in color\" and blend into or match the surrounding landscape on the US side. It does not address the aesthetics of the Mexican side. After initially saying the wall should be made of concrete, the government widened its call and said it would consider \"other designs.\" On Friday, it suggested non-concrete designs \"may not be entirely solid\" and could feature \"a see-through component\" so the border patrol would have \"situational awareness\" of the Mexican side. The specifications leave nearly all of the design work to interested bidders, who now have about two weeks to develop and submit their plans, known as proposals. A federal contracting expert told CNN this approach is common when the government knows generally what it wants, but is interested in seeing different ideas to accomplish the goals. It will select from those proposals several 30-foot-long prototypes to be built. Each prototype is expected to cost between $200,000 and $500,000, the government notice said. Companies will also build smaller 10-foot models for penetration tests. The prototypes will be used to decide upon a design for the wall that ultimately is constructed along the border. The wall -- and having Mexico pay for it -- was a central promise President Donald Trump made on the campaign trail. The government's proposal reflects many of his campaign promises, including that the wall be tall and \"beautiful.\" It also includes a provision that contractors use American materials whenever possible. Friday's release did not address the overall cost of the wall. Various estimates have put the project at between $10 billion and $25 billion. Trump's recent budget proposal requested $1 billion to begin the process. In recent weeks, hundreds of companies indicated interest in the project. One construction contracting expert told CNN, however, that there are only a handful of construction firms with the size, capability and experience to handle such a large-scale contract. The expert pointed to federal requirements that contractors set aside substantial amounts of money as a guarantee that the project is completed satisfactorily. As is standard with government contracts, a secretive selection committee will evaluate the proposals based on the merits of the design and the contractors' ability to complete the job. The committee will select up to 20 plans to move to the next phase, where contractors detail how much their plans will cost and answer other questions. Multiple contracts to build wall prototypes will then be issued, the government has said. It hinted that bidding may be reopened in the future, saying the current process \"is not intended as the vehicle for the procurement of the total wall solution for the border with Mexico.\"",

        "Text": "The statement from the Secret Service came after a source told CNN earlier Friday about the length of the incident and the agency's resulting investigation. In its statement Friday afternoon, the Secret Service offered some information about the incident and said the \"investigation is ongoing,\" so far including more than 50 interviews and a review of radio transmissions and video footage. The review found that the intruder climbed a five-foot fence and an eight-foot gate and then hopped a three-and-a-half foot fence while Secret Service members struggled to locate him. House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that the intruder even managed to rattle a door handle at the South Portico entrance to the White House, although he did not make it inside. \"That's why we spend billions of dollars on personnel and dogs and technologies and fences and undercover people and video surveillance,\" the Utah Republican said. \"And yet the person is able to get up close to the White House and spend 17 minutes before he's apprehended. That's unbelievable.\" The Secret Service statement added that \"immediate steps\" had been taken, including \"additional posts, technology enhancements, and response protocols.\" \"The men and women of the Secret Service are extremely disappointed and angry in how the events of March 10 transpired,\" the statement said. The source explained to CNN earlier Friday that the intruder, Jonathan Tran, set off several alarms, but was able to avoid other sensors. The source said \"the response to the alarm was lacking, and found (the suspect) vulnerabilities in the system.\" They say the 26-year-old California man carrying a backpack jumped multiple fences at the White House complex and set off multiple alarm sensors before he was discovered just steps from a main door to the mansion. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter Friday to the acting director of the Secret Service, saying his committee is now investigating the incident. He said his committee has learned of these additional allegations that weren't in the original affidavit, including triggered alarms that were ignored and that the suspect \"may have moved around on the White House grounds undetected for a considerable amount of time.\" Chaffetz wrote that the suspect also \"may have attempted entry into the building.\" \"If true, these allegations raise questions about whether the agency's security protocols are adequate,\" he wrote. Chaffetz asked William Callahan, the acting director, to provide documents and video related to the incident and to brief the committee on Monday at 5 p.m. ET. A Secret Service source tells CNN that Tran was observed looming around Pennsylvania Avenue as early as 6 p.m. almost six hours before he was arrested on the White House grounds. Video surveillance footage shows Tran, the accused jumper, first jumping a fence in the Northwest corner of the Treasury Building, immediately adjacent to the White House. Tran activated a sensor alarm in the Treasury Moat, the source said. Secret Service officers responded to the alarm, but Tran had already snuck beyond one Secret Service post and moved closer to the White House when an officer came to investigate. The source believes Tran then crossed over the East Executive Drive and jumped the White House gate near an East Wing guard post that is not routinely staffed. The source said Tran activated an alarm sensor, but was hiding behind a pillar of the East Wing entrance. The source said Tran then jumped a low wall before traversing along East Wing. Several sensors went off, but it is unclear if they were properly investigated. A variety of detection systems ring the White House complex in overlapping zones. The systems primarily rely on infrared and microwave technology, but can be subject to malfunction or false activation. The incident happened just before midnight on the night of March 10 while President Donald Trump was at the White House. RELATED: Intruder breaches White House grounds, arrested near residence entrance The President was alerted about the intrusion late Friday night, an administration official said. Trump said last Saturday that the suspect was disturbed, calling the situation \"sad\" and saying he appreciates the work of the Secret Service. \"The service did a fantastic job,\" the President said to reporters during a lunch meeting with Cabinet officials at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia. \"It was a troubled person. It was very sad.\"",

        "Text": "Xi told Tillerson that there are far more shared interests between the two countries than disputes, emphasizing the need for more communication and coordination on matters involving \"regional hotspots,\" according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry. The meeting occurred hours after North Korea claimed success in testing a new type of rocket engine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a successful test of a high-thrust engine, state-run KCNA reported early Sunday, saying the event had \"historic significance\" that could lead to the \"new birth\" of the country's indigenous rocket industry. Beijing was Tillerson's final stop on his first official trip to Asia, which also included visits to Japan and South Korea. The trip followed a string of North Korean missile launches, escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and prompting fears that Pyongyang is preparing for another nuclear test. North Korea's only ally China is Pyongyang's only major global ally, with bilateral trade accounting for 70% of North Korea's total of the country's trade, providing a political and economic lifeline to Kim's increasingly isolated regime. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on Beijing to use its leverage over its unpredictable neighbor. He singled out China again Friday, tweeting, \"North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!\" Despite earlier warning that all options -- including military action -- remained on the table in dealing with Pyongyang, Tillerson refrained from the harsh language that he had used in Tokyo and Seoul upon arriving in Beijing. After meeting his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minster Wang Yi, on Saturday, the top US diplomat stressed \"renewed determination\" by Beijing and Washington to \"work together to convince the North Korean government to choose a better path and a different future for its people\" -- without giving details. Although neither side brought up the subject publicly, Tillerson was expected to raise the prospect of financial penalties on Chinese companies and banks that do business with North Korea. \"The Trump administration is banking that threats of US military action in South Korea and tougher sanctions on Chinese entities will intimidate Beijing into changing its policies,\" said Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney.

Tillerson was also in Beijing to iron out the details of a tentative summit between Presidents Trump and Xi in Florida in April. It would be the first meeting between the two men, whose interactions would affect what many consider the world's most important diplomatic relationship. The Chinese foreign ministry statement quoted Tillerson as saying that Trump expected the two leaders to meet \"as soon as possible\" but did not confirm the April summit. Xi also invited Trump to visit China, it added. Despite fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail and prior to his inauguration, Trump and his administration have taken a relatively hands-off approach to China so far. Trump has not followed through on campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator or impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. He also endorsed the \"One China\" policy, which has governed delicate relations between the United States, China and Taiwan for decades -- after questioning its legitimacy shortly after his election.",

        "Text": "He said: \"Let me be very clear: the policy of strategic patience has ended.\" Tillerson also eliminated the possibility of negotiating with North Korea before it has \"given up its weapons of mass destruction,\" and did not rule out military action if the US believes Pyongyang's weapons program advances too far. Tillerson's statements are not as radical as they seem, but there is still no visible coherent strategy for the region. \"Strategic patience\" was the Obama-era policy toward North Korea. \"Strategic patience\" seems similar to \"doing nothing,\" but that is only true in a vacuum. Obama clearly supported the US alliance with South Korea, supported the free trade agreement with South Korea, and approved the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system that got underway last week. In the new Trump era, when the President devalues the US-South Korea alliance, the Obama policy looks much more sound. There is no chance that North Korea will eliminate its nuclear program as a precondition to negotiations. Tillerson must know this, and so he is ending the possibility of negotiations. This is also not an unreasonable proposition. North Korea is not going to give up its nuclear weapons -- it is the only thing that keeps the regime alive. The nuclear program is even more important than the relationship with China. But even if North Korea did agree to give up its weapons, it would take an almost unimaginably intrusive inspections regime to insure that Pyongyang did not violate its obligations. Critics may say that people said the same thing about Iran, but the situation is different for two key reasons. First, despite what you may read, the Iranian government cares about its own people. Second, Iran wanted to rejoin the international community, while North Korea prefers to hide from it. Tillerson's statement about a preemptive strike on North Korea presents another bad alternative. It once again calls into question America's commitment to its alliances. The implication is that Pyongyang's ability to reach American targets is unacceptable; but it can already strike South Korea, which we are obligated to defend.  The time for a preemptive strike ended when North Korea detonated its first nuclear device. Even if the US could guarantee the simultaneous and immediate destruction of every nuclear weapon in North Korea, there are still tens of thousands of artillery shells pointed at Seoul. It is not possible for South Korea and American forces to escape a conflict with North Korea unscathed. From the outside, it does not look like there is an American policy on North Korea. \"All options are on the table\" is a normal diplomatic statement and there are two important questions that are still unanswered. First, how well is the inter-agency process functioning? Are Tillerson's remarks part of a well-conceived -- or even poorly-conceived -- foreign policy toward North Korea? Has that policy been debated and discussed among North Korea experts at the State Department, Defense Department, CIA, and other agencies, and filtered through the interagency process at the National Security Council? That so many positions in all of these agencies remain unfilled suggests no -- as do Trump's previous statements that he would speak to Kim Jong Un, and his claims that \"there's a 10% or 20% chance\" he \"could talk him out of having his damn nukes.\" But perhaps even more important is this: Does Tillerson speak for Trump? That, unlike Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon, he has not been present at key meetings with foreign leaders, suggests that he is not necessarily \"in the loop.\" Tillerson's statement in Seoul might have been more meaningful if it had come from someone else -- or perhaps even in a tweet from the President. The Korean Peninsula is the site of a tremendous amount of upheaval. South Korea's next president may favor talks and greater economic integration with North Korea. Tillerson's visit is also set against the backdrop of THAAD deployment, which has resulted in Chinese economic retaliation against South Korea. Tillerson's next stop is Beijing, where he will no doubt seek China's help in reining in North Korea. But what incentive does China have to help an administration set on antagonizing it at every turn?",

        "Text": "Here's why: There was no category that could safely contain it. It charted No. 1 on the rhythm and blues charts, which was where most black recording artists such as Berry could be found. But its beat and its sensibility were just as deeply rooted in the predominantly white traditions of country blues and western swing. Though it was de rigueur in Jim Crow's waning days for white artists to \"cover\" African-American artists' hits, \"Maybellene\" crossed so many barriers that it all but obliterated them -- or, anyway, made them less imposing. How, exactly, could anybody \"cover\" this? It was too big to cover; big enough, even in its two-minutes-and-spare-change length to contain multitudes, embrace generations, swallow continents and change the world. It was, in short, rock and roll. And Chuck Berry was its chief designer, its master engineer and -- argue all you want but the available evidence overwhelms -- one of its inventors, if not THE inventor. Berry's death at 90 was announced Saturday. Of rock 'n' roll's founding big daddies raising the temperature of simmering, static culture of the 1950s to full boil, Fats Domino, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis -- a comparably improbable survivor -- now remain among the living. Probably it's as good a place as any to note that while touring with at an early rock-star revue, Lewis was so incensed that Berry was chosen over him to close a show that he gave a climactic set literally incendiary enough to end with him setting his piano on fire. As Lewis stormed off, smelling of lighter fluid and smoke, he passed by Berry and snarled sotto voce, \"Top that (expletive deleted)!\" And, as Lewis reportedly said later, \"He damn near did, too!\" I'm betting he did more than that because Berry in person was, well into senior citizenship, as compelling and galvanic as Berry on record. Berry didn't need pyrotechnics to send his audiences into the ozone. The duck walk, his inimitable stage move, was more than enough. Well, that ... and his guitar. Rolling Stone magazine once declared that rock guitar began with Berry and, once again, it's not hard to make the case. Berry's licks and riffs, fluid, supple and multi-tiered, remain electrifying enough to empower wave upon wave of guitarists seeking more blues in their rhythms and more rhythms. He was one of those artists who may have been singular when they broke through, but whose influence can be heard in every guitarist who followed. (Start wherever you want -- \"I'll take Keith Richards for $5,000, Alex!\" -- but the list of Berry's acolytes that follows stretches through presidencies, wars and recessions.) Finally, there are the songs, especially those \"great twenty-eight\" Berry recorded for Chess in the 1950s and early 1960s. They were so much more than catchy slices of pop that tickled wherever your musical dopamine was buried. \"Roll Over, Beethoven,\" \"Back in the U.S.A.,\" \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"You Never Can Tell,\" \"I'm Talking About You,\" \"School Days,\" \"Promised Land\" and on and on and ever onward. These and many others conveyed adventure, mischief, fun and, most of all, endless possibility in their titles alone. Those titles invited you in. The songs carried you as far as you wanted or dared to go. And you could hear every single lyric roar, spin and take curves into your head like Berry's fiery red Cadillac that you can now see in the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. As much as the thing he invented or, at least, helped invent, Chuck Berry delivered us from the days of old, remaining an American original to the very end. The problem with originals is that they come, like 45-RPM records, in singles. The best the rest of us can do is use his contraptions to power our own journeys to ecstatic reckoning. Go!",

        "Text": "Rodney James Hess, 36, of New Orleans was streaming on Facebook Live when he was shot Thursday afternoon, his family said in their own Facebook posting. Rodney Hess' video does not show the officers shooting and his relatives asked any witnesses to come forward. Hess was shot after Crockett County sheriff's deputies approached his sport utility vehicle because it was parked at a perpendicular angle along Highway 412 near the west Tennessee town of Alamo, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said in a statement. Officers reported that Hess refused officer commands, made erratic statements and tried to strike officers at least twice with his vehicle, DeVine said. \"During the escalation of events, at least one Crockett County deputy fired his service weapon through the front windshield of the vehicle driven by Hess, striking him,\" DeVine said. \"At this time, we do not believe Hess used a firearm in connection to this incident.\" Hess' video shows officers standing near the car and he can be heard saying, \"I would like the higher commands to come out.\" The video image became jerky and captured sounds of a commotion and a loud, sharp sound, followed by a man screaming. The video showed the interior of a vehicle and passing scenery until a crashing sound occurs. Hess drove for a distance after being shot and wrecked his vehicle, CNN affiliate WHBQ reported. The video ended with an image of broken glass and the the sound of a woman's voice, apparently coming from a phone. Hess family attorney Don Rouzan said Hess was asking to speak with a ranking officer when he used the phrase \"higher commands.\" Hess was not acting aggressively or raising his voice, Rouzan said. \"At the time there was no threat,\" Rouzan said. \"He was asking for a supervising officer and they opened fire.\" Hess died after being airlifted to a hospital in Memphis, about 80 miles southwest of Alamo. No law enforcement officers were hurt and the officers involved are not being identified, the TBI statement said. Hess' relatives went on Facebook to ask any witnesses to come forward. \"We're just praying that justice will be served and that if there's anything covered up that it will be brought to justice, that it wouldn't be just another black man shot by police officers,\" said Lee Smith, Rodney Hess' grandfather. \"All we're asking for is justice.\" Hess was the father to three children, ages 14, 3 and 18 months, Rouzan said. Rouzan said Hess grew up in the Memphis area not far from where he was killed. He'd been living in Texas and New Orleans and was traveling to Memphis, probably to visit family, when the shooting occurred, Rouzan said. TBI agents and forensic scientists will gather evidence and present it to the district attorney general, DeVine's statement said. Dash cam and body camera footage was obtained, he said. Agents are trying to determine the timeline of events. \"In this and all investigations, the TBI acts only as fact-finders,\" DeVine said. \"The decision as to whether the deputy's actions were justified rests solely with the district attorney general.\" Facebook livestreaming was a factor in the police shooting of a civilian in Minnesota in July last year. Philando Castile was fatally shot by St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop. Castile's fiancee livestreamed the immediate aftermath of the shooting. That officer has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter charges.",

        "Text": "On cue, teachers and students drop to the ground and wait for further instructions. \"This is a drill,\" a voice echoes over a loudspeaker across this small coastal town. \"A missile has been launched.\" Moments later, the entire school body runs from the athletic field into the school gym. They are joined by elderly volunteers, who line up in rows next to the children seated quietly on the wooden floor. This is Japan's first evacuation exercise preparing for the scenario of a North Korean missile attack against this country. \"A missile fell about 20 kilometers off the coast of Oga inside territorial waters,\" says another loudspeaker announcement. \"The damage is still unknown so please remain sheltered inside the gym.\" At the completion of the drill, a government official thanks participants in the gym, while carefully avoiding specific mention of North Korea. \"The government is doing its best to be amicable to the countries so that the country would not shoot a missile,\" says chief Cabinet counselor Atsushi Odani. \"If they shoot a missile, self defense forces will try to shoot them down,\" he adds, referring to the Japanese armed forces. Defense systems in place Japan is not entirely defenseless when it comes to ballistic missile threats. Earlier this month, guided missile destroyers from the US, Japan and South Korea participated in trilateral naval exercises focused on improving missile defense. The warships employ the Aegis missile defense system that is aimed at early detection of missile threats. Those ships can also fire interceptors to strike the ballistic missile early in its flight, or send tracking data to ships farther along the ballistic missile's flight path, so it can be destroyed when it's near its highest point. However, Japan and its close military allies the US and South Korea were unable to stop North Korea from launching four ballistic missiles earlier this month. Tokyo says three of the four missiles launched from North Korea on March 6 landed in the sea less than 200 nautical miles (around 370 kilometers) from Oga, which juts out on a peninsula from Japans' western coast. Despite United Nations' resolutions prohibiting North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology, in 2016 Pyongyang conducted at least two nuclear tests and fired more than a dozen missiles. In this sleepy fishing port, locals are waking up to the growing threat from across the sea. \"It's scary,\" says Zen-ei Nishikata, as he hauls sacks of freshly-caught, squirming octopus into a fish-packing plant next to the docks. \"You never know what the North Koreans might do next.\" Memories of sirens For some here in Oga, the missile evacuation drill brought back painful memories. \"During World War II, we hid in air raid shelters wearing masks when we heard the sirens,\" said Reinosuke Ishigaki, an 89-year old resident who helped coordinate the town's disaster preparation. \"If a war breaks out with North Korea, Japan will be targeted,\" he adds. \"And they have their finger on the nuclear button.\" The principal of Oga's elementary school argues the missile evacuation drill provided his students with a valuable lesson. \"They're still young, but the closer they get to 6th grade, the more they start to understanding what country we're talking about with this missile exercise,\" Shin Kikuchi says. \"The potential threat from a missile is beyond imagination.\" He speaks in a hallway of the school that is decorated with fearsome masks. They represent the namahage, a mythical ogre that is a community mascot on the Oga peninsula. It is a local tradition here on New Year's Eve for actors to dress up in frightening straw costumes and these fanged masks, to scare children straight. But as North Korea's ballistic missile program grows more sophisticated, residents now have something far more than frightening fairy tales to keep them awake at night.",

        "Text": "Speaking on Israel public radio Sunday morning, Liberman said, \"The next time the Syrians use their air defense systems against our airplanes, we will destroy all of them without thinking twice.\" His threat comes after Syria fired anti-aircraft missiles at Israeli military jets overnight Thursday into Friday. The Syrian military said the jets struck a military site near Palmyra, while Israel says they targeted a weapons shipment to Iran-backed Hezbollah. Syria claims their missiles downed one Israeli jet and hit another, which Israel rejected as \"absolutely untrue.\" \"Our central problem, and this above and beyond all of the other issues, is the transfer of advanced weapons from Syria to Lebanon,\" Liberman said. \"Every time we identify a transfer like this, we will work to prevent the transfer of game-changing weapons. On this issue there will not be any compromise,\" the outspoken Defense Minister added. Liberman has not shied away from threatening rhetoric since taking over the Defense Ministry last year. Rising tensions Friday's encounter was the most serious clash between Israel and Syria since the start of the Syrian civil war six years ago. Tension between the two countries de-escalated as the conflict progressed, but the threats have increased between the two countries in recent months., along with Israel's reported strikes. An airstrike near Palmyra would be one of the deepest inside Syria since the beginning of the fighting. The military actions did not go unnoticed both in the Middle East and further afield. In a sign of Russia's displeasure with the strike, Moscow summoned Israel's ambassador to Russia, Gary Koren, less than 24 hours after it happened. It is the first time in recent years that Moscow has summoned Israel's envoy over a strike in Syria, and it comes one week after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Russian President Vladimir Putin to reaffirm coordination between the Israeli and Russian militaries over Syria. The two countries established coordination last year to avoid conflicts in Syrian airspace, ostensibly to allow both countries to operate freely. Palmyra, once held by ISIS and retaken by the Syrian government, is strategically important to both the regime and its opponents. The intercept triggered alarm sirens in the Jordan Valley and shrapnel from the explosion, which was heard as far south as Jerusalem, landed in western Jordan, the Jordanian military said. Most of Israel's reported strikes have been around the Syrian capital of Damascus, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967. Weapons Israel has long focused on stopping the transfer of weapons from Syria to terror groups. In December, Liberman told a delegation of European Union envoys that Israel will \"prevent the smuggling of sophisticated weapons, military equipment and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah.\" It was another acknowledgment of Israel's ongoing operations in Syria. Last April, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel had struck Syria \"dozens of times,\" breaking with the policy of remaining quiet about involvement in its war-torn northern neighbor. In a video statement released Friday, Netanyahu was adamant in his defense of Israel's move to prevent weapons being supplied to Hezbollah. \"When we identify attempts to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah and we have intelligence and it is operationally feasible, we act to prevent it,\" he said. \"That's how it was yesterday and that's how we shall continue to act,\" he added. \"We are fully determined and the evidence of that is that we are acting. Everybody must take that into account -- everybody.\" Hezbollah Hezbollah is a Lebanese militant group and political party, funded and supplied by Iran. The group is at odds with Israel over territory located along the Lebanon-Israel border. It also supports the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, committing thousands of fighters to battle alongside Assad's forces. The United States, Israel, and the Arab League consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization while the European Union classifies Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group. As recently as late February, Syrian media reported that Israeli jets hit military positions and weapons convoys near Damascus. In November 2012, Israel fired warning shots toward Syria after a mortar shell hit an Israeli military post, the first time Israel had fired on Syria across the Golan Heights since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Israeli jets have been hitting targets in Syria since at least 2013, when US officials told CNN they believed IDF jets had struck inside Syrian territory. In 2014, the Syrian government and an opposition group both said an IDF strike had hit Damascus' suburbs and airport. Israeli strikes have also gone after ISIS fighters inside Syria. Late last year, IDF troops operating in the disputed Golan region came under fire from militants of the ISIS affiliate Khalid ibn al-Walid Army, Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. The soldiers fired back, triggering an exchange of gunfire. A subsequent Israeli airstrike destroyed a vehicle carrying four militants, Lerner said.",

        "Text": "A president's golf play is far from controversial: In fact, it's the most common pastime of the country's leaders. But before he ran for office, Trump was the most fervent critic of the fact that President Barack Obama regularly hit the links with friends, aides and advisers, arguing that it showed the president was unserious about fixing America's problems. Now that Trump is President, the comments are coming back to complicate his golf habit. Trump has visited the two courses near his Mar-a-Lago estate -- Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Course in Jupiter -- 10 times in the first two months of his presidency. Trump's top aides would rather obscure that fact, especially considering the President's past comments about the sport and the White House. \"I'm going to be working for you; I'm not going to have time to go play golf,\" Trump said during a 2016 event in Virginia. For the most part, aides have declined to confirm that Trump was playing golf on weekends in Florida, instead repeatedly telling reporters that the President \"may\" hit a few balls at his course but that they didn't know for sure. On multiple occasions, though, Trump's games have been made public. CNN has seen Trump golfing -- driving up the 12th hole on his championship course at Trump International Golf Course -- multiple times during the former reality star's first two months in office. It has also been revealed -- through golf blogs and media reports -- that Trump has played with top professional golfers such as Rory McIlroy, one of the top-ranked golfers in the world. While hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Palm Beach last month, Trump also played a full round with the foreign leader and professional golfer Ernie Els. Trump's preferred course by far is the one closest to his Florida home: Trump International Golf Club. He has visited the course all 10 times he has golfed since becoming President. Only one time -- while hosting Abe -- did the President also visit Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter. Trump also visited his course in Sterling, Virginia, on March 11 for a meeting. It is unclear whether he played. Trump made critiquing Obama for golfing a part of his 2016 message. \"I love golf, I think it's one of the greats, but I don't have time,\" then-President-elect Trump said during a December 2016 rally in Michigan. \"He played more golf last year than Tiger Woods. We don't have time for this. We don't have time for this. We have to work.\" And before he ran for president, Trump would tweet about Obama's golfing. \"Can you believe that, with all of the problems and difficulties facing the US, President Obama spent the day playing golf,\" Trump tweeted in October 2014. \"Worse than Carter.\" Now, citing the President's privacy, Trump's aides are left trying to conceal the President's frequent golfing.",

        "Text": "There is quite a bit to look out for. But five key players will determine how much bigger this story gets. 1. The enigma: James Comey Comey's \"October Surprise\" is viewed by many Democrats as hurting Clinton's electoral odds, but Comey is likely not on anybody's side. Indeed, it was reported that he was unhappy with the Trump team and the false allegations by the President that President Obama had the FBI spy on him. He will likely reaffirm what has already been confirmed by the Senate and House intelligence heads: that Trump's tweet about wiretapping has no basis in fact. But the key issue is whether he will confirm -- or punt -- a direct question about whether there is a criminal investigation into the Trump team's potential collusion with the Russians during the election. If he says yes, the political earth will shake. 2. The rock star: Sally Yates The early firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was dubbed by many as Trump's \"Monday Night Massacre.\" Trump fired Yates for refusing to carry out his first Muslim immigration ban, but perhaps the most critical legacy of Yates' brief time as acting attorney general was her warning to the White House that a top adviser in the administration, then National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, could be compromised because of ties to Russia. The White House did not do anything with the information until it was leaked to the press. What did Yates tell the White House? On Monday, she will testify and likely address this burning question. 3. The Real Housewives of the Intelligence Committee: David Nunes and Adam Schiff Committee Chairman Devin Nunes was on Trump's transition team and remains unconvinced that Russia tried to help Trump, while the top Democrat, Adam Schiff, has not pulled any punches when it comes to his criticism of the President. Schiff has also made it very clear that he plans to seek testimony from former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, the author of the unconfirmed dossier containing allegations about Trump's ties to Russia, as part of the committee's investigation. Their relationship is, in Facebook terms, complicated. When Nunes recently conceded that there was no \"there there\" about the Trump wiretap claims, it was a significant moment -- for the first time he showed some independence from a White House that had used him as their proxy. Will that independence continue? Meanwhile, Schiff has emerged as a party star and will not let Nunes run away with the questioning or focus. 4. The MIA: Michael Flynn One of the most relevant players in this inquiry will not be there. Flynn, who recently disclosed ties he had to Turkey during his work on the campaign, also received significant payments from Russia for speeches and work. We have certainly not heard the last from Gen. Flynn, and it is only a matter of time before he is called before either the House or the Senate Intelligence Committee. We also do not know if he is assisting any investigation. In the meantime, the man who won't be present at the March 20 hearing will certainly be a key topic in the testimony of others. 5. The President: Donald Trump I suspect he will be watching. His \"wiretap\" tweets have so captured our collective focus and time that it may be easy to forget just how damaging they were. But they are beside the point. The real story is Russia: its influence on our elections and what Trump knew about it. This story and this investigation will continue on a path of the slow drip, drip, drip variety; there will be no smoking gun. This is just a preliminary hearing, and there are many more to come, including the Senate Intelligence Committee review.  Few in Congress have fallen in line with the Trump administration's call to dismiss these reports as \"fake news,\" and so the longer the Russia issue drags on, the further the spin will shift away from partisan sour grapes. It will instead take the needed shape of a bipartisan demands for real answers. The President may not be ready for it.",

        "Text": "House Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Adam Schiff said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he thought \"there is circumstantial evidence of collusion\" as well as \"direct evidence\" of deception. \"We need to know whether the circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception is indicative of more,\" said Schiff, of California. Schiff's remarks are at odds with the statements of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who said two weeks ago that he had not seen any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. \"I was surprised to see Director Clapper say that because I don't think you can make that claim as categorically as he did,\" Schiff said. The congressman's comments came as his committee prepares to take testimony from FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers about the administration's investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the US election as well as any relationships between Russian officials and Trump's associates. Sen. Tom Cotton on Sunday previewed the upcoming House hearing, saying Comey's testimony would address \"unsubstantiated allegations\" of dealings between Moscow and President Donald Trump's campaign. \"I do think it's important that we look at the broader context here,\" Cotton said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" with Jake Tapper. \"The House committee hearing tomorrow is going to be in part about the unsubstantiated allegations in the media and by some Democrats of collusion between Trump associates and Russian intelligence.\" The US intelligence community has said Russia was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which it said were part of an effort to help Trump in the election. The Russian government has denied any wrongdoing. CNN and others have reported that current and former law enforcement, intelligence and administration officials have said there were communications between Trump's associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the campaign. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn resigned as Trump's national security adviser following media reports about his post-election communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. However, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that there was \"no evidence of collusion\" between Russia and the Trump campaign. In his CNN interview, Cotton cited Clapper and former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, who have both publicly stated they also have seen no evidence of any collusion. Morell, who supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, emphatically denied a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia earlier this month. \"On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire,\" Morell said. \"There's no little campfire. There's no little candle. There's no spark.\" Wiretapping claims As they took to the airwaves to offer differing opinions about the Russia matter, members of Congress almost all struck similar notes on Trump's unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower in New York during the campaign. Cotton, Nunes, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Maine Sen. Susan Collins were just some of Republicans who reiterated Sunday that they have seen no evidence Trump was correct about the accusation, which Trump and his administration have refused thus far to corroborate. On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee received a classified report from the Department of Justice about the claim, which is all but certain to come up at Monday's hearing. At the time, sources told CNN that the report would not back Trump's accusation. Nunes said Sunday that, based on his briefing with the Department of Justice, \"there never\" were physical wiretaps of Trump Tower, adding that a classified report from the department on Friday bolstered his belief that Trump was \"literally\" wrong. The California Republican also said there was \"no evidence of collusion\" between Russia and the Trump campaign. Cotton, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had not seen any evidence to back Trump's wiretap claim, but he deflected a question from Tapper on whether the President should apologize to his predecessor if Comey says evidence for the President's accusation is lacking. \"We'll see what Director Comey testifies about,\" Cotton said. Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz seemed to back Trump, at least in spirit. The Texas Republican said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Trump's accusation is \"not necessarily outlandish\" and accused the Obama administration of politically motivated behavior, citing the IRS scandal involving applications for tax-exempt status from conservative groups. But Cruz said Trump still needs to put forward the facts. \"It would be quite good for the administration to put forward what evidence there is,\" Cruz said. The armed forces Cotton, a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also touched on major military issues in the news. Regarding the influx of Marines and other service members into Syria, Cotton did not advocate for a specific policy, but said, \"I don't think we ought to set arbitrary troop caps.\" The Arkansas Republican also called for the defeat of ISIS, but said the US needs to counter Iran, whose activities he blamed, in part, for the rise of ISIS. \"If we don't roll back Iran's gains throughout the region, we're not going to have stability, and we're not going to defend US interests to the degree that we should,\" Cotton said. The senator also called the nude photo scandal in the Marine Corps, in which photographs of service members were taken and shared online without the subjects' consent, \"extremely disappointing\" and assured the public that those responsible would be identified and punished. \"I'm confident they're going to hold every Marine accountable,\" Cotton said, adding that he thought it was possible the scandal might extend beyond the Marines and could involve members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.",

        "Text": "In a statement released on Sunday, Ursula von der Leyen said \"there is no debt account in NATO. To relate the 2% defense spending that we want to reach in the next decade solely to NATO is wrong. \"The defense spending also goes to UN-peace mission, into European missions and towards our contributions to the fight against ISIS terrorism.\" Von der Leyen was responding to claims by Trump that some NATO allies owe money after not meeting defense spending targets. Germany spent 1.19% of its GDP on defense last year. Opinion: Trump's military spending won't make America safe again Trump: NATO members' spending 'very unfair' to US In a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who visited Washington last week, Trump said that he \"reiterated... strong support for NATO, as well as the need for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. \"Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years and it is very unfair to the United States,\" he said. \"These nations must pay what they owe.\" The statement is a mischaracterization of the commitments that NATO members have -- under the treaty, countries in the bloc have agreed to target a spend on defense of 2% of GDP, but do not accrue debts if they have not met these targets. Only five of the bloc's 28 members -- the US, Greece, Poland, Estonia and the UK -- meet the alliance's target, which NATO also terms a \"guideline\" in its annual report. However, \"many others\" plan to reach 2% by 2024, the report states. Trump also said that he had thanked the German leader for her commitment towards an increase in defense spending. Opinion: Donald Trump and Angela Merkel: The odd couple Twitter rant On Saturday Trump took to Twitter to confront what he characterized as media reports which reported that his summit with Merkel had gone badly. He also took the opportunity to once again push home the incorrect assertion that NATO signatory countries like Germany owe \"vast sums\" and that the US must be \"paid\" for its contribution. \"Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\" he tweeted.. \"Nevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\" Trump hits pause between a tough week and a critically important one Rebuttal Former US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder replied to the tweets with a series of twitter messages of his own, laying out how the treaty commitments really work. \"Sorry, Mr. President, that's not how NATO works,\" he tweeted. \"The US decides for itself how much it contributes to defending NATO.\" However, as Daalder also wrote in his nine-tweet explanation, \"Those who currently don't spend 2% of their GDP on defense are now increasing their defense budgets. That's a good thing.\" Europe tries to sway Trump administration views Mixed messages Before Trump took office, he rattled NATO members, when he called the organization \"obsolete\" in a joint interview with the Times of London and the German publication Bild. \"I said a long time ago that NATO had problems,\" he said in the January interview. \"Number one it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago. \"Number two the countries weren't paying what they're supposed to be paying,\" he said, adding that this was unfair to the United States. Various members of his administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, have since reiterated the US' commitment to NATO.",

        "Text": "Clashes broke out in the Syrian capital, which has not seen such attacks in months, if not years, said SOHR Director Rami Abdel Rahman. The rebel fighters began the attack from the district of Jobar in northeastern Damascus, an area split between rebel and government control. The rebel factions seem to have prepared for this offensive, Rahman said. Since the start of the conflict, the Syrian regime and allied militias have held a very tight grip on the capital. The opposition only has a few pockets of control around Damascus, including a part of Jobar. The assault was led by Islamist groups including Ahrar al-Sham and the recently formed umbrella jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that includes Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. Syrian state media reported that Syrian forces had repelled an attack by jihadist fighters, who also used tunnels to attack government positions. It was unclear if the fighting was ongoing on Sunday evening. There was no word on deaths. Sunday's assault comes after a series of suicide bombings that have hit the capital in March. On Wednesday, suicide bombings struck a courthouse and restaurant in Damascus, killing more than two dozen people and injuring others, Syrian state news said.",

        "Text": "But last year a long-standing river pact that governs how the two countries share crucial water resources came under threat as violence flared in the disputed region of Kashmir. On Monday, after a period of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, the two nations are due to come together for much-anticipated talks on the contentious Indus Water Treaty. The enormous Indus River system, which supports livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India, originates in Tibet, flowing through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan. The Indus Water Treaty dates from 1960 and governs how the fractious neighbors manage the vast volume of water, which is vital resource for both countries. However, the discussions in Islamabad come seven months after Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, suspended water talks with Pakistan. This week's discussions are expected to focus on India's plans to use the rivers to provide hydropower -- something which Pakistan has strenuously objected to. Modi announced in September he wanted to review the terms of their 57-year old water-sharing agreement -- a move some analysts interpreted as a threat to the deal. \"Blood and water cannot flow at the same time,\" Modi was quoted by his spokesperson Shri Gopal Baglay after an uptick in violence in contested Kashmir. What is the Indus Water Treaty? The treaty, which was brokered by the World Bank, stipulates that Pakistan receives water from the Indus and two of its tributaries -- the Jhelum River and the Chenab River. India has full control over the three eastern rivers -- Beas, Ravi and Sutlej -- and limited access to the Jhelum and Chenab. The agreement is hailed by experts as one of the most successful water-sharing agreements in the world. It has survived the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1965 and 1971 and numerous other standoffs between the two nations. However, recently, tensions between the nuclear neighbors have ratcheted up and the treaty's strength has once again been put to the test. Last September, armed militants entered an Indian army base in the garrison town of Uri killing 18 soldiers. The attack, which took place near the de facto border, was one of the deadliest on an army base in the region since militant attacks began in 1989. In the aftermath, tensions flared on both sides of the disputed border, with India launching what it claimed was a \"surgical attack\" across what is known as the Line of Control with Pakistan. The ripple effects were felt far and wide; India evacuated villages along the border and Pakistan temporarily blocked Indian films. Shortly after the Uri incident, Modi met with officials to review the provisions of the water treaty. At that meeting, it was said that India would exploit to the maximum the water of the Pakistan-controlled rivers it had access to -- including the Jhelum -- while staying within the boundaries of the historic agreement. Pakistan appeared to be rattled by the move and in response approached the World Bank to voice its concerns. In November, Modi reiterated India's rights over the eastern rivers, as determined by the treaty. \"This water belongs to India's farmers. That water is not coming to your farm, but is rather flowing to Pakistan and eventually to the ocean,\" Modi said. \"I am determined to bring every drop of that water back to the farmers of Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir... for India's farmers.\" Lifeblood for farming The point of the treaty, says analyst Rebecca Keller from geopolitical intelligence firm, Stratfor, is it provides a level of consistency -- in writing -- for a natural resource that is much needed by both nations, but shared over disputed borders. The Indus river basin supports an enormous 75% of Pakistan's irrigated land, says Keller, making it \"the largest contiguous irrigation network in the world.\" \"Roughly a quarter of the country's GDP comes from-the agriculture sector and it is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings,\" she said. While India has other basins that support its agricultural sector, the Indus still remains essential for regional farming. Dam dispute India also wants to use the rivers to provide hydropower -- something Islamabad first objected to a decade ago. In 2010, Pakistan filed a formal complaint with the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague about plans to build the Kishanganga dam. It feared that India would have the power to control the water flow into Pakistan's agricultural heartland. However, three years later, the Hague court ruled India could proceed with its construction. Islamabad has since renewed its opposition to the dam. It insists the amount of water the project could draw from the Indus River Basin will exceed India's allotted share of the rivers under Pakistan's control. India, however, argues it utilizes only a fraction of the 20% of waters it's allowed to use under the terms of the treaty for hydropower and agricultural projects. \"Some estimates put its use of the waters under Pakistan's control at just 4% of its total allocation,\" Stratfor said in a recent report. Although the two countries are at loggerheads over the water treaty, experts say it's highly unlikely either nation will be looking to jettison it when they meet this week. However, talks are likely to be fraught with both nations keen to protect their own interests during the negotiations, especially with general elections on the horizon. \"Both countries can use the dispute as a tool to advance their political aims in the coming year,\" says Keller. \"This is not the first dispute that has happened under the Indus Water Treaty, nor will it be the last.\"",

        "Text": "As he left Iraq for the United States Sunday, Abadi said Iraqi forces were close to ridding the country of ISIS and that he would talk to the US administration about the final steps needed. \"We are in the last chapter, the final stages to eliminate ISIS militarily in Iraq,\" he said in a video statement. Abadi said he hoped the US and other allies would continue to offer economic assistance to Iraq, which he said faced a financial crisis as a result of the war against the militant group. Trump last week announced a $54 billion increase in defense spending. If approved by Congress, more than $3 billion of the additional money would be allocated to the fight against ISIS, including $2 billion for a flexible fund that would allow the Pentagon to decide how to utilize resources in support of the new counter-ISIS strategy. Travel ban The meeting between Trump and Abadi may touch on some sensitive issues. The Iraqi government objected after its citizens were included on January's executive order banning travel from certain Muslim-majority countries to the United States Iraq was removed from the revised version of the order following intensive lobbying from Baghdad at the highest levels, a senior US official told CNN. The pressure from the Iraq officials included a phone call between Trump and Abadi on February 10 and an in-person conversation between Abadi and Vice President Mike Pence in Munich on February 18. Those conversations were followed by discussions between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and members of the Iraqi government about vetting measures in place that would prevent suspected terrorists from leaving Iraq and coming to the United States. Iraq did not implement new measures; rather, the country provided more detail to US officials about how it screens travelers. In Trump's call with Abadi, the President vowed to seek a resolution to his counterpart's concerns about his citizens being unable to enter the United States, according to a readout of the phone call from Baghdad. The US official said Trump asked Tillerson to get greater clarity on vetting measures in Iraq. Some US veterans condemned the move for its impact on Iraqis who had applied for asylum in the US after helping American forces in Iraq as translators and contractors. Trump also faced pressure to remove Iraq from the order from some American national security officials, who argued the restriction burdened a key anti-ISIS partner. More than 5,000 US military personnel are in Iraq, providing critical support in the war on ISIS. Iraq's oil Meanwhile, in January Trump said there would be no ISIS had the US kept Iraq's oil, following the US invasion into the country. \"We should have kept the oil when we got out. And you know, it's very interesting. Had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because they fuel themselves with the oil. That's where they got the money,\" the US President told ABC's David Muir. \"We should have taken the oil. You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil.\" Ahead of his first visit to Baghdad, US Defense Secretary, James Mattis clarified, telling reporters, \"We're not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil.\" \"All of us in America have generally paid for our gas and oil all along, and I'm sure that we will continue to do so in the future,\" the retired four-star general said.",

        "Text": "Nadia Murad, along with her counsel, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, described her ordeal to Zakaria. It began in 2014 after ISIS militants arrived at her village in Sinjar, Kurdistan, she said. \"Early morning on August 3, 2014, they attacked us,\" she recalled. \"Nearly 6,500 women and children from the Yazidi were abducted and about 5,000 people from the community were killed during that day. For eight months, they separated us from our mothers and our sisters and our brothers, and some of them were killed and others disappeared.\" Murad's mother and six of her brothers and stepbrothers were executed. Murad, along with other unmarried women, was taken as a sex slave and passed around various ISIS militants. At one point, she told the UN Security Council in 2015, as punishment for a failed escape attempt, she was gang raped until she passed out. All of this, she said, was considered legal under ISIS rule -- which dictates that Yazidis, because they do not practice Islam, can be taken as slaves on religious grounds. \"They sold girls, girls that were underage, because ISIS considered that permissible under Islamic law,\" Murad said. \"They came not just to attack certain people, but they came for all Yazidis.\" The violence against the Yazidi community continues to this day, said Clooney, who represents Murad. More than 6,000 Yazidis are believed to remain in captivity, some of them from Murad's own family, Clooney said. It's time, she said, to bring ISIS to justice for committing some of \"the worst crimes of our generation.\" \"We know that there's a military campaign going on where ISIS is being taken on on the battlefield. What we want is to see ISIS members also in a courtroom,\" Clooney said. No court has attempted to prosecute ISIS There hasn't been a \"single prosecution against ISIS in a court anywhere in the world for the crimes committed against the Yazidis ... for any international crimes,\" she added. Last week, Clooney addressed the UN in a bid to convince the Security Council to set up an investigation in Iraq to start collecting evidence. \"ISIS is not a local threat, it's a global threat,\" Clooney said. \"So, my message to the UN was, this is a global threat. It needs a global response. And part of that response must be a judicial one. It cannot be only on the battlefield. You can't defeat ISIS on the battlefield alone, because you have to also deal with future recruiting. And I think trials and exposing the brutality of ISIS and trying to make a dent in some of their shiny propaganda by showing that it's not a holy war and showing what they're really doing to children, to women, is one way to help that,\" she said. Clooney believes an investigation also is crucial to ensure that evidence is properly collected. \"ISIS has set up a whole bureaucracy involving the slave trade where they've set up committees, they've set up courts, so there are documents, there's DNA, there are mass graves, and nobody is actually collecting this evidence. And if it gets lost, it means we can never have trials and we can never have justice,\" she said. Clooney: There is a resolution 'drafted and ready' Clooney said she is asking the Iraqi government and the UN to step in and set up a thorough investigation. In order to make that happen, she said, Iraq needed only to send a letter to the Security Council saying, \"Please establish an investigation.\" \"There's already a resolution drafted and ready,\" she said, \"And if Iraq just sends the letter, then there will be a vote. And from all of my conversations, including with the Russian ambassador and the United States ambassador and others, it seems that there's actually broad support in the Council. \"So, this actually should move forward. It's in line with the Iraqi government's interests, because they're going after ISIS.\" Murad, who now lives in Germany, said she hoped ISIS would finally be brought to justice. Then, she said, switching from her native language to a halting English, she \"wondered,\" that \"maybe if I can speak English, maybe the UN, they can understand ... what we want. But I can't.\" \"We can hear you no matter what language you speak,\" said Zakaria.",

        "Text": "When that failed to move them sufficiently he added another threat: Vote with me or you'll never get another chance at health care reform. The Republicans gathered for an emotional pre-vote caucus in the basement of the Capitol. As they departed, many said it was one of the most impressive conferences they had ever attended. But when House Speaker Paul Ryan offered little more than a brief statement and dashed off without answering reporters' questions, the signs of defeat were apparent. Having practiced his usual method of deal-making, Trump then walked away from the hard work of political negotiating. White House spokesman Sean Spicer, insisting there was no \"plan B,\" predicted victory. While Ryan tried to get his House in order, the President climbed into a big-rig tractor parked outside the White House, sounded the horn like an excited boy and pretended he was driving. (He hadn't looked so happy in weeks.) Despite all these expressions of confidence, the Republicans who run Washington never could come together behind Trumpcare. Hours before the vote, The Daily Beast reported that, according to officials in the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump's top adviser, Steve Bannon, wanted him to make a list of his House GOP enemies so they might be punished. When this last tough-guy tactic failed, Trump and Ryan slammed on the brakes and canceled the showdown vote. CNN and other networks reported the debacle in real time and both men were left humiliated and diminished. No one should be surprised that Trump's first big legislative initiative collapsed in a cloud of chaos. Aside from the development of his enormous ego, nothing in Donald Trump's life experience prepared him to actually function as president of the United States. This became evident during the presidential transition, when he proved incapable of bringing the country together and then, upon his inauguration, when he immediately began offering lies and distortions about everything from the size of the crowd at the inauguration to the claim that the recent election was marred by massive voter fraud. The most remarkable thing about the Trump presidency may be our expectation that he would be any different. Trump first demonstrated his penchant for distortion and deception as a young man when he bragged about his accomplishments before he had any. Despite four massive corporate bankruptcies, each involving complex enterprises that required real executive skills, Trump insisted he was a great business leader. What he was, in fact, was a successful entrepreneur who led family-held companies that he could direct like a monarch. He was THE BOSS and anyone who disagreed with him knew where to find the door. The trouble for President Trump, who made repeal-and-replace of Obamacare one of his big campaign promises, is that he cannot fire anyone in Congress. Indeed, only the voters can fire a member of the House of Representatives and if the latest polls are to be believed, very few of those voters liked Trumpcare. Perhaps it was the part of the bill that would push 24 million of them off the health insurance rolls that they didn't like. Or maybe it was the part of the law that eliminated all those coverage requirements for policies including pregnancy care, drug benefits and mental health coverage. House members, who must seek re-election every two years, understood this and were far more afraid of facing angry constituents than dealing with a President whose approval rating is now 37%. As bad as Trump's retreat on his bill seemed as it was occurring, it seems worse as the minutes and hours have passed and we can reflect on how the defeat contrasts with the Trump image. This is a man who celebrates himself as a dynamic winner of incomparable abilities. \"Only I can fix\" them, he said of America's problems during the campaign. In his estimation, all those governors and legislators who ran against him in the primaries, were, like President Obama, losers and failures. Of course most of the others who sought the Republican nomination in 2016 were successful in government before they ran. And don't forget how that loser Obama managed to get his health care bill passed. What does it say about Trump that when he put himself on the line and tried to get his first piece of major legislation passed, he came up looking like an incompetent? First, it says that Trump lacks an understanding of how the legislative system works and probably ignored those around him who do. Second, he lacks a leadership style suited to dealing with hundreds of members of Congress who are each powerful political figures in their own districts. Finally, and most importantly, we can see that he does not possess the temperament of presidents like Johnson, Reagan and Clinton who respected the process and loved it. The flimsy bill that Trump and Ryan put forward and the clumsy way they went about seeking votes suggest they lacked real conviction. What happens next? If past is prologue, Trump will blame everyone but himself. Ryan should come in for a heap of recrimination, mostly from administration figures speaking to reporters under cover of anonymity. Eventually, perhaps sooner than later -- and despite his protestations to the contrary -- Trump will try again. The trouble is that Congress has demonstrated that Trump's usual way of leading through intimidation won't work. And he hasn't shown that he knows another way.",

        "Text": "Americans were divided on what it meant, and how they felt about it. Here are some reactions after House Republicans pulled the bill. Upset with Republicans Debby Goodwin, a 63-year-old from Arkansas, said she was ashamed that she voted Republican and was happy the House didn't vote on a bill Friday. \"Our family is going through a lot of undue stress because of Trump and the Republicans not caring about people in our economic level and they need to start listening to us,\" she told CNN. Goodwin's son, whose family is not on Obamacare, said he was glad there was no vote. \"It shows that the citizens were heard. The polls and a lot of people in the town halls (indicated) that was one of the main issues,\" said Nathan Dodson. 'Encouraging' development, health care CEO says The CEO of a Kentucky-based health care company said it thought Republicans were smart to pull the bill. \"This gives an opportunity for (President) Trump to reach across the aisle,\" Mike Caudill of Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation told CNN. \"I hope he breaches the divide that exists between the parties.\" Caudill told CNN that while many people might see the Friday's events as Republican weakness, he views it as an opportunity for President Trump. \"He can revise this with his stamp on it,\" he said. Caudill, whose company employs more than 300 people, said from the standpoint of his company, Friday's developments were encouraging. \"At least there won't be immediate adverse effects on the people we serve and are under the ACA (Affordable Care Act) ,\" he said. Nothing for women, LA woman says Susan Levin, a resident of Los Angeles, told CNN the decision was a victory for women. \"Hooray, it didn't pass!\" she said. \"I think that it was very masochistic. They had no provisions for women.\" Levin calls herself a woman of the 1960s and said she lived through some difficult times for women. \"And it didn't cover maternity, there was so much wrong with it. And if they want to change it they need to take a year and go through it very, very carefully,\" she said. Trump has this figured out, Obamacare critic says Becky Romero, who works in staffing at a company in California, is hopeful Republicans will keep up the effort to replace Obamacare. She said the Affordable Care Act negatively affected her business. \"We've had to pass that cost to our associates and most of (them) who qualified for that can't afford it anyway and they're forced to buy it,\" she said. She thinks Trump anticipated the difficulties the GOP encountered. \"So I'm sure he was prepared,\" she told CNN \"He's got another plan.\" Not a fan of Obamacare, but ... \"Trump's plan was horrible,\" said Rachel Stack, a 34-year-old bartender in Denver. For now, Stack is getting health care through work and she said instead of focusing on repealing Obamacare the government should focus on resolving the issues with Russia and Trump. Stack, a British-American, told CNN as she topped two Bloody Marys with celery: \"I am first-generation American and I hate this country.\" But would she move to the UK? \"Well, I supported Brexit and it sort of depends what happens there. The whole world really is just terrible,\" she said. Insurance exec: Don't manipulate Medicaid Alexandra Eidenberg, the president of an insurance company in Chicago, said she had been \"glued to the television\" following developments related to this week's health care vote and is happy the bill did not go through. \"I don't think the Affordable Care Act is working the way it should and clearly there are a lot of issues with the ACA that are not serving the American people, high rates included,\" Eidenberg said. \"But the bill put out by Ryan and Trump would have manipulated Medicaid and done things to any community that were going to cause a lot of issues for the states.\" Eidenberg remains optimistic that something positive will come out of today's failure to enact change to the health care system. \"The turmoil in health care is finally creating such an uproar in people that I think we may see something actually get done.\" Obamacare could be better, business owner suggests Nick Patel, a 65-year-old business owner from Nashville, Tennessee, said he thinks Obamacare needs to be beefed up. But if a new health care bill is to pass it would need revisions, he said. \"There has to be a lot of changes in the health care bill to go through so everyone can benefit,\" he said. Patel, who works in the hospitality industry, had two suggestions. \"They need to bring down the cost of medicine and insurance,\" he said. They should have voted, California man says Curtis Chipley wrote on Facebook that a vote would have been telling. \"So after watching 45 (President Trump) ramble on about the vote, and blah blah blah, he says, 'We were close very close, maybe 10, 15 votes from winning,' how will the American people EVER know how close the vote would have been,\" Chipley wrote. Pulling the bill showed a lack of transparency, said Chipley, who lists his home as French Gulch, California. \"If you really want to be honest you should have let the vote go on, and deal with the aftermath but of course you didn't,\" he wrote.",

        "Text": "And after nearly three full months into the year, he now has to face a head-on a challenge that is likely to haunt his tenure as speaker for the foreseeable future: seemingly irreconcilable differences among his fellow Republicans. \"Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,\" Ryan told reporters Friday. \"And well, we're feeling those growing pains today.\" The stunning setback was particularly excruciating for the 47-year-old, who made his name in Washington as a conservative policy wonk committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act and ascended to the powerful position of House speaker in fall 2015. The bill that too many of his fellow colleagues ultimately rejected was based on Ryan's signature policy agenda, called \"A Better Way.\" \"I don't know what else to say other than Obamacare is the law of the land. It'll remain law of the land until it's replaced,\" he said. \"We're going to be living with Obamacre for the foreseeable future.\" It's a rough reminder that life is different for Ryan now than before Trump was elected. During the Obama administration, the Republican-controlled House could pass message bills that would repeal Obamacare with impunity, knowing they would die in the Senate or be vetoed by the President. \"This is how governing works when you're in the majority. We need to get 216 people to agree with each other to write legislation. Not 210. Not 215,\" Ryan said at Friday's press conference. \"We were close but we didn't have 216 people. That's how legislating works.\" RELATED: Dems gleeful after Obamacare victory Even before the decision to pull the health care bill, Republican lawmakers were worried about the impact of a potential defeat. New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday afternoon prior to the cancellation of the vote that if the health care bill fails, it would leave a \"black eye\" on his party's ability to legislate. \"If we don't pass this, I personally don't think we pass a 2018 budget. We couldn't pass a 2017 budget. So if we couldn't pass a 2017 budget and this happens today, how are we going to pass a 2018 budget?\" he said. \"And that's the vehicle for tax reform. And if you don't do tax reform, where does the money come from for infrastructure? That's how critical this vote is today.\" But both Trump and Ryan say they plan to go to tax reform next. Ryan spoke alone from behind the podium, and he was not flanked by any of the Republican colleagues or White House officials who had furiously worked with him for weeks to try to get the health care legislation through the House. And while questions are being raised about Ryan's relationship with Trump, the two have publicly insisted that they have a healthy dialogue. The Wisconsin Republican said he had directly informed Trump that he did not have the votes, and that the President accepted his recommendation that Republicans yank the bill. Trump publicly blamed Democrats -- not the speaker -- for Friday's failure. \"I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. RELATED: Trump ready to cast blame But it will take more than platitudes to unite his party, especially after both conservative and moderate factions demonstrated their strength this week. The GOP's internal divisions were Ryan's gravest challenge, and one he never came close to resolving. Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus refused to get behind the bill, referring to leadership's proposal as \"Obamacare Lite\" that simply didn't go far enough in gutting the law. But when Ryan and his deputies attempted to appease that faction by offering to go further than their original bill in gutting Obamacare, that only irked the more moderate lawmakers in the House conference. In the final days, Ryan worked around the clock to try to bridge the two factions, holding back-to-back meetings and one-on-one sessions. But the differences could not be reconciled. \"We came really close today, but we came up short,\" Ryan said at a news conference. \"I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us.\"",

        "Text": "Curious about the police officer standing guard outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, Martin asked for a photograph with him. Soon after, the area would be engulfed in horror, and Keith Palmer, the 48-year-old police officer who smiled politely for her photograph would be dead. Martin, who is from West Palm Beach, Florida, traveled to London to visit her son who is studying abroad. While taking a tour of the city, her son showed her Parliament. Martin spotted an officer and was intrigued by his hat, so she asked to take a photo. \"I asked the officer if a photo was OK,\" Martin told CNN. \"He said yes, and I asked him if this happens a lot. He told me, 'It happens quite a bit.'\" She and her family left to eat lunch a block away. When they were leaving the lunch, the attack happened. The family didn't see the attack. \"We called an Uber after lunch and when the Uber turned the corner, a man came up to the window yelling at our driver that there was a shooting,\" she said. \"Initially, it was panic and chaos since it had just happened.\" Back at the hotel later in the day, Martin saw the news about the attack and was wondering if the officer she took a photo in was safe. \"We saw the picture on the news and was like I think that the same officer. We zoomed in on the photo and realized it was Palmer,\" she said. \"I want to get this picture to his family and I want people to know what a nice person he was and how fragile life can be.\"",

        "Text": "Among the recent deaths were five Russian diplomats. Some of the deaths appeared natural and governments have ruled out foul play. In some cases, though, questions remain. That's either because the facts have changed over time, details are hard to come by, or the deaths are still under investigation. Self-proclaimed online sleuths and conspiracy theorists have filled the information void with speculation that the deaths were somehow related to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. No evidence has surfaced to make such a connection. Here's a rundown of the eight deaths-and one near fatality: Russian politician who fled to Ukaine shot dead Denis Voronenkov, 45, was gunned down Thursday outside a hotel in Kiev. Voronenkov and his wife both spoke out against Putin after they left Russia for Ukraine in October. Voronenkov also helped Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian influence, testifying in a treason trial against ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was perceived as a puppet politician for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine's president called the shooting a \"Russian state terrorist act.\" Russian authorities denied the accusation. Russian ambassador to the UN suddenly dies Vitaly Churkin, 64, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, died on February 20 of an apparent heart attack. He was \"in his office fulfilling his duties\" when he died, according to a statement from the Russian mission at the UN. Russian ambassador to India dies after brief illness Alexander Kadakin, 67, the Russian ambassador to India, died on January 26. A spokeswoman for the Russian embassy in New Delhi said that Kadakin died after a short illness and that there was nothing \"special or extraordinary\" about the circumstances that led to his death. Kadakin had worked in India since 2009. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described him as \"a great friend of India\" who worked hard to strengthen relations between the two countries. Russian diplomat found dead in Athens Andrey Malanin, a senior diplomat at the Russian embassy in Greece, was found dead in early January. Malanin, 54, was the head of the Russian embassy's consular section in Athens. Police sources told CNN that worried colleagues called authorities after Malanin didn't show up to work for a few days. Police entered his apartment on January 9th and found him dead on his bedroom floor. Initial reports from Greek police suggested Malanin died suddenly from natural causes. Two Greek police officials said foul play was not suspected. An investigation remains underway. Former intelligence official found dead in his car Oleg Erovinkin, who had close ties to Russian intelligence, was found dead on December 26 sitting in his car on the streets of Moscow. Russian news outlets reported that he was 61 years old. Russian government agencies have not released an official cause of death. He was a former general in the Russian law enforcement and intelligence agency known as the FSB. He also served as chief-of-staff to Igor Sechin, the president of state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Sechin enjoys a close relationship with Putin that dates back to the 1990s. Because of Erovinkin's background, conspiracy theorists and Russia watchers have speculated that he might have been a source of information in the 35-page dossier that detailed alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. No evidence has emerged to firmly substantiate those claims. Diplomat fatally shot in back Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, 62, was assassinated in Ankara on December 20. He was shot at point-blank range by a gunman while speaking at an art exhibition. The shooter, who was a Turkish police officer, shouted \"do not forget Syria\" during the assassination. Russian diplomat shot to death in Moscow The same day as Karlov's killing, Petr Polshikov, 56, a senior Russian diplomat, was shot to death in his Moscow home, according to Moscow newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets. The paper said Polshikov's wife found him in their bedroom with a pillow over his head. Underneath the pillow, police found Polshikov with a head wound. A spokesman from the Russian Foreign Ministry said Polshikov's death was likely an accident and had nothing to do with his official government duties, according to Russian news outlet REN-TV. Russian official in NYC dies on Election Day On the morning of the U.S. election, November 8, about an hour after the first polls opened in New York City, police received a 911 call about an unconscious man inside the Russian consulate. When they arrived, they found Sergei Krivov, 63, unresponsive. Emergency responders declared him dead at the scene. Krivov, who was born in Russia, had served in the consulate as duty commander involved with security affairs, according to Russian news reports. Russian consular officials first said Krivov fell from the roof. Then, they said he died of a heart attack. The initial police report filed on the day of the incident said Krivov was found \"with an unknown trauma to the head,\" according to a New York Police Department spokesman. However, after conducting an autopsy and finishing its investigation, the New York City Medical Examiner ruled that Krivov died from bleeding in the chest area, likely due to a tumor. Police sources said foul play wasn't suspected and that Krivov had been in poor health. Russian lawyer for whistleblower is nearly killed Earlier this week, a private Russian lawyer on an anti-corruption crusade reportedly fell from the fourth floor of his Moscow apartment. Nikolai Gorokhov, 53, was near death with \"severe head injuries\" and remains in a hospital's intensive care unit, according to his friend, investor Bill Browder. Gorokhov represented Sergei Magnitsky, a fellow Russian lawyer who exposed Russia's largest ever tax fraud -- and was later jailed and beaten to death in a Moscow detention center. Gorokhov continued his client's fight.",

Unlike former President George W. Bush, whom he served as vice president, Cheney said he supported Trump, and was happy to do so. The US intelligence community has publicly accused Russia of being behind several hacks and information dumps, including against the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. Russia has denied the charge, which is central to investigations in the US House and Senate as well as the Trump administration. Cheney also warned of Russian military aggression and the potential destabilization Putin could bring. \"He is doing everything he can to find ways to undermine NATO,\" Cheney said. The former vice president fondly recalled the initial post-Cold War period and said times had changed for the worse in some ways. At the beginning of the Bush administration, the US had a closer relationship with Russia, but the relationship deteriorated significantly by the end of Bush and Cheney's time, following the war in Iraq, the growth of NATO since the fall of the Soviet Union and Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe.",

WikiLeaks has also taken to Twitter, where it has repeatedly denied any contact with Stone. Stone repeatedly claimed throughout the final months of the campaign that he had backchannel communications with Assange and that he knew of forthcoming document dumps from the group. Stone at times claimed Assange had emails that Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills deleted. Later, Stone said he only knew of forthcoming document dumps in a \"broad sense.\" In an email, Stone told CNN's KFile in response to the charges from WikiLeaks: \"Since I never communicated with WikiLeaks, I guess I must be innocent of charges I knew about the hacking of Podesta's email (speculation and conjecture) and the timing or scope of their subsequent disclosures. So I am clairvoyant or just a good guesser because the limited things I did predict (Oct disclosures) all came true.\" WikiLeaks also accused Stone of leaking his own DM's that showed interactions with the hacker Guccifer 2.0. Those DM's appeared in an article on The Smoking Gun, which showed Stone told the hacker he was \"delighted\" that Twitter had reinstated his account. \"It is also clear from the screenshot there of the DM tweet from Guccifer that Stone (or at least someone who has access to his account/computer/smartphone) is the source, once again, feeding the idiots, who go wild with the idea that they're Woodward & Bernstein, and they're taking Stone--and then the President down--when in fact, they're puffing him up, just like he planned.\"",

        "Text": "The officials said the latest engine trial is the third such test in recent weeks using similar technology. One official said that the initial assessment indicates that the engine technology could possibly be used in an eventual intercontinental ballistic missile. It was not clear whether the engine would require some adjustment to be used in an ICBM, if it can indeed be used that way at all. Possession of an intercontinental ballistic missile could allow North Korea to threaten the continental United States. ICBM technology is considered difficult to develop, with advanced rocket design being a necessary step. The US is also not sure whether North Korea's military is capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead so that it could be mounted on a rocket, such as an ICBM, though Pyongyang has claimed this capability and US officials have said that they incorporate that ability in their planning assumptions. In a separate move, the US announced Monday that the US Marines have deployed F-35Bs to South Korea for the first time as part of an exercise that began Friday. \"This is the first time we have operated the F-35B in the Republic of Korea,\" Pentagon spokesman US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis told reporters. The new short takeoff and vertical landing capable stealth strike fighter was only first declared operational in July of 2015. The deployment is part of a training exercise with the South Korean military, an exercise Davis called \"defensive in nature.\" \"It goes without saying we are committed to defending the Republic of Korea and Japan against any North Korean aggression,\" Davis added.

        "Text": "The storm continued to intensify as it approached landfall, becoming a Category 3 cyclone, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It's expected to make landfall near the town of Ayr late Tuesday morning, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Cyclone Debbie is forecast to pack gusts of up to 150 mph (240 kph), as well as flash flooding and storm surges as high as four meters. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said that 3,500 residents had already been evacuated. An additional 2,000 people have been ordered to evacuate in the Bowen area, as the cyclone has tracked farther south than originally predicted, she added. Officials predict cyclone will be 'nasty' Some residents are refusing to leave their home, Palaszczuk said, with police going door to door in a final attempt to get people to safety. \"This is going to be a nasty cyclone,\" Palaszczuk told reporters on Monday morning. \"There is no time for complacency ... the window of opportunity to leave is drastically closing,\" she said. \"I am just pleading to everyone, please, listen to authorities. This is about your safety, it is about the safety of your family and the safety of your children.\" Cyclone Debbie is the largest storm to hit Queensland since the Category 5 cyclone Yasi in 2011, which ripped homes from their foundations and destroyed farmland. Debbie could end up being as severe as Yasi, Palaszczuk warned. Storm surge John D Ginger, research director at the Cyclone Testing Station at James Cook University, said that coastal buildings were most at risk. \"Houses in low-lying coastal regions ... and [which] are subjected to storm surge will be vulnerable to significant damage,\" he said. The timing of cyclone Debbie's expected landfall coincides with a 12-foot tide in Bowen, one of the highest tides of the year, according to CNN affiliate 7 News. \"If you are in a storm surge zone and you are directed to leave -- you must leave. You cannot shelter from a storm surge,\" Queensland police tweeted Monday. The severe weather has already claimed the life of a 31-year-old woman after dangerous conditions were linked to a fatal car crash Sunday night near the town of Proserpine, Queensland police commissioner Ian Stewart said. Over 1,000 emergency service workers have been sent to the region in preparation, and all schools remain closed until further notice, 7 News reported.",

        "Text": "The $999 million requested by the White House in its budget supplement for just defense and border security spending would cover just 48 miles of new wall, according to justification documents from the Department of Homeland Security obtained by CNN. The documents describe exactly where the administration hopes to put its first installment of the border wall, as it described its modest 2017 funding ask. The money will fund 14 miles of new border wall in San Diego, 28 miles of new levee wall barriers and six miles of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley region and 14 miles of replacement fencing in San Diego. The fencing would likely include concrete elements, a source familiar with the plans told CNN. President Donald Trump made building a border along the entire US Southern border a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, and repeatedly pledged Mexico would pay for it, but the initial ask for funds to start building has been modest. The administration requested $1 billion in its supplemental for 2017, and another $2.6 billion for border infrastructure and technology in 2018. Estimates for a full wall along the Southern border have ranged from $12 billion to more than $20 billion. The budget request documents also make clear that the Trump administration is looking to ramp up border security elsewhere, specifying millions to bolster detention facilities and legal support for building the wall. The documents also claim that Trump's executive orders on immigration enforcement are already having an effect, saying arrests are up 50%, charges are up 40% and requests to detain arrested individuals who are deportable are up 80%. When asked, ICE did not have information on what the administration is using as a baseline. Wall or fence? Although on the campaign trail, Trump described building a tall, concrete wall, many career officials within DHS recommended see-through fencing as a more secure option, as CNN previously reported, in part to have visibility on what's happening on the other side. The federal government is soliciting contracting bids for two types of construction according to the bid website -- \"one focused on concrete designs, and one focused on other designs.\" W. Ralph Basham, a former Customs and Border Protection commissioner under the Bush administration, said instead of paying for a concrete border wall the government should strategically fund increases in surveillance technology and the construction of additional fencing based upon recommendations made by DHS. \"What does border patrol need to get the job done?\" Basham said. \"A lot of people in this country think that this wall is a good idea, but when you really break it down, it may not be the best way of spending the taxpayer dollar.\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly testified to Congress in February that some border patrol agents made him aware of their concerns about a solid, concrete wall as opposed to see-through fencing. Experts also said at the same House Homeland Security Committee hearing that a border fence could have advantages over a concrete wall, because agents could more easily see across the border. Kelly said the wall will take time to construct. \"We're not going to be able to build a wall everywhere all at once,\" he said. But he didn't give a clear timeline or cost estimates. \"I'd like to see we'd be well underway in two years,\" Kelly said of the wall. \"This is going to take some time, but there's places I think we can right away get at this problem.\"",

        "Text": "The order represents a clear difference between how Trump and former President Barack Obama view the role the United States plays in combating climate change, and dramatically alters the government's approach to rising sea levels and temperatures -- two impacts of climate change. A White House official briefed on the plan said Monday the administration believes the government can both \"serve the environment and increase energy independence at the same time\" by urging the EPA for focus on what the administration believes is its core mission: Clean air and clean water. More important than regulating climate change, the official said, is protecting American jobs. \"It is an issue that deserves attention,\" the official said of climate change. \"But I think the President has been very clear that he is not going to pursue climate change policies that put the US economy at risk. It is very simple.\" Tuesday's order will initiate a review of the Clean Power Plant initiative, rescind the moratorium on coal mining on US federal lands and urge federal agencies to \"identify all regulations, all rules, all policies ... that serve as obstacles and impediments to American energy independence,\" the official said. Specifically, the order will rescind at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, including Obama's November 2013 executive order instructing the federal government to prepare for the impact of climate change and the September 2016 presidential memorandum that outlined the \"growing threat to national security\" that climate change poses. \"The previous administration devalued workers by their policies,\" the official said. \"We are saying we can do both. We can protect the environment and provide people with work.\" The White House official went on to argue that the best way to protect the environment is to have a strong economy, noting that countries like India and China do less to protect the environment. \"To the extent that the economy is strong and growing and you have prosperity, that is the best way to protect the environment,\" the official said. The executive order also represents the greatest fears climate change advocates had when Trump was elected in November 2016. \"These actions are an assault on American values and they endanger the health, safety and prosperity of every American,\" Tom Steyer, the president of NexGen Climate, said in a statement. \"Trump is deliberately destroying programs that create jobs and safeguards that protect our air and water, all for the sake of allowing corporate polluters to profit at our expense.\" Andrew Steer, CEO of the World Resources Institute, said that the executive order shows Trump is \"failing a test of leadership to protect Americans' health, the environment and economy.\" But as much as Democrats and climate advocates will decry it, Trump's executive order follows the President's past comments about climate change. Though Trump told The New York Times during the election that he has an \"open mind\" about confronting climate change, he also once called it a hoax. \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,\" Trump tweeted in November 2012. \"I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama/Clinton,\" Trump said in October 2016. The changes, the official said, do not mean the Trump administration will not look to protect the environment any longer, the official said, but when pressed about the human impact on climate change and Trump's beliefs, the official was reluctant to say whether all government officials in the Trump White House believe humans cause climate change. \"I think there are plenty of rules on the books already. We will continue to enforce that provide for clean air and clean water. And that is what we are going to do,\" the official said. \"The President has been very clear that he wants the EPA to stick to that basic core mission that Congress set out for it.\" The changes also reflect the view of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who routinely sued the organization he now leads during his time as the Attorney General of Oklahoma. In an interview with CNBC earlier this month, Pruitt argued incorrectly that carbon dioxide isn't the \"primary contributor\" to climate change, a comment that goes against most scientific research. This executive order is also an attempt by the Trump administration to make good on its promise to bring more coal jobs back. The official said that Obama's regulations \"were not helpful\" to the coal industry and these reversals are the President honoring \"a pledge he made to the coal industry.\" \"We are going to put our coal miners back to work,\" Trump said at a March 2017 event in Kentucky. \"They have not been treated well, but they're going to be treated well now.\" He added: \"The miners are coming back.\"",

Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, the chairman VneshEconomBank, or VEB, in December 2016. The meeting raises additional questions because VEB has been under US sanctions for three years, and because Kushner has been trying to attract financing for a building project of his in Manhattan. The White House said Kushner was acting as a Trump adviser -- not as a private developer -- when he met with Gorkov. \"He was a conduit and to -- to leaders and that's until we had a State Department, a functioning place for people to go,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday. VEB confirmed the meeting with Kushner in a statement to CNN, though described Kushner in his role as head of Kushner Companies, not as a representative of Trump. \"During 2016 the bank's management repeatedly met with representatives of the world's leading financial institutions in Europe, Asia and America ... including the head of Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner,\" the VEB statement said. The meeting between Kushner and Gorkov does not violate the US sanctions, and it is not unusual for businesses under sanctions to meet with US officials, experts said. \"I don't see any problem in having a meeting,\" said Paul Saunders, executive director of the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, D.C., think-tank. \"The prohibitions relate to doing business with the banks, not to talking to them.\" Trump said during his presidential campaign that he was open to reconsidering the sanctions against Russia. The sanctions weakened much of the Russian finance sector by barring Americans and US companies from buying the debt of Russian financial institutions, which limits their ability to raise money. \"Right after the election, there was an expectation on the part of Russia that sanctions will be lifted,\" said Alevtina Guseva, a Boston University expert on Russian finance. VEB is a state-owned Russian corporation formed in 2007 that is closely tied to the Russian government. Its chairman is appointed by the Russian president. The Russian prime minister is chairman of the bank supervisory board. The bank has helped rescue financially troubled oligarchs and has financed infrastructure projects such as the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi that are too risky for commercial banks. Last year, the bank restructured 200 billion roubles (roughly $3.5 billion) in debts that were affiliated with Sochi projects. It was disclosed on Monday that Kushner agreed to speak to the Senate intelligence committee for its inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government in its effort to sway the 2016 election toward Trump. Lawmakers also want to question Kushner about his meeting in December with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions in 2014 after Russian annexed part of neighboring Ukraine. ",

        "Text": "In the formal letter that notified the European Union of Britain's intention to leave, May warned that the failure to strike a deal on any future relationship would have consequences for security. \"In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened,\" she wrote in the letter. In all, May mentioned security 11 times in the six-page letter. 'Shameful threat' Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who oppose Brexit, said her link between trade and security was \"shameful\" and a \"blatant threat.\" \"Security is too important to be used as a bargaining chip and this will backfire in any negotiations, which rather than building up alliances will leave Britain even more isolated,\" he said. Labour MP Yvette Cooper echoed the concerns. \"Completely irresponsible to threaten, gamble or bargain on national security,\" she wrote on Twitter. Speaking in the Commons, Stephen Kinnock of the opposition Labour Party read out an excerpt from the letter and asked, \"Is she really saying the security of our country will be traded like a bargaining chip in these negotiations?\" May replied that it would be important to negotiate a future deal on security. \"We have a relationship with the European Union, there are certain elements of the European Union in justice and home affairs that we're currently members of that in leaving the European Union we would not be members of, and we need to negotiate what the future relationship will be. \"It's very simple, it's very pragmatic and the aim of this will be to ensure cooperation on these matters.\" Britain is a member of Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, which co-ordinates the sharing of intelligence on terrorism and organized crime between member states. It is also arguably the union's strongest defense power, according to the Institute for Government. \"It is one of only two member states possessing 'full-spectrum' military capabilities (including a nuclear deterrent) and one of only five spending 2% of GDP on defense. It also holds a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and has the largest military budget within the EU,\" the institute said. A Downing Street spokesman declined to expand on the letter. \"The Prime Minister's words speak for themselves. It's a simple fact that if we leave the EU without a deal, the arrangements which we have as part of our EU membership will lapse,\" he told CNN. Trade deal sought The official start to the Brexit process came nine months after the UK voted in a hotly contested referendum that exposed deep divisions across the country. In her letter, May said the UK wanted to pursue a \"bold and ambitions\" free-trade agreement with the EU in forthcoming talks. If the country fails to strike a trade deal with Britain and defaults to trading under World trade Organization rules, it is forecast to lose 7.5% of its GDP over 15 years, according to the UK's own official estimates. May has made clear that the country will not remain in the bloc's single market or customs union, which essentially make the EU a free-trade zone. Staying in the market would likely have forced Britain to keep its borders open to all EU citizens, a key argument by the Leave campaign to exit the union. In her letter, May tried to strike a conciliatory tone with the EU, reiterating her hopes for Britain and the union to remain the closest of allies and to seek a \"deep and special partnership.\" She also made clear that she wanted to avoid walking away with no deal, and proposed several principles to guide negotiations. Here are the letter's highlights: The UK won't seek membership of the single market, essentially a free-trade zone. But it will seek a 'bold and ambitious' free-trade agreement. The UK hopes to avoid a cliff-edge separation and ensure certainty for businesses. It warns that European security will be under threat if a deal is not reached. It expects the devolved regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be granted greater powers. The government aims to repeal EU laws and automatically adopt them into UK law for review. A White Paper on how to do this will be published Thursday. Tusk: 'We already miss you' May accepted there would be downsides of Brexit. \"We understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU,\" she told MPs. \"We know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We know that UK companies that trade with the EU will have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part, just as we do in other overseas markets. We accept that.\" After receiving the Article 50 letter, Tusk struck a gloomy note. \"There is no reason to pretend that this is a happy day, neither in Brussels nor in London. After all, most Europeans, - including almost half the British voters, wished that we would stay together, not drift apart. As for me, I will not pretend that I am happy today,\" Tusk said. But he added that Brexit had made the 27 other nations in the EU more determined and united. \"And what can I add to this? We already miss you.\"",

        "Text": "Beloved by some, tolerated by most and long detested by others, the ever-intricate marriage was wrenched apart by referendum last year. The formal process will take two years and the costs could run into the tens of billions for Britain, but there is no going back. Starved of compromise when it needed it most, Britain spent the last years with the EU in and out of relationship therapy, surviving on an insufficient drip of concessions from the bloc. The last gasp came in the early hours of June 24 when 51.9% voted for termination. It held on through life support until the triggering of Article 50. But now the EU 28 is no more. It wasn't always this way. European suitors, known then as the Common Market, wooed a war-weary Britain, enjoying an on-again, off-again courtship that was almost derailed by a disapproving patriarch: French President Charles de Gaulle. His death paved the way for romance to blossom. Britain's defenses were finally broken down, and in 1973, a full marriage took place. Britain finally partnered with a like-minded equal -- at least that was the understanding. First came the honeymoon: Prosperity grew, the growth gap between Britain and founding members -- Germany, France and Italy -- began slowly to close. Incrementally, the UK became less the \"sick man of Europe.\" Indeed, this side of the relationship blossomed until the financial crisis. But over time, the nuptials didn't deliver the expected parity. Fisherman, farmers and car manufacturers were among the many to complain. From the get-go, the Common Fisheries Policy allocated dwindling sea stocks away from Britain's fishermen into the arms of the continental beau. Over time, this became an open sore -- a touchstone of the relationship going wrong. British fleets were badly hurt, ports put idle and Europeans hove closer to British shores than they'd ever been allowed to before. What started as a tiny national bleed was never cauterized in time, becoming in some fishing communities an ugly hemorrhage -- a place where the ills of the relationship could fester and find voice. So too for farmers in 1984, who railed at the Common Agriculture Policy. European subsidies and pricing were perceived to be undermining livelihoods and changing the British landscape. On the industrial landscape there was upheaval as factories closed. Car manufacturer British Leyland, once a giant that strode the land, became a casualty of continental competition. It's hard to say when the rot in the relationship really set in, but by degrees, dissatisfaction and disaffection grew. For some, the relationship became uncomfortable when the European Community began evolving toward the EU. In 1990, after years of political resistance, Britain signed up to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. It was supposed to prevent big swings in value between currencies across the EU to make it easier for members to trade with each other and ultimately introduce a single currency. Two years later, Britain was forced to withdraw when it was unable to prevent the pound from crashing. The union's open borders and single market -- demanding the free flow of goods, services, money and people -- came in to force in 1993, unlocking a dormant disease. It was not just a stealth agenda to stitch one another in to the same suit, but it also paved the way for economic migrants to leave behind their poorer, less well-serviced lives and cross Europe in search of their dreams. Whether it was true or not, many in Britain felt their country was the one in the relationship doing all the giving. What was once a waltz of joy between embracing lovers was becoming increasingly a stagger between estranging partners as wounds, sores, disease and imbalance were taking their toll. Then, after unexpectedly winning the 2015 general election, David Cameron had to fulfill an agenda promise and set an ultimatum for Brussels, hoping that things were not beyond repair. Instead, he severed his own Achilles, limped off and left the now hopeless partnership battered, dead and buried. Britain's departure from the EU's arms leaves the other lovers in this struggling union to keep the dance going. The EU, clinging ever tighter, searching for a stronger embrace, is unwilling to let any others go.",

        "Text": "David Cameron -- May's predecessor who lost the Brexit referendum -- has reason to be puzzled by the upshot of his defeat. Britain is now leaving the EU because of his request for a \"variable geometry\" -- allowing Britain to opt out of basic EU tenets -- which was unceremoniously turned down by Berlin and, less consequentially, by Paris. Yet, as a direct result of Brexit, Berlin and Paris are now adopting the idea of variable geometry as the way forward for the EU. This first paradox is easier to understand when seen through the lens of the conventional European practice of making a virtue out of failure. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, had for years opposed the idea of a Europe that proceeds at different speeds -- allowing some countries to be less integrated than others, due to their domestic political situation. But now -- after the colossal economic mismanagement of the euro crisis has weakened the EU's legitimacy, given Euroskeptics a major impetus, and caused the EU to shift to an advanced stage of disintegration -- Mrs Merkel and her fellow EU leaders seem to think that a multi-speed Europe is essential to keeping the bloc together. At the weekend, as EU leaders gathered to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, leaders of the remaining 27 member states signed the Rome Declaration, which says that they will \"act together, at different paces and intensity where necessary, while moving in the same direction, as we have done in the past.\" The failure to keep the EU together along a single path toward common values, a common market and a common currency will come to be embraced and rebranded as a new start, leading to a Europe in which a coalition of the willing will proceed with the original ambition while the rest form outer circles, connected to the inner core by unspecified bonds. In principle, such a manifold EU will allow for the East's self-proclaimed illiberal democracies to remain in the single market, refusing to relocate a single refugee or to adhere to standards of press freedom and judicial independence that other European countries consider essential. Countries like Austria will be able to put up electrified fences around their borders. It could even leave the door open for the UK to return as part of one of Europe's outer circles. Whether one approves of this vision or not, the fact is that its chances depend on a major prerequisite: a consolidated, stable eurozone. One only needs to state this to recognize the second paradox of our post-Brexit reality: In its current state, the eurozone cannot provide the stability that the EU -- and Europe more broadly -- needs to survive. The refusal to deal rationally with the bankruptcy of the Greek state is a useful litmus test for the European establishment's capacity to stabilize the eurozone. As it stands, the prospects for a stabilized eurozone do not look good. Business as usual -- the establishment's favored option -- could soon produce a major Italian crisis that the eurozone cannot survive. The only alternative under discussion is a eurozone federation-light, with a tiny common budget that Berlin will agree to in exchange for direct control of French, Italian and Spanish national budgets. Even if this were to happen, which is doubtful given the political climate, it will be too little, too late to stabilize the eurozone. So here is the reality that Europe faces today: a proper federation of 27 member states is impossible, given the centrifugal forces tearing Europe apart. Meanwhile, a variable geometry confederacy -- of the type David Cameron had requested and which the UK might want to join after 2019 -- requires a consolidated eurozone. But this also seems impossible, given the current climate. Allowing EU member states to move in different directions and at different speeds is precisely the wrong way to address to address the differing concerns of Europeans living in different countries -- and it seems an odd way to unite them behind a single way forward for the continent. In fact, Europeans are already united by two existential threats: Involuntary under-employment -- the bitter fruit of austerity-driven under-investment -- and involuntary migration -- the result of the overconcentration of investment in specific regions. To make the European Union work again, each and every European country must be stabilized and helped to prosper. Europe cannot survive as a free-for-all, everyone for themselves, or as an Austerity Union built on de-politicised economic decision-making with a fig leaf of federalism in which some countries are condemned to permanent depression and debtors are denied democratic rights. Europe, in short, needs a New Deal -- perhaps similar to the New Deal that my organization DiEM25 unveiled in Rome at the weekend while the European elites were toasting their variable geometry -- that runs across the continent, embracing all countries independently of whether they are in the eurozone, in the European Union or in neither.",

        "Text": "Asked directly on Thursday whether Russia interfered in the election, Putin said: \"Read my lips: No.\" Putin's comments are the President's most emphatic denial of the accusations yet, and are the first he has directly made since US President Donald Trump took office in January. Russian officials and spokespeople for Putin, however, have brushed off the claims several times as a political \"witch hunt.\" The denial comes as intelligence committees from both the House and Senate in the US investigate the alleged interference in the US election, including possible ties between Russian officials and members of Trump's campaign team. The FBI is also conducting its own investigation. Putin ridicules Kushner allegations Putin also downplayed a meeting between Jared Kushner -- Trump's son-in-law and close adviser -- and Sergey Gorkov, chairman of the Russian state development bank VneshEconomBank, which has been under US sanctions since July 2014. Kushner is expected to give voluntary testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"Now there are some questions raised regarding the meetings with our bankers. But American bankers come to Russia and talk to us, don't they? Including our officials. How they can they work otherwise? Of course they hold meetings,\" Putin said, without explicitly naming the men in question. \"I think it's not in the interest of the American people to carry Russian-American relations to the point of absurdity, just to benefit the inner political agenda,\" Putin continued. \"What do we want? [To] break off the diplomatic relationship? Force the situation to the point of the 1960s [Cuban missile] crisis? And what's next?\" Putin asked. \"People who behave themselves so recklessly, what are they leading us to? Including the people of the USA. I think it's a big mistake and I hope the situation will normalize -- and the sooner the better.\" The Russian leader also said that he would be open to meeting Trump on the side lines of an Arctic summit in Finland in September. \"If this happens, we will be glad to participate and I will be glad to take part in this event,\" he said. Trump says he and Putin have never met, but both leaders have repeatedly said they are open to doing so. Election meddling claims The US government publicly announced in October that it was \"confident\" Russia orchestrated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and other political organizations of the Democratic Party in the lead-up to the election. And in January, days before Trump took office, the US intelligence community concluded that Putin had ordered an \"influence campaign\" aimed at hurting Trump's rival, Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. The DNC hacks resulted in the public release of thousands of stolen emails, many of which included damaging revelations about the Democratic Party and Clinton's campaign. Trump has flip-flopped on the issue, at first refusing to consider that Russia may have been behind the DNC hacks, but later conceding \"I think it was Russia.\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in January that the charges against Russia \"were not backed by anything\" and were \"made on a very amateur, emotional level.\" \"What we see is ... that all of this looks like is a full-scale witch hunt,\" Peskov said. Before leaving office, former President Barack Obama ordered a full review into hacking aimed at influencing US elections going back to 2008.",

        "Text": "Katie Walsh, the White House's deputy chief of staff, will join a nonprofit group supporting the President's agenda, the President's top aides said Thursday. The move marks the second departure of a senior White House official in the first months of the administration, following national security adviser Michael Flynn's forced resignation last month. It also represents a major change in the makeup of the White House's top staff that could shift the power dynamics within the West Wing as Walsh was a close ally of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. Walsh was Priebus' deputy, joining him in the administration after serving as his chief of staff when he was chairman of the Republican National Committee. She is now set to serve as a senior adviser to America First Policies, a nonprofit group helmed by former Trump campaign officials that has struggled to get off the ground in the first months of Trump's presidency. A senior White House official insisted that Walsh was \"not being fired.\" A source familiar with the inner workings of the White House who called the move a \"tremendous loss,\" and noted the frustration inside the White House after the administration's failure to get Republicans to coalesce around a health care bill supported by Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The official said Walsh saw a need to better organize support for the White House's initiatives on the outside. \"It was a very collective conversation that we could have moved the health care message more effectively,\" the White House official said. Two senior White House officials dismissed the notion that Walsh's departure signaled Priebus could be next to leave. \"Reince is not next,\" said one senior White House official. Asked at Thursday's daily briefing if there would be additional staff shake-ups following Walsh's departure, White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded: \"No.\" The triumvirate of top White House officials -- Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner -- sang Walsh's praises during a briefing Thursday in Priebus' West Wing office with a small group of reporters. Bannon called her \"the vital link that pulls things together and makes things happen,\" while Kushner called her \"one of the unsung heroes of the campaign\" and lauded the \"sacrifice she is making.\" Priebus stressed that the decision for Walsh to leave the White House for the outside political group came after it became \"abundantly clear we didn't have air cover\" during the health care debate. \"Nobody can fix this problem better than Katie Walsh,\" Priebus said.

        "Text": "US District Court Judge Derrick Watson blocked the core provisions of the revised executive order two weeks ago, concluding that the order likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. But Watson's earlier decision was only a limited freeze of the executive order through a temporary restraining order. Read the ruling As a result, the plaintiffs asked the judge to convert that decision into a longer-term preliminary injunction and Watson agreed Wednesday night, meaning that the President's 90-day ban on foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries and the 120-ban on all refugees entering the country are now blocked indefinitely, unless any higher court changes Watson's order or the state's lawsuit is otherwise resolved. The Justice Department said Thursday morning it will continue to defend the executive order. \"The Justice Department strongly disagrees with the federal district court's ruling. The President's executive order fails squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation's security, and the department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts,\" a department spokesperson said in a statement. These Muslim Americans approve of the travel ban One of the practical implications of Wednesday's decision is that the Justice Department may now immediately appeal the ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, should it choose to do so. But how long it will take for any appeals to be completed remains unclear. The reasoning in Watson's decision Wednesday largely follows his decision from two weeks ago, which used Supreme Court precedent to conclude that Donald Trump's statements about Muslims during the presidential campaign speak to the constitutionality of the executive order. \"The court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has,\" Watson wrote Wednesday. Trump's new travel ban blocked: What you need to know \"The court concludes that, on the record before it, plaintiffs have met their burden of establishing a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their Establishment Clause claim.\" How Trump's 'Muslim ban' comments can hurt his travel ban case DOJ has separately appealed a different federal judge's decision to halt the 90-day travel ban to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.",

Critics, however, claim that Trump's hiring violates federal nepotism laws. CNN's Alisyn Camerota asked Jason Miller on \"New Day\" Thursday: \"The one thing I don't understand is how is this not nepotism?\" \"Well, I mean, how is it nepotism?\" Miller, a Trump surrogate, replied. \"Because she's the daughter of the President, that's how it's nepotism,\" Camerota responded. \"She's working for free. She's volunteering her time and effort for the good of the country,\" Miller said. \"Everybody from the White House counsel to the (Department of Justice) has said that this doesn't violate any sort of nepotism rules.\" Speaking during the same segment, former White House ethics czar Norman Eisen said that both the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations included the White House in its interpretation of the federal nepotism law, passed in 1967, that says no public official -- from the President down to a low-level manager at a federal agency -- may hire or promote a relative. But the law states that any appointee found to have violated the law is \"not entitled to pay\" by the federal government, which appears to offer the opportunity for Trump and Jared Kushner, her husband, to forgo paychecks while still serving the administration. Kushner, a top Donald Trump aide, is also serving the White House as an unpaid government employee. A source has told CNN that the decision to make Ivanka Trump officially an employee was made after there was great \"unease\" expressed by about the nature of her voluntary role. \"I have heard the concerns some have with my advising the President in my personal capacity while voluntarily complying with all ethics rules, and I will instead serve as an unpaid employee in the White House Office, subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees,\" Ivanka Trump said in a statement. \"Throughout this process, I have been working closely and in good faith with the White House counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role.\"",

The vote marked the first time in U.S. history that a vice president was required to cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate.\n\nDeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and education activist, has been a vocal advocate for school choice and charter schools. Her nomination was met with fierce opposition from Democrats and many Republicans, who expressed concerns over her lack of experience in public education and her support for private schools.\n\nThe Senate confirmation vote was delayed several times due to a Democratic filibuster, but ultimately, Vice President Mike Pence was called upon to cast the deciding vote. In a brief ceremony, Pence entered the Senate chamber and announced, \"I hereby announce the vote is 51-50 in favor of confirming Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education.\"\n\nThe confirmation was met with immediate criticism from Democrats, who claimed that DeVos was not qualified for the position and that her views on education would harm public schools. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) stated, \"This is a dark day for public education in America.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Republicans hailed the confirmation as a victory for school choice and parental empowerment. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) praised DeVos, saying, \"She is a dedicated public servant who is committed to improving the lives of American students.\"\n\nAs Secretary of Education, DeVos will oversee a department with a budget of over $70 billion and a workforce of over 4,000 employees. Her confirmation sets the stage for a significant shift in education policy, with DeVos promising to focus on increasing school choice and reducing federal oversight of education.\n\nThe confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education marks a significant milestone in the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the federal government's role in education. While the vote was closely divided, DeVos's confirmation sets the stage for a contentious debate over the future of American education.",

        "Text": "In a move that has sparked widespread concern among educators and civil rights advocates, the Senate has confirmed Betsy DeVos as the new Secretary of Education. The vote was largely along party lines, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote to confirm DeVos.\n\nCritics of DeVos' nomination had long warned that her lack of experience in the education sector and her history of supporting voucher programs and charter schools would lead to a further erosion of public education. Now, many are worried that her confirmation will have a devastating impact on the country's most vulnerable students, particularly those in low-income and minority communities.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is that DeVos' policies will exacerbate the trend of resegregation in American schools. Under her leadership, schools that are already struggling to integrate may be incentivized to further segregate themselves, leading to a lack of diversity and a lack of opportunities for students of color.\n\nDeVos has a history of supporting voucher programs, which allow parents to use public funds to send their children to private schools. This has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on low-income and minority students, who are more likely to be forced to attend underfunded and underresourced public schools.\n\nFurthermore, DeVos has also been a strong supporter of charter schools, which have been shown to be less effective than traditional public schools in many cases. The proliferation of charter schools has also been linked to the decline of public education, as funding is diverted away from traditional public schools to support these privately-run institutions.\n\nIn addition to these concerns, DeVos' confirmation has also been met with opposition from many educators and education experts, who argue that she lacks the qualifications and experience necessary to lead the Department of Education.\n\nAs the country moves forward with DeVos at the helm of the Department of Education, many are left wondering what the future holds for public education. Will DeVos' policies lead to a further erosion of public education, or will she surprise critics and work to improve the system? Only time will tell, but for now, many are left feeling uneasy about the direction of American education.",

Khamenei made the comments during a speech at Tehran University on Tuesday, as reported by the semi-official Fars News Agency.\n\nThe Iranian leader's remarks come amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington, following Trump's decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal. The deal was signed in 2015 by the Obama administration and several other world powers, and was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions.\n\nKhamenei accused Trump of being a \"new edition\" of former US President George W. Bush, who led the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Iranian leader stated that Trump's actions are a continuation of the US's \"hegemonic\" and \"imperialist\" policies, which seek to dominate and control other nations.\n\n\"He [Trump] has shown the true face of the United States,\" Khamenei said. \"He has shown that the US is a deceitful and treacherous government. They lied and deceived the world, and now they are doing the same thing with the nuclear deal.\"\n\nKhamenei also warned that the US's withdrawal from the JCPOA would have severe consequences for the region and the world. He called on the international community to stand against the US's \"aggressive\" actions and to defend the nuclear deal.\n\nThe Iranian leader's comments come as tensions between Tehran and Washington continue to escalate. The US has imposed new sanctions on Iran, and has accused the country of supporting terrorism and human rights abuses. Iran has responded by threatening to retaliate against US interests in the region.\n\nThe US withdrawal from the JCPOA has also been met with widespread criticism from European leaders, who had signed the deal along with the US. The European Union has announced plans to work with Iran to maintain the nuclear deal, despite the US's withdrawal.\n\nThe situation remains highly volatile, with many experts warning of the potential for conflict in the region. The US and Iran have a long history of tensions, and the situation could potentially escalate into a wider conflict.",

        "Text": "In a shocking and unprecedented move, the leader of Al Qaeda has publicly mocked US President Donald Trump following a botched raid in Yemen that left 30 civilians dead, including 10 children. The brazen statement is a rare instance of a terrorist organization's leader directly targeting a sitting US President.\n\nIn a message released on social media, Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri called Trump \"a fool\" and accused him of being responsible for the deaths of the innocent civilians in the raid. The statement, which was translated by SITE Intelligence Group, a US-based monitoring organization, also claimed that the raid was a \"cowardly\" act that demonstrated the US military's ineptitude.\n\nThe raid, which was conducted on January 29, was aimed at capturing or killing Al Qaeda leader Qasim al-Raymi, who was reportedly killed in the operation. However, the mission quickly turned into a debacle, with US Navy SEALs suffering heavy casualties and losing one of their own, Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens, who was killed in the raid.\n\nThe botched raid has sparked widespread outrage and criticism, with many questioning the efficacy of the operation and the Trump administration's handling of the situation. Trump himself has been criticized for his handling of the aftermath, with many accusing him of using the raid as a way to deflect attention from the controversy surrounding his travel ban and other issues.\n\nAl-Zawahiri's statement is likely to further inflame tensions between the US and Al Qaeda, and could potentially be used to galvanize support for the terrorist organization among its followers. The statement also underscores the challenges facing the Trump administration in its efforts to combat terrorism, as it struggles to balance its military actions with its rhetoric and public diplomacy.\n\nIn a statement, the US Department of Defense said it would not comment on Al-Zawahiri's statement, but reiterated its commitment to combating terrorism and protecting its citizens. The statement also praised the bravery and professionalism of the US military personnel involved in the raid.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to Al-Zawahiri's mocking statement and whether it will have any impact on the administration's plans to tackle terrorism. One thing is certain, however - the botched raid in Yemen has opened up a new front in the war on terror, and the US and its allies will need to be prepared to respond to the changing dynamics of the conflict.",

The criticism comes after a recent report by the White House claiming that there has been a significant decrease in terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nThe report, which was released on January 31, 2017, stated that the number of terrorist attacks in the US had decreased by 73% since the beginning of 2016. However, a group of journalists from various news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN, have disputed these claims.\n\nAccording to the journalists, the White House's report was based on a flawed methodology that failed to take into account the definition of a \"terrorist attack.\" The journalists argued that the report's definition of a terrorist attack was too narrow, and that it excluded many incidents that could be considered as terrorist attacks.\n\nThe journalists also pointed out that the report's data was based on a small sample size, and that it did not take into account the severity of the attacks. They argued that the report's conclusion that there had been a significant decrease in terrorist attacks was based on a flawed analysis of the data.\n\nThe White House has defended its report, saying that it was based on the best available data and that it was a accurate reflection of the current situation. However, the journalists have refused to back down, saying that the report was flawed and that it did not provide a accurate picture of the threat posed by terrorism.\n\nThe dispute between the White House and the journalists has sparked a heated debate about the accuracy of the White House's terror reporting. Many experts have weighed in on the issue, with some supporting the White House's claims and others criticizing the report's methodology.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of the media in reporting on terrorism. Some have argued that the media has a responsibility to critically evaluate the information provided by the government, while others have argued that the media should simply report on the information provided without questioning its accuracy.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the dispute, the controversy has highlighted the importance of accurate and reliable information in the reporting of terrorism. It has also underscored the need for the media and the government to work together to provide the public with a accurate and balanced picture of the threat posed by terrorism.",

The bill, aimed at combating corruption, has sparked widespread criticism and outrage among Romanians, who believe it is too lenient on corrupt officials.\n\nAccording to Iohannis, the bill's failure to introduce harsher penalties for corruption and lack of transparency in the process of selecting the head of the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) have contributed to the public's negative reaction. The President emphasized that the government's efforts to combat corruption must be genuine and effective, rather than mere rhetoric.\n\nRomanian Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu defended the bill, stating that it represents a step forward in the fight against corruption. However, critics argue that the bill does not go far enough in addressing the root causes of corruption, and that it may even make it easier for corrupt officials to escape punishment.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the bill has sparked widespread protests across the country, with thousands of Romanians taking to the streets to demand more effective measures to combat corruption.

The researchers believe that the gel could potentially be used as a non-hormonal, reversible, and safe form of male contraception. However, before humans can benefit from this innovation, the scientists must conduct further studies to ensure its safety and efficacy.\n\nThe male contraceptive gel, developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is designed to work by blocking the production of sperm. The gel is applied to the skin of the scrotum, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and travels to the testes. Once there, it inhibits the production of sperm, effectively preventing fertilization.\n\nIn the study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the researchers tested the gel on 12 male rhesus macaques. The results showed that the gel was able to suppress sperm production in all of the monkeys, with the effects lasting for up to four months.\n\nWhile the results are promising, the scientists are quick to point out that the gel is still in the early stages of development. \"We have a long way to go before we can say whether this gel will be effective and safe for human use,\" said Dr. Stephanie Page, the lead researcher on the study. \"We need to conduct more studies to ensure that the gel is safe and effective in humans.\"\n\nThe development of a male contraceptive gel has the potential to revolutionize family planning. Currently, there are limited options for men looking to avoid pregnancy, and many of these options have side effects or are not always effective. A non-hormonal, reversible, and safe form of male contraception could provide men with a more convenient and effective way to plan their families.\n\nIn addition to its potential benefits for family planning, the development of the male contraceptive gel could also have implications for the treatment of certain medical conditions. For example, the gel could potentially be used to treat conditions such as prostate cancer, where the ability to suppress sperm production could be beneficial.\n\nOverall, the development of the male contraceptive gel is an exciting breakthrough, and scientists are eager to continue studying its potential. While there is still much work to be done, the results of the study are promising, and the possibility of a new and effective form of male contraception is on the horizon.",

The 'bug gate' scandal, as it has come to be known, has sent shockwaves through the sporting world and beyond.\n\nAccording to reports, a 35-year-old man was taken into custody by New Zealand police on Tuesday after being accused of placing a listening device, known as a 'bug', in the dressing room of the Australian cricket team during the third Test match between the two nations. The match, which took place at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, ended in a thrilling draw, but the focus has now shifted to the alleged sabotage.\n\nThe incident is believed to have occurred on the second day of the match, when the Australian team was reportedly discussing their strategy with coach Darren Lehmann. The listening device, which was discovered by the Australian team's manager, was allegedly planted by the suspect, who has been identified as a 35-year-old man from Wellington.\n\nThe Australian Cricket Board has confirmed the incident, stating that they were \"aware of the situation\" and were working closely with New Zealand authorities to investigate the matter.

The law, which has sparked widespread criticism and debate, has been met with outrage from women's rights groups and advocates.\n\nAccording to the law, a husband can sue his wife for \"emotional distress\" if she decides to have an abortion without his consent. The law also allows husbands to seek damages for \"loss of consortium\" if their wife has an abortion.\n\nThe law has been criticized for its potential to restrict women's reproductive rights and for its lack of consideration for the potential consequences of an abortion on the woman's physical and emotional well-being.\n\nWomen's rights groups have argued that the law is a violation of a woman's right to make her own decisions about her body and her health. They have also pointed out that the law could have unintended consequences, such as encouraging women to seek illegal or unsafe abortions.\n\nThe law has also been criticized for its potential to create a culture of fear and intimidation around abortion. Women who are considering an abortion may feel pressured to seek their husband's consent, even if they do not want to continue the pregnancy.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the government has defended the law, saying that it is intended to promote \"family values\" and to protect the \"rights\" of husbands. However, many have argued that the law is a step backwards for women's rights and that it is not in line with international human rights standards.\n\nThe law has also been met with criticism from medical professionals, who have expressed concerns about the potential impact on women's health. They have argued that the law could lead to delays in seeking medical care and could increase the risk of complications from unsafe abortions.\n\nThe law has sparked a heated debate about the role of government in regulating women's reproductive rights. While some have argued that the government has a responsibility to protect the \"rights\" of husbands, others have argued that the government should be focused on protecting the rights and health of women.\n\nAs the debate continues, many are left wondering what the implications of this law will be for women's rights and reproductive health. One thing is clear, however: the law has sparked a much-needed conversation about the importance of protecting women's rights and promoting access to safe and legal abortion.",

        "Text": "Tensions between China and Japan escalated on February 5, 2017, as Chinese coast guard vessels sailed near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. The islands, also known as the Diaoyu Islands in Chinese, have been a source of contention between the two nations for decades.\n\nAccording to reports, five Chinese coast guard ships entered the waters surrounding the islands, prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets to monitor the situation. The Japanese government has been urging China to respect its territorial claims and to withdraw the vessels from the area.\n\nThe Senkaku Islands are a group of five uninhabited islets located in the East China Sea, approximately 200 kilometers north of Taiwan. Both China and Japan claim sovereignty over the islands, with Japan having administered them since 1895. China, however, has been increasingly assertive in its claims, citing historical records and geographical proximity.\n\nThe recent incursion by Chinese vessels is the latest in a series of provocative actions taken by China in the region. In 2012, China's national oil company, CNOOC, began exploring for oil and gas in the waters surrounding the islands, sparking a diplomatic row with Japan.\n\nThe Japanese government has condemned the latest incursion, calling it a \"serious threat to Japan's national security and territorial integrity.\" Japan has also urged China to abide by international law and to respect the country's sovereignty over the islands.\n\nThe United States has also weighed in on the issue, with a State Department spokesperson stating that \"the United States opposes any unilateral actions that could escalate tensions in the region.\" The spokesperson also called on all parties to resolve the dispute peacefully and in accordance with international law.\n\nThe situation is likely to remain tense in the coming days, with both sides showing no signs of backing down. The dispute over the Senkaku Islands is just one of many territorial disputes in the Asia-Pacific region, and its resolution will likely have far-reaching implications for regional stability and security.",

        "Text": "Kabul, Afghanistan (AP) - A suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle outside the Afghan Supreme Court in Kabul on Monday, killing at least 20 people and wounding dozens more. The attack occurred at around 8:30 am local time, when the court was still open for business.\n\nThe blast caused widespread destruction, with several buildings nearby damaged or destroyed. The Supreme Court building itself was severely damaged, with parts of the structure collapsed.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the bomber targeted the entrance of the court, where a large crowd of people had gathered to conduct official business. The explosion sent debris flying everywhere, causing panic and chaos in the area.\n\n\"I was waiting for my brother outside the court when the blast happened,\" said Gulalai, a local resident who witnessed the attack. \"I saw people running and screaming, and I thought it was the end of the world.\"\n\nThe Taliban, the militant group responsible for numerous attacks in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the bombing. In a statement, the group said the attack was intended to target the court's judges, who they claimed were \"collaborating with the infidels.\"\n\nThe attack has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from around the world. The United Nations, the European Union, and several governments have issued statements condemning the bombing and offering condolences to the victims and their families.\n\nThe blast is the latest in a series of attacks in Afghanistan, which has seen a surge in violence in recent months. The country is still struggling to rebuild and stabilize after decades of war and conflict.\n\nThe Afghan government has vowed to bring those responsible for the attack to justice, and has launched an investigation into the bombing. In the meantime, the country is left to mourn the loss of life and rebuild in the aftermath of this devastating attack.",

        "Text": "Amnesty International has released a shocking report, claiming that over 13,000 people were secretly hanged at a Syrian prison during the country's ongoing civil war. The organization says that the majority of those executed were civilians, including children, women, and men who were arrested for their political beliefs or suspected of being opponents of the government.\n\nAccording to the report, the majority of the executions took place at the Saydnaya military prison, located just outside of Damascus. Amnesty International researchers spoke to multiple sources, including former prisoners and guards, who confirmed the mass executions.\n\nThe organization claims that the executions were carried out in secret, with prisoners being taken from their cells in the middle of the night and hanged in groups of 50-100. The prisoners were often denied access to lawyers and were not given a fair trial.\n\n\"This is a shocking and devastating revelation that highlights the brutal and systematic nature of the Syrian government's human rights abuses,\" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa research director.\n\nThe Syrian government has repeatedly denied allegations of mass executions, but Amnesty International's report is the latest in a series of damning human rights abuses against the government.\n\nThe report also highlights the role of the Russian government in supporting the Syrian government's actions. Russia has been a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and has provided military support to his government.\n\nThe news comes as the Syrian civil war enters its sixth year, with no end in sight. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, and the displacement of millions more.\n\nAmnesty International is calling on the international community to take immediate action to address the human rights crisis in Syria. The organization is urging governments to impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for the human rights abuses, and to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict.\n\nThe report's findings are a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of the Syrian civil war, and the need for immediate action to protect the rights of those affected.",

        "Text": "Photographer Martin Schoeller has been taking portraits of some of the most iconic figures in the world, from bodybuilders to world leaders, for over two decades. His unique approach to photography has earned him widespread recognition and acclaim. Schoeller's photographs are not just aesthetically pleasing, but they also reveal the subject's true nature, as he believes that an \"honest\" photograph is one that shows the subject as they truly are.\n\nSchoeller's journey in photography began in the early 1990s, when he started working as an assistant to renowned photographer, Herb Ritts. During this time, he honed his skills and developed his own style, which focuses on capturing the subject's authenticity. His breakthrough came in 2003, when he published his first book, \"Obamaland,\" featuring portraits of then-Senator Barack Obama. The book became an instant hit, and it was praised for its candid portrayal of the future president.\n\nSince then, Schoeller has continued to work with a wide range of subjects, from celebrities like Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Jennifer Lawrence to athletes like LeBron James and Serena Williams. He has also taken portraits of world leaders, including former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and even the Dalai Lama.\n\nSchoeller's approach to photography is centered around his concept of \"honest\" photography. He believes that a true portrait should reveal the subject's true nature, rather than just showcasing their public image. To achieve this, he uses a unique combination of techniques, including unconventional lighting, bold compositions, and a focus on the subject's eyes.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Schoeller's photographs is the way he captures the subject's personality. His portraits often reveal a more vulnerable or introspective side of the subject, which is a far cry from the usual glamour and glitz of celebrity photography.\n\nSchoeller's work has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world, and he has received numerous awards and accolades for his photography. His photographs are also held in high esteem by his subjects, many of whom have praised his ability to capture their true essence.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian, Schoeller explained his approach to photography, saying, \"I'm not interested in creating a perfect image. I'm interested in creating an honest image. I want to show the subject as they truly are, not as they want to be seen.\"\n\nAs Schoeller continues to take portraits of some of the most fascinating figures in the world, his work serves as a reminder of the power of photography to reveal the truth and capture the essence of its subjects.",

Known for his fearlessness and unorthodox playing style, van der Westhuizen was a trailblazer who broke the mold of traditional rugby players.\n\nBorn on February 20, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, van der Westhuizen's love for rugby began at a young age. He made his professional debut in 1992 and quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with on the pitch. His exceptional skills, which included a powerful scrum-half, quick thinking, and unrelenting work rate, earned him a spot in the South African national team, the Springboks.\n\nDuring his illustrious career, van der Westhuizen won 78 caps for the Springboks, participating in two Rugby World Cups and earning a reputation as one of the greatest scrum-halves in the history of the sport. His fearless approach to the game inspired a generation of players, and his iconic try against England in the 1995 Rugby World Cup will forever be etched in the memories of rugby fans worldwide.\n\nOff the pitch, van der Westhuizen was equally remarkable. He was a vocal advocate for social justice and equality, using his platform to raise awareness about issues affecting the marginalized communities in South Africa. His passion for education led him to establish the Joost van der Westhuizen Foundation, which aimed to provide educational opportunities to underprivileged children.\n\nThroughout his life, van der Westhuizen remained humble and grounded, never losing sight of his roots and the values that shaped him. His unwavering dedication to his craft, his country, and his community earned him the respect and admiration of fans, teammates, and opponents alike.\n\nAs the rugby world mourns the loss of this incredible individual, we remember Joost van der Westhuizen not only as a brilliant player but also as a true leader who broke the mold of traditional rugby players.

The Cheeto, which has been dubbed the \"Harambe Cheeto,\" has been valued at a staggering $100,000, sparking a heated debate about the value of novelty items and the limits of human weirdness.\n\nThe Harambe Cheeto was discovered by a 24-year-old woman named Mariah who was snacking on a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos at a friend's house. As she reached for another handful, she noticed something peculiar - a Cheeto that looked eerily similar to the famous gorilla. Mariah took to social media to share her discovery, and the image quickly went viral, garnering millions of views and sparking a frenzy of comments and memes.\n\nThe value of the Harambe Cheeto was reportedly determined by a prominent auction house, which deemed it a \"unique and historic\" item due to its uncanny resemblance to the gorilla. The auction house's assessment was met with skepticism by many, who questioned the logic behind assigning such a high value to a mere Cheeto.\n\nAs news of the Harambe Cheeto spread, it sparked a wider conversation about the absurdity of the internet and the value we place on novelty items.

        "Text": "Narok, Kenya - In a remarkable turnaround, a group of Maasai warriors in Kenya who once hunted and killed lions for sport have now turned into wildlife warriors, dedicating their lives to protecting the very same predators they once feared.\n\nThe Maasai people, who inhabit the Rift Valley region of Kenya, have traditionally had a complex relationship with lions. In the past, they would hunt and kill the big cats for sport, viewing them as a threat to their livestock. However, over the years, the Maasai have come to realize the importance of preserving the lion population and the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThe change in attitude is largely attributed to the efforts of a local conservation organization, the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust (MWCT). The organization has been working with the Maasai community to educate them on the importance of conservation and to provide them with alternative sources of income.\n\nOne of the key initiatives of the MWCT is the Lion Guardians program, which employs former lion-hunters as wildlife warriors. These warriors, who are now known as \"lion guardians,\" are tasked with monitoring lion prides, tracking poachers, and working with local authorities to protect the lions and their habitats.\n\nThe program has been highly successful, with the number of lion killings by Maasai warriors decreasing significantly over the past few years. In fact, a recent survey by the MWCT found that over 90% of Maasai warriors who were once involved in lion hunting now support conservation efforts and are actively working to protect the lions.\n\nThe lion guardians are also being trained in other conservation skills, such as tracking, surveillance, and community outreach. This not only helps to protect the lions but also provides the Maasai warriors with a sense of purpose and a new source of income.\n\nThe success of the Lion Guardians program is a testament to the power of community-based conservation and the importance of engaging local communities in conservation efforts. By working together, conservation organizations and local communities can achieve great things and help to protect the world's precious wildlife.",

But few people know that he also uses a secret weapon to spread joy and positivity: playful humor. In a recent interview, the Dalai Lama revealed that he believes humor is a powerful tool for bringing people together and creating a sense of community.\n\nAccording to the Dalai Lama, playful humor is a way to break down barriers and connect with others on a deeper level. He believes that by using humor, people can let their guard down and be more authentic, which can lead to deeper and more meaningful relationships.\n\nBut how can we, as ordinary people, use playful humor to bring more joy and positivity into our lives? The Dalai Lama suggests that we start by being playful and lighthearted, even in difficult situations. He encourages people to find the humor in everyday situations and to not take themselves too seriously.\n\nAdditionally, the Dalai Lama recommends using humor to connect with others. He suggests that we use playful humor to break the ice and build rapport with others, whether it's a colleague, a friend, or a stranger.\n\nThe Dalai Lama's emphasis on playful humor is not just a personal quirk, but rather a key component of his approach to spirituality and personal growth. He believes that by cultivating a sense of humor, people can become more compassionate, more patient, and more understanding.\n\nIn a world that can sometimes seem serious and somber, the Dalai Lama's message of playful humor is a refreshing reminder of the importance of joy and positivity. By incorporating playful humor into our daily lives, we can create a more lighthearted and compassionate world, one joke at a time.\n\n###",

        "Text": "As the United States enters a new era under the presidency of Donald Trump, concerns about the health of democracy in the country are growing. The 2016 presidential election was marked by controversy and division, with many Americans feeling that the democratic process was compromised by foreign interference, voter suppression, and biased media coverage.\n\nSince taking office, President Trump has taken several actions that have raised eyebrows among democracy advocates. His executive orders on immigration and refugees have been criticized for being overly broad and potentially unconstitutional. His administration has also been accused of attempting to silence dissenting voices, including by restricting access to information and cracking down on leaks.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has been gridlocked, with many lawmakers feeling that they are unable to effectively check the president's power. The Senate has been unable to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and the House has been unable to pass a bill to fund the government.\n\nDespite these challenges, many Americans are finding ways to resist and advocate for their rights. Protest movements have sprung up across the country, with millions of people taking to the streets to demand action on issues such as climate change, immigration reform, and healthcare.\n\nIn addition, many organizations and individuals are working to protect and defend democracy. The ACLU has been at the forefront of challenging the Trump administration's policies, and other groups such as the NAACP and the Sierra Club are also fighting to protect the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nAs the fight for democracy continues, it is clear that the stakes are high. The future of the country depends on the ability of its citizens to come together and demand that their leaders prioritize the common good.",

        "Text": "In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that United States President Donald Trump has become a key ally for Russian President Vladimir Putin in his country's ongoing war on the West. The development has left many stunned, as it appears that Trump's campaign promises of improving relations with Russia have been replaced with a full-fledged alliance.\n\nThe news comes as a result of a series of recent meetings and phone calls between Trump and Putin, which have been shrouded in secrecy. While details of the conversations are still scarce, it is clear that the two leaders have been working closely together to further their shared interests.\n\nTrump's decision to side with Putin has been met with widespread criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who are accusing him of putting the interests of Russia ahead of those of the United States. The move is seen as a major betrayal of the country's allies, particularly those in Eastern Europe who have been under threat from Russian aggression.\n\nIn a statement, Trump defended his actions, saying that he is working to create a better relationship with Russia in order to improve the lives of American citizens. However, many are skeptical of his motives, given the significant economic and political benefits that Russia stands to gain from the alliance.\n\nThe news has also raised concerns about the potential for Russia to interfere in future elections, given its history of meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has repeatedly denied any involvement by Russia in his campaign, but many are still left wondering if he is truly committed to protecting the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it is clear that the world is watching with bated breath to see what will happen next. One thing is certain, however: Trump's decision to side with Putin has sent shockwaves around the globe, and it will be interesting to see how this development plays out in the coming months.",

The \"Saturday Night Live\" (SNL) star has been making headlines with her spot-on impersonation of Spicer, leaving the Press Secretary in a pickle.\n\nFor weeks, McCarthy has been portraying Spicer on SNL, capturing his mannerisms and speech patterns with uncanny accuracy. The sketch has become a fan favorite, with many praising McCarthy's impressive impression. However, Spicer seems to be taking it personally.\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Spicer expressed his frustration with the sketch, stating that it is \"sad\" and \"unfair\" to mock him. He also accused McCarthy of being \"desperate\" for attention. The remarks have sparked a heated debate, with many defending McCarthy's right to poke fun at the Press Secretary.\n\nDespite Spicer's concerns, McCarthy remains unfazed. In an interview with \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" she joked that she was \"honored\" to be the target of Spicer's ire. \"I think it's a badge of honor to be impersonated by Melissa McCarthy,\" she said with a chuckle.\n\nThe feud has sparked a national conversation about the role of comedy in politics and the importance of a sense of humor in the face of adversity. While Spicer may be struggling to find the humor in the situation, many are enjoying the lighthearted banter between the Press Secretary and the SNL star.\n\nAs the debate continues to rage on, one thing is clear: Melissa McCarthy has won the hearts of many with her hilarious impression of Sean Spicer. Whether or not the Press Secretary will be able to laugh off the jokes remains to be seen.",

The initiative is set to take place on March 14, 2017, and will involve students from over 100 colleges and universities across the United States.\n\nAccording to the organizers, #MyFreedomDay is a response to the growing concern about the persistence of slavery and human trafficking in the 21st century. The movement aims to mobilize students and young people to take action against these injustices and to demand that governments and corporations take concrete steps to prevent them.\n\nThe initiative will feature a range of activities, including awareness campaigns, fundraising events, and advocacy efforts. Participants will be encouraged to share their experiences and stories on social media using the hashtag #MyFreedomDay, and to participate in a global social media storm to raise awareness about the issue.\n\nThe organizers of #MyFreedomDay are working closely with anti-slavery organizations and advocacy groups to ensure that the initiative is effective and impactful. The movement is also supported by several prominent celebrities and public figures, who have pledged to participate and raise awareness about the issue.\n\nThe launch of #MyFreedomDay comes at a time when human trafficking and modern-day slavery are increasingly recognized as major global problems. According to the International Labor Organization, there are an estimated 21 million people trapped in modern slavery worldwide, with the majority being women and girls.\n\nThe movement is also timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), a landmark legislation that aimed to combat human trafficking and modern-day slavery. The TVPA has been credited with helping to reduce the number of human trafficking cases in the United States, but organizers of #MyFreedomDay argue that more needs to be done to eradicate the problem.\n\nAs #MyFreedomDay approaches, students and young people around the world are gearing up to take action against modern-day slavery and human trafficking. With its global reach and social media momentum, the movement has the potential to make a significant impact and to inspire a new generation of activists and advocates to take on this critical issue.",

        "Text": "OTTAWA - The issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada has been a long-standing concern, but a recent report by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) has shed light on a disturbing trend: sex traffickers are targeting Indigenous Canadian women and girls.\n\nAccording to the report, which was released in June 2016, Indigenous women and girls are disproportionately represented among Canada's sex trade, with some estimates suggesting that they make up as much as 50% of the sex trade industry. This is despite the fact that Indigenous people make up only 4.9% of the Canadian population.\n\nThe CCPA report, titled \"Stolen Sisters: The Human Rights Crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada,\" highlights the systemic issues that contribute to the vulnerability of Indigenous women and girls to sex trafficking. These include poverty, lack of access to education and employment opportunities, and the legacy of colonialism and forced assimilation.\n\nThe report also notes that many Indigenous women and girls are forced into the sex trade by traffickers who prey on their vulnerability. These traffickers often use tactics such as manipulation, coercion, and violence to keep their victims captive and under their control.\n\nThe issue of sex trafficking among Indigenous women and girls is not limited to Canada. According to the International Justice Mission, a non-profit organization that works to combat human trafficking, Indigenous women and girls are disproportionately affected by sex trafficking in many countries around the world.\n\nThe Canadian government has faced criticism for its response to the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, including the lack of a comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of the problem. The CCPA report calls for increased funding for services and programs that support Indigenous women and girls, as well as a national inquiry into the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nThe issue of sex trafficking among Indigenous women and girls is a complex and deeply disturbing one, and it will require a concerted effort from government, community organizations, and individuals to address. It is a reminder of the urgent need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to addressing the systemic issues that contribute to the vulnerability of Indigenous women and girls.\n\n###",

        "Text": "A 32-year-old man was arrested in California after a detective discovered a small but crucial detail in a photo he posted online, leading to his identification as a child predator. The suspect, who has not been named, was arrested on April 19, 2016, and is being held on suspicion of multiple counts of child pornography and distribution of child pornography.\n\nAccording to the authorities, the suspect had posted a photo of himself on a social media platform, which caught the attention of a detective from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office. The detective, who was working on a tip about a possible child predator, noticed something unusual in the photo - a tattoo on the suspect's hand that matched a description from a previous investigation.\n\nThe detective, who has been working on the case for several months, had been reviewing hundreds of tips and photos when he came across the suspect's image. He immediately recognized the tattoo and realized that it was the same one described by a victim in a previous case.\n\nThe detective then worked with the suspect's social media provider to obtain more information about the account, including the suspect's IP address and other identifying details. This led to a search warrant being issued for the suspect's home, where authorities found evidence of child pornography and other incriminating materials.\n\nThe suspect was arrested at his home and is currently being held without bail. The authorities have released few details about the case, but it is believed that the suspect had been producing and distributing child pornography for several years.\n\nThe arrest is a testament to the importance of online detective work and the impact that a small detail can have in solving a complex case. The detective who made the arrest has been praised for his diligence and attention to detail, and the authorities are now working to identify any potential victims of the suspect's crimes.\n\nThe case is a reminder of the importance of online safety and the need for parents and children to be aware of the risks associated with social media. It also highlights the crucial role that law enforcement plays in protecting children from predators and bringing perpetrators to justice.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the authorities are urging anyone with information about the suspect or his activities to come forward. The case is a sobering reminder of the importance of staying vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the authorities.",

The brand, which was once a symbol of Trump's business acumen and success, has become a hot potato, with many businesses and individuals distancing themselves from the Trump name.\n\nThe issue is not just about Trump's controversial presidency, but also about the potential damage to the brand's reputation. Many of Trump's business partners and associates have publicly distanced themselves from him, citing his divisive rhetoric and questionable business practices. This has led to a significant decline in the value of the Trump brand, with many businesses and individuals no longer wanting to associate themselves with the Trump name.\n\nThe Trump Organization has also faced several lawsuits and investigations, including a federal lawsuit filed by the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia, alleging that Trump's for-profit education company, Trump University, defrauded thousands of students. The company has also faced scrutiny over its dealings with foreign governments, including its handling of a $100 million deal with a Chinese government-owned company.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Trump Organization remains committed to the Trump brand, with the company's CEO, Donald Trump Jr., stating that the brand will continue to thrive despite the controversy surrounding it. However, many experts believe that the brand's reputation will continue to suffer as long as Trump remains in office.\n\nIn conclusion, the Trump brand has become a hot potato, with many businesses and individuals distancing themselves from the Trump name. The brand's reputation has taken a significant hit, and it remains to be seen whether the Trump Organization can recover from the controversy surrounding it.",

        "Text": "In his first month in office, President Donald Trump has been making headlines with his unconventional approach to politics. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has chosen to focus on creating fear and uncertainty rather than offering reassurance and calm. This shift in tone has left many Americans wondering why Trump is opting for a strategy that has historically been unsuccessful.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of Trump's scare tactics is his repeated claims that his predecessor, Barack Obama, wiretapped him during the 2016 presidential election. Despite a lack of evidence, Trump has continued to assert that Obama was involved in a conspiracy to undermine his campaign. This narrative has been widely debunked by fact-checkers and intelligence agencies, but Trump's persistence has created a sense of unease among many Americans.\n\nTrump's approach to healthcare is another area where he has chosen to focus on fear rather than hope. Rather than highlighting the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Trump has opted to emphasize the potential drawbacks and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the healthcare system. This strategy has been criticized by many experts, who argue that it is unfair to create fear and anxiety among those who rely on the ACA for their healthcare.\n\nTrump's use of fear-mongering has also been evident in his approach to national security. In his first major speech on the topic, Trump painted a dire picture of the threats facing the United States, from terrorism to cyber attacks. While it is true that these threats exist, many experts argue that Trump's approach is overly alarmist and may actually create more problems than it solves.\n\nSo why is Trump opting for a strategy that has historically been unsuccessful? One possible explanation is that Trump believes that fear and uncertainty are effective tools for achieving his policy goals. By creating a sense of crisis, Trump may be attempting to justify his own policies and actions, which may be unpopular with many Americans.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that Trump is simply not equipped to handle the demands of the presidency. As a businessman, Trump is used to making deals and creating wealth, but he may not have the same level of expertise in areas such as foreign policy and national security. As a result, he may be relying on fear and uncertainty to create a sense of urgency and justify his own decisions.\n\nRegardless of the reason, Trump's approach to politics is a departure from the strategies used by his predecessors. While some may see it as a refreshing change, others may view it as a cause for concern. As the new president continues to shape his administration, it will be important to monitor his approach and evaluate its effectiveness in achieving his goals.\n\n###",

However, a review of Trump's remarks and the senator's statements suggests that Trump's accusation is unfounded.\n\nDuring a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Trump praised Gorsuch, saying that he is \"a highly respected judge\" and \"a man of great integrity.\" However, he also took issue with Blumenthal's comments about Gorsuch's criticism of a 2006 opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nBlumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, had stated that Gorsuch's criticism of Kennedy's opinion in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey was \"a fundamental departure from established law\" and \"a radical departure from the settled law of the land.\" Trump responded by saying that Blumenthal was \"misrepresenting\" his comments on Gorsuch.\n\nHowever, a review of Trump's remarks shows that he did not criticize Blumenthal's comments on Gorsuch's criticism of Kennedy's opinion. Instead, Trump praised Gorsuch and defended his nomination for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe controversy over Trump's accusation against Blumenthal highlights the intense political debate surrounding Gorsuch's nomination. Democrats have criticized Gorsuch's views on issues such as abortion and workers' rights, while Republicans have praised his conservative credentials.\n\nAs the nomination process continues, the debate over Gorsuch's qualifications and views is likely to remain a central issue.

The deportation, which took place at the Tucson Airport, marks a significant setback for the family and has raised concerns about the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nAccording to reports, the mother, who has been living in the United States for over a decade, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents last week. She was then transferred to a detention center in Arizona, where she was held for several days before being deported to her native Mexico.\n\nThe mother's deportation is the latest in a string of high-profile cases in Arizona, where ICE agents have been cracking down on immigration violators. The move has sparked widespread outrage, with many arguing that the Trump administration is targeting undocumented immigrants and their families.\n\n\"We are deeply disturbed by this development and the harm it will cause to this family,\" said Chris Newman, executive director of the Arizona-based advocacy group, Border Action Network. \"The Trump administration's deportation policies are tearing families apart and causing irreparable harm to communities across the country.\"\n\nThe mother's deportation has also sparked concerns about the impact it will have on her three U.S.-born children, who are now left without a primary caregiver. The family's lawyer, Ray Ybarra, said that the children are \"devastated\" by their mother's deportation and are struggling to come to terms with the loss.\n\n\"We are doing everything we can to support this family and ensure that they are reunited as soon as possible,\" Ybarra said. \"This is a heartbreaking situation, and we hope that the Trump administration will reconsider its deportation policies and prioritize family unity.\"\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, advocates are calling on the Trump administration to rethink its approach to immigration enforcement and to prioritize family unity. In the meantime, the family's supporters are holding vigils and protests to raise awareness about the impact of deportation on families and communities.\n\nThe mother's deportation is a stark reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by immigrant families in the United States. As the debate over immigration reform continues to rage on, one thing is clear: the fate of families like this one hangs in the balance.",

The Turkish military said the strike was carried out by Russian warplanes, but Moscow has yet to confirm the incident.\n\nThe Turkish military said the strike caused significant damage to the outpost and killed three soldiers, with several others injured. The wounded were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.\n\nThe incident is likely to further strain relations between Russia and Turkey, which have been at odds over the conflict in Syria. Russia has been a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey has backed opposition groups seeking to overthrow him.\n\nThe Turkish military has been involved in a military campaign in northern Syria, known as Operation Euphrates Shield, which aims to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State militants. The operation has been backed by Turkish artillery and airstrikes.\n\nThe Russian airstrike came as Turkish and Russian military officials were holding talks in Moscow to discuss the conflict in Syria. The talks were aimed at reducing tensions between the two countries, which have been at odds over the conflict.\n\nThe incident is likely to raise concerns about the safety of Turkish troops in Syria and the risk of accidental strikes.

The find, announced on February 2, 2017, is considered one of the most significant in decades, offering a unique glimpse into the history and culture of the Second Temple period.\n\nThe cave, located near the ancient city of Qumran, is believed to date back to the 2nd century BCE, a time when the Essenes, a Jewish sect, lived in the area. The discovery was made by a team of Israeli archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, led by Dr. Oren Gutfeld.\n\nAccording to Dr. Gutfeld, the cave contains a large number of scrolls, including biblical texts, commentaries, and apocryphal works. While the exact number of scrolls has not been disclosed, the team estimates that the cave may hold up to 10 times more material than the famous Cave 4, which is currently the largest repository of Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of ancient Jewish texts, were first discovered in 1947 by a Bedouin shepherd. The find has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 20th century, providing valuable insights into the history and culture of the ancient Jewish world.\n\nThe new cave discovery is expected to shed further light on the daily lives, beliefs, and practices of the Essenes and other Jewish groups living in the region during the Second Temple period. The team is currently working to excavate the cave and preserve the fragile scrolls, which will be studied and translated by experts in the field.\n\nThe discovery is also expected to attract tourists and scholars from around the world, boosting the local economy and promoting cultural exchange.\n\nAs the excavation and conservation efforts continue, the world waits with bated breath for the secrets that the new Dead Sea Scrolls cave will reveal.

The 12-year-old boy, whose identity has been kept anonymous, was born with a condition known as Parapagus, a type of conjoined twins where the twins are joined at the pelvis.\n\nThe boy's parents, who hail from the eastern state of Odisha, had noticed the unusual birthmark on their child's body and had taken him to a local hospital for treatment. However, the hospital was unable to provide the necessary treatment, and the family was forced to seek help from a higher-level hospital in the city.\n\nDr. Suresh Rao, a pediatric surgeon at the hospital, was called in to operate on the boy. According to Dr. Rao, the surgery was a complex procedure that required a team of specialists to work together to separate the conjoined twins.\n\n\"We had to work carefully to ensure that the boy's organs and blood vessels were not damaged during the surgery,\" Dr. Rao said in an interview. \"It was a challenging procedure, but we were able to successfully separate the twins and repair the damaged tissue.\"\n\nThe surgery, which took several hours to complete, was a success, and the boy is now recovering in the hospital.

        "Text": "The wife of Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent critic of the Russian government, has accused the Kremlin of being responsible for her husband's mysterious illness. In an interview with the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Irina Kara-Murza claimed that her husband had been poisoned, likely by the Russian government, due to his vocal opposition to the Kremlin's policies.\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza, 39, is a Russian opposition leader and a member of the People's Freedom Party (PARNAS), a liberal democratic party that has been critical of the Russian government. He has been a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin and has spoken out against human rights abuses and corruption in Russia.\n\nKara-Murza fell ill on April 5, 2017, while attending a television program in Moscow. He suffered from severe headaches, dizziness, and numbness in his legs and was hospitalized shortly after. His condition rapidly deteriorated, and he was placed in an induced coma.\n\nIrina Kara-Murza claims that her husband's illness is a result of a deliberate attack by the Russian government, citing his recent public statements and his involvement in the opposition movement. She also pointed out that several other Russian opposition leaders and activists have been targeted and injured or killed in recent years.\n\nThe Russian government has denied any involvement in Kara-Murza's illness, with the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, stating that the allegations are \"absurd\" and \"groundless.\" However, Irina Kara-Murza is convinced that her husband's illness is a direct result of his political activism and the Russian government's efforts to silence him.\n\nThe case has sparked widespread concern and outrage, with many human rights groups and opposition leaders calling for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Kara-Murza's illness. The incident has also raised questions about the safety of Russian opposition leaders and activists, who often face harassment, intimidation, and violence at the hands of the government.\n\nAs the investigation into Kara-Murza's illness continues, his wife remains by his side, fighting for his recovery and demanding justice for her husband's suspected poisoning. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by Russian opposition leaders and the importance of protecting their rights and freedoms.",

        "Text": "In a surprising turn of events, Scottish tennis star Andy Murray has issued a warning to his fellow tennis legend Roger Federer, advising him to steer clear of deep-fried Mars bars. The unusual advice came during a recent charity event in London, where the two tennis greats were in attendance.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, Murray was overheard cautioning Federer about the potential dangers of indulging in the sweet and savory treat. \"I know it sounds weird, but trust me, you don't want to go down that road,\" Murray allegedly said. \"I learned the hard way that deep-fried Mars bars are not for the faint of heart.\"\n\nWhile the exact reason behind Murray's warning remains unclear, sources close to the tennis star have revealed that he had a particularly unpleasant experience with the deep-fried Mars bars in the past. \"Andy got a little too enthusiastic with the fried Mars bars during a tournament after-party, and let's just say it didn't end well for him,\" a friend of Murray's explained.\n\nFederer, known for his love of fine dining and indulgent treats, seemed taken aback by Murray's warning. \"I'm not sure what's gotten into Andy, but I think I'll take his advice under consideration,\" the Swiss tennis icon joked during a post-event interview.\n\nAs news of the unusual warning spread, fans and fellow athletes alike took to social media to weigh in on the matter. Some joked that Murray was simply trying to get under Federer's skin, while others praised the tennis star for his honesty and concern for his friend's well-being.\n\nRegardless of the motivations behind Murray's warning, one thing is certain: deep-fried Mars bars are no longer a safe bet for tennis enthusiasts looking to indulge in a sweet treat.

        "Text": "A groundbreaking study has shed new light on the relationship between autism and brain structure, revealing that women with brains resembling those of men may be at a higher risk of developing the disorder. The research, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, provides a crucial breakthrough in understanding the complex interplay between brain anatomy and autism risk.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Dheeraj Rai from the University of Cambridge, analyzed brain scans of over 1,000 individuals, including both men and women with autism and those without the condition. The researchers used a technique called tractography to map the brain's white matter tracts, which are responsible for transmitting signals between different brain regions.\n\nThe results showed that women with autism had brains that were more similar to those of men, particularly in the areas responsible for social cognition and language processing. These regions are typically larger and more developed in men, and the study found that women with autism had a greater number of these \"male-like\" brain features.\n\nThis unique brain structure was linked to a higher risk of developing autism, with women who had more \"male-like\" brains being nearly three times more likely to have the condition than those with more \"female-like\" brains. The researchers also found that the brain structure differences were more pronounced in women with high-functioning autism, who often have better language skills and are more likely to be diagnosed with the condition.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of autism and its prevalence in women. While autism is typically thought of as a male-dominated disorder, it is estimated that up to 20% of individuals with autism are women. The research suggests that women may be more likely to be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed due to the differences in brain structure, and that a more nuanced understanding of the disorder is needed.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Dheeraj Rai, emphasized the importance of further research in this area, stating, \"This study highlights the need for more research into the causes of autism in women and the potential role of brain structure in this process.\" He added, \"We hope that our findings will contribute to a better understanding of autism and ultimately lead to improved diagnosis and treatment options for women with the condition.\"\n\nThe study's results have sparked excitement among researchers and clinicians, who are eager to explore the implications of this groundbreaking research. As our understanding of autism continues to evolve, it is clear that the complex interplay between brain structure and function is a crucial area of study. With further research, we may uncover new insights into the causes and prevalence of autism, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for individuals affected by the disorder.",

The Shanghai-based choir, \"The Sound of Silence,\" has been making waves among the country's 18- to 35-year-olds, who are flocking to their performances in droves.\n\nFounded in 2014 by 27-year-old conductor, Li Zhen, the choir is made up of around 50 members, ranging in age from 20 to 30. Despite the lack of traditional Chinese musical instruments, the group has gained a massive following among young people who are looking for a respite from the fast-paced, technology-driven world they live in.\n\n\"We're not just a choir, we're a community,\" says Li. \"We provide a space for people to relax, to express themselves, and to connect with others who share their passions and values.\"\n\nThe choir's popularity can be attributed to its unique blend of traditional Western choral music and modern Chinese pop songs. Their performances often feature a mix of classical instruments, such as violins and cellos, alongside more contemporary elements, like electric guitars and synthesizers.\n\nBut what really sets \"The Sound of Silence\" apart is their focus on mental health and wellness. In a society where long working hours and intense pressure to succeed are the norm, the choir offers a much-needed escape for young people who are struggling to cope.\n\n\"We're not just singing, we're also talking about mental health, we're talking about self-care, we're talking about mindfulness,\" says Li. \"We're providing a platform for people to share their stories and to find support.\"\n\nThe choir's efforts have not gone unnoticed. They have been featured on popular Chinese television shows and have performed at numerous high-profile events, including the Shanghai International Arts Festival.\n\nAs the choir continues to grow in popularity, it's clear that their message of hope and resilience is resonating with young people across China.

The program, which is still in its early stages, involves analyzing photos taken by hotel guests and comparing them to known images of suspected sex traffickers.\n\nThe idea behind the initiative is that many sex traffickers use hotels to house their victims and conduct their illegal activities. By analyzing photos taken in these hotels, investigators hope to identify patterns and connections that could help them track down and apprehend the traffickers.\n\nThe FBI has partnered with several major hotel chains, including Marriott, Hilton, and InterContinental, to access their photo databases. The agency is also working with other law enforcement agencies, including local police departments and immigration authorities, to share information and coordinate efforts.\n\nWhile the program is still in its early stages, officials say they have already made some promising discoveries. In one case, investigators used a photo taken in a hotel room to identify a suspected sex trafficker who was later arrested and charged with multiple counts of human trafficking.\n\nThe initiative is part of a broader effort by law enforcement agencies to use technology to combat human trafficking. Other initiatives include using social media to track down suspected traffickers and using data analytics to identify patterns and trends in trafficking activity.\n\nWhile the use of hotel room photos to catch sex traffickers is a new and innovative approach, it has raised some concerns about privacy and the potential for abuse. Some have expressed worries that the program could be used to monitor and track the activities of innocent people, rather than just suspected traffickers.\n\nHowever, officials say that the program is designed to be targeted and focused, and that they are taking steps to ensure that the privacy of hotel guests is protected. They also emphasize that the program is a critical tool in the fight against human trafficking, and that it has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of victims and their families.\n\nAs the program continues to evolve and expand, officials say they will continue to work closely with hotel chains and other stakeholders to ensure that it is effective and responsible. They also urge anyone with information about human trafficking to come forward and report it to the authorities.",

        "Text": "In a groundbreaking study, NASA astronauts Mark and Scott Kelly, also known as the Kelly twins, have provided scientists with a wealth of information on how the human body reacts to prolonged periods in space. The twins, who spent a year apart - Mark in space and Scott on Earth - have allowed researchers to compare the effects of microgravity on their bodies, shedding light on the mysteries of human physiology in space.\n\nThe 12-month experiment, known as the NASA Twins Study, aimed to investigate the effects of space travel on the human body, particularly on the immune system, gene expression, and other physiological processes. The study was conducted from March 2015 to March 2016, with Mark Kelly spending 340 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) while his twin brother Scott remained on Earth.\n\nResearchers at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and other institutions have been analyzing the data collected during the study, which includes blood samples, urine tests, and other health metrics. Preliminary findings have revealed some surprising insights into how the human body adapts to space travel.\n\nOne of the most significant discoveries is that the immune system is more active in space than on Earth. The study found that Mark Kelly's immune system produced more antibodies and had a stronger response to vaccines than his brother's on Earth. This could have implications for future space missions, where the immune system may be more susceptible to infection.\n\nAnother key finding is that the twins' bodies underwent changes in gene expression, with some genes being turned on or off in response to space travel. This could have significant implications for our understanding of how the human body responds to environmental changes, such as those experienced in space.\n\nThe study has also provided valuable insights into the effects of microgravity on the human body. For example, the twins' bodies underwent changes in bone density, with Mark Kelly experiencing a loss of bone mass in his legs and hips. This could have implications for long-duration space missions, where astronauts may be at risk of developing osteoporosis.\n\nThe NASA Twins Study has provided a wealth of information on the effects of space travel on the human body. As NASA continues to plan for future missions to Mars and beyond, understanding how the human body reacts to space travel will be crucial in ensuring the health and well-being of astronauts.\n\nTitle: The Kelly twins: Revealing the secrets of the human body in space",

        "Text": "Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, known for her fiery rhetoric and unyielding advocacy for the American people, has once again taken to the Senate floor to express her frustration and disappointment with the latest developments in the nation's healthcare system.\n\nIn a passionate speech delivered on February 7, 2017, Warren criticized the newly-passed Republican bill aimed at repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The senator, who has been a long-time champion of healthcare reform, argued that the proposed legislation would have devastating consequences for millions of Americans who rely on the ACA for their healthcare coverage.\n\n\"We feel your pain, Senator Warren,\" tweeted a flurry of supporters, echoing her sentiments and expressing solidarity with her efforts to protect the ACA. The hashtag #WeFeelYourPain began trending on social media, with many users sharing their own personal stories of how the ACA has positively impacted their lives.\n\nWarren's speech came on the heels of a contentious debate on the Senate floor, where Republican lawmakers voted to advance the bill, despite strong opposition from Democrats. The proposed legislation would repeal key provisions of the ACA, including the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid, leaving many Americans vulnerable to losing their healthcare coverage.\n\nIn her speech, Warren emphasized the importance of preserving the ACA, citing its success in reducing the uninsured rate, increasing access to healthcare services, and promoting greater transparency and accountability in the healthcare industry. She also highlighted the devastating impact that repeal would have on rural communities, where access to healthcare services is already limited.\n\nWarren's impassioned plea to her colleagues has sparked a national conversation about the importance of healthcare reform and the need to protect the most vulnerable members of society. As the debate continues to unfold, one thing is clear: Elizabeth Warren's voice will be heard, and her fight for the American people will not be silenced.",

        "Text": "As President Donald Trump's first month in office comes to a close, his administration's unconventional approach to governance is drawing both praise and criticism from lawmakers, experts, and the general public. Trump's emphasis on delegation and empowerment has led to a unique distribution of power within his administration, with some cabinet members and advisors taking on significant roles in shaping policy.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Trump's leadership style is his willingness to delegate authority to his cabinet members. Rather than micromanaging every detail, Trump has given his appointees significant autonomy to make decisions and take action. This approach has led to a more streamlined decision-making process, with officials able to respond quickly to emerging issues.\n\nFor example, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been given a free hand to negotiate with foreign leaders, while Secretary of Defense James Mattis has been tasked with overseeing the military's response to emerging threats. Similarly, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been empowered to take a leading role in shaping the Justice Department's priorities.\n\nTrump's delegation of power has also led to a more fluid and adaptive approach to governance. Rather than being bogged down in bureaucratic red tape, Trump's officials are able to respond quickly to changing circumstances and make decisions that may not have been possible under a more traditional approach.\n\nHowever, Trump's emphasis on delegation has also raised concerns about accountability and transparency. With the president and his advisors taking on a more hands-off approach to governance, some lawmakers and experts worry that important decisions may be made without adequate oversight or public input.\n\nAs Trump's administration continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether his unconventional approach to governance will prove successful or whether it will lead to a lack of accountability and transparency. One thing is certain, however: Trump's willingness to delegate power has already led to a more dynamic and responsive approach to governance, and it will be interesting to see how this approach plays out in the months and years to come.",

        "Text": "KYIV, Ukraine - As the conflict in eastern Ukraine drags on, the Ukrainian government is growing increasingly frustrated with what it perceives as a lack of support from the West. The country has been fighting Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since April 2014, and the conflict has resulted in over 9,000 deaths and over 1 million displaced persons.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been vocal about his concerns, stating that Ukraine is \"fighting for its independence and sovereignty\" and that the international community has a responsibility to support it. However, despite a series of diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions against Russia, Ukraine feels that it has been left to fight alone.\n\nThe Ukrainian government is particularly upset with the European Union, which it believes has failed to provide sufficient economic support. Ukraine's economy has been severely impacted by the conflict, with the country's GDP contracting by over 10% in 2015. The country has also struggled to implement key reforms, such as introducing a new tax code and improving the business environment, due to a lack of resources.\n\nIn recent weeks, tensions have escalated further, with Ukrainian forces engaged in intense fighting in the Donetsk region. The Ukrainian military has reported significant gains, but the conflict remains ongoing, and the humanitarian situation remains dire.\n\nThe Ukrainian government is now looking to the United States for support, with President Poroshenko set to meet with President Donald Trump in the coming weeks. However, even if the US does provide additional support, it remains unclear whether it will be enough to turn the tide of the conflict.\n\nAs the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate, the country's leaders are left wondering why the West is not doing more to support them. The lack of support has led to a growing sense of isolation and abandonment, which could have long-term consequences for Ukraine's ability to defend itself and achieve its goals.",

The Russian Defense Ministry stated that intelligence gathered from various sources, including satellite imagery and human intelligence, suggests that ISIS is preparing to send a large group of fighters to the city.\n\nThe news comes as Syrian government forces, backed by Russian airpower, have been making gains against ISIS in the region. In recent weeks, Syrian troops have recaptured several key cities and towns from ISIS control, including the city of Deir Ezzor.\n\nPalmyra, known for its stunning ancient architecture, was once a major cultural and economic center in the ancient world.

(AP) - Authorities in California have ordered the evacuation of thousands of people living near a series of dams in the northern part of the state due to concerns over the potential for catastrophic failures.\n\nThe evacuation order was issued on Tuesday evening by the Butte County Sheriff's Office, which cited the potential for \"uncontrolled releases\" of water from the Oroville Dam, the tallest dam in the United States.\n\nThe dam, located about 75 miles north of Sacramento, is one of several in the Lake Oroville system that have been facing heavy rainfall and snowmelt in recent days. The dam's spillway, which is used to release excess water, has been damaged, leading to concerns that the dam could fail and send a massive amount of water downstream.\n\nAs a precaution, authorities have ordered the evacuation of about 180,000 people living in the area, including the cities of Oroville and Chico. Residents were told to leave immediately and head to higher ground.\n\n\"This is not a drill,\" said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea. \"We are taking this situation very seriously and are asking everyone to take it seriously as well.\"\n\nThe evacuation order came as a storm system brought heavy rain and strong winds to the region, causing the American River to overflow its banks and forcing the closure of several roads.\n\nThe California Department of Water Resources said in a statement that the dam's spillway is being monitored closely and that crews are working to repair it as quickly as possible. However, officials said that the dam's emergency spillway, which is used in the event of a failure, is still intact and functioning properly.\n\nThe situation is being closely monitored by state and federal officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.",

The whales, which were discovered on February 9, were in a state of decomposition and were at risk of exploding due to the buildup of gases in their bodies.\n\nThe decision to puncture the carcasses was made after experts assessed the situation and determined that the whales were beyond saving. According to a spokesperson for the Department of Conservation, the move was taken to prevent any potential harm to humans or the environment.\n\n\"We understand that this may seem unusual, but in this case, it was the most responsible and safest course of action,\" said the spokesperson. \"The whales were in a very advanced state of decomposition, and we had to take action to prevent any potential harm or damage.\"\n\nThe 20 pilot whales, which were all females, were found stranded on a beach in the Chatham Islands, a remote archipelago located about 800 kilometers east of New Zealand's mainland. The whales were estimated to be around 4-5 meters in length and were believed to have been alive just days before they stranded.\n\nThe puncturing of the carcasses was carried out by a team of conservation officials and scientists, who used specialized equipment to make small holes in the whales' bodies to release the built-up gases. The process was monitored closely to ensure that it was done safely and humanely.\n\nThe stranding of the whales has sparked an investigation by conservation officials, who are working to determine the cause of the event. The incident is believed to be one of the largest whale strandings in New Zealand's history.\n\nIn the meantime, the punctured carcasses will be left on the beach to decompose naturally, and conservation officials will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that there are no further incidents. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of conservation efforts and the need for ongoing research and monitoring to protect these majestic creatures.",

The move marks a significant shift in US policy towards the island nation, which has been a major point of contention in the region.\n\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, the White House said that the US government will no longer refer to Taiwan as a \"sovereign state\" and will instead recognize the \"One China\" policy, which recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China.\n\nThe decision comes just days after Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the phone, during which they discussed a range of issues including trade, security, and the South China Sea. Trump's administration had previously signaled a willingness to challenge Beijing's claims in the region, but the president's comments during the call seemed to suggest a shift in approach.\n\nThe move has been welcomed by Beijing, which has long been opposed to any recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state. The Chinese government has seen the \"One China\" policy as a fundamental principle of its national sovereignty and has used it to justify its claims over the island.\n\nTaiwan's government, on the other hand, has expressed disappointment and frustration over the decision. The island's president, Tsai Ing-wen, has vowed to continue to defend Taiwan's sovereignty and democratic way of life, and has called on the international community to recognize Taiwan's right to self-determination.\n\nThe decision is likely to have significant implications for the region, and could potentially destabilize the delicate balance of power in the Asia-Pacific. The US has long been a major supporter of Taiwan, and its recognition of the island as a sovereign state has been seen as a key factor in maintaining stability in the region.\n\nThe move is also likely to have significant implications for the US-China relationship, which has been strained in recent years over issues such as trade, security, and human rights. The decision could potentially mark a new era in US-China relations, with the two countries potentially working together more closely on a range of issues.\n\nOverall, the decision to back down on the \"One China\" policy marks a significant shift in US policy towards Taiwan, and could potentially have significant implications for the region and the world.",

The nomination comes as Trump continues to fill key positions in his administration.\n\nAcosta, a Cuban-American, has a long history of public service, having served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2001 to 2005. He also served as the dean of the Florida International University College of Law from 2009 to 2013.\n\nAs the nominee for Labor Secretary, Acosta would be responsible for overseeing the Department of Labor, which is responsible for enforcing labor laws and ensuring worker safety. Trump has been vocal about his plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has led to concerns about the potential impact on workers' benefits and protections.\n\nIn a statement, Trump praised Acosta, saying, \"Alex has a brilliant record of working to protect the rights of workers and to promote economic growth. He will be a fantastic Secretary of Labor, and I am honored to have him join my administration.\"\n\nAcosta's nomination has been met with support from some business groups, who see him as a pro-business candidate. However, some labor unions have expressed concerns about his record on workers' rights and his views on the minimum wage.\n\nThe nomination now goes to the Senate for confirmation, where it is expected to face scrutiny from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. If confirmed, Acosta would replace Thomas Perez, who served as Labor Secretary under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe announcement comes as Trump continues to build his administration, with many key positions still vacant. The nomination of Acosta to Labor Secretary marks another step in the process of filling out Trump's cabinet.",

        "Text": "President Donald Trump has announced plans to issue a new executive order on immigration, following a court ruling that blocked his original order aimed at restricting travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. The Department of Justice (DOJ) had asked a federal appeals court to hold off on a decision regarding the original order, but the court denied the request, leading to its suspension.\n\nThe original order, which was signed on January 27, was widely criticized for its perceived targeting of Muslims and sparked widespread protests and legal challenges. A federal judge in Seattle, Washington, ultimately blocked the order, citing constitutional violations.\n\nTrump's new order is expected to be more targeted and less broad in its restrictions, according to sources close to the administration. The order is likely to focus on specific national security concerns and may include additional safeguards to address the legal concerns raised by the original order.\n\nThe DOJ's decision to ask the court to hold off on a decision regarding the original order was seen as an attempt to buy time and gather more information before the court made a final ruling. However, the court's denial of the request means that the original order is now effectively suspended, pending further legal action.\n\nThe White House has not yet released details about the new order, but officials have indicated that it will be issued in the coming weeks. The move is seen as an effort to rebrand the administration's immigration policies and address the concerns raised by the original order.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the original order has had significant implications for the administration's relationships with key allies and has sparked widespread debate about the role of religion in national security decision-making. The new order is likely to face similar legal challenges and public scrutiny, and will be closely watched by lawmakers, advocates, and the general public.\n\n### End of Article ###",

The news comes as a blow to the Trump administration, which had been expected to announce Faust's nomination for the role earlier this week.\n\nAccording to sources within the Harvard community, the FAS faculty voted overwhelmingly against supporting Faust's candidacy, citing concerns over her lack of experience in national security and her potential conflicts of interest. Faust, who served as Harvard's president from 2007 to 2018, is a renowned historian and expert in American studies, but her background is not in national security.\n\nThe decision by the FAS faculty is seen as a significant setback for the Trump administration, which had been counting on Faust's appointment to help shape its national security strategy. The role of National Security Adviser is a critical one, responsible for advising the President on matters of national security and coordinating the administration's foreign policy efforts.\n\nFaust's candidacy had been met with skepticism by some members of the Harvard community, who questioned her qualifications for the role and her potential ability to provide independent advice to the President. The FAS faculty's decision to reject her candidacy is seen as a reflection of these concerns.\n\nIt is unclear at this time whether the Trump administration will continue to pursue Faust's nomination or seek an alternative candidate for the position. The White House has yet to comment on the matter.\n\n###",

The visit, which is scheduled to take place next week, is likely to be overshadowed by the growing controversy surrounding the Trump administration's alleged ties to Moscow.\n\nAccording to sources, Pence's trip is part of a larger effort by the administration to strengthen ties with European allies and to reassure them of the US commitment to the region's security. However, the trip is also seen as an opportunity for the Vice President to address concerns over Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria, as well as the alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nThe trip comes at a time when the White House is reeling from the fallout of the latest developments in the Russia probe. On Tuesday, it was reported that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials, leading to his resignation from the administration.\n\nFlynn's departure has raised questions about the extent of Russia's influence within the Trump administration, and Pence's trip is likely to be scrutinized for any signs of Russian interference. The Vice President is expected to meet with European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, to discuss a range of issues, including the crisis in Ukraine and the fight against ISIS.\n\nHowever, with the Russia probe ongoing and the White House struggling to contain the fallout, Pence's trip is unlikely to be without controversy. The Vice President is expected to face tough questions from European leaders and the media about the administration's stance on Russia, and whether the US is doing enough to hold Moscow accountable for its actions.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is working to shore up its response to the Russia crisis. On Wednesday, the White House announced that it would impose new sanctions on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine, a move that is seen as an attempt to demonstrate the administration's commitment to addressing the crisis.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Pence's trip is seen as an important opportunity for the US to strengthen its ties with European allies and to reassure them of the US commitment to the region's security. However, with the Russia probe ongoing and the White House struggling to contain the fallout, the trip is unlikely to be without controversy.",

With over two decades of experience in the field, Dubke has worked with various high-profile clients, including the Republican National Committee and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe appointment comes as the Trump administration has faced criticism over its handling of communications, particularly in the aftermath of the president's first few weeks in office. The move is seen as an attempt to address concerns over the White House's ability to effectively convey its message to the public.\n\nDubke's background in crisis communications and his experience working with Republican leaders could prove invaluable in navigating the current political landscape. His appointment is also seen as a sign of the White House's willingness to shake things up and bring in fresh perspectives.\n\nThe official announcement of Dubke's appointment is expected to be made in the coming days, pending a background check and other necessary clearances. As the new communications director, Dubke will be tasked with reorganizing the White House communications team and implementing a more effective strategy for getting the administration's message out to the public.\n\nThis move is likely to be closely watched by both supporters and critics of the Trump administration, as the White House looks to regain control of the narrative and set a more positive tone for the remainder of the president's first term.",

This assurance came during a meeting with the leaders of the Baltic States - Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania - in Brussels on February 16, 2017.\n\nThe meeting took place ahead of a scheduled NATO foreign ministers' meeting, where the alliance is expected to discuss its relations with Russia. Tillerson's statement is seen as a bid to alleviate concerns among NATO allies that the US might be considering a separate deal with Russia to ease tensions in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe US Secretary of State emphasized that any deal with Russia would require the involvement and consent of NATO allies, and that the US would not pursue any agreements that would compromise the security and interests of its allies. He also reiterated the US commitment to the collective defense of NATO members, as enshrined in Article 5 of the NATO treaty.\n\nThe Baltic States, which share a border with Russia and have been a major focus of Russian aggression in recent years, have been particularly concerned about the US-Russia relationship. They have been seeking reassurance from the US that it will not abandon them or compromise their security in any deal with Russia.\n\nTillerson's statement is seen as a significant development in the ongoing efforts to ease tensions between the US and Russia. The two countries have been at odds over a range of issues, including the conflict in Ukraine and Russia's alleged meddling in the US presidential election.\n\nThe meeting between Tillerson and the Baltic leaders also touched on other issues, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the situation in Syria. The US Secretary of State reiterated the US commitment to supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and urged Russia to fulfill its obligations under the Minsk agreements aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe meeting came as NATO foreign ministers were preparing to gather in Brussels for a meeting aimed at discussing the alliance's relations with Russia. The meeting is expected to focus on the ongoing tensions between the West and Russia, as well as the alliance's efforts to strengthen its collective defense capabilities.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between the US and Russia, Tillerson's statement is seen as a significant development. It is likely to be welcomed by NATO allies, who have been seeking reassurance from the US that it will not compromise their security in any deal with Russia.",

In a move that is likely to escalate tensions between Malaysia and North Korea, police have told Pyongyang that they will not return the body of Kim Jong-nam unless they receive the DNA samples of his family members.\n\nThe demand was made public on Wednesday, as the investigation into the assassination of Kim Jong-nam entered its fourth day. The 45-year-old was killed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13, after being attacked with a nerve agent at the airport's departure gate.\n\nMalaysian police have been working closely with international authorities to identify the suspects and uncover the motives behind the assassination.

The attack, which took place during a procession to mark the birthday of the Sufi saint, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, is the deadliest in Pakistan this year.\n\nThe blast occurred at around 6:30 a.m. local time, when thousands of devotees had gathered at the shrine, a revered site for Sufis and Muslims alike. The suicide bomber, who was wearing a vest packed with explosives, detonated the device near the entrance of the shrine, causing widespread destruction and chaos.\n\n\"I was praying inside the shrine when I heard a loud explosion,\" said Muhammad Rashid, a survivor who was injured in the blast. \"I saw people running and screaming, and I knew something terrible had happened.\"\n\nPakistani officials have blamed the attack on a militant group, the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, which is affiliated with the Taliban. The group has claimed responsibility for several other attacks in the country, including a bombing at a Christian church in Lahore last year that killed 15 people.\n\nThe attack has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across Pakistan, with many calling for greater action to be taken against militant groups. The country's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, has vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice and has ordered an investigation into the attack.\n\nThe blast has also raised concerns about the safety of religious sites in Pakistan, which have been targeted by militants in the past. The shrine in Sehwan is a popular pilgrimage site for Sufis and Muslims, and the attack has left many in the community feeling shaken and vulnerable.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, rescue teams and medical personnel have been working to treat the injured and recover the bodies of the dead. The Pakistani military has also been deployed to the area to maintain order and provide support to the local authorities.\n\nThe attack on the shrine in Sehwan is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by militant groups in Pakistan, and the need for greater cooperation and coordination between the government, security forces, and the community to prevent such attacks in the future.",

The astonishing revelation has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, offering new insights into the Earth's geological history.\n\nLocated east of Australia, Zealandia spans approximately 4 million square kilometers, roughly the size of India. It was previously thought to be a submerged portion of the Australian continental plate, but further research has revealed that it is, in fact, a distinct continent.\n\nLed by a team of researchers from New Zealand's University of Auckland, the study utilized advanced mapping techniques and geological data to confirm the existence of Zealandia. The team's findings were published in the journal GSA Today on February 15, 2017.\n\n\"This is a game-changer,\" said Professor Nick Mortimer, the lead researcher on the project. \"Zealandia is a significant discovery that challenges our understanding of the Earth's geological history. It provides new insights into the formation of continents and the movement of tectonic plates.\"\n\nThe team's research suggests that Zealandia was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana, which began to break apart around 180 million years ago. Over time, Zealandia sank beneath the ocean, a process known as continental rifting.\n\nThe discovery of Zealandia has significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's geology and the formation of continents. It also raises questions about the potential for undiscovered species and ecosystems within the newly identified continent.\n\n\"This find has opened up new avenues for research and exploration,\" said Dr. Mortimer. \"We're excited to learn more about Zealandia and its secrets.\"\n\nThe discovery of Zealandia is a testament to the power of scientific inquiry and the importance of continued exploration and research. As scientists continue to study this newly identified continent, we can expect to uncover even more fascinating insights into the Earth's history and the secrets it holds.",

Trump's tumultuous start has been marked by a series of controversial decisions, inflammatory statements, and chaotic management style, which have raised doubts about his ability to lead the country.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is Trump's lack of experience in government. Despite having never held a political office, Trump has been making major decisions without consulting with experts or following established protocols. His recent executive orders on immigration and refugee policies, for instance, have been criticized for being poorly thought out and potentially illegal.\n\nAnother worry is Trump's penchant for tweeting. His frequent use of social media to make announcements and attack his opponents has led to confusion, misinformation, and diplomatic incidents. Many are concerned that Trump's tweets are not only unprofessional but also potentially harmful to the country's reputation and national security.\n\nFurthermore, Trump's relationship with his advisors and cabinet members has been strained, with reports of frequent disagreements and power struggles. His decision to fire Acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce his immigration ban has raised concerns about the limits of his authority and the rule of law.\n\nAs a result, many are questioning whether Trump has the temperament and leadership skills necessary to be an effective president. His performance has sparked widespread anxiety about the direction of the country and the potential consequences of his decisions.\n\n\"We're seeing a president who is making decisions based on his own whims and biases, rather than careful consideration and expert advice,\" said Dr. Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \"This is a recipe for disaster, and it's only a matter of time before something goes terribly wrong.\"\n\nDespite these concerns, Trump remains defiant, insisting that his opponents are trying to undermine his authority and that he is doing a great job as president. However, as the days go by, it's clear that the nation is facing a critical period, and the stakes could not be higher.\n\nAs the country navigates these uncertain times, one thing is certain: the next few months will be crucial in determining the trajectory of Trump's presidency and the future of the United States.",

This statement came during a meeting with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and other officials at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nTrump's comments were in response to the ongoing debate over his administration's immigration policies and the increased focus on deporting undocumented immigrants. The President has made it clear that his administration is committed to enforcing the country's immigration laws and removing those who are in the country illegally.\n\n\"We're going to do it, and we're going to do it quickly,\" Trump said during the meeting. \"It's a military operation, believe me. It's a big operation, and it's going to be very successful.\"\n\nTrump's comments were met with criticism from some lawmakers and advocacy groups, who argue that the President's language is overly aggressive and may be scaring or intimidating certain groups of people. However, Trump's administration has maintained that the focus on deportations is necessary to ensure public safety and national security.\n\nThe administration has also emphasized that it is working to streamline the deportation process and make it more efficient. This includes implementing new technologies and training programs for immigration officials, as well as increasing the number of detention centers and immigration courts.\n\nThe President's comments on deportations come as his administration is facing criticism for its handling of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was established by former President Barack Obama to provide temporary protection from deportation to certain young undocumented immigrants. Trump's administration has announced plans to phase out the program, which has led to widespread protests and criticism from lawmakers and advocacy groups.\n\nDespite the criticism, Trump's administration remains committed to its immigration policies and is moving forward with its plans to deport undocumented immigrants. The President's comments on deportations are likely to be seen as a further indication of his administration's tough stance on immigration, and may have significant implications for the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States.",

De Lima has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless\" and \"politically motivated.\"\n\nThe warrant was issued after the prosecution presented evidence that De Lima had received money from a convicted drug lord, which she allegedly used to fund her 2016 senatorial campaign. De Lima's lawyers have denied the allegations, saying that the money was given to her as a loan to help her pay off debts.\n\nThe arrest warrant is the latest move in Duterte's efforts to silence his critics and consolidate power. The president has faced widespread criticism for his brutal campaign, which has been marked by extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses.\n\nDe Lima's arrest has been condemned by human rights groups and opposition lawmakers, who have called for the charges against her to be dropped. The International Commission of Jurists has also expressed concern about the use of the judiciary to silence political opponents.\n\nThe arrest warrant comes as the Philippine government faces growing international pressure to address its human rights record. The United Nations has called for an investigation into the extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses, and several countries have called for the government to respect the rule of law and human rights.\n\nThe Philippines is set to host the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in April, which is expected to be attended by leaders from around the world. The arrest of De Lima is likely to be a major topic of discussion at the summit, and could have implications for the country's relations with the international community.",

The notice will include a description of the suspects, their aliases, and any known addresses or travel patterns.\n\nMalaysian police have identified four North Korean suspects, including Ri Jong-chol, who is believed to be the mastermind behind the assassination. The other three suspects are Ri Jae-nam, Kim Uk-jin, and Hong Song-nam.\n\nThe investigation has been complicated by North Korea's refusal to cooperate with Malaysian authorities, with the country's ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, being recalled from his post earlier this week.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has said that the country will not be intimidated by North Korea's actions and will continue to pursue those responsible for the assassination. \"We will not be swayed by any threats or intimidation,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the use of chemical weapons and the involvement of North Korea in international terrorism. The United States and South Korea have both condemned the assassination, with the US calling it a \"reckless and barbaric act.\"\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and Malaysian authorities are working with international partners to bring those responsible to justice.

In a recent interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, the Pope suggested that it might be better to be an atheist than a bad Christian. This statement has sparked a lively debate among Catholics and non-Catholics alike, with many interpreting it as a call for moral accountability within the Church.\n\nThe Pope's comments were made in response to a question about the rise of secularism and the decline of religious faith in Europe. Francis emphasized the importance of faith, but also acknowledged the existence of \"bad\" Christians who use their faith as a pretext for moralizing and judging others. He stated that these individuals do more harm to the Church than atheists, who at least do not pretend to be something they are not.\n\nFrancis' remarks have been seen as a reflection of his long-standing emphasis on the importance of compassion, mercy, and humility in faith. He has repeatedly criticized the Church's history of judgmentalism and exclusivity, and has instead called for a more inclusive and loving approach to faith.\n\nThe Pope's comments have also been seen as a response to the growing trend of secularization in Europe. Many have interpreted his statement as a recognition that the Church must adapt to changing societal values and attitudes, rather than trying to impose its own beliefs and morals on others.\n\nReaction to the Pope's statement has been mixed, with some Catholics praising his willingness to challenge traditional dogma and others expressing concern that he is undermining the authority of the Church. Atheists and secularists, on the other hand, have welcomed the Pope's remarks as a recognition of the importance of individual freedom and autonomy.\n\nRegardless of one's interpretation, Pope Francis' statement serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of moral accountability and the need for faith to be lived out in a way that is compassionate, merciful, and humble. As the Catholic Church continues to grapple with the challenges of the 21st century, Francis' words offer a powerful call to action for believers and non-believers alike.",

        "Text": "In a rare public speaking appearance, White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon offered a glimpse into the Trump administration's agenda during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 22, 2017. Bannon's address provided insight into the administration's plans for the economy, healthcare, and national security, as well as its views on the media and the opposition party.\n\nBannon began his speech by emphasizing the need for a \"movement\" to challenge the existing political and economic order. He argued that the Trump administration is committed to dismantling the regulatory state and reducing the role of government in the economy. To achieve this, Bannon outlined several key initiatives, including a review of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, a repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and a reduction in corporate tax rates.\n\nOn healthcare, Bannon reiterated the administration's commitment to repealing the ACA, which he characterized as a \"monstrous\" piece of legislation. He also praised the House Republicans' plan to replace the ACA, which he described as a \"step in the right direction.\" However, Bannon cautioned that the plan needs to be improved and emphasized the need for a more comprehensive approach to healthcare reform.\n\nRegarding national security, Bannon emphasized the importance of a strong military and a more assertive foreign policy. He criticized the Obama administration's approach to national security, which he characterized as \"weak\" and \"ineffective.\" Bannon also praised President Trump's decision to launch a missile strike against a Syrian airbase in response to the country's use of chemical weapons.\n\nIn addition to discussing policy, Bannon also took aim at the media and the opposition party. He accused the media of being \"fake news\" and \"enemies of the people,\" and he criticized Democrats for their resistance to the Trump agenda. Bannon also praised the Trump base, which he characterized as a \"movement\" of ordinary Americans who are committed to making America great again.\n\nOverall, Bannon's speech provided a glimpse into the Trump administration's agenda and its approach to governance. While the speech was short on specifics, it offered a sense of the administration's priorities and its commitment to challenging the existing political and economic order. As the Trump administration moves forward, it will be interesting to see how it implements its agenda and responds to the challenges it faces.",

The news has sparked widespread concern over the potential interference of the Trump administration in the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a move that has been described as unprecedented, the FBI declined to publicly refute the reports, which were first published by The New York Times and The Washington Post. The stories alleged that Trump campaign officials had repeated contacts with Russian officials during the election season, and that Trump himself had been briefed on the matter.\n\nThe White House had requested that the FBI issue a statement denying the reports, but the agency refused, citing the ongoing investigation and the need to maintain the integrity of the probe. The decision has raised questions about the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to intervene in the investigation, and whether the FBI is willing to stand up to political pressure.\n\nThe controversy comes as the FBI is facing increasing scrutiny over its handling of the investigation into Russian meddling. The agency has been criticized for its slow pace in releasing information to the public, and for its handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and has accused the FBI and other intelligence agencies of perpetuating a \"witch hunt\" against the president. However, the refusal of the FBI to knock down the reports has added to the growing sense of unease and distrust surrounding the Trump administration.\n\nThe FBI's decision to refuse the White House request has been hailed by some as a sign of the agency's commitment to maintaining its independence and integrity. However, others have expressed concern that the move could be seen as a sign of bias against the Trump administration.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the public remains divided on the issue. Some have called for the FBI to release more information about the investigation, while others have accused the agency of being overly secretive and lacking transparency.\n\nIn the meantime, the controversy has raised questions about the role of the FBI in American politics, and the extent to which the agency should be allowed to operate independently of political pressure. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen how the FBI will handle the ongoing scrutiny, and whether the agency will be able to maintain its independence in the face of growing political pressure.",

The toxic substance was reportedly applied to Kim's face using a cloth, which was then thrown away.\n\nPolice have identified four North Korean suspects, including Ri Jong Chol, Ri Jae Nam, and Hong Song Nam, who are believed to have been involved in the assassination. The fourth suspect, Kim Uk, is believed to be a member of North Korea's military intelligence agency.\n\nMalaysian police have also seized a number of items, including a packet of NEXLURON, a medication used to treat seizures, and a bottle of NEXLURON cream, which was found in the suspects' luggage. The items are believed to have been used to disguise the VX nerve agent.\n\nThe investigation has been led by the Malaysian police, with assistance from the FBI and other international agencies. The suspects are currently being held in custody, and an autopsy has been conducted on Kim's body.\n\nThe use of VX nerve agent in the assassination has sparked international outrage, with many countries condemning the attack. The United Nations has also condemned the use of the banned chemical weapon, calling it a \"heinous\" act.\n\nThe motive behind the assassination is still unclear, but it is believed to be linked to Kim Jong Nam's involvement in a plot to overthrow his half-brother. Kim Jong Nam had been living in exile in Malaysia and had been critical of his half-brother's regime.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the use of chemical weapons and the need for international cooperation to prevent such attacks in the future. It has also highlighted the fragile relationship between North Korea and its neighbors, and the potential for further tensions in the region.\n\n###",

        "Text": "VX, also known as O-Ethyl S-(2-diisopropylaminoethyl) methylphosphonothiolate, is a highly toxic and deadly nerve agent that is considered to be one of the most toxic substances known to man. It is a chemical warfare agent that was first developed in the 1960s by the United Kingdom and has since been banned by international treaty.\n\nVX is a clear, colorless, and odorless liquid that is highly soluble in water and other organic solvents. It is a potent neurotoxin that works by disrupting the normal functioning of the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death.\n\nThe effects of VX exposure can be severe and rapid. Inhaling or ingesting even a small amount of VX can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, blurred vision, and difficulty speaking or swallowing. If left untreated, these symptoms can progress to paralysis, respiratory failure, and ultimately death.\n\nVX is a highly potent and deadly substance, with an LD50 of just 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. This means that even a small amount of VX can be lethal, making it one of the most dangerous substances known to man.\n\nDespite its extreme toxicity, VX is not as well-known as some other nerve agents, such as sarin or mustard gas. This is likely due to the fact that VX is not as widely used or produced as these other agents, and is therefore less likely to be encountered in a military or terrorist context.\n\nIn recent years, there have been several high-profile incidents involving VX, including the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in 2017. The incident highlighted the dangers and consequences of VX and the need for international cooperation to prevent its use.\n\nIn conclusion, VX is a highly toxic and deadly nerve agent that is considered to be one of the most dangerous substances known to man. Its effects can be severe and rapid, and even a small amount of VX can be lethal. As such, it is important to be aware of the risks and consequences of VX and to work towards preventing its use in military or terrorist contexts.",

It's a disaster for the transgender community, it's a disaster for the country, and it's a disaster for the world.\" Jenner, who is a transgender woman and a former Olympic athlete, was a prominent supporter of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump's decision, announced on February 22, reverses the guidance issued by the Obama administration in May 2016, which stated that public schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. The guidance was intended to ensure that transgender students were treated with respect and dignity, and that they were able to access the same educational opportunities as their non-transgender peers.\n\nJenner expressed her concern that the Trump administration's decision will lead to increased discrimination and bullying against transgender students. \"This is not just about bathrooms, this is about human rights,\" she said. \"This is about allowing people to live their lives with dignity and respect.\"\n\nJenner also criticized Trump's decision to appoint a commission to study the issue, rather than simply allowing transgender students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. \"A commission is not going to solve this problem,\" she said. \"This is a human rights issue, and it needs to be addressed now.\"\n\nJenner's comments reflect the widespread opposition to Trump's decision from the LGBTQ community and its allies. Many have expressed concern that the decision will lead to increased discrimination and violence against transgender individuals, and have called on Trump to reconsider his decision.\n\nIn the meantime, Jenner has pledged to continue fighting for the rights of transgender individuals. \"I'm not going to stop fighting for this,\" she said. \"I'm going to keep fighting until we get equality and justice for all people, regardless of their gender identity or expression.\"",

Jones' decision comes amidst growing scrutiny over Trump's business dealings and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nJones, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump's policies, said in a statement that he believes the American people have a right to know the president's financial information. \"As a member of Congress, I have a responsibility to ensure that the government is transparent and accountable to the people,\" Jones said. \"Releasing the president's tax returns is a step in the right direction towards building trust with the American people.\"\n\nJones' call for transparency comes as Trump's administration has faced criticism for its handling of the president's business empire. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, many experts have questioned the legitimacy of this claim, and several lawmakers have called for the release of the documents.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump's tax returns has sparked a heated debate in Washington, with some lawmakers calling for greater transparency and others defending the president's decision to keep his financial information private.\n\nAs the debate continues, Jones' decision to call for the release of Trump's tax returns has been met with both praise and criticism. While some have praised Jones for standing up for transparency and accountability, others have accused him of being disloyal to the president.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Jones' move is likely to add to the growing pressure on Trump to release his tax returns. With the IRS audit claim facing increasing scrutiny, the president may be forced to reconsider his stance on the matter.\n\nIn the meantime, Jones' decision has sent a clear message to the American people: that even within the Republican Party, there are voices calling for greater transparency and accountability in government. As the debate over Trump's tax returns continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether Jones' call for transparency will have any impact on the president's decision-making process.",

The shocking decision was made public on Thursday, February 24, 2017, and has sent shockwaves throughout the football world.\n\nRanieri's departure comes after a dismal run of results, which has seen Leicester City win just one of their last 11 matches in the Premier League. The team has slipped to 18th place in the standings, just above the relegation zone, and the club's owners have decided to take drastic action to turn their season around.\n\nDespite his incredible achievement in leading Leicester City to the title, Ranieri's tactics and team selection have been questioned by many fans and pundits in recent weeks. The team's defense has been particularly porous, conceding 24 goals in their last 11 matches, and Ranieri's failure to address this issue has been seen as a major contributing factor to his downfall.\n\nThe decision to sack Ranieri has been met with widespread shock and disbelief, with many questioning the timing and logic behind the move.

The sanctions, which included a ban on coal exports, were passed in an effort to curb Pyongyang's nuclear program.\n\nHowever, North Korea has reacted angrily to the move, with a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs calling the ban \"a grave provocation\" and accusing China of \"sacrificing the interests of the DPRK and the people for the sake of its own interests\".\n\nThe statement also accused China of \"dancing to the tune of the US\" and of being \"more loyal to the US than to the DPRK\". The comments are seen as a significant escalation of tensions between the two nations, which have traditionally been close allies.\n\nThe ban on coal imports is a significant blow to North Korea's economy, which is heavily reliant on coal exports. The country has been trying to diversify its economy, but coal exports have been a key source of revenue.\n\nThe move is also seen as a significant test of the relationship between North Korea and China, which has traditionally been the reclusive state's main ally.

Trump made the claim during a press conference at the White House on February 16, 2017.\n\nTrump's statement came as the latest leak, involving a conversation between him and the leader of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, sparked widespread outrage and raised concerns about national security. The leak, which was published by The Washington Post, revealed that Trump had pressured Peña Nieto to publicly announce that Mexico would pay for a border wall, a claim that had been disputed by the Mexican government.\n\nTrump's accusations against Obama were met with skepticism by many in the media and political circles, who pointed out that there was no evidence to support the claim. The former president's team also denied any involvement in the leaks, with a spokesperson calling Trump's accusations \"baseless\" and \"unsubstantiated.\"\n\nDespite the lack of evidence, Trump's statement was seen as an attempt to shift the focus away from the controversy surrounding the leaks and towards his predecessor. The move was also seen as an effort to appeal to his base, which has been critical of Obama's administration.\n\nThe leaks have been a major headache for the Trump administration, which has struggled to contain the flow of sensitive information. The latest leak, involving the conversation with Peña Nieto, was the third major leak in as many weeks, and it has raised concerns about the security of the information.\n\nThe White House has been working to identify the source of the leaks, but so far, no one has been charged or identified as the culprit.

According to sources in Seoul, the executions took place in April 2016, but the information was only recently confirmed by the South Korean government.\n\nThe officials, who were part of the North Korean military's elite corps, were accused of plotting against the government of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. The executions were reportedly carried out by firing squad, a method commonly used by the North Korean regime for punishing perceived enemies.\n\nThe South Korean government has long been critical of North Korea's human rights record, and the reported executions have sparked concerns about the regime's brutal treatment of its own citizens. The North Korean government has a history of executing officials who are seen as threats to its power, and the latest executions are likely to have sent a chilling message to anyone who might be considering challenging the regime.\n\nThe executed officials included Ri Yong-ho, who served as defense minister from 2012 to 2015, as well as several other high-ranking military officers. The exact circumstances of their alleged treachery are not known, but it is believed that they were accused of plotting to overthrow Kim Jong-un or collaborating with foreign powers.\n\nThe reported executions come at a time of heightened tensions between North and South Korea, with the North Korean regime continuing to develop its nuclear weapons program and the South Korean government imposing economic sanctions in response. The executions are likely to have further strained relations between the two countries, and may have significant implications for regional stability.\n\n###",

        "Text": "A significant blow has been dealt to the terrorist organization al Qaeda with the reported death of its deputy leader, Abu Muhammad al-Masri, in Syria. The killing of the Egyptian national is a major setback for the group, which has been fighting to establish a stronghold in the war-torn country.\n\nAccording to reports, al-Masri was killed in a drone strike carried out by the United States in the Idlib province of Syria. The strike, which was authorized by the Trump administration, targeted a meeting of high-ranking al Qaeda leaders, resulting in the death of al-Masri and several other top officials.\n\nAl-Masri, who was believed to be in his mid-50s, had been a key figure in al Qaeda's operations in Syria and was responsible for overseeing the group's activities in the country. He was also believed to have played a significant role in the planning and execution of terrorist attacks around the world.\n\nThe killing of al-Masri is seen as a major victory for the United States and its allies in the fight against terrorism. It comes at a time when the US is increasing its military presence in the region, with the goal of defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) and other terrorist groups.\n\nThe death of al-Masri is also a significant blow to al Qaeda's leadership, which has been reeling from a series of setbacks in recent years. The group's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has been in hiding for several years, and the killing of al-Masri leaves a significant power vacuum at the top of the organization.\n\nThe US military has been carrying out drone strikes in Syria for several years, targeting ISIS and other terrorist groups. The strikes have been authorized by the Obama and Trump administrations, and have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of terrorist fighters.\n\nThe killing of al-Masri is the latest in a series of significant blows to al Qaeda's leadership. In 2011, the group's leader, Osama bin Laden, was killed in a raid by US Navy SEALs in Pakistan. Since then, several other top officials have been killed or captured, including the group's second-in-command, Abu Yahya al-Libi.\n\nThe death of al-Masri is likely to have significant implications for the fight against terrorism in the region. It is unclear at this time what the future holds for al Qaeda, but it is clear that the group will continue to be a major threat to regional and global security.",

        "Text": "BEIJING, China - In a move aimed at boosting its declining population, China is considering introducing a \"baby bonus\" policy to encourage couples to have a second child. The proposal comes as the country struggles to balance its economic growth with its rapidly aging population.\n\nAccording to reports, the Chinese government is considering a range of incentives, including a one-time payment of up to 10,000 yuan (approximately $1,500) for couples who have a second child. The payment would be made to help offset the costs associated with raising a second child, including education and healthcare expenses.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant shift in China's family planning policies, which have been in place since the 1970s. Under the current one-child policy, couples are allowed to have two children if one of the parents is an only child, but many couples have chosen to have only one child due to the financial and emotional burdens associated with raising a family.\n\nThe \"baby bonus\" policy is seen as a way to address China's demographic challenges, including a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce. The country's working-age population, which includes people between the ages of 15 and 64, has been declining since 2012, and is expected to continue to decline over the coming years.\n\nThe proposal has been welcomed by many in China, who see it as a step in the right direction towards addressing the country's demographic challenges. However, others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the country's economy and social stability.\n\n\"It's a good start, but it's not enough,\" said Wang Feng, a demographer at the University of California, Berkeley. \"China needs to do more to address the root causes of its demographic challenges, including the lack of social support for families and the high cost of living.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has not yet announced when the \"baby bonus\" policy will be implemented, but it is expected to be rolled out in the coming months. In the meantime, the government is expected to continue to monitor the impact of its current family planning policies and make adjustments as necessary.\n\n###",

        "Text": "President Donald Trump delivered two major speeches within a span of a week, showcasing his leadership style, policy priorities, and communication skills. The inaugural address on January 20, 2017, and the address to a joint session of Congress on February 28, 2017, offered a unique opportunity to compare and contrast Trump's message, tone, and delivery.\n\nThe inaugural address was a more personal and introspective speech, with Trump focusing on his vision for America and the struggles the country faces. He spoke about the need for unity, the importance of the American people, and the challenges posed by globalization, terrorism, and other issues. Trump's inaugural address was marked by its simplicity, with short sentences and a straightforward tone. He also made references to his campaign promises, such as building a wall along the US-Mexico border and repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn contrast, Trump's address to Congress was more policy-focused, with the President outlining his legislative agenda and highlighting his administration's achievements in the first month. Trump used the speech to emphasize his commitment to creating jobs, cutting taxes, and reducing regulations. He also took a more confrontational tone, criticizing Democrats and accusing them of obstructionism.\n\nOne notable difference between the two speeches was Trump's use of language. In the inaugural address, Trump spoke about the \"American carnage\" and the \"cancer\" of politics, using vivid imagery to convey his message. In the address to Congress, Trump's language was more measured, with a focus on policy details and administrative actions.\n\nDespite these differences, both speeches showcased Trump's ability to connect with his audience and inspire his supporters. The inaugural address was marked by its emotional appeal, with Trump's words resonating with many Americans who felt frustrated with the political status quo. The address to Congress, on the other hand, demonstrated Trump's capacity to deliver a clear and concise message, highlighting his ability to communicate complex policy ideas to a broad audience.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's inaugural address and address to Congress offered a unique glimpse into the President's leadership style and communication skills. While the two speeches had distinct tones and focuses, they both demonstrated Trump's ability to inspire and connect with his audience. As Trump continues to navigate the complexities of the presidency, his ability to deliver effective speeches will be crucial in shaping his legacy and achieving his policy goals.",

The women, dressed in white, wore a symbolic nod to the women's suffrage movement and the struggle for women's rights.\n\nThe event, which was organized by Rep. Lois Frankel (D-FL), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), aimed to highlight the importance of women's participation in politics and the need for continued advocacy on issues such as healthcare, education, and equal pay. The attendees, which included a mix of lawmakers, activists, and constituents, came together to express their concerns about the potential impact of the Trump administration on women's rights.\n\nDuring the event, the women held signs and banners bearing messages of resistance, such as \"We Resist,\" \"We Persist,\" and \"We Are Watching.\" The gathering served as a powerful display of unity and determination, as the attendees acknowledged the challenges ahead and vowed to continue fighting for the rights and interests of women.\n\nThe symbolic act of wearing white drew parallels to the suffragettes, who wore white to symbolize purity and innocence as they fought for the right to vote. The move was seen as a powerful statement, emphasizing the importance of women's voices in the political landscape.\n\nIn a statement, Rep. Frankel emphasized the significance of the event, saying, \"Today, we stand together as women to reject the divisive and discriminatory rhetoric of the incoming administration. We will continue to fight for the rights and dignity of women and all marginalized communities.\"\n\nThe event served as a strong statement of defiance and a testament to the power of collective action. As the Trump administration takes office, the women who gathered at the U.S. Capitol have made it clear that they will not be silenced and will continue to advocate for the rights and interests of women.",

However, following widespread criticism and legal challenges to the initial executive order issued in January, the White House announced that it would revise the ban to address concerns over religious discrimination.\n\nIn his speech to Congress, President Trump touted his administration's efforts to combat terrorism and praised the men and women of the U.S. military, law enforcement, and intelligence agencies for their bravery and dedication. The speech was widely seen as an attempt to shift the focus away from the travel ban controversy and towards the President's broader agenda.\n\nDespite the delay, opponents of the travel ban have vowed to continue their legal challenges, citing concerns that the ban targets Muslims and is therefore unconstitutional. Several states, including Washington, Minnesota, and Hawaii, have already filed lawsuits against the administration, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has launched a nationwide campaign to block the ban.\n\nThe delay is seen as a significant concession by the Trump administration, which had initially insisted that the travel ban was necessary to ensure national security. However, it remains unclear whether the revised ban will address the concerns of critics or simply delay the inevitable legal showdown.\n\nIn the meantime, the delay has sparked a mixed reaction from lawmakers and advocacy groups. While some have welcomed the delay as a sign of compromise, others have criticized the administration for attempting to \"rewrite\" the Constitution to justify its actions.\n\nAs the debate over the travel ban continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the controversy has raised important questions about the balance between national security and individual rights, and the role of the executive branch in shaping U.S. immigration policy.",

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was seen shaking her head in disbelief as Trump touted his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sat with her arms crossed, her expression a mix of frustration and concern.\n\nOn the Republican side, some lawmakers were visibly thrilled by Trump's promises to reduce taxes, cut regulations, and boost infrastructure spending. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) beamed with pride as Trump vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, while Representative Steve Scalise (R-La.) was seen nodding enthusiastically as the president touted his plan to build a wall along the US-Mexico border.\n\nHowever, not all Republicans were won over by Trump's words. Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) looked unimpressed, his eyes fixed on the speaker as Trump made claims about the country's economic prowess. Representative Justin Amash (R-Mich.) was seen scribbling notes, his expression a mixture of skepticism and concern.\n\nThe most striking reaction, however, came from Representative Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who was visibly moved to tears as Trump spoke about the struggles of working-class Americans. Her emotional response was met with applause from both sides of the aisle, a rare moment of bipartisan unity in an otherwise divided Congress.\n\nAs the speech came to a close, lawmakers from both parties filed out of the chamber, their faces a reflection of the complex emotions that had played out during the address. While some were undoubtedly inspired by Trump's words, others were left wondering what the future held for the country. One thing was clear, however: the looks on lawmakers' faces during Trump's speech would be remembered for a long time to come.",

The move is seen as a significant blow to Le Pen's political career, as it allows prosecutors to investigate her for spreading hate speech and inciting terrorism.\n\nThe investigation into Le Pen's Twitter activity began in 2015, after she shared three gruesome images of ISIS executions on her account. The images showed the beheadings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, as well as the murder of a Syrian pilot. Le Pen claimed at the time that she had not seen the images before sharing them, and that she was unaware of their content.\n\nHowever, French prosecutors have long suspected that Le Pen was aware of the images' content, and that she shared them in an attempt to stir up anti-Muslim sentiment among her supporters. The investigation has been ongoing for over a year, with Le Pen repeatedly denying any wrongdoing.\n\nThe loss of Le Pen's parliamentary immunity means that she can now be questioned by prosecutors and potentially charged with a crime. The move has been welcomed by many in France, who see Le Pen's actions as irresponsible and harmful.\n\n\"This is a major victory for the rule of law in France,\" said Philippe Martinez, the head of the CGT union. \"Marine Le Pen's actions were unacceptable, and she must be held accountable for spreading hate speech and inciting terrorism.\"\n\nLe Pen has vowed to continue fighting the charges, and has accused the French government of launching a political witch hunt against her. However, many in France are skeptical of her claims, and see the investigation as a necessary step towards holding Le Pen accountable for her actions.\n\nThe investigation into Le Pen's Twitter activity is ongoing, and it is unclear what charges she may ultimately face. However, one thing is clear: the loss of her parliamentary immunity marks a significant turning point in the case, and could have far-reaching implications for Le Pen's political career.",

The shooter, Cedric Ford, was shot and killed by police shortly after the attack.\n\nMoreland, who was 21 at the time of the shooting, was celebrating his birthday with friends at the bar when the shooting started. He recalled the chaos and panic that erupted as people scrambled to get away from the gunfire.\n\n\"It was like a scene from a movie,\" Moreland said. \"People were screaming, running, trying to get out of the way. I was trying to get out of the way, but I got hit.\"\n\nMoreland said he remembers feeling a sharp pain in his leg as he fell to the ground. He was able to crawl to a nearby table and hide under it, where he remained until the shooting stopped.\n\nThe shooting has left Moreland with physical and emotional scars. He has undergone multiple surgeries to repair the damage to his leg and is still recovering from the trauma of the incident.\n\n\"It's been tough,\" Moreland said. \"I've had to deal with a lot of pain and anxiety. But I'm trying to stay positive and focus on my recovery.\"\n\nThe shooting has also had a profound impact on Moreland's relationships with his friends and family. He said he has become more cautious and paranoid, always looking over his shoulder to make sure he is safe.\n\n\"I used to be a very outgoing person, but now I'm more reserved,\" Moreland said. \"I don't like going out in public as much as I used to. It's hard for me to feel safe anymore.\"\n\nAs Moreland continues to heal and recover, he is grateful for the support of his loved ones and the community. He said he is also grateful for the bravery of the police officers who responded to the shooting and were able to stop the gunman.\n\n\"I'm just grateful that the police were there to stop him,\" Moreland said. \"I don't know what would have happened if they hadn't been.\"\n\nThe shooting at Austins Bar and Grill has left a lasting impact on the community, with many people still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. Moreland's story is a powerful reminder of the devastating effects of gun violence and the importance of seeking help and support after a traumatic event.",

However, according to reports, Ri Jong Chol is expected to be released without charge due to a lack of evidence linking him to the crime.\n\nKim Jong Nam was murdered at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia on February 13, 2017. The assassination sparked a diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea, with Malaysia initially refusing to release the body until North Korea agreed to send a team to identify the victim.\n\nThe investigation into Kim Jong Nam's death has been ongoing, with Malaysian authorities working closely with international agencies to identify the perpetrators. Four suspects, including Ri Jong Chol, were arrested and charged in connection with the murder.\n\nHowever, according to sources, the investigation has been hampered by a lack of cooperation from North Korea, which has refused to provide any information or evidence to aid the investigation. As a result, prosecutors have been unable to build a strong case against the suspects, leading to the decision to release Ri Jong Chol without charge.\n\nIt is unclear what will happen to the other three suspects, who are still facing trial. The Malaysian government has said that it will continue to pursue the case against the remaining suspects, but it is likely to be a long and challenging process.\n\nThe release of Ri Jong Chol without charge is seen as a significant development in the case, and is likely to raise questions about the effectiveness of the investigation and the ability of Malaysian authorities to bring those responsible for the murder to justice. The case has also highlighted the complex and often fraught relationships between North Korea and other countries, particularly in the region.",

        "Text": "The recent spate of bomb threats targeting Jewish community centers and schools across the United States has left authorities and the public alike on high alert. In the wake of these incidents, authorities have released recordings of the threatening calls, providing a chilling glimpse into the minds of the perpetrators.\n\nAccording to reports, the majority of the calls were made to Jewish institutions in the Northeast, with several incidents occurring in New York, New Jersey, and Florida. The threats, which were often made via phone, typically involved the caller claiming that a bomb would detonate at the targeted location within a specific time frame.\n\nOne such call was made to the Jewish Community Center in Boca Raton, Florida, where the caller claimed that a bomb would explode in 30 minutes. In a similar incident, a caller threatened to detonate a bomb at the Jewish Community Center in Hackensack, New Jersey, stating that it would happen within an hour.\n\nThe calls, which have been deemed to be \"credible\" by authorities, have resulted in numerous evacuations and security sweeps. In some cases, the threats have also led to the cancellation of events and programs at the affected institutions.\n\nWhile the motivations behind the threats are unclear, many have speculated that they may be linked to rising anti-Semitic sentiment in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League has reported a significant increase in anti-Semitic incidents in recent years, with many of these incidents occurring on college campuses and online.\n\nIn response to the threats, authorities have launched investigations and are working to identify the perpetrators. The FBI has also released a statement urging anyone with information regarding the threats to come forward.\n\nAs the investigation continues, many are left wondering how such incidents can occur in the United States, a country that prides itself on its commitment to freedom and tolerance. In the face of these threats, Jewish communities across the country are coming together to show solidarity and support for one another.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the recent spate of bomb threats targeting Jewish institutions is a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle against anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms.",

        "Text": "In a move that has raised concerns about the balance of power between the military and the executive branch, the Pentagon is considering a proposal to authorize some military raids without the need for White House approval. The idea, which is still in its infancy, would allow certain operations to be conducted under a \"standing authority\" that would bypass the traditional requirement for presidential approval.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the plan, the proposal would apply to low-risk, low-visibility operations that are deemed to be in the best interests of national security. These operations would be pre-approved by the Defense Secretary and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and would not require the personal involvement of the President.\n\nThe move is seen as a response to the growing complexity and pace of modern warfare, which often requires swift and decisive action. It is also seen as a way to increase the military's flexibility and responsiveness in the face of emerging threats.\n\nHowever, the proposal has also raised concerns about the potential for abuse and the erosion of the President's constitutional authority. Critics argue that the plan would undermine the principle of civilian control over the military, and could lead to a slippery slope of unchecked military power.\n\nThe Pentagon has declined to comment on the proposal, citing the need for further consultation and review. However, it is understood that the plan is still being discussed at high levels within the Defense Department, and could potentially be put into effect in the coming months.\n\nThe idea of authorizing military raids without White House approval is not new, and has been debated in the past. However, the current proposal is seen as more significant due to the growing threats posed by terrorism and other non-traditional security challenges.\n\nIn recent years, the military has increasingly been called upon to conduct operations in non-traditional environments, such as counter-terrorism missions in Africa and the Middle East. These operations often require rapid and decisive action, and can involve a range of tactics and techniques.\n\nThe proposal is also seen as part of a broader effort to modernize the military's legal and operational frameworks, and to provide greater flexibility and agility in the face of emerging threats. However, it remains to be seen whether the plan will ultimately be approved, and what form it will take if it is.",

The allegations have led to widespread condemnation of Russia and have contributed to a significant deterioration in US-Russia relations.\n\nRyabkov dismissed the allegations as baseless and claimed that the US is trying to discredit Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. \"This is a witch hunt, a campaign of slander and lies,\" Ryabkov said. \"We have nothing to hide, and we will not be intimidated by these unfounded accusations.\"\n\nRyabkov's comments have been met with skepticism by many in the US, who see them as a classic example of the \"Pot calling the kettle black\" phenomenon. Critics point out that Russia has a history of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, including the 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatist groups in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe US government has accused Russia of using cyberattacks and propaganda to influence the 2016 presidential election, and has imposed sanctions on Russia in response. Russia has denied any wrongdoing and has accused the US of trying to undermine its sovereignty.\n\nThe ongoing feud between the US and Russia has significant implications for global security and stability. As the world's two largest nuclear powers, the US and Russia have a responsibility to maintain a positive relationship and work together to address common challenges such as terrorism and nuclear proliferation.\n\nRyabkov's comments have been seen as a sign that Russia is unlikely to back down in the face of US criticism, and that the relationship between the two countries is likely to remain strained for the foreseeable future.",

        "Text": "Washington D.C. - The ongoing investigation into alleged ties between the Trump administration and Russia has led to new revelations as several Trump advisers have disclosed meetings with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak.\n\nThe latest disclosures come after President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned on February 13th following reports that he had discussed sanctions with Kislyak before Trump took office. Flynn's resignation marked the first major departure from the Trump administration amidst the ongoing probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nOn February 28th, Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified before the House Judiciary Committee, stating that he had met with Kislyak twice during the presidential campaign. Sessions, who was a key surrogate for Trump during the campaign, had previously failed to disclose the meetings under oath during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nAdditionally, it was revealed that several other Trump campaign officials, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former foreign policy adviser Carter Page, had also met with Kislyak during the campaign.\n\nThe disclosures have raised concerns about the extent of Russian influence within the Trump administration and whether there was any coordination between the two parties to influence the outcome of the election.\n\nThe FBI and congressional investigators are currently probing the alleged ties between Trump associates and Russia, and the latest revelations are expected to be a key part of their investigation.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or coordination with Russia, and Trump himself has accused the media and Democrats of perpetuating a \"witch hunt\" against him.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the public is left to wonder what other secrets may be hiding beneath the surface of the Trump administration's dealings with Russia. One thing is certain, however: the growing list of Trump associates with ties to Kislyak is only adding to the already-heightened scrutiny of the administration's actions.",

This statement comes amid growing tensions between the UK and Scottish governments over the latter's push for a second independence referendum.\n\nSpeaking at a Conservative Party event in London, May accused the Scottish National Party (SNP) of being consumed by their desire for independence, stating that they were \"obsessed\" with the idea of breaking away from the UK. The Prime Minister's comments were met with strong opposition from Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who accused May of being \"out of touch\" with the Scottish people.\n\nThe UK government has been resisting Scottish demands for a second independence referendum, citing the need for the country to resolve its Brexit negotiations with the EU before considering such a vote. However, the SNP has been pushing for a referendum to be held before the UK leaves the EU, citing the need for the Scottish people to have a say in their country's future.\n\nThe tensions between the two governments have been escalating in recent weeks, with May and Sturgeon engaging in a war of words over the issue. May has been accused of being dismissive of Scotland's demands for a referendum, while Sturgeon has been accused of being reckless and irresponsible in her pursuit of independence.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked concerns about the impact of the Brexit negotiations on Scotland's future. Many Scottish politicians have expressed concerns that the UK government's hardline stance on Brexit could lead to Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will, and that a second independence referendum could be the only way to prevent this.\n\nIn response to May's comments, Sturgeon has reiterated her commitment to holding a second independence referendum, stating that the Scottish people have the right to decide their own future. The SNP has also accused the UK government of being in denial about the reality of Scotland's situation, and of trying to silence the voices of the Scottish people.\n\nThe controversy is likely to continue in the coming weeks, with both sides digging in their heels and refusing to back down. The outcome is far from certain, but one thing is clear: the future of Scotland and the UK is hanging in the balance.",

The victims, 17-year-old Jamiyah Taylor and 16-year-old Dashawn McGrier, were found dead in a wooded area in April 2016. The investigation, which was led by the Prince George's County Police Department and the FBI, uncovered a gruesome and calculated crime scene.\n\nAccording to court documents, the defendants, Luis Alexander Mendez, Jose A. Gomez, Carlos Eduardo Morales, and Jesus Adonis Garcia, were part of a MS-13 clique that operated in the region. The gang members allegedly targeted the two students, who were friends and classmates, because they believed they were rivals.\n\nThe indictment alleges that the defendants, along with other MS-13 members, lured the victims to the wooded area under false pretenses. Once there, they brutally attacked and murdered the students, using knives, rocks, and other objects to inflict severe injuries. The victims' bodies were then left in the woods, where they were discovered several days later.\n\nThe indictment charges the defendants with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, and other related crimes. If convicted, they face life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\n\nThe indictment marks a significant milestone in the investigation, which has been ongoing for over a year. \"Today's indictment is a testament to the tireless efforts of our detectives and federal partners to bring justice to the victims and their families,\" said Prince George's County Police Chief Hank Stawinski.\n\nThe MS-13 gang has been linked to numerous violent crimes in the region, including murders, assaults, and drug trafficking. The gang's activities have been the subject of increased scrutiny in recent years, with law enforcement agencies working to dismantle its operations.\n\nThe indictment is the latest development in a case that has shocked the community and left families grieving. \"This indictment brings us one step closer to justice for Jamiyah and Dashawn,\" said their families' attorney. \"We will continue to work with the authorities to ensure that those responsible for their deaths are held accountable.\"\n\nThe defendants are scheduled to appear in court for a status hearing on March 15, 2017.",

The decision comes amid growing tensions with neighboring Russia, which has been accused of aggressive behavior in the region.\n\nStarting in January 2018, Swedish men and women aged 18 to 25 will be required to serve for nine to 12 months, with some exceptions for those who have completed military training or have certain medical conditions. The conscription system will be reintroduced in phases, with the first group of conscripts expected to report for duty in July 2018.\n\nThe decision to reintroduce conscription was made after a series of high-level meetings between Swedish government officials and military leaders. The move is seen as a response to Russia's increasingly aggressive posture in the region, including its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and ongoing support for separatist groups in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"We have to be prepared to defend our country and our values,\" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said in a statement. \"Russia's actions in the region have made it clear that we cannot rely solely on our existing defense capabilities.\"\n\nSweden's decision to reintroduce conscription is seen as a significant shift in the country's military strategy. In the past, Sweden has maintained a policy of neutrality, avoiding military alliances and focusing on domestic defense.\n\nThe reintroduction of conscription is also expected to have significant social and economic implications for Sweden. The country's defense budget is expected to increase by around 10 billion kronor (approximately $1.2 billion USD) over the next few years, with a significant portion of that money going towards training and equipment for the new conscripts.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by reintroducing conscription, many Swedes have expressed support for the move. A recent poll found that 70% of Swedes believe that the country needs to take a stronger stance against Russia.\n\nThe reintroduction of conscription is seen as a significant development in the region, with neighboring countries such as Finland and Denmark also taking steps to bolster their military capabilities in response to Russia's actions.\n\nIn conclusion, Sweden's decision to reintroduce conscription is a significant response to the growing tensions with Russia. The move is expected to have significant implications for Sweden's military strategy and its economy, but is seen as a necessary step to ensure the country's national security.",

This marks a significant victory for the Syrian government in its fight against ISIS, which has been holding the city since May 2015.\n\nThe recapture of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was announced on March 2, 2017, after a series of intense battles between the Syrian army and ISIS militants. The city, which is home to some of the most impressive ancient ruins in the world, has been largely destroyed by ISIS, who used it as a stronghold and a symbol of their brutal regime.\n\nThe Syrian army, supported by Russian warplanes and special forces, launched a major offensive to retake Palmyra in December 2016. The campaign was slowed by fierce resistance from ISIS, but the Syrian army made significant gains in recent weeks, reportedly pushing ISIS fighters out of the city.\n\nThe recapture of Palmyra is seen as a major blow to ISIS, which has lost several key strongholds in Syria and Iraq in recent months. The city's recapture also marks a significant victory for the Syrian government, which has been struggling to regain control of its territory from ISIS and other rebel groups.\n\nThe Syrian army's victory in Palmyra comes as the international community is increasing pressure on ISIS to stop its brutal attacks and human rights abuses. The United Nations has condemned ISIS's destruction of Palmyra's ancient ruins, and the international community has called for the group to be held accountable for its crimes.\n\nThe recapture of Palmyra is a significant milestone in the fight against ISIS, but it is not the end of the conflict. The city still needs to be cleared of mines and unexploded ordnance, and the Syrian government will need to work to rebuild the city and restore its ancient ruins.",

Comey's remarks came during a speech at the Brookings Institution on March 6, 2017, where he emphasized the need for individuals to be aware of the limitations of their privacy in the digital age.\n\nComey's comments were made in the context of the ongoing debate over government surveillance and data collection. He acknowledged that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies do collect a vast amount of data on individuals, including their phone records, emails, and social media activity. However, he emphasized that this collection of data is necessary to prevent and investigate crimes.\n\n\"We live in a world where technology has made it possible for us to collect and store vast amounts of data, and we must use that technology to stay ahead of the bad guys,\" Comey said. \"But we must also be mindful of the fact that there is no such thing as absolute privacy in America. We all know that our phone records, our emails, our social media activity – all of that is collected and stored by companies and governments around the world.\"\n\nComey's remarks have sparked concerns among privacy advocates, who argue that the government's ability to collect and store vast amounts of data on individuals is a threat to their civil liberties. They argue that the government should be more transparent about its data collection practices and should establish stricter limits on how the data is used.\n\nOn the other hand, Comey's comments have also been seen as a necessary warning to individuals about the limitations of their privacy in the digital age. As technology continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly important for individuals to be aware of the data they are sharing online and to take steps to protect their privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, Comey's remarks serve as a reminder that individuals must be aware of the limitations of their privacy in the digital age.

The meeting, which took place at the White House, aimed to gather support from the Republican Party's most conservative wing for the American Health Care Act (AHCA), also known as the Trumpcare plan.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the meeting, Trump emphasized the importance of passing the healthcare bill and the consequences of its failure. He allegedly told the leaders that if the bill does not pass, he will hold the Democrats responsible for the setback. The President also reportedly emphasized that he is willing to make concessions to conservative lawmakers to ensure the bill's passage.\n\nThe AHCA has been met with fierce opposition from both parties, with many Democrats labeling it as a \"cruel\" and \"draconian\" plan that would leave millions of Americans without healthcare coverage. Republicans, on the other hand, have been divided on the issue, with some calling for more significant changes to the bill.\n\nThe meeting comes as the President faces mounting pressure to pass the healthcare bill, which is seen as a key component of his campaign promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The AHCA has already faced several setbacks, including a vote in the House of Representatives that saw 20 Republicans defect from the party line.\n\nDespite the challenges, Trump remains committed to passing the bill, and the meeting with conservative leaders is seen as a crucial step in building support for the plan. However, the President's willingness to blame Democrats if the plan fails has raised concerns among some lawmakers, who argue that such rhetoric could further divide the country and hinder the legislative process.\n\nAs the debate over the AHCA continues, one thing is clear: the fate of the President's healthcare plan hangs in the balance, and the consequences of its failure could have far-reaching implications for the country's healthcare system and the President's own political legacy.",

However, Pence declined to answer, saying, \"I'm not aware of any evidence that would support the president's tweets.\"\n\nTrump's claims have been a subject of controversy since they were first made public on March 4. The president accused Obama of ordering a wiretap of his campaign headquarters, but provided no evidence to back up his claims. The allegations have been denied by Obama, and the FBI and Department of Justice have said there is no evidence to support them.\n\nThe controversy has led to a rift between the White House and the intelligence community, with some lawmakers calling for an investigation into the claims. The House Intelligence Committee has launched an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, but has not specifically looked into Trump's wiretapping claims.\n\nPence's refusal to answer the question has raised questions about the White House's commitment to transparency and its willingness to engage in a fact-based discussion about the allegations.

        "Text": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - In a significant development, two Malaysian United Nations staff members who were detained in North Korea for several weeks have been allowed to leave the country, according to sources. The news comes as a relief to the Malaysian government and the families of the detained individuals.\n\nThe two Malaysian nationals, who were working for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), were arrested in Pyongyang in February while on a humanitarian mission. The exact reasons for their detention were not disclosed, but it was reported that they were being held at a hotel in the North Korean capital.\n\nMalaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman confirmed the news, stating that the two staff members had been released and were on their way back to Malaysia. \"We are grateful that they have been released and are returning home safely,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe detention of the two Malaysians had sparked concerns over the deteriorating relations between Malaysia and North Korea. The two countries had been at odds over the murder of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in February. North Korea had denied any involvement in the assassination, but Malaysia had accused Pyongyang of being behind the attack.\n\nThe release of the two Malaysians is seen as a positive development in the strained relations between the two countries. However, the incident has highlighted the risks and challenges faced by international aid workers and diplomats operating in North Korea.\n\nThe Malaysian government had been working to secure the release of the two staff members, and had sought the assistance of international organizations, including the United Nations, to facilitate their release. The UN had also been working to resolve the issue, and had sent a team to North Korea to negotiate the release of the two Malaysians.\n\nThe release of the two Malaysians is a welcome development, and it is hoped that it will help to improve relations between Malaysia and North Korea. However, the incident serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of working in North Korea, and the need for caution and diplomacy in resolving conflicts.",

        "Text": "A federal judge in Hawaii is set to hear a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, which targets six majority-Muslim countries. The ban, which went into effect on March 6, 2017, has been met with widespread criticism and protests across the United States.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the state of Hawaii and a number of individuals and organizations, argues that the ban violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs contend that the ban is discriminatory and unfairly targets individuals from six predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nThe revised ban, which replaced a previous version that was blocked by the courts, prohibits the entry of nationals from the six targeted countries into the United States for 90 days. The ban also suspends the refugee resettlement program for 120 days and indefinitely bars the entry of Syrian refugees.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the ban, saying it is necessary to protect national security and prevent terrorism. However, critics argue that the ban is a thinly veiled attempt to discriminate against Muslims and is unconstitutional.\n\nThe hearing in Hawaii is expected to be a significant test of the ban's constitutionality. The judge, Derrick Watson, has already issued a temporary restraining order blocking the ban, but the administration is seeking to have the order lifted.\n\nThe case is one of several legal challenges to the ban that are being heard in courts across the country. The outcome of the case in Hawaii could have significant implications for the ban's constitutionality and its impact on the thousands of individuals who have been affected by it.\n\n###",

The move marks a significant escalation in the US-led coalition's efforts to defeat the terrorist group.\n\nAccording to sources, a small contingent of US Marines, including special operations forces, has been deployed to the Raqqa province to support local Kurdish and Arab fighters. The troops will be providing artillery and mortar fire support to help the local forces push back against ISIS.\n\nThe US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets in Raqqa for months, but the addition of ground troops is seen as a crucial step in the fight to reclaim the city. The city has been under ISIS control since 2014, and its recapture is seen as a key goal in the campaign to defeat the terrorist group.\n\nThe US Marines' involvement in the battle comes as the US military has been increasing its presence in Syria in recent weeks. In addition to the Marines, US special operations forces have been conducting missions on the ground in the country, and US warplanes have been conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets.\n\nThe local forces fighting in Raqqa are made up of Kurdish and Arab fighters, including the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is the main force fighting against ISIS in the region. The SDF has been making gains against ISIS in recent weeks, and the addition of US ground troops is seen as a boost to their efforts.\n\nThe battle for Raqqa is expected to be a long and difficult one, with ISIS likely to put up fierce resistance. However, the US-led coalition is confident that with the support of local forces and its own military might, it can ultimately defeat the terrorist group and reclaim the city.\n\nAs of March 9, 2017, the battle for Raqqa remains ongoing, with both sides suffering casualties and neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The outcome of the battle is far from certain, but one thing is clear: the US Marines' involvement in the fight marks a significant escalation in the US-led coalition's efforts to defeat ISIS in Syria.",

        "Text": "In a stunning admission, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer clarified that President Donald Trump did not mean wiretapping when he tweeted about wiretapping on March 4, 2017. The tweet in question read, \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\"\n\nSpicer made the statement during a press briefing at the White House on Monday, March 13, 2017. The clarification came after a week of controversy and scrutiny surrounding the tweet, with many interpreting it as a claim that the Obama administration had ordered wiretaps on Trump's campaign or transition team.\n\nHowever, Spicer insisted that the President's tweet was actually referring to surveillance or monitoring of some kind, but not specifically wiretapping. \"I think the President was using a common phrase to describe surveillance,\" Spicer said. \"The President was not claiming that there was any wiretapping, but rather that there was surveillance.\"\n\nSpicer's clarification did little to ease the concerns of lawmakers and intelligence officials, who have repeatedly denied any evidence of wiretapping. The House Intelligence Committee is currently investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and some lawmakers have expressed frustration with the lack of transparency from the Trump administration.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the President's use of social media, particularly his Twitter account, which has become a major source of news and policy announcements. Critics have argued that Trump's tweets often lack context and can be misleading, while supporters see them as a way for the President to connect directly with the public.\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, it remains unclear what exactly Trump meant by his tweet, and whether the administration will provide further clarification or evidence to support its claims. One thing is certain, however: the wiretapping saga has become a major distraction for the Trump administration, and its impact on the President's credibility and relationship with lawmakers and the public remains to be seen.",

        "Text": "As the deadline for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide evidence supporting President Donald Trump's claims of wiretapping by the Obama administration approached, lawmakers and the public alike eagerly awaited the outcome. The deadline, set by the House Intelligence Committee, marked the culmination of a weeks-long standoff between the administration and Congress over the matter.\n\nOn March 13, 2017, the DOJ finally released a statement, but it did little to quell the controversy. The statement, signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said that the agency had \"no information\" to support the President's claims and that it would not comply with the committee's request for evidence, citing \"long-standing\" Justice Department policies.\n\nThe development marked a significant setback for Trump, who has repeatedly accused his predecessor, Barack Obama, of ordering the wiretapping of Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. The President's claims have been widely disputed by lawmakers, intelligence officials, and the FBI, who have all stated that there is no evidence to support the allegations.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a heated debate over the limits of executive power and the extent to which the President can use the Justice Department to further his political agenda. Critics have accused Trump of using the wiretapping claims as a smokescreen to distract from investigations into potential ties between his campaign and Russian officials.\n\nThe release of the DOJ statement has also raised questions about the role of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from any investigations related to the 2016 election after it was revealed that he had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions has denied any wrongdoing, but his decision to recuse himself has sparked criticism from some lawmakers who argue that he should have been more forthcoming about his meetings with the ambassador.\n\nAs the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election continues to unfold, the controversy over the wiretapping claims is likely to remain a major point of contention. The standoff between the administration and Congress has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the government's handling of sensitive information.\n\nIn the meantime, lawmakers are left to grapple with the lack of evidence supporting the President's claims and the implications for the rule of law and the integrity of the political process. The episode serves as a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining a separation of powers and the need for a free and independent press to hold those in power accountable.",

Celik made the comments during a press conference in Ankara on March 12, 2017, following a tumultuous visit to the Netherlands.\n\nCelik was in the Netherlands to campaign for a \"yes\" vote in an upcoming referendum on constitutional reforms in Turkey. However, his visit was marred by controversy and violence. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's security detail clashed with protesters in Rotterdam, and Celik was prevented from speaking at a rally in the city.\n\nThe Dutch government has since criticized Celik's visit, saying that it was \"not welcome\" and that it was used to \"divide\" the country. Celik has denied these claims, stating that his visit was peaceful and that he was there to promote Turkish-Dutch relations.\n\n\"We came to the Netherlands to talk to the Turkish community, to explain the importance of the referendum, and to promote Turkish-Dutch relations,\" Celik said during the press conference. \"We did not come to the Netherlands to divide the country or to cause any problems. We are not terrorists, and we will not be labeled as such.\"\n\nCelik also criticized the Dutch government for its handling of the situation, saying that it was \"unacceptable\" for the government to prevent him from speaking at a rally. He called on the Dutch government to apologize for its actions and to work towards improving relations between the two countries.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Celik's visit has sparked a heated debate about freedom of speech and the role of foreign governments in domestic politics. The incident has also highlighted the tensions between Turkey and the Netherlands, which have been strained in recent years over a number of issues, including the Turkish government's crackdown on dissent and the Netherlands' criticism of Turkey's human rights record.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the controversy will impact Turkish-Dutch relations and the upcoming referendum in Turkey.",

The ban was imposed amid concerns over the safety of Turkish citizens and the potential for political tensions to escalate.\n\nThe dispute began when the Turkish government announced plans to hold rallies in several European countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium, to drum up support for a constitutional referendum that would grant President Recep Tayyip Erdogan greater powers. The referendum is set to take place on April 16.\n\nThe Netherlands, however, refused to allow Turkish politicians to hold rallies in the country, citing concerns over the safety of Turkish citizens and the potential for political tensions to escalate. The move was seen as a major blow to Turkey's efforts to garner support for the referendum abroad.\n\nTurkey responded by imposing travel restrictions on the Dutch ambassador and his family, and also summoned the Dutch ambassador to the Turkish Foreign Ministry for a dressing-down. The Turkish government also accused the Netherlands of \"fascist\" and \"Nazi\" tactics, and threatened to impose further sanctions on the country.\n\nThe row has sparked concerns over the deteriorating state of relations between Turkey and the European Union, which has been strained over a range of issues including Turkey's human rights record and its handling of the migrant crisis.\n\nThe Turkish government has accused the EU of trying to interfere in its internal affairs, while the EU has accused Turkey of violating democratic norms and human rights. The row has also raised concerns over the future of Turkey's EU accession talks, which have been stalled for several years.\n\nIn a statement, the Dutch government said that it had taken the decision to ban the Turkish rallies in order to protect the safety and security of its citizens. \"The Netherlands will not be used as a platform for political propaganda,\" the statement said.\n\nThe row has also sparked concerns over the impact it could have on Turkish-Dutch relations, which have traditionally been close. Many Turkish people live and work in the Netherlands, and there are concerns that the row could damage relations between the two countries.\n\nThe dispute is also seen as a major test of Turkey's relations with the EU, which has been a major source of support and funding for the country in recent years. The EU has been critical of Turkey's human rights record and its handling of the migrant crisis, and has been slow to move forward with Turkey's accession talks.\n\nIn a statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that it was \"deeply disappointed\" by the Netherlands' decision to ban the Turkish rallies. \"This decision is a clear example of the anti-democratic and fascist approach of the Netherlands,\" the statement said.\n\nThe row is likely to continue to escalate in the coming days, with both sides trading barbs and accusations. The future of Turkish-Dutch relations and the country's EU accession talks remain uncertain, as the row continues to unfold.",

        "Text": "In recent weeks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been engaged in a heated dispute with European leaders, sparking concerns about the future of relations between the two sides. The tensions began after a failed military coup in Turkey, which Erdogan blamed on Fethullah Gulen, a cleric living in exile in the United States. Erdogan's government subsequently launched a massive crackdown on perceived Gulen supporters, detaining thousands of people and firing or suspending hundreds of thousands of others from their jobs.\n\nEuropean leaders, however, have been critical of Erdogan's response, citing concerns about the erosion of democracy and human rights in Turkey. The European Union, in particular, has been vocal in its criticism, with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini stating that the EU is \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Turkey.\n\nThe spat has significant implications for the future of Turkey's relations with Europe. Turkey has long sought to join the EU, but the country's human rights record and democratic institutions have been major sticking points. The current tensions have raised questions about whether Turkey's EU accession process will be put on hold or even terminated.\n\nFurthermore, the dispute has also sparked concerns about the stability of the region. Turkey is a key player in the Middle East, and its relations with Europe are critical to regional security. The current tensions have raised concerns about the potential for further instability in the region.\n\nIn addition, the spat has also highlighted the challenges of dealing with authoritarian leaders. Erdogan has been accused of cracking down on dissent and opposition, and the EU has been criticized for its inability to effectively address these concerns. The dispute has raised questions about the limits of European influence in the region and the ability of the EU to promote democracy and human rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the spat between Erdogan and Europe is significant because it highlights the challenges of dealing with authoritarian leaders and the limits of European influence in the region. The dispute also raises questions about the future of Turkey's relations with Europe and the potential for further instability in the region.",

According to UNICEF's latest report, released on March 13, 2017, the year saw unprecedented levels of violence, displacement, and deprivation affecting the lives of millions of Syrian children.\n\nIn 2016, the conflict in Syria entered its sixth year, with fighting intensifying in many parts of the country. The resulting humanitarian crisis has left an estimated 13.5 million people, including 6.5 million children, in need of aid. UNICEF reported that the situation for children in Syria was particularly dire, with widespread attacks on civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, and residential areas.\n\nThe report highlighted the severe impact of the conflict on children's access to education, healthcare, and protection. In 2016, more than 2.5 million children were out of school, and an estimated 2,500 schools were damaged or destroyed. The number of children affected by the conflict has also led to a significant increase in child labor, with many forced to work to support their families.\n\nUNICEF also expressed concern about the increasing number of children being recruited into armed groups, with estimates suggesting that up to 15,000 children were fighting on the frontlines. The agency also reported a significant increase in the number of children killed or maimed, with an estimated 2,500 children killed or injured in 2016 alone.\n\nDespite the challenges, UNICEF emphasized the importance of continued humanitarian efforts to support children and families affected by the conflict. The agency is working to provide lifesaving assistance, including food, shelter, and medical care, as well as supporting efforts to protect children from the worst effects of the conflict.\n\nIn a statement, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Daniel Toole, emphasized the need for a sustained international response to the crisis. \"The situation for children in Syria is catastrophic, and the international community must come together to provide urgent support and protection,\" he said.\n\nAs the international community continues to grapple with the complexities of the Syrian conflict, UNICEF's report serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of the crisis on the country's most vulnerable population – its children.",

The decision was announced on March 13, 2017, and it is expected to be finalized in the coming days.\n\nMubarak, 88, has been serving a life sentence at a military hospital in Cairo since 2012. He was convicted of corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters, but his lawyers have long argued that the trial was unfair and that the evidence against him was weak.\n\nThe court's decision to release Mubarak was met with both jubilation and outrage. His supporters see it as a victory for justice and a recognition of his innocence, while his detractors believe it is a slap in the face to the thousands of Egyptians who risked their lives to overthrow him.\n\nThe ruling comes at a time of heightened political tension in Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has been cracking down on dissent and opposition. Many fear that Mubarak's release could be a sign of a broader attempt to undermine the country's democratic gains and restore the old regime's power.\n\nMubarak's release is also likely to have significant implications for the country's political landscape. His supporters, who have been quietly building a campaign to rehabilitate his image, may see this as a chance to revive his legacy and challenge el-Sisi's dominance.\n\nHowever, human rights groups and opposition figures have expressed outrage at the decision, calling it a \"travesty of justice\" and a \"betrayal of the revolution.\" They argue that Mubarak's release would be a slap in the face to the thousands of Egyptians who died during the uprising and a blow to the country's fragile democratic institutions.\n\nThe Egyptian government has not commented on the decision, but it is expected to face intense pressure from international human rights organizations and governments to reconsider the ruling.\n\nIn the meantime, Mubarak's lawyers are expected to file an appeal to confirm the release, and the former president is likely to remain under house arrest until the appeal is heard.\n\nAs the news of Mubarak's release spreads, Egyptians are bracing themselves for a potentially tumultuous period of political uncertainty. Will this decision mark a new era of authoritarianism in Egypt, or will it be a turning point for the country's democratic aspirations? Only time will tell.",

The US has been providing South Korea with military aid and training in recent years, and the deployment of the drones is seen as the latest step in this effort.\n\nThe MQ-9 Reaper is a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is designed for surveillance and attack missions. It is equipped with a range of sensors and weapons, including Hellfire missiles and precision-guided bombs. The drone is capable of flying for up to 12 hours and has a range of over 1,000 miles.\n\nThe deployment of the drones is expected to enhance the military capabilities of both the US and South Korea, and will likely be seen as a deterrent by North Korea. The move is also seen as a sign of the growing importance of drones in modern warfare, as they offer a range of advantages over traditional manned aircraft, including the ability to fly for long periods of time without the need for rest, and the ability to conduct missions in hostile environments.\n\nThe US and South Korea have been working closely together to counter the growing threat from North Korea, which has been conducting a series of missile tests in recent months. The deployment of the drones is seen as the latest step in this effort, and is likely to be seen as a significant development in the region.\n\n###",

        "Text": "A controversial bill has been proposed in the Texas state legislature that would fine men $100 each time they masturbate. The bill, which was introduced by Republican Representative Tony Tinderholt, aims to reduce the state's high rates of sexual addiction and related crimes.\n\nUnder the proposed law, men would be required to pay a $100 fine each time they engage in solo sexual activity. The fine would be enforced by a new agency, the Texas Sexual Addiction Enforcement Agency, which would be responsible for monitoring and regulating sexual activity in the state.\n\nThe bill has sparked widespread outrage and criticism, with many calling it a violation of privacy and a form of government overreach. Critics argue that the bill is unconstitutional and would disproportionately affect low-income men, who may not have the financial resources to pay the fine.\n\nThe bill has also been criticized for its lack of scientific basis. Many experts argue that there is no evidence to suggest that masturbation is a significant contributor to sexual addiction or related crimes.\n\nDespite the backlash, Tinderholt remains committed to the bill, arguing that it is necessary to address the state's high rates of sexual addiction and related crimes. He claims that the bill would help to reduce the number of sexual offenders in the state and promote a culture of sexual responsibility.\n\nThe bill is currently pending in the Texas House of Representatives, where it is expected to face stiff opposition. Many lawmakers have expressed concerns about the bill's constitutionality and its potential impact on individual privacy.\n\nAs the debate continues, many are left wondering whether the bill is a serious attempt to address a legitimate issue or simply a publicity stunt. One thing is certain, however: the bill has sparked a heated and controversial debate about the role of government in regulating personal behavior.",

        "Text": "The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump paid $38 million in income taxes in 2005, according to documents released by the administration on Friday. The disclosure comes amid growing controversy over Trump's tax returns and his claims of not owing any taxes.\n\nThe 2005 tax return, which was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, shows that Trump reported an adjusted gross income of $150 million that year. His taxable income was $103 million, resulting in a tax liability of $38 million. The return also reveals that Trump claimed a large deduction for a mortgage interest payment on his Trump Tower penthouse, which was valued at $57 million at the time.\n\nThe release of the tax return is the first time the Trump administration has provided any details about the President's tax returns. Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns, citing an audit and claiming that they are under review by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe disclosure has sparked debate among tax experts and political opponents, who have criticized Trump's tax strategy and questioned whether he has been truthful about his tax payments. Many have pointed out that Trump's tax return for 2005 shows a significant tax liability, which contradicts his claims of not owing any taxes.\n\nThe White House has defended Trump's tax strategy, arguing that it is a normal part of doing business and that the President has paid millions of dollars in taxes throughout his career. The administration has also claimed that the 2005 tax return is an isolated incident and does not reflect Trump's overall tax strategy.\n\nThe release of the tax return has also raised questions about the Trump administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. Critics have argued that the President's refusal to release his tax returns is an attempt to hide his financial dealings and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe 2005 tax return is just the latest development in a long-running controversy over Trump's tax returns. In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump's tax returns were leaked to the press, showing that he had paid little to no taxes in some years. The leaks sparked widespread criticism and calls for Trump to release his tax returns.\n\nThe release of the 2005 tax return has provided some clarity on Trump's tax payments, but it has also raised more questions than answers. As the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will release any further details about the President's tax returns.",

The country's voters are expected to choose between a coalition of traditional parties and a rising tide of populist and nationalist forces.\n\nThe election has garnered significant attention globally, with many observers seeing it as a test of the populist wave that has swept across Europe in recent years. The Dutch government has been led by the conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) since 2010, but the party is facing a strong challenge from the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) led by Geert Wilders.\n\nWilders, known for his anti-immigration and anti-EU stance, has gained popularity in recent years, particularly among young voters and those disillusioned with mainstream politics. His party is currently leading in the polls, with some surveys suggesting it could win as many as 30 seats in the 150-seat parliament.\n\nHowever, the PVV's success is not without controversy. Wilders has been criticized for his divisive rhetoric and his party has been accused of spreading hate speech and promoting discrimination. The PVV has also been linked to far-right and neo-Nazi groups in the Netherlands and abroad.\n\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, the GreenLeft party, led by Jesse Klaver, is also gaining momentum. Klaver has positioned his party as a progressive alternative to the traditional left and right, advocating for issues such as climate change, social justice, and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nThe election is also expected to have implications for the European Union, with many voters expressing concerns about immigration, terrorism, and the impact of globalization on the Dutch economy. The outcome of the election could influence the direction of European politics, particularly in the wake of the UK's decision to leave the EU.\n\nAs the Dutch head to the polls, many are left wondering whether the country will follow in the footsteps of other European nations, such as the UK and the United States, and elect a populist government. The outcome of the election will be closely watched by observers around the world, who are seeking clues about the future of European politics and the impact of the populist wave on the continent.",

The move was seen as a major blow to Turkish President Erdogan's efforts to rally support for the April 16 referendum, which would grant him sweeping new powers.\n\nErdogan, known for his fiery rhetoric, did not mince words in his criticism of the Dutch government. \"The Netherlands, which is a country of fascists and Nazis, has once again shown its ugly face,\" he said in a televised address. \"This is not the first time the Netherlands has shown its fascist face. We will not forget this.\"\n\nThe Turkish leader also threatened to impose sanctions on the Netherlands, saying that \"if they continue to behave like this, we will take measures.\" He did not specify what those measures would be, but hinted that they could include economic penalties.\n\nThe diplomatic spat between Turkey and the Netherlands has sparked widespread concern, with many warning that it could escalate into a full-blown crisis. The two countries have a long and complex history, with Turkey having been a key player in the Balkans during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s.\n\nThe controversy has also drawn attention to the ongoing tensions between Turkey and the European Union. Turkey has been a key player in the EU's efforts to manage the refugee crisis, but its membership bid has been stalled due to concerns over its human rights record and democratic institutions.\n\nThe Dutch government has defended its decision to block the Turkish ministers, saying that it was necessary to protect public order and national security. \"The Netherlands will not be intimidated by threats or blackmail,\" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.\n\nThe dispute has also drawn in other European countries, with Germany and Austria both coming out in support of the Dutch government. \"We cannot allow any country to use its diplomatic channels to interfere in the internal affairs of another country,\" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nThe crisis has also highlighted the growing tensions between Turkey and its Western allies, with many fearing that it could have far-reaching consequences for regional stability. The dispute has also drawn attention to the ongoing controversy surrounding the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, in which Bosnian Serb forces killed over 8,000 Muslim men and boys.\n\nErdogan has long been accused of downplaying the scale of the massacre, and has been criticized for his handling of the issue. The controversy has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for Turkey to acknowledge its role in the massacre and provide compensation to the victims' families.\n\nThe diplomatic spat between Turkey and the Netherlands is likely to continue to escalate in the coming days, with many warning that it could have far-reaching consequences for regional stability. The crisis has also highlighted the growing tensions between Turkey and its Western allies, and has sparked widespread concern over the future of Turkish-EU relations.",

The visit, scheduled to take place from March 15 to 23, will see Tillerson visit Japan, South Korea, and China, with North Korea looming large over the proceedings.\n\nTillerson's trip comes at a time when the Korean Peninsula is in a state of heightened alert. North Korea's recent missile tests and nuclear bomb tests have sparked widespread condemnation from the international community, with the United States leading the charge. The Trump administration has vowed to take a tougher stance on Pyongyang, with Tillerson warning that the US is \"reviewing all options\" in response to the regime's provocations.\n\nThe trip is also seen as an opportunity for Tillerson to build relationships with key regional players, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The two leaders have been vocal in their criticism of North Korea's actions, and will likely seek assurances from Tillerson that the US will continue to support their efforts to contain the regime.\n\nChina, meanwhile, will be a crucial stop on Tillerson's itinerary. Beijing has long been North Korea's primary ally and economic lifeline, and the US is keen to persuade China to use its influence to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear program. Tillerson is expected to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other senior officials to discuss the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Tillerson's trip is being seen as a crucial step in the US's efforts to reassert its influence in the region. The new Secretary of State has a reputation for being a straight-talker, and is likely to bring a fresh perspective to the complex and often fraught issues of the Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe trip is also seen as a test of Tillerson's diplomatic skills, particularly in the face of North Korea's increasingly bellicose rhetoric. The regime has been using its state-controlled media to threaten the US and its allies, and Tillerson will need to navigate these tensions with care if he is to achieve his goals.\n\nIn the end, Tillerson's trip to Asia will be a crucial test of the US's ability to navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries that exists in the region. As the world watches, one thing is clear: the stakes could not be higher, and the outcome will have far-reaching consequences for the future of the Korean Peninsula.",

He emphasized that he had spoken with Comey and was assured that the FBI chief would provide a clear answer on whether the agency is probing the matter.\n\nThe senator's comments come as the Trump administration faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of Russia's alleged meddling in the election. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but critics have accused him and his team of downplaying the issue and potentially colluding with Russia.\n\nComey's expected update has sparked widespread interest, with many speculating about the potential implications for Trump's presidency.

The incident occurred on a domestic flight operated by American Airlines from Phoenix, Arizona to Dallas, Texas.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the passenger was using his headphones to listen to music when smoke began to billow out of the device. The passenger immediately alerted the flight attendants, who quickly sprang into action to contain the situation.\n\n\"We were all in a state of panic,\" said passenger Sarah Johnson, who was seated nearby. \"The flight attendants were very calm and professional, though. They quickly moved everyone away from the area and started evacuating the plane.\"\n\nThe fire was reportedly contained and extinguished before it could spread to other areas of the plane. No injuries were reported, but the flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the passengers were evacuated and the plane was inspected.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation, but it is believed to be related to a faulty or damaged battery in the headphones. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the incident, and American Airlines has pledged to cooperate fully.\n\nThis is not the first time that headphones have caught fire on a plane. In 2014, a similar incident occurred on a Delta Air Lines flight, prompting the FAA to issue new guidelines for the use of electronic devices on aircraft.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder to passengers to be vigilant and report any unusual occurrences to the flight attendants immediately. It also highlights the importance of proper maintenance and inspection of electronic devices, particularly those used on aircraft.\n\nIn the meantime, American Airlines has issued a statement apologizing for the inconvenience caused to its passengers and reassuring them of its commitment to safety.

According to the exit polls, the VVD party secured around 31% of the vote, followed closely by the PVV party of anti-immigration leader Geert Wilders, which gained approximately 20% of the vote.\n\nThe exit polls were conducted by several major Dutch media outlets, including RTL Nieuws, NOS, and De Telegraaf. While the final results are still pending, the early indications suggest that the VVD party will likely emerge as the largest party in the Dutch parliament, the House of Representatives.\n\nThe election was closely watched by international observers, as it marked a significant test of populist sentiment in the Netherlands. Wilders, a vocal critic of immigration and Islam, had been gaining momentum in the polls in recent weeks, and his party's strong showing in the exit polls was seen as a major upset by many observers.\n\nHowever, Rutte's VVD party has traditionally been the dominant force in Dutch politics, and its strong showing in the exit polls may be a sign that the party's centrist policies have resonated with voters. The party has focused on issues such as economic stability, education, and healthcare, and has been seen as a stabilizing force in Dutch politics.\n\nThe results of the election are expected to have significant implications for the country's politics and policy, particularly in the areas of immigration and integration. Wilders' PVV party has been a vocal critic of immigration and has called for a ban on the Quran, and its strong showing in the polls has raised concerns about the potential for increased xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment in the Netherlands.\n\nThe final results of the election are expected to be announced later today, and will provide a clearer picture of the political landscape in the Netherlands. In the meantime, the early exit polls suggest that the VVD party is likely to emerge as the largest party in the Dutch parliament, and will play a key role in shaping the country's political agenda in the coming months.",

The indictment charges the two with conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse, as well as aiding and abetting identity theft.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Dokuchaev and Sushchin, both Russian intelligence officers, worked with other co-conspirators to gain unauthorized access to Yahoo's systems and steal user data, including email addresses, security questions, and answers, and other personal information. The hack, which was carried out between 2014 and 2015, affected an estimated 500 million Yahoo users worldwide.\n\nThe DOJ alleges that the two Russian spies, along with other co-conspirators, used the stolen data to impersonate Yahoo users, send fraudulent emails, and steal money from the victims' accounts. The indictment also charges Dokuchaev and Sushchin with conspiring to commit wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nThe indictment marks the first time that the DOJ has brought charges against Russian government officials for hacking and cybercrime. The move is seen as a significant escalation in the US government's efforts to hold Russia accountable for its alleged cyberattacks and interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe indictment comes as a result of a long-term investigation by the FBI, the IRS, and other agencies, which has been ongoing since 2014. The investigation was sparked by a complaint filed by Yahoo in 2014, alleging that its systems had been hacked and user data stolen.\n\nThe two Russian spies, who are currently believed to be in Russia, are unlikely to face trial in the US. However, the indictment sends a strong message to Russia and other countries that engage in cybercrime and hacking, that the US will not tolerate such activities and will take action to hold those responsible accountable.\n\nThe indictment also marks a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to combat cybercrime and protect the privacy and security of individuals and businesses. As the US government continues to ramp up its efforts to combat cybercrime, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of international cooperation and the need for countries to work together to prevent and prosecute cyberattacks.",

        "Text": "In a last-ditch effort to revive the stalled Obamacare repeal bill, the White House and a group of Republican senators are working together to make significant changes to the legislation. The development comes as the Trump administration faces mounting pressure to deliver on its campaign promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the negotiations, the White House and senators are focusing on three key areas: cost-sharing reductions, Medicaid expansion, and the individual mandate. The proposed changes aim to address the concerns of moderate Republicans who have been hesitant to support the bill due to its potential impact on vulnerable populations.\n\nOne of the main areas of contention is the cost-sharing reduction (CSR) program, which helps low-income individuals pay for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. The White House and senators are considering a plan to freeze CSR payments for two years, allowing for a review of the program's funding and potential reforms.\n\nAnother area of focus is Medicaid expansion, which has been a major point of contention among Republicans. The proposed changes would allow states to opt out of Medicaid expansion, giving them more flexibility to manage their own healthcare systems. This move is seen as a compromise between conservative lawmakers who want to repeal Medicaid expansion entirely and moderate Republicans who want to preserve it.\n\nThe individual mandate, which requires individuals to purchase health insurance or face a penalty, is also under scrutiny. The White House and senators are considering a plan to eliminate the mandate, but also provide a transition period to allow individuals to adjust to the change.\n\nThe proposed changes are seen as a major departure from the original Obamacare repeal bill, which was met with widespread criticism and opposition from both parties. The new plan is an attempt to find a middle ground that can appeal to a broader range of Republicans and potentially win over some Democrats.\n\nThe White House and senators are expected to unveil the revised bill in the coming days, with a vote scheduled for next week. While the changes are seen as a positive step, many remain skeptical about the bill's chances of passage. The American Health Care Act (AHCA), the original Obamacare repeal bill, was withdrawn from consideration last month due to lack of support.\n\nAs the debate continues, healthcare advocates and lawmakers are keeping a close eye on the developments, knowing that the fate of millions of Americans hangs in the balance. With the clock ticking and the deadline for repeal looming, the White House and senators must navigate the complex web of healthcare politics to deliver a bill that can pass and provide relief to those affected by Obamacare.",

However, his campaign ultimately failed to resonate with Dutch voters, who instead opted for the traditional center-right parties, including the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).\n\nThe election results are being hailed as a significant blow to the far-right populist movement, which had been gaining momentum in recent years. Wilders' defeat is seen as a major setback for his anti-immigrant and anti-Islam agenda, and a victory for those who believe in the importance of inclusivity, tolerance, and diversity.\n\nThe outcome of the election is also significant for the future of the European Union, as it suggests that the continent's voters are not necessarily enamored with the anti-EU and anti-immigrant rhetoric that has been gaining traction in recent years. Instead, many Dutch voters appear to be prioritizing stability, predictability, and cooperation with other European countries.\n\nThe election results are also expected to have significant implications for the Dutch government, which will now likely be formed by a coalition of center-right parties. Mark Rutte, the leader of the VVD, is expected to become the country's next prime minister, and will likely face significant challenges in navigating the complex issues facing the country, including its relationship with the European Union and its response to the refugee crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the Dutch election results are a significant victory for those who believe in the importance of tolerance, inclusivity, and cooperation, and a major setback for the far-right populist movement. The outcome of the election will be closely watched by politicians and voters across Europe, and will likely have significant implications for the future of the continent.",

        "Text": "In a landmark decision that has sparked controversy and debate, Judge Derrick Watson of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii blocked President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The order, signed on January 27, 2017, aimed to enhance national security by temporarily suspending the entry of citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nJudge Watson's ruling, issued on March 15, 2017, effectively halted the implementation of the travel ban, citing concerns over its constitutionality and potential harm to individuals and families. The judge emphasized that the order \"plainly discriminates based on nationality\" and \"violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\"\n\nSo, who is Derrick Watson? Born on November 17, 1957, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Judge Watson has had a distinguished career in law. A graduate of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and Harvard Law School, he began his legal career as a prosecutor in the Honolulu District Attorney's Office. In 1993, he was appointed as a judge on the Hawaii State Circuit Court, where he served for 14 years.\n\nIn 2007, Judge Watson was elevated to the Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals, where he served as the chief judge from 2013 to 2015. He was nominated by President Barack Obama to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii in 2012 and confirmed by the Senate in 2013.\n\nThroughout his career, Judge Watson has been known for his fairness, integrity, and commitment to upholding the Constitution. His ruling on the travel ban is a testament to his dedication to protecting the rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or religion.\n\nAs the legal battle over the travel ban continues, Judge Watson's decision has sent a strong message about the importance of upholding the Constitution and protecting the rights of vulnerable populations. As the nation continues to grapple with the implications of this ruling, one thing is clear: Derrick Watson is a judge who is unafraid to stand up for what he believes is right, even in the face of controversy and challenge.",

The reef, known for its vibrant colors and pristine condition, is now threatened by the damage caused by the ship's crash.\n\nAccording to reports, the captain of the vessel, a cargo ship carrying goods from Asia to the United States, has been detained by authorities and may face charges for his role in the incident. The ship, which was traveling through the reef's designated shipping lane, reportedly lost control and drifted off course, striking the reef at high speed.\n\nThe damage to the reef is significant, with many sections of the coral structure now broken and covered in oil and debris from the ship. The incident has sparked outrage among environmental groups and local residents, who are calling for stricter regulations on shipping lanes and greater protections for the reef.\n\n\"This is a disaster for our community and for the entire planet,\" said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a marine biologist who has spent years studying the reef. \"This reef is one of the most unique and valuable ecosystems on the planet, and it's been damaged irreparably. We need to take action to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again.\"\n\nThe incident has also raised concerns about the potential impact on local fishing industries and tourism, which rely heavily on the reef's health. Local authorities have launched an investigation into the incident and are working to assess the full extent of the damage.\n\nIn the meantime, efforts are underway to clean up the reef and restore it to its former glory. A team of divers and marine experts has been deployed to the area to remove debris and oil, and to begin the process of repairing the damaged coral.\n\nThe incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible shipping practices and the need for greater protections for our planet's most valuable ecosystems. As the investigation continues and the reef begins its long journey towards recovery, one thing is clear: we must do better to protect our planet's precious natural resources.",

        "Text": "A recent court case in the United States has highlighted the importance of punctuation, particularly the Oxford comma, in legal proceedings. The case, which was heard in the Minnesota Court of Appeals, centered around a contract dispute between two companies, Fidlar Corporation and Dunthorpe Properties.\n\nIn 2013, Fidlar Corporation entered into a contract with Dunthorpe Properties to purchase a property in Minneapolis. The contract stated that the property would be sold \"free from all liens and encumbrances except as permitted by this paragraph.\" However, a subsequent clause stated that the property would be sold \"subject to all matters of record except as permitted by this paragraph.\"\n\nFidlar Corporation claimed that the second clause nullified the first clause, allowing them to back out of the deal. Dunthorpe Properties disagreed, arguing that the clauses were separate and that the property was still being sold \"free from all liens and encumbrances.\"\n\nThe trial court ruled in favor of Fidlar Corporation, but the Minnesota Court of Appeals overturned the decision, siding with Dunthorpe Properties. The court ruled that the absence of an Oxford comma in the contract meant that the two clauses were separate and not contradictory.\n\nThe Oxford comma, also known as the serial comma, is a comma used after the penultimate item in a list of three or more items before the conjunction (usually \"and\" or \"or\") preceding the final item in the list. For example, \"I had eggs, toast, and orange juice for breakfast.\" Without the Oxford comma, the sentence would read \"I had eggs, toast and orange juice for breakfast.\"\n\nThe court's decision highlights the importance of clear and concise language in contracts. The absence of an Oxford comma may seem like a minor issue, but it can have significant consequences in legal proceedings. The case serves as a reminder to lawyers and businesspeople alike to carefully consider the language used in contracts to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nAs of March 16, 2017, the decision has been met with mixed reactions from legal experts and linguists. While some have praised the court's decision, others have criticized the ruling, arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent for the importance of punctuation in legal documents.\n\nRegardless of one's stance on the issue, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of attention to detail in all aspects of life, from contracts to punctuation.",

The Australian Government's official report, released on March 14, 2017, reveals that the reef has suffered an alarming 30% decline in coral cover over the past three decades.\n\nThe reef, stretching over 2,300 kilometers off the coast of Queensland, is not only a vital ecosystem but also a significant tourist attraction, generating over AUD 6.4 billion for the Australian economy annually. However, the latest damage is attributed to a combination of factors, including climate change, pollution, and poor water quality.\n\nThe report highlights that 2016 was the hottest year on record for the reef, with temperatures reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius above the average. This has led to an unprecedented number of coral bleaching events, resulting in the death of vast areas of coral. In addition, the reef is facing an influx of pollutants, including fertilizers, pesticides, and sewage, which are damaging the delicate balance of the ecosystem.\n\nConservationists and scientists are urging immediate action to address the crisis. Dr. Charlie Veron, a renowned coral reef expert, stated, \"The Great Barrier Reef is a natural wonder, but it's facing an unprecedented threat. We need to act now to reduce our carbon footprint, improve water quality, and protect the reef from further damage.\"\n\nThe Australian Government has pledged AUD 500 million to restore the reef over the next five years, including efforts to reduce pollution and promote sustainable tourism practices. However, many experts argue that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the crisis.\n\nAs the world's attention turns to the Great Barrier Reef, it is imperative that we acknowledge the severity of the situation and work together to protect this precious ecosystem. The fate of the reef hangs in the balance, and it is up to us to ensure its survival for future generations.",

He acknowledged that the previous policies had failed to achieve their objectives and that it was time to rethink the strategy.\n\n\"We've had 20 years of a failed approach,\" Tillerson said. \"We're going to take a fresh look at it, and we're going to come up with a new approach that's going to be effective.\"\n\nTillerson's comments come amid growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea has been conducting a series of nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches in defiance of international sanctions and warnings. The US and its allies have been scrambling to respond to the threat, with the Trump administration considering a range of options, including military action.\n\nWhile Tillerson did not provide details on the new policy, he hinted that it would be more comprehensive and multifaceted than previous approaches.

The National Front party's leader, Marine Le Pen, has since suspended Philippot, saying that his comments were \"unacceptable\" and did not reflect the party's views.\n\nPhilippot's comments were seen as a betrayal of the party's stance on the Holocaust, which is to recognize its historical significance and condemn anti-Semitism. The National Front has historically been criticized for its anti-Semitic and xenophobic views, and the suspension of Philippot is seen as a move to distance the party from these views.\n\nThe suspension of Philippot comes at a time when the National Front is trying to rebrand itself as a more mainstream party. Le Pen has been trying to distance herself from the party's far-right views and has been seeking to attract more moderate voters.

Trump's claims have been widely criticized by lawmakers from both parties, as well as by intelligence officials and experts in the field of national security.\n\nIn response to Trump's allegations, Obama's team has denied any involvement in wiretapping Trump Tower, and the FBI has also denied any wiretaps were conducted.

One thing is clear, however: Santorum's comments reflect a growing sense of unease within the Republican Party about Trump's behavior, and the potential damage it may cause to the party's reputation and to the country as a whole.",

        "Text": "U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated on Thursday that military action against North Korea is \"an option\" if the communist country continues to pursue its nuclear weapons program. Tillerson made the comments during a visit to South Korea, where he met with President Moon Jae-in and other officials to discuss the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nTillerson's comments come as tensions between the United States and North Korea continue to escalate. In recent months, North Korea has conducted a series of ballistic missile tests, and the country is believed to be on the verge of developing a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\n\nDuring his visit to South Korea, Tillerson emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong alliance between the two countries and reiterated the U.S. commitment to defending its ally. He also called on China, North Korea's largest trading partner, to do more to pressure the North Korean government to abandon its nuclear program.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea have been conducting joint military exercises in recent weeks, which have been condemned by North Korea as a provocation. The exercises have also been seen as a way for the two countries to demonstrate their military capabilities and show their commitment to defending against any potential North Korean aggression.\n\nTillerson's comments on the possibility of military action against North Korea come as the U.S. and its allies continue to weigh their options for dealing with the growing threat posed by the North Korean nuclear program. While the U.S. has emphasized its commitment to a peaceful resolution to the crisis, it has also made it clear that it will not stand idly by while North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn a statement released by the State Department, Tillerson said, \"The United States will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea and will continue to work with our allies and partners to address this growing threat.\"\n\nTillerson's visit to South Korea comes as the U.S. and its allies are preparing for a possible military conflict with North Korea. The U.S. has deployed additional troops to the region, and its military has been conducting joint exercises with South Korean forces.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies are also considering a range of options for dealing with the North Korean nuclear program, including the possibility of a military strike. However, any military action would likely be met with strong opposition from China, which has traditionally been a close ally of North Korea.\n\nIn the meantime, the U.S. and its allies will continue to work together to address the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program. Tillerson's visit to South Korea is seen as a key step in this process, and his comments on the possibility of military action against North Korea are likely to be closely watched by diplomats and military officials around the world.",

The dramatic turn of events is a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of seeking justice.\n\nIn 1985, Walter McMillian was convicted of the murder of Ronda Morrison in Alabama. He was sentenced to death and spent three decades in prison, despite maintaining his innocence throughout. The case drew widespread attention and outrage, with many questioning the fairness of the trial.\n\nThe case took a dramatic turn in 2014 when Bryan Stevenson, a lawyer from the Equal Justice Initiative, took up McMillian's case. Stevenson, who has been a vocal advocate for criminal justice reform, uncovered new evidence and re-examined the case. His efforts led to a re-investigation by the state of Alabama, which ultimately resulted in the wrongful conviction being overturned.\n\nOn Tuesday, McMillian, now 67, was released from Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. He was greeted by Stevenson and other supporters, who had been fighting for his freedom for years. McMillian's release is a major victory for those who have been advocating for criminal justice reform and a reminder that justice can be delayed, but it is never too late.\n\n\"I want to thank God for giving me the strength to endure all these years,\" McMillian said in a statement. \"I want to thank Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative for their tireless efforts to free me. And I want to thank all the people who have supported me over the years. Don't stop fighting for justice, because it's worth it.\"\n\nThe case has raised important questions about the criminal justice system and the need for reform. McMillian's release is a reminder that wrongful convictions can happen, and it is crucial that we work to ensure that justice is served.\n\nMcMillian's story is a powerful reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for a better tomorrow. As he begins a new chapter in his life, he will undoubtedly continue to be a symbol of resilience and determination.",

The story began when Trump tweeted on March 4 that his phones had been wiretapped by former President Barack Obama, without providing any evidence to support his claim.\n\nSince then, the controversy has sparked heated debates, with some lawmakers calling for an investigation into the matter. Trump has remained adamant that the wiretap occurred, claiming it was a \"serious violation\" of his rights. However, the FBI and the Justice Department have both denied any wiretapping took place.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence and the denials, Trump has continued to bring up the topic, using it as a way to deflect attention from other issues. On March 15, he tweeted, \"The NSA and FBI tell Congress that no wiretap exists. Then last week, the intelligence chairman of the House committee announced that he had seen no evidence of wiretapping.

The report, which was made public on Monday, March 13, 2017, is a summary of the FBI's investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe report, which was submitted to the House Intelligence Committee, provides a detailed account of the FBI's findings, including its investigation into alleged Russian hacking and alleged ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. However, the report does not contain any evidence to support Trump's claim that Obama had ordered his predecessor's communications to be wiretapped.\n\nTrump had made the claim in a series of tweets on March 4, 2017, accusing Obama of wiretapping him during the 2016 election campaign. The claim sparked a major controversy, with many Democrats and some Republicans criticizing Trump for making the claim without providing any evidence to support it.\n\nThe DOJ report's findings have been widely seen as a major blow to Trump's claims, and have raised further questions about the accuracy of his assertions. The report's release has also sparked renewed calls for Trump to provide evidence to support his claims, and for Congress to investigate the matter further.\n\nIn response to the report's findings, Trump's team has maintained that the report does not rule out the possibility of wiretapping, and has accused the Obama administration of engaging in a \"cover-up.\" However, many experts have criticized Trump's claims as baseless and unfounded, and have called for him to provide evidence to support his assertions.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Trump's wiretap claims has sparked a major debate about the role of the FBI and the DOJ in investigating political controversies, and has raised concerns about the potential for political interference in the work of these agencies.

The shooting occurred at approximately 8:30 pm local time, as the airport was bustling with passengers preparing for their evening flights.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the assailant, later identified as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, 39, approached a group of French soldiers from the Sentinelle operation, a force established to protect French citizens from terrorist threats. The soldiers, part of the Territorial Surveillance Force, were stationed at the airport's South Terminal.\n\nBen Belgacem, who was reportedly a French national of Tunisian descent, began to argue with the soldiers before attempting to seize one of their weapons. The soldiers, however, quickly responded, and a brief struggle ensued. During the confrontation, Ben Belgacem was shot and killed by the soldiers.\n\nNo one else was injured in the incident, and the airport remained operational despite the chaos. An investigation into the shooting is currently underway, with authorities seeking to determine the motives behind Ben Belgacem's actions.\n\nIn a statement, the French Ministry of the Interior confirmed the incident, stating that the assailant was known to the authorities for previous petty crimes, but there was no indication he was involved in any terrorist activity.\n\nThe shooting comes at a time of heightened security concerns in France, which has been plagued by a series of terrorist attacks in recent years. The country remains on high alert, with soldiers deployed at airports, train stations, and other public places to prevent potential threats.\n\nAs the investigation continues, authorities are working to piece together the events leading up to the shooting and to understand the motivations behind Ben Belgacem's actions.

The evacuation is expected to be completed within the next few days, with reports suggesting that around 1,000 rebels and their dependents will be leaving the city.\n\nThe agreement was facilitated by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), who have been working to broker a peaceful solution to the conflict in Homs.

The evacuation is seen as a significant blow to the rebels, who have lost control of much of the country to government forces and their allies.\n\nDespite the success of the evacuation, the situation in Homs remains precarious. The city has been heavily damaged by the conflict, with many buildings reduced to rubble and infrastructure destroyed. The government has promised to provide aid and assistance to the city's residents, but many are skeptical about the government's ability to deliver on its promises.\n\nThe evacuation of the rebels from Homs marks a significant turning point in the conflict, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of people. While the agreement is seen as a positive development, many questions remain about the future of the conflict and the fate of those who remain in the city.\n\n###",

The charges stem from his work as a consultant for Yanukovych's Party of Regions, which dominated Ukrainian politics from 2010 to 2014.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian officials, Manafort's activities in Ukraine between 2007 and 2012 were illegal and aimed at promoting the interests of Yanukovych and his allies. The prosecution claims that Manafort used offshore accounts to launder the money, which was then used to buy properties and fund his own business ventures.\n\nManafort has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyers have called the allegations \"baseless.\" However, the Ukrainian authorities have provided evidence, including documents and recordings, that allegedly link Manafort to the corruption scheme.\n\nThe move comes as Ukraine's new government, led by President Petro Poroshenko, has been cracking down on corruption and attempting to distance itself from the Yanukovych era. The investigation is seen as a major test of the country's commitment to tackling corruption and holding those responsible accountable.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor's office has requested assistance from Interpol in locating and arresting Manafort, who is believed to be currently residing in the United States. If apprehended, Manafort could face up to 15 years in prison for each count of money laundering.\n\nThe development has sparked intense speculation about the potential implications for Trump's presidency, given Manafort's high-profile role in the campaign. Trump's campaign team has yet to comment on the matter, but the White House has reiterated its commitment to transparency and cooperation with international authorities.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Manafort will be brought to justice and what the consequences will be for those involved. One thing is certain, however: the world is watching with great interest as Ukraine takes a bold step in its fight against corruption.",

The test, conducted at the Sohae Space Center in Cholsan County, North Pyongan Province, is believed to be a significant step forward in the development of the country's long-range ballistic missile program.\n\nAccording to KCNA, the new rocket engine boasts a thrust power of 200 tons, making it one of the most powerful in the world. The agency stated that the test was conducted to \"improve the performance of the rocket engine and to enhance the reliability of the launch vehicle.\" The move is seen as a significant advancement in North Korea's efforts to develop a more powerful and reliable long-range missile system.\n\nThe test comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the United States and South Korea conducting joint military exercises and North Korea conducting a series of ballistic missile tests in recent months. The United Nations has imposed several rounds of sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile tests, which have been condemned by the international community.\n\nThe development of a more powerful rocket engine is likely to be seen as a significant escalation by the international community, particularly as North Korea has been pushing to develop a long-range missile capable of striking the continental United States. The test is also likely to be seen as a response to the recent deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system in South Korea, which is designed to intercept North Korean ballistic missiles.\n\nThe significance of the test is likely to be felt globally, with many experts warning that the development of a more powerful rocket engine could have far-reaching implications for regional and global security. The United States, South Korea, and other countries have called on North Korea to cease its nuclear and missile tests, and instead engage in talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.\n\nAs the world waits to see the significance of North Korea's rocket engine test, many are left wondering what the implications will be for regional and global security. One thing is certain: the test is a significant step forward in North Korea's efforts to develop a more powerful and reliable long-range missile system, and the world will be watching closely to see what comes next.",

These outings have taken place at various courses in the Washington, D.C. area, as well as in Florida and New Jersey.\n\nTrump's golfing habits have sparked controversy, with some critics accusing him of being a hypocrite.

Trump also made a point to note that he did not have time for golf, citing his busy schedule and business responsibilities.\n\nHowever, Trump's actions since taking office suggest that his stance on golfing has changed. The president has used golf as a way to relax and unwind, often taking breaks from his busy schedule to hit the links.\n\nWhile Trump's golfing habits may not be as frequent as Obama's, they are still a significant departure from his campaign promises. Trump's critics are quick to point out the hypocrisy, arguing that the president should be focused on more important issues rather than indulging in leisure activities.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump's supporters argue that the president has a right to take breaks and engage in activities that bring him joy. They also note that Trump's golfing outings are often used as opportunities to meet with world leaders and conduct official business.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding Trump's golfing habits continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the president will balance his personal interests with his official duties.

Despite this, he remained steadfast in his assertion that there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nAnother prominent figure was Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the committee. Schiff has been a vocal critic of Trump and has called for a more thorough investigation into Russian interference. During the hearing, he grilled witnesses on the extent of Russia's involvement and the potential impact on the election.\n\nFBI Director James Comey was also a key player in the hearing. Comey testified that the FBI is investigating Russian interference in the election and potential ties to the Trump campaign. He also revealed that the FBI is looking into whether Trump's campaign was involved in any way with Russia's efforts.\n\nThe hearing also featured testimony from Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser. Flynn resigned from his position in February after it was revealed that he had lied about his contacts with Russian officials. During the hearing, Flynn testified that he had not discussed sanctions with Russian officials, but that he had discussed the issue with Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the US.\n\nOther key players in the hearing included Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been a vocal critic of Trump and has called for a more thorough investigation into Russian interference. Also testifying was Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has been a strong supporter of Trump but has also called for a more thorough investigation.\n\nThe hearing was marked by intense partisan bickering, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over the extent of Russia's involvement and the potential impact on the election. Despite this, the hearing provided valuable insight into the ongoing investigation and the potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nIn the end, the hearing left more questions than answers, with many wondering what exactly the Trump campaign knew about Russia's efforts and whether they were involved in any way. As the investigation continues, one thing is clear: the Russian interference in the 2016 election is a complex and multifaceted issue that will continue to dominate the headlines in the coming weeks and months.",

In recent weeks, several high-ranking officials have been ousted or resigned amid accusations of ties to Russia, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) dismissed the notion that Russia's actions posed a significant threat to national security, stating that \"Russia is not a serious adversary.\" McConnell's comments were met with swift backlash from Democratic lawmakers, who argue that the country's actions warrant a more robust response.\n\n\"We cannot ignore the evidence of Russian meddling in our elections and their aggressive actions around the world,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). \"It's time for Congress to take action and hold Russia accountable for their actions.\"\n\nSchumer's sentiments were echoed by several other Democratic lawmakers, who have called for increased sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Russia. In contrast, many Republicans have been more cautious in their approach, citing concerns over the potential consequences of escalating tensions with Moscow.\n\n\"I understand the concerns about Russia, but we need to be careful not to overreact,\" said Representative Devin Nunes (R-CA), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. \"We need to gather more facts and consult with our allies before taking any action.\"\n\nThe differing opinions on Russia have also spilled over into the 2020 presidential campaign, with several candidates weighing in on the issue. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has called for increased sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Russia, while Republican candidate Donald Trump has downplayed the significance of the issue.\n\nAs the debate continues to unfold, lawmakers are under pressure to find a solution that balances national security concerns with the need to maintain diplomatic relations with Russia.

She stressed that Germany's contributions to NATO go beyond just financial support, citing the country's participation in NATO's military missions and operations.\n\nVon der Leyen's statement has been welcomed by many in Germany, who have been critical of Trump's comments.

India, on the other hand, maintains that the dam is designed to improve irrigation and power generation in the region. The dispute has led to a deterioration in relations between the two countries, with Pakistan threatening to approach the World Bank to settle the matter.\n\nIn a recent development, Pakistan has announced that it will not participate in the next round of talks with India on the Indus Water Treaty, citing India's refusal to withdraw its objections to the Kishanganga Dam. The move has sparked concerns about the future of the treaty and the possibility of a breakdown in dialogue between the two countries.\n\nThe Indus Water Treaty has been a cornerstone of India-Pakistan relations since its signing in 1960. The treaty was brokered by the World Bank and has been amended several times since then. However, the recent tensions have raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the treaty.\n\nThe dispute has also raised concerns about the impact on the environment and the livelihoods of people living along the Indus River. The river is a vital source of water for agriculture, industry, and drinking water for millions of people in both countries.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether India and Pakistan can bridge their differences and find a solution that works for both countries. The fate of the Indus Water Treaty hangs in the balance, and the consequences of a breakdown in dialogue could be severe.\n\n###",

Nadia Murad, a 23-year-old Yazidi woman, has become an unlikely advocate for her people, sharing her harrowing tale of survival and exploitation at the hands of ISIS militants.\n\nIn August 2014, Murad was kidnapped along with thousands of other Yazidis by ISIS fighters, who considered them to be \"devil worshipers\" and sought to eliminate them from the face of the earth. She was taken to Mosul, where she was sold into slavery and subjected to unimaginable physical and sexual abuse.\n\nMurad's story is a testament to the brutality of ISIS's campaign against the Yazidi minority. The group, which has been responsible for numerous atrocities in Iraq and Syria, has sought to erase the Yazidi community from existence. According to estimates, over 5,000 Yazidis were killed, and thousands more were forced to flee their homes.\n\nDespite the trauma she endured, Murad has emerged as a powerful voice for her people. In a speech at the United Nations in November 2016, she told the story of her captivity and called for international action to protect the Yazidi community.\n\nMurad's efforts have not gone unnoticed. In February 2017, she was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, an honor bestowed by the European Parliament. Her speech at the award ceremony was a poignant reminder of the Yazidi people's struggle for survival and justice.\n\nAs Murad continues to advocate for her people, she remains steadfast in her demands for justice. She has called for the prosecution of ISIS leaders and the protection of Yazidi survivors, many of whom are still living in camps and struggling to rebuild their lives.\n\nIn the face of unimaginable horror, Nadia Murad's courage and resilience serve as a beacon of hope for the Yazidi community. Her determination to seek justice for her people is a powerful reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way forward.",

The controversy surrounding the deal has led many to question Trump's negotiating skills and whether he truly has the ability to make deals.\n\nThe issue began when the United States Department of Commerce imposed a seven-year ban on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company, from buying American-made technology and components due to the company's violations of U.S. sanctions against North Korea and Iran. ZTE, which is one of the largest telecommunications companies in China, was accused of making false statements and obstructing justice.\n\nIn June 2017, Trump tweeted that he had made a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping to lift the ban on ZTE in exchange for China's help in resolving the North Korean crisis. However, details of the deal were scarce, and many were left wondering what exactly had been agreed upon.\n\nIn December 2018, the Commerce Department announced that it had reached a deal with ZTE to lift the ban in exchange for the company paying a $1 billion fine, replacing its management, and implementing new compliance measures. However, the deal was widely criticized, with many arguing that it was too lenient and that the company had not taken adequate steps to address its violations.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the deal has led many to question Trump's negotiating skills and whether he truly has the ability to make deals. Critics argue that the deal was too favorable to ZTE and that Trump was too quick to make concessions without getting much in return.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent controversy surrounding the deal with ZTE has raised questions about Trump's ability to make deals and whether he truly has the negotiating skills that he claims to have. While Trump may have been successful in making deals in the past, his handling of the ZTE controversy has led many to question his judgment and whether he truly has the ability to make deals that benefit the United States.",

The latest developments in Washington, D.C. have left many Americans uncertain about their healthcare futures, with the current ACA, also known as Obamacare, hanging in the balance.\n\nIn the days leading up to the expected vote, which ultimately did not occur, lawmakers and healthcare stakeholders alike expressed deep concerns about the potential implications of the proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA). Critics argued that the bill would lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance coverage, particularly low-income and elderly individuals, as well as those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have been pushing for the passage of the AHCA, claiming it would provide more affordable and accessible healthcare options for Americans. However, the bill's opponents, including many Republicans, have voiced their disapproval, citing concerns about the potential harm it could cause to vulnerable populations.\n\nAs the debate rages on, healthcare providers, patients, and advocacy groups are left to navigate the uncertainty. Many are urging lawmakers to work together to find a bipartisan solution, while others are calling for a more comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system.\n\nThe current stalemate in Congress has sparked a renewed focus on the importance of healthcare as a fundamental human right. Advocates are emphasizing the need for a more equitable and sustainable healthcare system, one that prioritizes the well-being of all Americans, regardless of their income, age, or health status.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, it is likely that the healthcare debate will continue to dominate the national conversation. As lawmakers work to find a solution, Americans can expect to see a renewed emphasis on the importance of healthcare as a cornerstone of our society.",

This latest test is seen as a significant development in the country's nuclear and ballistic missile program, and has raised concerns among international leaders.\n\nAccording to sources, the test was conducted at the Tongchang-ri missile test site in North Hamgyong province, North Korea. The engine test is believed to be a crucial step in the development of the country's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities.\n\nThe test was reportedly successful, with North Korea successfully testing a new engine design.

The proposal, which was submitted to Congress last week, marks a significant escalation in the President's efforts to build a barrier along the southern border.\n\nAccording to the documents, the funding request is part of a broader $18 billion plan to fortify the border, which includes upgrading existing fencing, building new walls, and deploying advanced surveillance technology. The administration claims that the wall is necessary to stem the flow of illegal immigration, drugs, and gang activity, but critics argue that it will be a costly and ineffective solution to these complex issues.\n\nThe $1 billion price tag for the 62-mile stretch is equivalent to the cost of building a 150-mile highway, according to estimates. The administration has argued that the wall will create jobs and stimulate economic growth, but many experts disagree, citing the significant environmental and social impacts it could have on communities along the border.\n\nThe proposal has already sparked intense debate on Capitol Hill, with Democrats and some Republicans expressing concerns about the cost and the administration's lack of transparency. \"This is a reckless and irresponsible proposal that will do more harm than good,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"We need to focus on real solutions to our border security challenges, not a vanity project that will waste billions of taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the wall is a key part of its overall immigration strategy, which includes increasing the number of immigration judges and deportation officers. \"We're going to build a wall, and we're going to make Mexico pay for it,\" the President tweeted earlier this month. However, Mexico has repeatedly rejected the idea of paying for the wall, and it's unclear how the administration plans to fund the project.\n\nAs the debate continues, many are left wondering whether the wall is worth the cost. With the administration's proposal facing significant opposition, it remains to be seen whether Congress will ultimately approve the funding request. One thing is certain, however: the issue of border security will continue to be a major point of contention in the coming months.",

Four of them were seriously injured and are still receiving medical attention.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread outrage and concern among the public, with many calling for stricter safety regulations and better maintenance of public transportation systems.\n\nThe shopping mall's management has apologized for the incident and promised to cooperate with the police investigation.\n\nThe arrested mechanics are expected to be charged with causing harm to others and other related offenses. The investigation is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming days.\n\nThis is the second major escalator malfunction in Hong Kong in recent months, highlighting the need for improved safety standards and more stringent regulations. The incident has also raised questions about the qualifications and training of maintenance personnel responsible for ensuring the safety of public transportation systems.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the public is advised to remain vigilant and report any safety concerns to the authorities.",

        "Text": "In a move that has sent shockwaves through the global community, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reversing the Obama administration's climate change policies. The order, which was signed on March 28, 2017, marks a significant shift in the United States' approach to addressing climate change.\n\nThe executive order, titled \"Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth,\" seeks to undo many of the climate change regulations and policies put in place by the previous administration. Specifically, the order:\n\n* Suspends the Clean Power Plan, a rule aimed at reducing carbon emissions from power plants\n* Withdraws the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, an international accord aimed at limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius\n* Lifts the moratorium on federal coal leasing, allowing for new coal mining permits to be issued\n* Revokes the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, which protected wetlands and waterways from pollution\n* Orders a review of the social cost of carbon, a metric used to estimate the economic impacts of climate change\n\nThe move has been met with widespread criticism from environmental groups, scientists, and international leaders. Many have expressed concern that the executive order will undermine global efforts to combat climate change and put the United States at odds with its international partners.\n\n\"This is a disaster for our planet and for future generations,\" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. \"The science is clear: climate change is real, it's caused by human activity, and it's already causing devastating impacts around the world. We cannot afford to turn back the clock on our progress.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, White House officials have argued that the executive order is necessary to promote American energy independence and create jobs in the fossil fuel industry. They have also claimed that the order will not undo all of the progress made on climate change, and that the United States will continue to work with other countries to address the issue.\n\nThe impact of the executive order is still unclear, but it is likely to have significant implications for the United States' role in international climate negotiations and for the country's ability to meet its own climate change goals. As the debate continues, one thing is certain: the future of the United States' approach to climate change has never been more uncertain.",

        "Text": "Russian Banker Who Met with Jared Kushner Has Ties to Putin\n\nIn a development that has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, a Russian banker who met with Jared Kushner, a senior advisor to President Donald Trump, has been revealed to have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe banker, Sergey Gorkov, is the head of Vnesheconombank, a state-controlled Russian bank that has been subject to US sanctions. Gorkov met with Kushner in April 2017, shortly after Trump's inauguration, to discuss the bank's investments in the US.\n\nGorkov's ties to Putin are well-documented. He has been a member of the Russian government's Advisory Council since 2012 and has also served as the chairman of the board of the Russian state-owned bank, VTB Bank. In 2016, Gorkov was appointed as the head of Vnesheconombank by Putin himself.\n\nThe meeting between Gorkov and Kushner has sparked concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as well as questions about whether the Trump administration is willing to overlook the close ties between the Russian government and its bankers.\n\nKushner has come under scrutiny for his meetings with foreign officials, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, during the presidential transition period. The meetings have raised concerns about whether Kushner was using his position to influence the Trump administration's foreign policy decisions.\n\nGorkov's meeting with Kushner was first reported by The New York Times, which obtained documents showing that the two men had met at the banker's office in Moscow. The documents also revealed that Gorkov had offered to help Kushner with his business dealings in Russia.\n\nThe meeting has been criticized by Democrats, who have accused the Trump administration of being too cozy with the Russian government. \"This is just the latest example of the Trump administration's willingness to put its own interests above those of the American people,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate.\n\nThe Trump administration has denied any wrongdoing, saying that Kushner's meeting with Gorkov was a routine business meeting. However, the controversy has raised questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and its willingness to address potential conflicts of interest.\n\nAs the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election continues, the meeting between Gorkov and Kushner has become a focal point of the controversy. It remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will be able to weather the storm of criticism and maintain its credibility on the world stage.",

The massive footprint, measuring 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) long and 0.8 meters (2.6 feet) wide, was found in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia, an area known for its rich fossil history.\n\nThe team, led by Dr. Scott Hocknull, a paleontologist from James Cook University, has been excavating the site since 2015. The fossilized footprint, estimated to be around 130 million years old, is believed to belong to a massive sauropod, a long-necked, herbivorous dinosaur.\n\n\"This is a truly remarkable find,\" Dr. Hocknull said in a statement. \"The size of the footprint is astonishing, and it's a testament to the incredible diversity of life on Earth during the Jurassic period.\"\n\nThe discovery was made in a region known as the \"Australia's Jurassic Park,\" due to its unique concentration of Jurassic-era fossils. The area is a treasure trove of prehistoric remains, with many fossils of dinosaurs, crocodiles, and other ancient creatures found in the region.\n\nThe massive footprint is expected to provide valuable insights into the behavior and movement patterns of sauropods. The team plans to conduct further excavations and analysis to learn more about the ancient creature that left behind the massive footprint.\n\n\"This find has the potential to rewrite the history books,\" Dr. Hocknull said. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery that will captivate the imagination of people around the world.\"\n\nThe team's findings are set to be published in a scientific journal later this year, with the possibility of further discoveries in the region. The discovery of the world's largest dinosaur footprint is a significant milestone in the field of paleontology, and it is sure to captivate the attention of scientists and the general public alike.",

        "Text": "LONDON - British Prime Minister Theresa May has been accused of making a \"blatant threat\" against the European Union (EU) regarding security cooperation after Brexit, sparking outrage among EU leaders and politicians.\n\nAccording to sources, May told EU leaders in a private meeting on March 26, 2017, that the UK would no longer participate in the EU's counter-terrorism efforts and would instead work with other countries outside the bloc. This move has been seen as a direct threat to the EU's security, as the UK is a key partner in the fight against terrorism.\n\nEU officials have expressed deep concern over May's statement, saying it could undermine the EU's ability to combat terrorism and potentially create a security vacuum in the region. \"This is a blatant threat to the EU's security,\" said a senior EU official. \"We cannot allow the UK to simply walk away from our joint efforts to combat terrorism without a replacement mechanism in place.\"\n\nThe accusation has also been met with criticism from some British politicians, who argue that May's statement was unnecessary and could harm the UK's relations with the EU. \"This is a reckless and irresponsible move by the Prime Minister,\" said Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. \"We need to work with the EU to combat terrorism, not threaten to abandon them.\"\n\nThe UK's decision to leave the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, has already sparked significant tensions between the two sides. The EU has been pushing for a transition period to ease the exit process, but the UK has been resistant to the idea, saying it would undermine its sovereignty.\n\nAs the UK and EU continue to negotiate the terms of Brexit, the security implications of May's statement have become a major point of contention. The EU has warned that any attempt to undermine its security cooperation would have serious consequences, while the UK has maintained that it is committed to maintaining good relations with the EU despite its decision to leave.\n\nThe situation remains highly uncertain, with both sides locked in a tense standoff over the terms of Brexit. As the deadline for the UK's departure from the EU approaches, it remains to be seen whether the two sides can come to a mutually acceptable agreement or if the situation will continue to escalate.",

        "Text": "###\n\nThe United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU) has sent shockwaves across the globe, leaving many wondering how the complicated marriage between Britain and the EU came to an end. The journey to this point has been long and arduous, with roots tracing back to the country's initial decision to join the EU in 1973.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the UK's relationship with the EU was marked by a series of treaties and agreements that gradually increased the country's integration into the union. However, the tide began to turn in the early 2010s, as concerns about EU membership and the perceived loss of sovereignty grew among the British public.\n\nThe catalyst for the UK's departure from the EU was the 2015 general election, which saw the Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, secure a majority government. In the run-up to the election, Cameron had promised to hold a referendum on EU membership, with the aim of strengthening the UK's negotiating position within the union.\n\nThe subsequent EU Referendum, held on June 23, 2016, asked British citizens whether they wanted to remain a part of the EU or leave. The result was a narrow victory for the Leave campaign, with 51.9% of voters opting to exit the union.\n\nIn the aftermath of the referendum, the UK's Prime Minister, Theresa May, triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, formally notifying the EU of the country's intention to leave. The two-year negotiation period began, during which the UK and EU would work to agree on the terms of the UK's departure.\n\nAs the negotiations progressed, it became clear that the two sides were far apart on key issues, including trade, immigration, and the status of EU citizens in the UK. The UK's Brexit Secretary, David Davis, resigned in July 2018, citing the government's inability to agree on a plan for the country's departure from the EU.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, the UK and EU reached an agreement on the terms of the UK's departure, known as the \"Brexit deal.\" The deal outlined the UK's withdrawal from the EU, as well as the framework for the country's future relationship with the union.\n\nWhile the Brexit deal has brought a sense of closure to the UK's complicated marriage to the EU, the journey is far from over. The UK will continue to negotiate the details of its relationship with the EU, with the aim of securing a trade deal and other agreements by the end of the year.\n\nAs the UK embarks on this new chapter in its history, one thing is clear: the country's complicated marriage to the EU has been wrenched apart, and the road ahead will be long and challenging.",

        "Text": "The European Union is facing an unprecedented crisis, with rising nationalism, economic instability, and political gridlock threatening its very existence. As the EU struggles to respond to these challenges, many experts agree that it cannot survive if it continues to operate on autopilot, ignoring the fundamental changes that are reshaping the global landscape.\n\nThe EU's inability to adapt to these changes has led to a growing sense of disillusionment among its citizens. A recent survey by the European Commission found that a majority of Europeans believe that the EU is moving in the wrong direction, with concerns over immigration, terrorism, and economic inequality driving a surge in support for populist and nationalist parties.\n\nThe EU's economic woes are also a major concern. The ongoing economic crisis in the Eurozone has led to widespread unemployment, stagnant growth, and a rise in poverty and inequality. The EU's inability to implement effective economic policies has further eroded trust in the institution, with many countries turning to austerity measures and protectionist policies to address their economic woes.\n\nThe political gridlock in the EU is also a major obstacle to effective governance. The EU's cumbersome decision-making process, which requires consensus among all member states, has led to a lack of progress on key issues such as climate change, trade, and migration. The rise of nationalist and populist parties has also led to a growing sense of fragmentation, with some countries seeking to opt out of EU policies and institutions.\n\nIn light of these challenges, many experts are calling for a fundamental overhaul of the EU's structures and policies. This includes a greater emphasis on democratic accountability, greater flexibility in EU decision-making, and a more robust response to the challenges posed by globalization and technological change.\n\nOne potential solution is the creation of a more decentralized EU, with greater autonomy for member states to address their own economic and social challenges. This could involve the creation of a more flexible and adaptable EU framework, which would allow countries to respond to changing circumstances in a more effective and timely manner.\n\nAnother potential solution is the creation of a more robust and effective EU governance structure. This could involve the creation of a more powerful EU executive, with greater authority to implement EU policies and make key decisions. This could also involve the creation of a more effective EU legislative body, with greater powers to scrutinize and amend EU legislation.\n\nIn conclusion, the EU cannot survive if it sticks to business as usual. The institution must adapt to the changing global landscape, address the concerns of its citizens, and respond to the challenges posed by economic instability, political gridlock, and rising nationalism. The creation of a more decentralized and effective EU governance structure is a key step towards achieving this goal, and ensuring the long-term survival and prosperity of the EU.",

The allegations have sparked a heated debate between the US and Russia, with US President Donald Trump's administration denying any wrongdoing by Russia.\n\nPutin's denial of Russian involvement in the election meddling was his most direct and forceful response to date, marking a shift in his tone on the issue. In previous statements, Putin had acknowledged that Russia may have inadvertently affected the election through its hacking activities, but he has denied any deliberate attempt to influence the outcome.\n\nDuring the meeting, Putin also accused the US of interfering in Russian internal affairs, citing allegations of US funding for Russian opposition groups and support for Russian dissidents. He warned that Russia would take retaliatory measures if the US continued to interfere in its internal affairs.\n\nThe Russian leader's comments come as the US Congress prepares to vote on a bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Russia for its alleged election meddling. The bill, which has bipartisan support, would also authorize the US president to take additional measures against Russia, including the potential for military action.\n\nThe US intelligence community has concluded with \"high confidence\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and has provided evidence of Russian hacking and disinformation efforts. The investigation is ongoing, and the US Department of Justice has indicted several Russian nationals and entities for their alleged role in the election meddling.\n\nPutin's denial of Russian involvement in the election meddling has been met with skepticism by many in the US, who view the Russian leader's comments as an attempt to deflect responsibility and undermine the investigation. The controversy is likely to continue to dominate headlines in the coming weeks, as the US and Russia engage in a diplomatic standoff over the issue.",

The health care debacle has led to widespread criticism and calls for change within the administration. In response, President Donald Trump has announced a series of staff changes aimed at improving the functioning of his administration.\n\nThe most notable change is the departure of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who has been replaced by General John F. Kelly, the former Secretary of Homeland Security. Kelly is seen as a more forceful and organized leader who will help to streamline the administration's operations.\n\nIn addition to Priebus' departure, several other high-ranking officials have left the White House or announced their resignations. These include Mike Dubke, the Director of Communications, who resigned earlier this month, and Sean Spicer, the Press Secretary, who has been reassigned to a new role.\n\nThe staff shake-up is seen as an effort to address the growing criticism of the administration's ability to pass legislation. The failure to repeal the ACA has led to concerns about the administration's ability to deliver on its campaign promises.\n\nThe changes are also seen as an effort to improve the administration's public image.

        "Text": "A federal judge in Hawaii has extended his ruling halting President Donald Trump's revised travel ban indefinitely, allowing travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries to continue entering the United States. The revised ban, which aimed to restrict immigration from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, was set to take effect on March 16. However, Judge Derrick Watson's decision on March 15 has effectively put the ban on hold, citing concerns over its potential to discriminate against Muslims.\n\nThe ruling is a significant setback for the Trump administration, which has argued that the travel ban is necessary for national security reasons. The White House has repeatedly claimed that the ban is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and ensuring the safety of American citizens. However, opponents of the ban have argued that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional, citing the President's own campaign rhetoric and the fact that it targets predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nJudge Watson's decision is the latest development in a series of legal challenges to the travel ban. The original ban, signed by President Trump on January 27, was quickly blocked by federal courts in Washington and Hawaii. The Trump administration subsequently revised the ban, but it was met with similar resistance from the courts.\n\nThe latest ruling has been hailed by civil rights groups and advocacy organizations, who argue that it is a major victory for the principles of equality and justice. \"Today's decision is a testament to the resilience of the American legal system and the commitment of our courts to upholding the Constitution,\" said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project.\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to appeal the decision, but it is unclear when the appeal will be heard. In the meantime, travelers from the affected countries will continue to be allowed to enter the United States, and the government will be unable to implement its revised travel ban.\n\nAs the legal battle continues, the debate over the travel ban's merits will likely remain a contentious issue in American politics. Proponents of the ban argue that it is necessary for national security, while opponents argue that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional. Regardless of the outcome, the case has highlighted the ongoing tensions between the executive and judicial branches of government, as well as the importance of upholding the Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process.",

        "Text": "In a recent interview, a close ally of President Donald Trump has defended Ivanka Trump's new role as an advisor to the White House, stating that it is not an example of nepotism since she is not being paid for her services. The ally, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed that Ivanka's involvement in the administration is purely based on her expertise and qualifications, and not because of her familial ties to the President.\n\nIvanka Trump, the President's daughter, has taken on a new role as an unpaid senior advisor to her father, sparking concerns among critics that she is using her family connections to gain an advantage. However, the Trump ally dismissed these claims, stating that Ivanka's lack of compensation for her services proves that her involvement is not motivated by personal gain.\n\n\"Ivanka is not being paid, which shows that she is doing this out of a sense of duty and a desire to serve the country, not to line her own pockets,\" the ally said. \"She has a wealth of experience in business and has a unique perspective on how to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. The President has taken her on board because he values her input and expertise, not because of her family ties.\"\n\nThe Trump ally also pointed out that Ivanka has been working closely with the President's other advisors, including Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, to develop policies and initiatives that benefit the country. \"Ivanka is not just a figurehead; she is an integral part of the team and is working hard to make a positive impact,\" the ally said.\n\nDespite the ally's defense, critics remain skeptical about Ivanka's role in the administration. Many have questioned whether her lack of experience in government and politics makes her an appropriate choice for an advisor position. Others have expressed concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest, given her family's business ties and her own personal brand.\n\nAs the controversy surrounding Ivanka's role continues to unfold, the Trump administration remains committed to her involvement. In a statement, the White House said, \"Ivanka is a valued member of the team and is working closely with the President to advance his agenda. Her expertise and perspective are invaluable, and we are grateful to have her on board.\"\n\nFor now, it seems that Ivanka's position as an unpaid senior advisor will remain unchanged. However, as the debate surrounding her role continues to rage on, it remains to be seen whether her lack of compensation will be enough to silence critics and prove that her involvement is truly motivated by a desire to serve the country.",

        "Text": "The 51-50 vote marks the end of Trump's most challenging confirmation battle to date. Senate Democrats engaged in a marathon debate through the night and into Tuesday morning, attempting to block DeVos' confirmation with the support of Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Throughout the confirmation process, Democrats argued that they only needed \"one more\" Republican vote to sway the outcome. However, Senate Republican leaders ultimately succeeded in delivering a victory to Trump in a fight that few expected to be as contentious. DeVos' poor performance during her confirmation hearing, which included her suggestion that a Wyoming school might want to have guns on premises to protect against grizzly bears, sparked widespread anger among public school supporters and teachers' unions. Critics had already raised concerns about DeVos' lack of experience with public schools and her financial backing of initiatives like school vouchers, which could divert funds from public institutions. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed his disappointment with the vote shortly after DeVos' confirmation, tweeting, \"Today, @VP Mike Pence did something unprecedented: casting the tie-breaking vote on his own cabinet nominee.\" DeVos tweeted after the vote, \"I appreciate the Senate's diligence and am honored to serve as @usedgov Secretary. Let's improve options and outcomes for all US students.\" Senator Chris Murphy told CNN earlier that day that DeVos seemed to have no knowledge of the federal law protecting students with disabilities. \"You combine that with a lack of compassion for the tragedies that have occurred, such as Sandy Hook, and an inability to understand the basic law governing vulnerable students, and it was clear at the end of that hearing that this person was not suited to be Secretary of Education,\" the Connecticut Democrat said. In the aftermath of a 24-hour marathon of protests by Democrats both inside and outside the Capitol, which lasted through the night and into Tuesday morning, Betsy DeVos secured her Senate vote. The delay tactics employed by Democrats have been successful in stalling many of President Trump's most crucial Cabinet appointments, but Senate Republican leaders have vowed to hold votes for four key nominees this week: DeVos, Tom Price for Health and Human Services, Steven Mnuchin for Treasury, and Jeff Sessions for attorney general. Meanwhile, scrutiny of Trump's Cabinet picks has intensified, with new concerns emerging daily. Labor Department nominee Andrew Puzder recently admitted to hiring an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper, but Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn has pledged to overcome Democratic obstruction by working long hours at the Capitol, potentially even through Saturday. \"We'll be burning the midnight oil,\" Cornyn said on Monday.

        "Text": "Betsy DeVos' limited experience in education policy has sparked concerns about her ability to lead the federal agency responsible for elevating American public education for all students. However, there is another critical aspect to this debate that must be addressed, particularly in today's racially charged environment and considering the enduring impact of segregated schools on our political landscape. Racial animus was a primary driver of the shift towards private and religious K-12 education nearly 50 years ago, and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling, public and private, today. DeVos' track record suggests that she will not take meaningful action to combat these trends. Following the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which declared that separate schools for black and white students were inherently unequal, the federal government began to slowly desegregate schools in the South that had previously been forbidden by law from educating children of different races together. Additionally, the government addressed de facto segregation in schools in the North. The backlash was intense, with prominent figures like Alabama Governor George Wallace and Louise Day Hicks leading opposition to desegregation. However, the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools, leading to an estimated half-million white students leaving public schools between 1964 and 1975 to enroll in \"segregation academies\" - a phenomenon that was part of a larger \"white flight\" movement. This demographic shift saw millions of whites migrate from cities to racially isolated suburbs, marking one of the most significant population changes in American history. Noted scholar Kevin Kruse has described \"white flight\" as the most effective response to the moral demands of the civil rights movement and the legal authority of the courts, leading to a re-segregation of American schools. The character and quality of most American schools today, mirroring the neighborhoods they serve, are deeply rooted in a racial past. Unfortunately, public schools in the US are reverting to a type of racial segregation reminiscent of the pre-Brown era. Over the past 25 years, the number of severely racially isolated schools, defined as those with 0-10% white students, has tripled. In New York City, in 2010, a staggering 92% of black students and 88% of Latino students attended majority-minority schools, some of which are plagued by extreme poverty and have been dubbed \"apartheid schools.\" In Michigan, where charter schools have proliferated over the past two decades, public school enrollment and funding have declined, while segregation has increased. Moreover, public funding for private schools, as advocated by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, appears to have little positive impact on students of color. The idea that tax dollars \"follow the child\" through voucher programs and other public funding initiatives is misleading, as research has shown that private schools are even more segregated than public schools. This has negative consequences for both white students and students of color. Studies have consistently found that black children who attend desegregated schools tend to earn higher incomes, have better long-term health, and experience no negative effects on their white peers. Furthermore, a range of studies suggests that desegregated schools are more effective in educating all children to contribute to a healthier American economy and society. \"It is a moral shame and an economic misstep that the school choice and religious education movement is tainted by racial animosity, even in subtle forms. While many private and religious schools are excellent and welcoming institutions, we must not be deceived. School choice is not truly about freedom. Freedom is a fundamental American value, but the notion of 'freedom' that drives the exodus from integration and towards racial segregation will never lead to a genuinely free society. As senators deliberate on DeVos' nomination to oversee public education for every American child, they would do well to recall the core values of public schooling and the profound implications of appointing a Secretary of Education linked to an exclusive and racially discriminatory vision.\"\n\nI made some minor changes to improve clarity and flow, while preserving the original meaning and tone. Let me know if you have any specific requests or if you'd like me to revise anything further!",

        "Text": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a gathering of air force commanders in Tehran that the new US administration has revealed the \"depth of corruption\" within the US government, according to quotes published by MEHR news agency. Khamenei reportedly stated, \"We are grateful to this new administration in the White House, as it has largely accomplished what we had been trying to do for decades: to expose the true face of the US. We had been working to reveal the extent of corruption within the US government and among its ruling elite, and Trump has done so in just a few days after taking office.\" He added, \"Their claims of upholding human rights are no longer credible.\" Khamenei also referenced the case of a five-year-old Iranian boy who was detained at a US airport following Trump's travel ban, saying, \"By taking actions like handcuffing a five-year-old child, Trump is demonstrating the reality behind American claims of human rights.\" The comments come amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US since Trump took office. The travel ban, sanctions, and missile testing by Iran have contributed to the deteriorating relationship. Concerns have been raised over the future of a nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration, which requires Iran to significantly restrict its nuclear program. On Saturday, a day after the Trump administration imposed fresh sanctions over an Iranian ballistic missile test, US Defense Secretary James Mattis labeled Iran \"the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\" \"Two days prior, Trump had tweeted that Iran had been formally put on notice and should be thankful for the terrible deal brokered by the Obama administration. He refused to rule out the possibility of military action against Iran. However, a senior Iranian adviser to the Ayatollah, Ali Akbar Velayati, dismissed Trump's remarks as baseless and inflammatory. This is not the first time the Ayatollah has spoken critically of the US President. In November, during the election campaign, Khamenei strongly criticized both Trump and Hillary Clinton for exposing what he viewed as the moral shortcomings of the US.\" ",

        "Text": "AQAP leader Qassim al-Rimi released an 11-minute recording on Saturday, in which he condemned the January 29 raid and addressed the White House, saying, \"The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.\" The recording, translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, was released online. Rimi claimed in the recording that \"dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,\" a claim that contradicts the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens, and the wounding of three additional SEALs. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint operation between the US and the United Arab Emirates. According to a senior US military official, Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after the raid.\n\nAmong the dead was the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born cleric who directed attacks against the US and was killed in 2011. Human rights organizations, including Reprieve, a London-based NGO, and a Sanaa-based human rights worker, reported that at least 23 civilians were killed in the attack. In the recording, Rimi said that after the US forces escaped, they destroyed their own planes to prevent evidence of their actions from being found. A senior US military official stated that while intelligence collection was an objective of the raid, it was not the only goal. The official added that even if Rimi was not present, the US military believed it would find intelligence that could lead to him. The decision to green-light the mission was not dependent on Rimi's presence, according to a senior US military official. The US Central Command, which oversees forces in the region, had previously disputed that Rimi was the target of the raid more than a week ago. According to Col. John Thomas, the raid was not a high-priority mission aimed at killing or capturing terrorist leaders. Thomas stated that there was no strong evidence to suggest a \"high possibility\" that Rimi was at the compound on the night of the raid, and that Navy SEALs would have captured any leaders of the al Qaeda affiliate, including Rimi, as part of an intelligence-gathering operation. \"Anyone found on site would have been taken,\" Thomas emphasized. NBC initially reported that Rimi was a target of the raid, which may have justified the large allocation of resources used in the mission.\n\nThe raid did not go as planned, as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters detected the SEAL team before it reached its objective, leading to an intense firefight. Initially, the military stated that the goal of the mission was to gather intelligence on the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. Later, the Pentagon released clips from an al Qaeda training video seized during the raid, but withdrew them because the video was nearly a decade old. Government officials previously told CNN that plans for the raid had been in the works for months and that President Trump green-lighted the mission shortly after his inauguration.\n\nThe Pentagon reported that the battle resulted in the deaths of 14 al Qaeda fighters, including two AQAP leaders. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been regarded by many as the most perilous, if not the most perilous, offshoot of al Qaeda since its inception in 2009. Following a 2015 drone strike that claimed the life of Nasir al-Wuhayshi, Rimi allegedly took over as the group's leader.",

        "Text": "The White House released a list of 78 terror attacks on Monday to support President Donald Trump's claim that the media is not adequately reporting them. Trump told service-members at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida that terror attacks were happening \"all over Europe\" and that they were often not being reported. \"The dishonest press doesn't want to report it,\" Trump said, adding that they have their reasons. The White House later distributed a list of attacks, stating that \"most did not receive adequate attention\" from Western media sources. However, many of these attacks have been robustly covered by reporters in print, on air, and on social media. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius expressed concern over Trump's statement, saying, \"As a journalist, I'm really troubled by that.\" He pointed out that many journalists take big risks to cover these stories, citing The New York Times' recent reporting on ISIS's involvement in European and international attacks. Ignatius said he has around 100 examples of strong reporting he'd like to show the President. CNN's Anderson Cooper also highlighted his network's coverage of many of the events listed on the White House's list. \"Not only did we cover a significant number of the attacks listed by the White House, but we gave them extensive coverage,\" he said on Monday night, showing footage of himself reporting from Ottawa, Canada, in 2014, Paris in November 2015, San Bernardino, California, in 2015, and Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He clarified that while our program did not cover every single incident on the list, other programs, including CNN International, extensively covered most of them. The attacks listed span from September 2014 to December 2016, including notable incidents such as the Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting, and the truck attacks in Nice and Berlin. However, the White House only mentions attacks that appear to have been carried out with Islamist motives, omitting other terror operations. Notably, the list does not include the recent mosque attack in Quebec City or the racially motivated church shooting in South Carolina, in which nine black worshipers were killed. White House press secretary Sean Spicer later explained that President Trump believes some media outlets do not provide equal coverage to all terror attacks, noting that a protest might receive more attention than a foiled attack. Trump has used terror attacks to justify his controversial travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations and has repeatedly accused media organizations critical of him of spreading \"fake news.\"\" ",

        "Text": "A lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota has gained national attention since last Friday, when a federal district court judge halted President Trump's executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals and temporarily reopened US borders to immigrants. The hearing, which will be held by telephone and livestreamed, will take place on Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET and will last an hour. The central issue to be addressed is whether the judge who put a temporary hold on the travel ban, US District Court Judge James Robart, abused his discretion. No court has yet addressed the constitutionality of the executive order. The lawsuit was brought by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who was later joined by Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson. The Department of Justice's Civil Division is defending the executive order. The three-judge panel hearing the case was randomly assigned and consists of Judges William C. Canby Jr., Michelle T. Friedland, and Richard R. Clifton, appointed by Presidents Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush, respectively. Each side will have 30 minutes to present their arguments during the telephonic oral argument. In a brief submitted on Monday, the states' attorneys urged the appellate court to maintain the suspension of the travel ban. The states are arguing that the temporary restraining order should remain in place because the President's decision to sign the executive order has caused \"chaos\" and that the government's claim of irreparable harm is unfounded. They contend that accepting the government's position would mean that the defendants were suffering some unspecified harm before the order was issued, which makes no sense. The states argue that preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the best interest of all parties.\n\nThe Trump administration's argument is that the states do not have the right to sue in this case and that a district court judge cannot second-guess the President's national security judgment in the immigration context. The government also made a fallback argument, suggesting that if the appellate court upholds the district court's decision, it should only apply to a specific class of people who have been previously admitted to the US, such as those traveling on a student visa. The government believes that individuals outside the US who have never set foot on US soil have no constitutional right to enter the country.\n\nThe judges have several options to resolve this case, but it is unlikely that they will rule on the constitutionality of the ban, as that is not the question before them. The central issue is whether the executive order should remain suspended for now. For instance, the judges could reject the DOJ's request for a stay of Robart's decision because, as acknowledged by the government, temporary restraining orders are generally not appealable. Regardless of their decision, the suspension of the travel ban would remain in place while the case proceeds with additional scheduled hearings. Alternatively, the appellate court could find that Robart exceeded his authority by including classes of individuals not protected by the Constitution (such as aliens living abroad), in which case the ban would be reinstated. Once the three-judge panel issues its decision, the losing party has 14 days to file a petition for rehearing the case before the full appellate court, although this is not mandatory to reach the Supreme Court. Given the high stakes involved in this lawsuit, it is likely that the losing party will appeal to the Supreme Court. Currently, with only eight justices on the court, a 4-4 split would result in the Ninth Circuit's ruling becoming the law of the land.",

        "Text": "Romanian President Klaus Iohannis urged the nation to decide whether it wants to be a strong and prosperous country or a weak and disrespected one. He called for a referendum to allow the people to have a say in the matter. On Sunday, over half a million citizens took to the streets in the largest of a series of protests against a bill that would have shielded many politicians from corruption charges. The Social Democrat-led government responded by announcing it would repeal the decree, which had been approved just a week earlier without parliamentary input. However, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu indicated that he still intends to push through amendments to the criminal codes through parliamentary legislation.\n\nThe protests continued on Monday night, albeit on a smaller scale, with demands for the government's removal. In a speech on Tuesday, President Iohannis criticized the government's decision to withdraw the decree, saying it was too little, too late. While stopping short of calling for fresh elections, he chastised the center-left government, which has been in power since December, for prioritizing the interests of convicted politicians over those of the Romanian people. The governing coalition, comprising the Social Democrats and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, walked out of the room in response to the President's remarks. \"Are you already tired?\" Iohannis asked, adding, \"Too bad.\" Romania requires a robust government, one that is transparent and predictable in its decision-making, with all actions conducted in the open, not in secret. He asked, \"What kind of nation do we want to be? Do we want to be a strong and prosperous one, built on the rule of law and respect for it, where justice is powerful and independent? Or do we want to be a weak nation, despised and at risk, sacrificing everything to save a few from difficult times?\" He emphasized that this would be the central question and purpose of a referendum, which would genuinely gauge the will of the Romanian people. Demonstrations continued, with approximately 25,000 people gathering in Victory Square in Bucharest on Monday evening and around 20,000 elsewhere in the country, according to estimates from the Romanian media. Although the turnout was significantly lower than on Sunday, protesters still demanded the government's resignation. A counter-demonstration with around 3,000 people assembled outside the presidential palace, calling for President Iohannis to step down and supporting the government. In an interview with CNN, Vlad Mixich, a Romanian journalist and political commentator, commented on the President's address to Parliament, saying, \"He mainly spoke to the people who took to the streets last week. I think it was essential for him to do so.\" This was one of the largest protests in Romania since the fall of communism in 1989, so the President needed to address those in the streets directly, even if the protesters do not consider him their leader. Mixich described the proposed referendum as a symbolic gesture, a type of move that politicians often favor, as it would keep the issue in the spotlight. \"A brighter future is ahead, but only if some government ministers step down, according to Bianca Dumitru, a 25-year-old sports journalist from Brasov, Romania. She joined the protests in her hometown, saying, \"We've had enough of them.\" Dumitru praised the recent unity and motivation that swept the country, attributing it to the government's actions. However, she believes it's time for the government to let the people enjoy their victory and live in a prosperous environment with a promising future. The opposition has submitted a censure motion to Parliament, which is set to debate the issue on Wednesday. Despite this, the government's majority in the legislative body makes it unlikely that the motion will succeed.\"",

During their getaway, Branson, an avid water sports enthusiast, offered Obama the chance to learn how to kitesurf. To make the experience even more thrilling, Branson proposed a friendly challenge: he would try to learn how to foilboard before Obama mastered kitesurfing. They agreed to have a final showdown on the last day of their trip to see who could stay aloft the longest.\n\nKitesurfing involves riding a surfboard while holding onto a kite, while foilboarding involves riding a surfboard with a hydrofoil that lifts the board above the water's surface. After a few days of training, the challenge was on, and Obama emerged victorious. \"We were neck and neck until the last run on the last day, when I got up on the foilboard and screamed along for over 50 meters, three feet above the water,\" Branson wrote on Virgin.com. \"I was feeling very pleased with myself, only to look over and see Barack go 100 meters on his kiteboard!

        "Text": "For over a century, this method of birth control has been the standard. However, a new injectable gel called Vasalgel has shown promise in trials using monkeys. The gel blocks sperm inside the body, preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through, and has been found to be effective and safe in these trials. The researchers behind Vasalgel, led by the Parsemus Foundation, hope to begin human trials within the next few years. According to Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, the new study involving 16 male monkeys is a significant step forward. The monkeys were injected with Vasalgel and released into social outdoor housing with females, and their ability to impregnate the females was compared to a historical sample of monkeys that had undergone vasectomies. The study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of Vasalgel, and the results showed that none of the females in the group conceived during the breeding season. One monkey experienced some adverse effects, including an incorrectly inserted gel and a sperm granuloma, but the majority of the monkeys tolerated the gel well and showed little inflammation. In fact, the rates of granuloma and inflammation were lower than what is typically seen after a vasectomy. The team plans to conduct further animal trials this year and hopes to begin human clinical trials next year. However, Lissner notes that while the gel has shown promise in monkeys, it may not work exactly the same way in humans. She acknowledges that the task ahead is larger and more complex than initially anticipated. Administering Vasalgel involves injecting a polymer into the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis, to block sperm release. The procedure, which is performed under anesthesia, mimics the effect of a vasectomy but without the surgical incision. The polymer, known as Vasalgel, is a sticky gel that filters out sperm, allowing fluids to pass through while blocking sperm release. The backed-up sperm are then reabsorbed by the body. Unlike a traditional vasectomy, Vasalgel is designed to break down and be flushed out with a second solution, making the procedure reversible. However, successful reversibility has yet to be proven, as trials on rabbits showed reversibility, but trials on monkeys and baboons did not. The procedure also carries some risks, including the possibility of an immune reaction that could leave men less fertile after reversal, similar to vasectomy. According to Dr. Ilpo Huhtaniemi, emeritus professor of reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, approximately 50% of men who undergo vasectomy reversal remain infertile. While this new form of birth control doesn't entirely eliminate the possibility of men having children, it does offer an alternative method. The latest research on monkeys has sparked hope for a new, non-invasive form of contraception, but experts emphasize the need for further evidence on its reversibility. According to Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, the procedure needs to be proven reversible before it can be considered a viable replacement for traditional vasectomy methods. The idea of inserting a gel into the vas deferens to block sperm from reaching the penis is not new, but this study marks a step forward in developing the concept. A previous male hormonal birth control injection was discontinued due to side effects, and other approaches aimed at controlling sperm production through testosterone targeting have been hindered by side effects such as depression and weight gain. Japanese scientists discovered a crucial protein, calcineurin, which helps sperm swim and fertilize eggs, and blocking its genes in mice led to infertility. In contrast, Vasalgel has shown promising results in animals with minimal side effects. Lissner, the lead researcher, is confident that her team's gel will overcome the challenges and provide a hormone-free birth control option. \"Why manipulate the entire body when we can target a small tube where all the sperm swim through?\" she asked. While Vasalgel may be valuable for specific populations, Huhtaniemi believes that a less-invasive, pill-based option is needed for widespread use. \"We need a pill that's easy to administer,\" he said. \"It's feasible, we just need to find the right target.\"",

        "Text": "New Zealand Rugby has revealed that a room in Sydney's Double Bay Intercontinental Hotel, where the All Blacks held meetings before their August Bledisloe Cup clash with the Wallabies, was allegedly bugged. A 51-year-old security consultant, who was employed at the time of the alleged offense, has been charged with public mischief by New South Wales police. He is scheduled to appear in court on March 21.\n\nAll Blacks head coach Steve Hansen has described the charge as \"bizarre\" and \"unbelievable\". Hansen praised the accused individual, saying he is a well-respected professional who has worked with the All Blacks and other organizations for many years. However, he noted that due process must be followed, and it would be inappropriate to comment further on the matter.\n\nAustralia Rugby Union chief executive Bill Pulver commended the police for their investigation. However, he expressed disappointment that the discovery of the alleged bug was reported publicly on the day of the match, rather than earlier in the week. Pulver believes the resulting media attention was a distraction that neither team needed on the morning of the Test match. \"The Australian Rugby Union (ARU) and the Wallabies have been cleared of any wrongdoing, but it's essential that this matter has been resolved to provide absolute reassurance to all fans that the organization and the team had no involvement in the incident. While some questions may still linger, today's news is a welcome development, as an individual has been held accountable for their actions. The All Blacks, currently ranked the world's top rugby union team, went on to defeat Australia 42-8 in the match, securing their largest win over the Wallabies on Australian soil in 113 years. The team, led by coach Hansen, set a new world record with their 18th consecutive victory in the third and final Bledisloe Cup series fixture in Auckland, but later lost to Ireland in their next game in Chicago.\" ",

        "Text": "Doctors treating Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, at the hospital say they still lack a clear understanding of what caused his illness, but agree that a toxic substance is to blame, according to his lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov. Kara-Murza's wife, Yevgenia, told CNN that doctors have attempted to bring him out of a medically-induced coma, but he showed little response, except to his name being called. He is currently undergoing dialysis and artificial ventilation. Doctors have diagnosed him with acute intoxication by an unidentified substance, and there is no prognosis. The risks have increased due to his previous illness. Prokhorov told CNN that an investigator from Moscow's Khamovniki district contacted him last Friday to inquire about the circumstances surrounding Kara-Murza's hospitalization, but has since received no further updates on the ongoing investigation. \"The problem is that they're not paying any real attention to this,\" Prokhorov said. \"The investigative committee is only interested in this situation because of the media coverage.\" He has no direct proof that his client was poisoned. The Kremlin has previously denied any involvement in Kara-Murza's 2015 illness.\n\nIn 2015, Kara-Murza nearly died from a mysterious illness. \"I fell into a coma, and all of my major organs began failing, one after another,\" he said. \"It was the kidneys first, then the lungs, the heart, the liver.\" At the time, he believed his suspected poisoning was a politically motivated attack. \"Frankly, there's no other possible reason,\" he said. \"I don't have any money dealings. I don't have any personal enemies. I didn't steal anybody's wife.\" The case bears striking similarities to the 2006 poisoning of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko in London. A British public inquiry into the Litvinenko assassination found two former Russian agents responsible for carrying out the poisoning using the radioactive isotope Polonium-210. The inquiry's final report concluded that Putin was \"probably\" aware of the operation. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK inquiry as politically motivated, and the Kremlin denied any involvement. In February 2015, prominent Russian opposition figure and friend of Kara-Murza, Boris Nemtsov, was brutally murdered on a bridge near the Kremlin. Kara-Murza fell ill four months later. The hospitalization of Kara-Murza has sparked outrage among US lawmakers, who are urging the Trump administration to speak out on his behalf. Senator Marco Rubio, a frequent Putin critic, called for accountability if there is evidence that the Russian government was involved in Kara-Murza's poisoning. \"Vladimir Putin does not deserve the benefit of the doubt in this matter, given the alarming frequency of political assassinations and poisonings under his regime,\" Rubio said. \"I am praying for Kara-Murza's recovery.\" Rubio urged the White House and State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. As a dual Russian-British citizen, Kara-Murza splits his time between Russia and his family home in Virginia. He is a key figure in the Open Russia foundation, an organization of anti-Putin activists advocating for open elections, a free press, and civil rights reforms. When he fell ill last week, Kara-Murza was in Russia touring for screenings of a documentary about Nemtsov. ",

        "Text": "The Arkansas Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, signed into law by Governor Asa Hutchinson, will take effect later this year. The law prohibits dismemberment abortion, the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. A controversial clause allows a husband to sue a doctor to stop his wife's abortion, provided he is the father of the child. However, there is no exemption for cases of rape or incest, meaning a rapist could theoretically file suit to prevent an abortion. The ACLU of Arkansas has challenged the law's constitutionality and plans to take the case to court before it goes into effect. When asked about the lack of debate on these issues, Arkansas state Senator Joyce Elliott told CNN affiliate KARK that there was little discussion on the Senate floor. \"It felt kind of fruitless to make sense of the rest of the bill,\" she said, expressing frustration with the law's restrictions on women's autonomy. In contrast, Senator Missy Irvin believes that husbands should have a say in abortion decisions, arguing that \"when you have created a life, you created a life with someone else.\" Similar laws in Kansas and Oklahoma are currently tied up in court, according to CNN affiliate KFSM. \"Following Donald Trump's election, several states with conservative lawmakers have enacted stringent new abortion laws. One such state is Ohio, which has implemented a ban on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\" ",

        "Text": "Japan claims sovereignty over the islands, known as the Senkaku Islands, while China asserts control over the same territory, calling it the Diaoyu Islands. The latest sailing comes just days after US Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed the US commitment to defending Japan and its disputed islands. According to Japanese public broadcaster NHK, protests were lodged with the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and in Beijing through the Japanese Embassy. The disputed islands have been a source of tension between Japan and China in recent years, with several incidents involving Japanese and Chinese naval and air forces that have been deemed dangerous by both sides.\n\nChina's State Oceanic Administration, which oversees the country's Coast Guard, issued a statement on Monday, saying that three ships had cruised within China's territorial sea around the Diaoyu Islands. China's Defense Ministry separately confirmed the movement of the Coast Guard ships. Japan's Coast Guard reported that the Chinese vessels spent two hours in Japanese territorial waters, marking the fourth such incident this year. According to the Japanese Coast Guard, there were 36 such incidents in 2016. The latest sailing, which occurred shortly after US Defense Secretary James Mattis' visit to Japan, is seen by experts as a subtle message to both Tokyo and Washington. \"It is both a signal that China will not be intimidated from defending its interests and claims, and a test to see how the new Trump administration responds,\" said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center. Denny Roy, an Asian security expert at the East-West Center in Honolulu, warned that ship movements in disputed waters could escalate into a shooting incident. \"The danger of conflict is particularly high because military personnel on both sides are often eager to prove their determination to defend what they consider national territory,\" said Roy. A military confrontation between China and Japan could also draw in US forces. During a press conference in Tokyo on Saturday, Mattis stated that the US would defend the islands alongside Japan. \"I reiterated that our longstanding policy on the Senkaku Islands remains unchanged - the US will continue to recognize Japanese administration of the islands and, as such, Article 5 of the US-Japan Security Treaty applies,\" Mattis said, appearing alongside Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada. The US stance was reinforced on Tuesday in a phone call between Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a statement from Japan's Foreign Ministry. \"The United States will oppose any unilateral action that threatens to damage Japanese administration of the Senkaku Islands,\" Tillerson stated during the call, according to the Japanese statement. China responded swiftly to the US stance on the islands, claiming it would bring instability to the region. \"The Diaoyu Islands and affiliated islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. These are historical facts that cannot be altered. The US-Japan security treaty, a product of the Cold War, should not infringe on China's territorial sovereignty and legitimate rights,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement. \"We urge the US side to adopt a responsible attitude and refrain from making incorrect comments on the issue of Diaoyu Islands sovereignty,\" Lu added. The US commitment to the Senkakus is not new, as the Obama administration also stated in 2014 that the remote chain falls under the treaty.\" In November 2013, China unilaterally established an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over a significant portion of the East China Sea, including the disputed Senkaku Islands, despite protests from both Tokyo and Washington. Japan, meanwhile, has its own ADIZ covering the same area. Although the Senkaku Islands are currently uninhabited, control over them would grant the owner exclusive rights to oil, mineral, and fishing resources in the surrounding waters. The ongoing dispute over the Senkakus remains a point of contention in the US-China relationship, but Mattis' visit appeared to ease tensions in another area, the South China Sea. Although US Defense Secretary Mattis criticized China for eroding trust in the region by fortifying disputed islands in the South China Sea, he also stated that no increased US military activity was necessary. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu welcomed this stance, saying that Mattis' comments acknowledging the need for diplomatic resolution rather than large-scale military operations in the area were deserving of affirmation.",

        "Text": "A suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a parking lot near the Supreme Court in Kabul, the Afghan capital, according to Basir Mojahid, the spokesman for Kabul's chief of police. The attack, which occurred around 3:45 p.m. local time, targeted Supreme Court employees as they were leaving for the day, Mojahid said. At least 35 people were injured in the blast, according to Saleem Rasooli, head of Kabul hospitals. There have been no initial claims of responsibility for the attack. An eyewitness, Nimatullah Mati, described the explosion as powerful, saying it shook the ground as he was leaving his office, which is located opposite the Supreme Court. The area is home to several residential apartments and was crowded on Tuesday afternoon with people heading home from work. Ambulances and firetrucks arrived on the scene within five minutes, Mati said. Afghanistan's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, expressed his condolences on Twitter, saying, \"The blood of our people isn't cheap & won't be wasted.\" NATO also condemned the attack, with Italian army Lt. Gen. Rosario Castellano, deputy commander of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, stating, \"Anyone who seeks to destabilize the pillars of a functioning government are enemies of Afghanistan.\" The blast comes a month after a similar attack near the Afghan Parliament in Kabul, which killed at least 36 people and wounded dozens. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack on January 10. Tuesday's blast highlights the growing concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, where the country's security forces and international allies have been fighting Taliban militants and other radical groups for years. According to a new report from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, more than 11,000 people were killed or injured in 2016, the highest number of civilian casualties in a single year since the United Nations began systemically documenting those in 2009. The report reveals a devastating record high in child casualties in the ongoing Afghanistan War. According to the report, 923 children were killed last year, out of a total of 3,498 fatalities. Anti-government forces, primarily the Taliban, were responsible for nearly two-thirds of the casualties, as per the report. The report also highlights the growing presence of ISIS militants in the country, who frequently target Shia Muslims in their attacks. ",

        "Text": "A human rights group has accused the Syrian regime of carrying out a secret campaign of mass executions at Saydnaya prison, north of Damascus, with as many as 13,000 people killed since the start of the conflict. According to Amnesty International's report, \"Human Slaughterhouse,\" prisoners are taken from their cells in the dead of night, supposedly for a transfer, only to be hanged on the prison grounds, often unaware of their fate until the noose is placed around their neck. The report, the culmination of a year-long investigation, is based on testimony from 84 witnesses, including security guards, detainees, judges, and lawyers. The majority of those executed were civilians believed to be opposed to the government, the report found. \"This report reveals a hidden, monstrous campaign authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" said Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for research at Amnesty's Beirut office. The report alleges that detainees were given sham trials by a \"Military Field Court\" that had no connection to the rule of law. A former judge described the court's proceedings as follows: \"The judge will ask the name of the detainee and whether he committed the crime. Whether the answer is yes or no, he will be convicted... This court has no relation with the rule of law. This is not a court.\" The report also notes that there are two detention centers at Saydnaya prison, with the \"red building\" housing mainly civilian detainees arrested since 2011, and the \"white building\" housing military officers and soldiers. CNN has requested comment from the Syrian government. Amnesty International researcher Nicolette Waldman detailed the appalling conditions prisoners are allegedly subjected to. \"They are literally dying in large numbers due to repeated torture combined with the systematic denial of food, water, medicine, and medical care,\" she told CNN. Waldman noted that the report has garnered the attention it deserves, stating, \"It's a significant story. However, for those who work on Syria, it's a test case to see if the world still cares not just about the deaths, but the fact that they are organized and systematic.\" In light of the findings, Amnesty is urging an immediate investigation and calling on the UN to take swift action. \"I want to be crystal clear that these practices are unacceptable and must stop. Mass killings of civilians and extermination through starvation, illness, and treatable diseases must cease. Russia has a unique responsibility to uphold global peace and security,\" Waldman emphasized. \"We are calling on Russia to use its influence with the Syrian authorities to push for access to independent monitors in all government-run prisons in Syria where these atrocities are occurring, so that those responsible can be held accountable.\" At the UN, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative Peter Wilson responded to the report's allegations. \"We have seen the Amnesty International report on atrocities in Syria,\" he said. \"Our foreign secretary has expressed his disgust with this report. We strongly condemn these atrocities and continue to work to shed light on what's happening in Syria and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.\" President Bashar al-Assad's regime has a history of facing allegations of extrajudicial killings and war crimes during Syria's civil war, which began in 2011. In 2014, CNN obtained a report that revealed \"direct evidence\" of \"systematic torture and killing\" by the Syrian government, based on photographs leaked by a Syrian defector. One of the report's authors described it as a \"smoking gun\" that conclusively proved the use of torture. However, Assad has consistently denied the accusations against him, claiming that many are politically motivated. In a meeting with western visitors, including The New York Times, in November, Assad dismissed the criticism, saying, \"I'm just a headline - the bad president, the bad guy, who is killing the good guys.\" He argued that the real reason behind the accusations is to topple his government, which he believes does not align with the United States' interests. According to the UN, approximately 400,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, and an additional 4.8 million have fled the country.",

In his 20-year career of taking close-up portraits, he has used the same lighting, setting, angle, and camera for every subject. According to Schoeller, this approach ensures that what you see is what you get, with no retouching. By treating each portrait equally, regardless of the subject, Schoeller aims to uncover the truth in an often dishonest medium. \"I believe all photographs are dishonest,\" he said. \"You can't capture a person's true essence in a split second, but perhaps some photographs are more honest than others. I'm trying to steer towards the more honest side of the spectrum.\" Among the thousands of people he has photographed, Schoeller finds actors to be the most challenging subjects. \"Actors are difficult to photograph because they're always acting,\" he explained. \"You think you've captured an honest, great portrait, but when you review the contact sheets, you realize they were playing a role the entire time and you didn't even notice.\"  ",

        "Text": "The start of the men's downhill course in St. Moritz is a daunting prospect, with the steep slope of 100% or 45 degrees requiring TV cameramen to abseil into position while wearing crampons. But for the one skier brave enough to harness the breakneck speed, the reward will be the title of world downhill champion for the next two years. The 2017 World Championships, which kick off this week in the upscale Swiss town of St. Moritz, will culminate in the highlight event, a testament to the town's reputation as a premier destination for the jetset and its long history of hosting high-profile winter sports events. St. Moritz, nestled in the picturesque Engadin valley, has been a favorite among the international elite for generations, drawing discerning travelers to its gourmet restaurants and luxury hotels. With a rich heritage that includes hosting two Winter Olympics and four previous World Championships, St. Moritz is widely regarded as the \"home of winter sports.\" The 2017 World Championships will bring together 600 athletes from over 70 countries to compete in six alpine skiing disciplines, including slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill, super combined, and team event. For many skiers, the World Championships is the pinnacle of achievement, surpassing even the prestige of the World Cup circuit. \"It's like winning the Olympics, minus all the other sports – that's what the World Championships means to us,\" says Mikaela Shiffrin, the 21-year-old American sensation who leads the World Cup overall and slalom standings. Shiffrin is gunning for her third consecutive slalom world title, having won gold in Schladming in 2013 and Beaver Creek two years ago, as well as the Olympic slalom gold in 2014. As she acknowledges, she has set a high bar for herself, and anything less than victory would be a disappointment. \"Not winning is a feeling I dislike – it makes me feel like I've done something wrong,\" she confesses. The main event, however, will be Lindsey Vonn, the second most successful ski racer in history, with 77 World Cup wins, trailing only Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark (86). Vonn, a speed queen and 2010 Olympic downhill champion, is back on the circuit after a year-long hiatus due to a broken arm and severe nerve damage to her right hand sustained in a crash following knee surgery. Vonn has shown signs of her former dominance, winning her first race back in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany in January, but has also struggled with crashes, including a recent downhill event in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. In the opening run of the World Championships' first race, the women's super-G, Vonn skied out after losing her concentration, but managed to stay on her feet. \"I just lost my focus for a minute,\" Vonn said. \"The important thing is that I stayed upright.\" Austria's Nicole Schmidhofer took the gold medal, edging out Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein and home favorite Lara Gut, in perfect conditions that followed two days of heavy snow that had cancelled the men's and women's downhill training sessions. Defending champion Anna Veith, an Olympic gold medalist, failed to make the second run after missing a gate. The women's downhill, which starts lower than the men's, is a significant test of skill and endurance. Vonn's main rivals on Sunday will be World Cup overall champion Lara Gut and Slovenia's Ilka Stuhec, the current World Cup downhill leader. Tina Maze, a Slovenian skier who won the world title in 2015 and has since retired, was another notable competitor. The men's downhill event takes place on Saturday on the renowned \"Free Fall\" course, designed by Bernhard Russi, a two-time downhill world champion and 1972 Olympic gold medalist from Switzerland. Prior to the race, competitors will access the start hut via a steel staircase before hurtling down 2,625 meters to the Salastrains plateau above St. Moritz, Switzerland. Defending champion Patrick Kung of Switzerland is looking to retain his title, but Peter Fill of Italy, the 2015-16 World Cup champion, is currently leading the standings this season. Norway's Kjetil Jansrud and Italy's Dominik Paris, who won in Kitzbuhel, are in second and third place in the World Cup standings. Last year's winner at St. Moritz, Beat Feuz, a 29-year-old Swiss skier, is aiming to improve on his World Championship bronze medal from 2015. The men's slalom on February 19 is expected to be a thrilling competition between Austria's Marcel Hirscher and Sweden's Henrik Kristofferson. Hirscher, 27, has won four World Championship gold medals and a record five overall World Cup titles, while Kristofferson, 22, is the reigning World Cup slalom champion. Briton Dave Ryding is also worth keeping an eye on, having achieved a joint best result for his country with a second-place finish in the slalom at Kitzbuhel last month. Ryding's performance equaled the achievement of Konrad Bartelski in a downhill event in 1981. He followed up his success with a 10th-place finish in the Schladming night slalom and currently sits fifth in the World Cup slalom standings. For more news and video on skiing, visit cnn.com/skiing.

        "Text": "Science and art are intertwined, as evident in the precise technique of the scalpel, the sleek design of the laboratory, and the intimate observations made by scientists to discover new materials and microorganisms. Bio-art, an artistic genre that emerged in the 1980s, further solidifies this connection. According to artist and writer Frances Stracey, bio-art represents the intersection of art and biology, where living matter such as genes, cells, or animals serves as the medium. Bio-artists often incorporate imaging technologies into their work, bringing together living and dead matter in the gallery space. They draw upon biological metaphors to infuse their artwork with themes of healing and wounding. For example, BioCouture combines fashion, art, and biology to create new materials. As noted by author Suzanne Anker, bio-artists like Donna Franklin and Gary Cass have created dresses from cellulose generated by bacteria from red wine, while Suzanne Lee composes \"growing\" textiles using sugar, tea, and bacteria to fashion jackets and kimonos. Lee's work includes jackets made from cellulose produced by bacteria in green tea and sugar baths. Bio-art encompasses a wide range of mediums, including the skins and cells of celluloid and digital video, the membranes of sound, and the liquids and fluids of body parts and eyeballs. Another example is Christian B?k's The Xenotext, which uses a \"chemical alphabet\" to translate poetry into DNA sequences, which are then implanted into a bacterium's genome. When translated into a gene and integrated into the cell, the poetry becomes a set of instructions that cause the organism to manufacture a viable, benign protein in response. \"Biologist Bök writes, 'I'm engineering a life-form that not only serves as a durable archive for storing a poem, but also a machine that can write a poem - one that can persist on the planet until the sun's eventual demise.' In this era of collaboration, scientists and artists converge in newly created spaces of co-creation. Together, they engage with pressing questions about what constitutes life, sentience, and who decides which lives are saved, exploited, or destroyed. Bio-art synthesizes the hopes and concerns of both scientists and artists as we navigate an age of rapid, sometimes perilous transformations in human life and daily existence.\n\nAuthor Sheel Patel observes about Bök's work: 'If a living cell can be engineered to produce novel poetry, could we one day live in a society where humans are no longer necessary for generating new ideas and literary works?' In the interactive art-science exhibition Morbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts, actual and metaphorical communicative diseases are used to explore the often toxic relationship between human and non-human life. The exhibition delves into the precarious threshold between life and death in an era of species and habitat destruction, as well as the increasingly permeable boundaries of contemporary bodies. Science's ability to scrutinize every location, facilitated by its microscopic and bio-technological powers, trains us to detect disease everywhere. Meanwhile, dominant discourse suggests that some spaces, things, and objects are inherently more diseased than others.\" \"We are often taught to view disease as something that affects others, whether it's the homes of outsiders, the nests of insects, or the fabric of certain societies and belief systems. However, new perspectives in materialism and animal philosophy challenge our understanding of what life is and where it can be found, leading us to consider how humanity's actions can infect and taint everything it touches. This collision between the possibilities and limitations of human and non-human life is a precarious balance between nightmare and dream.\n\nMorbis Artis: Diseases of the Arts is a collection of 11 artistic works that explore the chaos of the world through various media and art forms. Each artist imagines disease differently, yet within the terror of their visions, there is also beauty and hope. In Drew Berry's video projection, infectious cells are set free, filling the exhibition space with droplets of life and death.

        "Text": "South Africa rugby legend Joost van der Westhuizen, who was confined to a wheelchair and struggled to speak in his later years due to motor neurone disease, passed away at the age of 45 on Monday. Despite his physical limitations, his contributions to the sport will never be forgotten, according to his former teammate Cobus Visagie. \"Joost essentially set the standard for modern scrumhalves,\" Visagie said on CNN's World Sport show on Tuesday. Standing at 6 feet 2 inches tall, van der Westhuizen played scrumhalf, a position typically occupied by the smallest players on the field. \"Sometimes I'd look around at the circle of players and see a man with boots three sizes bigger than mine - a scrumhalf!\" Visagie recalled, having played alongside van der Westhuizen at the 1999 World Cup and earning 29 caps for South Africa. \"He was incredibly fast, incredibly brave, and is renowned for the tackles he made in the 1995 World Cup, including the crucial one against Jonah Lomu in the final against New Zealand.\" In that game, van der Westhuizen brought down the giant winger when he had broken through the South African defense, helping the Springboks win 15-12 in extra time. The 1995 World Cup final, the first major sporting event held in South Africa after the end of Apartheid, has become an iconic moment in rugby history, immortalized in the Hollywood film \"Invictus.\" \"Who could forget that tackle in the '95 World Cup?\" former Springboks forward Alistair Hargreaves said. \"He was fearless, and for a scrumhalf, he certainly broke the mold. As a young boy, he embodied what South African rugby was all about. We idolized him.\" A star player from the Blitzboks leaves the sport on a high note. Scotland stuns Ireland in the opening match of the Six Nations tournament. Courage on the field is matched by courage off it for Joost van der Westhuizen, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011, a year after retiring from international rugby with a record 89 caps for the Springboks. Also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, the condition causes muscles to weaken and waste away over time. The \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" became a global phenomenon in 2014, raising awareness and funds for motor neurone disease research. Although never teammates, Hargreaves was fortunate to meet his childhood hero, van der Westhuizen, later in life. \"I met him after his playing career, and probably at a time when his illness was really taking hold,\" Hargreaves said. \"If he was resilient on the field, he proved to be even more courageous in the face of his diagnosis. What a remarkable battle he fought. You can only respect the man for his courage.\" After his diagnosis, van der Westhuizen founded the J9 Foundation, a charity dedicated to supporting those affected by motor neurone disease. \"It's incredibly sad, but Joost fought a long and courageous battle,\" Hargreaves added. \"He was aware of the struggle he faced, and I'm sure there's relief at the end of it. The guy has achieved so much, he's done so much for rugby, and I'm sure he'll be remembered as a legend of the game.\" \"For more news and videos, visit CNN's rugby page at cnn.com/rugly.

        "Text": "In 1499, Michelangelo completed the Pieta, a masterpiece that embodies the perfect blend of classical ideals and divine inspiration. Fast forward to 2017, when a peculiar item emerged on the internet: a Flamin' Hot Cheeto shaped like a dead gorilla. Dubbed \"Harambe the Gorilla\" by its creator, the Cheeto sparked a bidding war on eBay, with the seller claiming it sold for nearly $100,000 after 132 bids. We're choosing not to believe it, as it's unlikely that a Cheeto, no matter how peculiar, is worth such a staggering sum. The seller's legitimacy, however, is verified, with an active account since 2008 and a sufficient amount of buyer and seller feedback. Despite this, the absurdity of the situation is undeniable. The proliferation of Harambe Cheeto-related items on eBay has become a cruel joke, a commentary on the darker aspects of consumerism and humanity. If you're interested in purchasing one of these items, you can do so with your hard-earned cash. Alternatively, you could simply gaze at a bag of Cheetos and imagine the shapes you see. Ultimately, nothing seems to matter anymore.  ",

        "Text": "However, nature is not always benevolent. Half of the world's lion population resides in East Africa, and these majestic creatures have a taste for livestock. Historically, the Maasai have used force to protect their herds, often embarking on revenge missions to hunt and kill lions. In the past, the Maasai also practiced ritual killings, known as \"Ala-mayo.\" The killing of a lion, a symbol of strength and power, was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into the warrior class, \"Morani.\" Armed with a spear, these young men would become men, earning respect from their tribe upon their return. Although the Tanzanian government banned ritual killings in the 1970s, certain pockets of activity were tolerated in silence. In Ngorongoro Crater, a conservation area since 1959, the practice was deemed sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence. In the 1960s, the tribe claimed to have killed no more than 10 lions per year, but as the Maasai population grew in Ngorongoro, so did the threat to the lion population. Today, up to 40 lions, if not more, are under threat annually in the conservation area, and lion numbers are declining across Tanzania. Conservationists recognize the need for action and have made a remarkable breakthrough by enlisting the expertise of the Maasai themselves to patrol the Maasai Steppe. At around 5am, the Maasai \"Wildlife Warriors\" rise to the sound of birdsong, nature's alarm clock. They begin their day with a bowl of porridge and a cup of chai, then slip on sandals made from recycled old car tires and head out of their \"kraal,\" a small, sheltered community, to start tracking. These Maasai have traded their hunting ways for a life of conservation. As part of an initiative by the Tanzania People and Wildlife Fund, a organization dedicated to resolving human-animal conflict, the Wildlife Warriors are stationed across communities in Tarangire and the surrounding rangeland, utilizing their skills to protect what was once their adversary. Beyond the low wall of the kraal, tracks crisscross the dirt, betraying the presence of lions, hyenas, and wild dogs that visit at night, drawn to livestock and the community's water supply during the dry season. On a typical day, the Warriors might embark on an animal census, circling the Steppe in the early morning with a car provided by the Fund. However, when tracks begin inside the kraal, it's often a sign of a big cat. In such cases, the footprints usually lead to a kill. The next step is crucial. \"People are growing increasingly angry towards wildlife,\" says Wildlife Warrior Lucas Lengoje. In the past, a carcass would lead to retribution, but the Maasai's decreasing head of cattle per person has made each loss feel more devastating. \"The community finds it challenging to understand the importance of wildlife,\" Lengoje adds. \"It takes time to calm them down and for them to believe us, as they prioritize their livestock over wildlife.\" Some reprisals have become extreme, including poisoning carcasses between a lion's initial gorge and second feed, which not only kills the lion but also any animal that feeds on the subsequent carcass. The Wildlife Warriors intervene, defuse the situation, and ultimately provide solutions for their communities and those around them. One of their primary concerns is documenting the attack and location, using GPS to map the incident on the Fund's database. In addition to warning neighboring herders of potential dangers, the organization also provides contact information so Maasai people can claim compensation from the government if their cattle are lost. This marks the beginning of a long-term approach to preventing cattle loss. The organization, in collaboration with the Maasai, is using a innovative method called \"Living Walls\" to prevent cattle loss. These walls, made of African myrrh trees connected by chain link fences, have been successfully implemented across several communities. According to Elvis Kisimir from the organization, the key difference between traditional \"bomas\" and Living Walls is the use of chain link, which is more effective at keeping predators out. \"Bomas\" are made of dried twigs from thorny acacia bushes, but chain link is more secure, especially when combined with living, fast-growing thorny trees that become more difficult to breach over time. In the wet season, these walls can reach heights of over 12 feet. The organization has already built over 700 \"bomas\" and has seen a 99% reduction in cattle loss at night using the Living Wall method. To further supplement this success, the organization is launching education programs through Maasai Wildlife Warriors to promote coexistence between humans and predators. \"We wouldn't be able to achieve this on our own,\" admits Kisimir. \"Community is everything.\" Laly Lichtenfeld, executive director of the organization, describes this as \"the next step\" in creating a self-regulating environment where both Maasai people and lions can thrive. \"The Maasai people are absolutely critical to the conservation process in northern Tanzania,\" she emphasizes. \"This is their land, and their livelihoods are deeply dependent on wise environmental stewardship. Healthy grasslands mean healthy livestock, and the cattle are at the heart of their identity and economic well-being. If they can manage to maintain healthy ecosystems, everything in the system will benefit.\"",

        "Text": "The Dalai Lama, now 81, has laugh lines etched on his face, a testament to his infectious sense of humor. As he presided over the Emory-Tibet Symposium in December at a majestic temple in Mundgod, India, he showcased his playful nature. Thousands of saffron-robed nuns and monks, esteemed scientists, Tibetans, and curious followers gathered to explore the intersection of science and Buddhism. The crowd was initially somber, murmuring quietly and shifting in their seats as they waited for the proceedings to begin. But when the Dalai Lama emerged from a side door, the atmosphere transformed. The scraping of plastic chairs as the crowd stood and applauded was followed by gasps of joy as some prostrated themselves on the ground. Surrounded by monks in traditional attire and bodyguards in Western dress, the Dalai Lama smiled broadly, laughing and waving at the crowd. \"When you smile, I notice everyone around you smiles,\" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, observed during an interview with the Dalai Lama after the event. \"We are social animals,\" the Dalai Lama replied, \"and we need friends. Trust is essential for developing genuine friendships.\" The Dalai Lama believes that building trust requires showing genuine respect and love. He thinks that a warm, genuine smile is an important part of that. However, it's also clear that a sense of humor can go a long way in winning over a crowd. At a recent event, the Dalai Lama sat down in his floral chair, which was adorned with a pillow that looked like it had been borrowed from a monk's bed. The crowd grew quiet, leaning forward in anticipation of his words. But instead of offering a prayer or words of wisdom, he decided to wipe his brow, taking his time to do so. He then placed the white washcloth on his head, where it rested like an absurd hat. The audience giggled as he wore it for about an hour, enjoying the lighthearted moment.\n\nLater, he reached for a glass jar of candy on the low table in front of him and joked, \"This is not decoration.\" He pointed to himself and said \"eat,\" then unwrapped a gold foil candy and popped it into his mouth. His playful behavior, laughing and joking, quickly put the solemn and respectful crowd at ease. They began to laugh along with him, warming up to the idea of discussing heavy topics such as the fundamental constituents of the universe and the establishment of knowledge. The Dalai Lama later revealed to Gupta that he wears the washcloth in a playful way because he is a practical person who gets hot, but also because he believes it's essential for leaders, especially spiritual ones, to be relatable and playful. He emphasized that being too formal can be self-torture, and he often hopes for unexpected moments that will bring out the humanity in others. In 1954, he recalled a visit from an Indian ambassador in Peking, where the formal atmosphere was broken when officials brought in fruit and everyone relaxed. The Dalai Lama believes that people should let themselves be playful and find the humor in life, as it can help reduce stress and bring joy to others.\n\nIn his book \"My Spiritual Journey,\" the Dalai Lama describes himself as a \"professional laugher\" and attributes his cheerful nature to his upbringing in a family that values humor and playfulness. Research has shown that laughing and being playful can have numerous benefits, including lowering stress levels, increasing empathy, and fostering a sense of well-being. The Dalai Lama believes that adopting this approach can bring a deeper sense of peace and happiness, even in difficult times. He writes that focusing only on the negative aspects of life doesn't help find solutions and can destroy one's peace of mind. Instead, he encourages people to create reasons to smile, as genuine smiles can bring happiness to oneself and others.",

        "Text": "President Trump's defense of Russian President Putin after Fox's Bill O'Reilly called him a \"killer\" reveals a disturbing disregard for democratic norms. Trump's response, \"You think our country is so innocent,\" shows a blatant disregard for the values that have long defined America. While the United States has undoubtedly made mistakes throughout its history, its commitment to individual liberties and democratic ideals has remained unwavering. In stark contrast, Putin's Russia has seen the opposition decimated, critics imprisoned, and all branches of government brought under his control. The free press is a shadow of its former self, and critics, including journalists, continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances. One of Putin's most vocal critics, Vladimir Kara-Murza, remains in a Moscow hospital in grave condition after suffering a full organ failure that doctors agree was caused by a toxic substance. Despite Trump's comments and recent executive actions, he can expect pushback from a country committed to liberal democratic principles. The divide between the President and the American people has turned the United States into the latest battleground in a global clash of ideologies. The unexpected rise of populist authoritarianism has caught many off guard, but the millions of Americans who remain skeptical of Trump and are now protesting on a weekly basis can take comfort in knowing they are not alone. On Sunday, while the American public was glued to the Super Bowl, a remarkable sight unfolded in Romania. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest a government push to decriminalize corruption, and remarkably, they had already won. This display of democratic strength serves as a powerful reminder that there are still those who stand up for what is right, even in the face of authoritarianism. Demonstrations had started six days earlier, sparked by the government's attempt to quietly pass a decree that would have cleared the records and freed individuals convicted of corruption for amounts under $47,000. The government ultimately agreed to retract the order, but the protests only intensified, with protesters insisting they had taken to the streets to safeguard their democracy. Romanians were acutely aware of the importance of defending democracy, given their recent communist past and the erosion of liberal democracy in neighboring countries, which requires the separation of powers, an independent judiciary, free and fair elections, and the freedom to protest. Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the influx of refugees, demagogic politicians have exploited public discontent, vilifying foreigners and vowing to prioritize their country's \"true\" residents, thereby gradually dismantling the foundations of liberal democracy. While Romanians have scored a victory in this round, the forces defending democracy elsewhere, including in neighboring Hungary, have been losing ground. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has openly declared his intention to build an \"illiberal state\" and is making progress in his quest to emulate regimes led by leaders like Putin. Democratic freedoms have suffered significant setbacks in recent years. Turkey is sliding towards dictatorship, Venezuela remains mired in autocracy, and countries across every continent are facing similar challenges. As for the United States, some veterans of the struggle are pessimistic. When millions of women took to the streets the day after Trump's inauguration, Julia Ioffe, whose family fled Russia, dampened their enthusiasm by tweeting, \"The joyful, feisty crowds, the clever signs - it all feels like the protests in Moscow in 2011. That achieved nothing.\" It's true that protests have not yet achieved significant results against other authoritarian regimes. In Venezuela, the Chavista regime seized power in 1999, and despite the opposition's relentless efforts, it has managed to maintain its grip on power. Similarly, in Turkey, mass protests and even electoral victories have been unable to halt Recep Tayyip Erdogan's slide towards de facto authoritarianism. In Russia, Vladimir Putin has consolidated his power, with a compliant legislature and a stranglehold on the media. However, the story may unfold differently in the United States. Yascha Mounk, a Harvard expert on right-wing populism, has noted that President Trump's authoritarian tendencies are more pronounced than he initially feared, but he has also been heartened by the bravery of the opposition. The United States has a deeper wellspring of democratic tradition than any of the countries where liberal democracies have been undermined. Freedom from tyranny is the national creed, and Americans have a long history of defending their democratic way of life. Within days of Trump's inauguration, the country witnessed the largest national protest in its history. When he issued a travel ban targeting seven Muslim-majority countries, spontaneous demonstrations erupted at major airports across the country, with lawyers filing legal briefs on the spot. While the Republican-controlled Congress has been largely silent in the face of Trump's attacks on the independent media and the judiciary, the press has remained steadfast in its commitment to its duties, and judges have shown no signs of intimidation in the face of White House bullying. Even members of the executive branch have begun to speak out against the president's actions. While many Americans support Trump, there are signs that his sharp departure from democratic norms, his attacks on judges, and his vitriolic rhetoric against the media and critics of all kinds are generating a backlash. The battle for liberal democracy is being waged on two fronts: those fighting to defend it and those working to undermine it. By likening the United States to Putin's Russia, President Trump has effectively placed himself on the illiberal side of the divide. However, the American people have spent centuries building a strong democratic system, and they are prepared to fight to defend it.",

        "Text": "During the Cold War, the Kremlin employed a propaganda technique known as \"whataboutism\" to discredit the West. This tactic aimed to portray the West as morally flawed, making its criticism of the Soviet empire seem hypocritical. The Soviet Union would respond to any criticism of its actions (such as the war in Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, or persecution of dissidents) by listing Western abuses (supporting fascist dictatorships, suppressing trade unions, and racial oppression).\n\nA classic example of this technique was a joke about Radio Yerevan, a popular Soviet-era humor staple. In the joke, a caller asks about the average wage of an American manual worker, only to be met with a pause and the response, \"Over there, they lynch Negroes.\" This phrase became a derisive term for Soviet propaganda and seemed to die out in the 1990s when Russia's goal was to become like the West.\n\nHowever, under President Vladimir Putin, \"whataboutism\" made a comeback. Putin's propaganda machine focuses on spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) in the West. By convincing Americans, Britons, Germans, and others that their leaders are corrupt and incompetent, and that legality and liberty are a sham, Putin's strategy aims to make them less likely to take risks and make sacrifices in defending their countries.\n\nWhile \"whataboutism\" can be a useful tactic in argument, as it encourages scrutiny of criticism from a purported moral high ground, it is fundamentally different when employed by Putin's Russia. Unlike the West, which is genuinely self-critical and self-correcting, Russia's treatment of its indigenous populations, such as the Maris, Buryats, and Komis, is a stark reminder of its own human rights abuses. Therefore, it is disingenuous for Russia to lecture the West on minority rights. \"At the heart of our system is contestability. While our elected officials and government leaders are not infallible and can make mistakes, they are held accountable through various mechanisms. They face the risk of legal action, impeachment, media scrutiny, public protest, and potential removal from office, which can lead to a lifetime of reputational damage. These checks and balances may not be perfect, but they are effective. In contrast, President François Hollande's missteps in France have been relatively minor compared to the standards set by President Putin, who can remain in office indefinitely. President Trump's recent visa ban has been met with immediate legal challenges, a stark contrast to the lack of accountability faced by President Putin in Russia. It's telling that Trump seems to aspire to emulate Russia's authoritarian system, which he perceives as less constrained by legal limitations on executive power. This view is not only misguided but also dangerous. As the world's beacon of freedom and justice, America sets a standard for other political systems to follow. This reputation is a valuable asset, and Trump is squandering it with every utterance. Moral relativism is eroding sentiment in the frontline states of the new cold war. In countries like Bulgaria, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, pro-Western leaders are feeling hopeless, wondering why they should continue to fight for freedom when the leader of the free world has abandoned its principles. Furthermore, Trump's actions will spread the notion that power and money are the only currencies that matter, and that the political currency that truly works is forged from lies and fear. If these are the rules of the game, then it's better to play along.\" \"Despite initial doubts, it appears that Trump's strategy has been successful. Edward Lucas, a senior editor at The Economist, served as the publication's Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. Additionally, he holds the position of senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. The views expressed in this commentary are his own and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of The Economist or the Center for European Policy Analysis.\"",

        "Text": "Let's hope these came in handy when Melissa McCarthy parodied White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live over the weekend. We all know President Donald Trump's boss has a reputation for being thin-skinned and humorless, having complained on Twitter about SNL's countless spoofs, calling the show \"unwatchable,\" \"totally biased,\" and \"not funny.\" He's also taken aim at Alec Baldwin's impersonation, saying it \"just can't get any worse.\" I agree with that assessment; SNL has been relying too heavily on simply mimicking Trump and his antics through Baldwin, rather than cleverly satirizing him. Until this weekend, that is. Melissa McCarthy's take on Spicer was a game-changer, as she brought a well-studied ear for his tics and tone to the role. Exaggerating a White House spokesman might seem like inside-the-beltway humor, but in this era of reality TV, everyone around Trump is a character. The SNL writers didn't just mimic Spicer; they encapsulated a bigger story: what happens when a professional political operative becomes Trumpified. If you didn't laugh out loud, you might have Trump's thin-skin disorder. But will Spicer follow his boss's lead and tweet about how unfunny SNL is? Not if he's smart. If an SNL spoof is funny, the only way to handle it is to embrace it. At his next press briefing, which was rescheduled for Monday, Trump should take a lighthearted approach, brushing off the parody with a joke and a smile. He's already attempted this tactic in a recent interview with Extra, telling AJ Calloway that McCarthy \"could dial back\" her impressions, while also praising the show as \"funny.\" If Trump can continue to do so, he'll be following a long tradition of politicians taking parody in stride. In the past, politicians have demonstrated a sense of humor about being spoofed. For example, in 1995, House Republicans invited Chris Farley, who had been impersonating Speaker Newt Gingrich on Saturday Night Live, to impersonate him in person at a conference meeting, with Gingrich laughing along. Similarly, after Dana Carvey had been spoofing George H.W. Bush for four years, he was invited to the White House to meet the former president. After Bush lost the election, he even had Carvey come to cheer up his staff. More recently, in 2008, after Tina Fey had been perfectly portraying then-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, Palin appeared on Saturday Night Live alongside Fey and Alec Baldwin, who playfully mistook her for Fey and asked how she could appear on the show with the \"real\" Palin, \"that horrible woman.\" However, that was before Trump's presidency. During Trump's administration, many of his team members have become increasingly defensive, serious, and aggressive, adopting his rhetorical style of hyperbole, bombast, and fact-blurring. They say things publicly that I know they would never have said before. It seems like they're playing a part in a new reality show, one that Trump seems to be directing. I wouldn't be surprised if Spicer, in particular, reverts to Trump's lack of humor toward unflattering satire, sticking to the script and refusing to acknowledge the parody. However, that would only make things worse. \"The fact that the credibility of the White House and its staff is already being ridiculed just two weeks into the Trump administration is a concern. The appointment of Steve Bannon, a Trump political adviser, has raised questions about who will provide a calm and rational influence on the president. If the White House wants to ease these concerns, Press Secretary Sean Spicer should take a cue from his pre-Trump persona and play along with McCarthy's humor. Otherwise, the notion that Trump's White House can't handle a joke will become increasingly worrying.\"",

On March 14, 2017, we invite you and your school to join us for #MyFreedomDay, a global initiative to raise awareness about modern slavery and celebrate freedom. We encourage students to organize events at their school to highlight the issue and promote freedom. The schools that demonstrate the most enthusiasm and dedication to fighting slavery will be featured on CNN TV, CNN.com, and CNN Facebook. A few select schools will even receive a visit from a CNN correspondent, who will report live from the school on the day.\n\nTo participate, we encourage students and teachers to come up with their own creative ideas. Here are some suggestions to get you started:\n\n* Film Screening: Watch documentaries or movies that address human trafficking. You can access free CNN documentaries on cnn.com/myfreedom.\n* Art Show: Create artwork in any medium and display it at your school. Share your creations on Twitter or Instagram using #MyFreedomDay.

        "Text": "Lauren Chopek, now 19, once blamed herself for everything that happened to her. But she's since realized that she was a victim of sexual exploitation and trafficking, and that the guilt and shame belong to her perpetrators, not her. \"I was just a child,\" she says, her voice calm and serene as she sits in a safe house in rural Manitoba, a healing lodge that provided her with the love and protection she needed after escaping her life on the streets. Chopek was just 14 when she was trafficked for sex in her hometown of Winnipeg. Unfortunately, her story is all too common for indigenous girls in Canada, where they make up just 4% of the population but account for more than 50% of all sex trafficking victims. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted, but ultimately rooted in a legacy of poverty, racism, and abuse.\n\n\"I was making bad choices for a reason,\" Chopek explains. \"When you experience sexual abuse, it's confusing. You're never sure if it's your fault or theirs.\" Diane Redsky, who runs the Ma Mawi Wi Chi Itata Centre, an organization that advocates for indigenous women and children, including sex trafficking victims, says that the history of racism against indigenous Canadians perpetuates a cycle of violence and exploitation against them. Redsky's organization operates safe houses, rehabilitation programs, and prevention programs throughout Manitoba, including the rural healing lodge where Chopek stayed. \"It's extremely challenging for indigenous women to combat stereotypes when society is perpetuating violence and abuse against them, particularly against indigenous women and girls, which often leads to sex trafficking,\" says Redsky. Tanay Little's story exemplifies the insidious nature of abuse. At just 11 years old, Little was sexually exploited on the streets near her family's home in Winnipeg. An older girl, who pretended to be her friend, manipulated Little into drug use and then trafficked her for sex. \"I recall one instance where she locked me in a room and I was forced to have sex with two men, one after the other,\" Little shares. If she refused to comply, she was beaten. \"If you didn't get beaten, you'd be raped by multiple men,\" Little explains. The traffickers demanded a daily \"debt bondage\" of $1,000 to $2,000, which the girls were forced to pay to their captors or face severe consequences. These harrowing stories have been shared in family homes, police stations, and safe houses across Manitoba for years. The province is now pioneering a new approach to prevention and rehabilitation, with a focus on supporting victims. Redsky and others in Manitoba are leading transformative programs to identify the threats and risks prevalent in indigenous communities and provide targeted support. Jennifer Richardson runs Tracia's Trust, Manitoba's strategy to combat the sexual exploitation and trafficking of children. Manitoba's government has committed a significant investment of over $10 million Canadian per year to fund the program, a substantial amount considering the province's population of approximately one million people. According to Richardson, Manitoba has made tremendous progress in this area over the past decade, earning recognition as a leader in the field across Canada.\n\nThe program's innovative approach sets it apart from others, utilizing not only targeted funding but also words, actions, and training to combat human trafficking. One strategy involves outreach on neighborhood streets, carried out in partnership with law enforcement officers. The Winnipeg Police Department's elite unit is dispatched almost daily to counter sexual exploitation and human trafficking, marking a shift in their approach from solely focusing on enforcement to prioritizing victim support and perpetrator accountability.\n\nLaw enforcement officials acknowledge a history of bias and racism, which previously hindered their understanding of the vulnerabilities and risks faced by indigenous girls. \"We recognize that there is implicit bias within our police service, and we have taken steps to address it,\" says Danny Smyth, Winnipeg's deputy police chief. \"We have a dedicated outreach team that focuses on building relationships with individuals on the streets and establishing trust.\"\n\nHowever, the legacy of abuse and racism continues to hinder the healing process for Canada's indigenous community. An upcoming national inquiry will investigate the reasons behind the high number of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. Studies have shown that indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to die in violent circumstances than their non-indigenous counterparts. \"We are still living in a society that targets indigenous women and girls, and the national task force has concluded that there is a market for indigenous girls,\" says Redsky. \"This perpetuates a society that views indigenous women as less than human and of no value.\"",

        "Text": "In the background of a photo posted online, various products, including prescription medication, can be seen. However, upon closer inspection, the details of the pill bottle are illegible. At the Homeland Security Investigations Cyber Crimes Center, special agent and supervisor Jim Cole, an expert in Victim Identification, sets to work using cutting-edge technology. By leveraging technology that had not yet been released to the public, Cole and his team were able to reverse the motion blur on the pill bottle and extract some valuable information. They managed to decipher the offender's first name, \"Stephen,\" the first two letters of their last name, and the first three digits of the prescription order. With this information, Cole applied to the pharmacy for customer details on every individual who matched the criteria, which narrowed down the list to a man named Stephen Keating. Additionally, the team was able to extract the offender's fingerprints from the image, a feat that had never been accomplished before. The evidence gathered was strong enough to put Stephen Keating behind bars for 110 years, and investigators were able to rescue his 14 victims. Cole co-founded Project VIC, which aims to ensure that no victim is left behind. \"We strive to find these children as quickly as possible,\" Cole said. \"The longer it takes us, the longer the child is in harm's way.\" The task is daunting, as Cole notes that they are currently processing 500,000 images per week, which translates to over 25 million per year. The Keating case, which was previously a months-long investigation, was solved in just three weeks. In the past, uncovering such an image could have taken months or even years. Thanks to \"Photo DNA\" technology, investigators can now quickly sort through hundreds of thousands of photos, categorizing familiar images to focus on new victims. \"What used to take nine months now takes only a month,\" said Cole, a investigator. \"And it's not just photos - our technology also allows us to review video at a scale of about 100 times faster than before,\" he added. \"It's been a complete game-changer for law enforcement, and we hear that from the field all the time.\" Not only does this technology save time, but it also helps ease the psychological burden on investigators. \"We've definitely seen a mental health benefit from this technology,\" Cole said. \"Our offenders often use familiar, mundane images, which can be overwhelming for investigators to review. But with this technology, we can quickly identify and categorize those images, reducing the psychological toll on our team.\" The technology recently helped investigators identify a seemingly innocent photo of a known offender with her victim on vacation. The image showed the pair holding fish at a campsite, and by isolating the fish and sending them to Cornell University, investigators were able to determine the geographical area where those fish could be caught. The campsite image, with the child and perpetrator removed, was then sent to every campsite advertiser in that location. Within just four hours, investigators had identified the child, and she was rescued. The woman responsible is now serving a 25-year sentence. A second image, featuring an offender with a young girl, caught the attention of the Project VIC team. The image showed a company logo on the man's sweatshirt, but the team couldn't decipher the writing at first. Thanks to advanced technology, the logo became almost completely legible, leading investigators to a plumbing business. An online search for matching names revealed a former employee, who was subsequently tracked down and four victims were rescued. Unfortunately, the proliferation of such images online is a growing global problem. Last year, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) received a staggering 4.4 million reports to its CyberTipline, an 800% increase from 2013. These reports come from the public as well as companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter, which are mandated by U.S. regulations to report any such images. According to Lindsay Olson, director of the Exploited Child Division at NCMEC, 94% of the cases reported last year were outside the United States. The CyberTipline receives reports of various forms of child exploitation, including child pornography, online enticement, sex trafficking, and child molestation. Olson explained that the organization makes reports available to law enforcement agencies in over 100 countries and collaborates with Europol and Interpol. Griffeye, a Swedish-based company, was a founding partner of Project VIC and donates its software for use in child exploitation cases. According to Johann Hofmann, director of Griffeye, the increasing digital nature of crime means that law enforcement agencies need to adapt and use the right tools to crack cases. The Internet has no borders, and law enforcement agencies must overcome traditional geographic boundaries to work together effectively. Project VIC is now being used by Interpol, Europol, and agencies in 35 countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, with a rollout planned in Australia. In the United States, the results of Project VIC have been impressive, with over 1,000 victims rescued by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) alone in the past year. Similar success has been seen in other agencies as well.",

        "Text": "Lan's life was forever changed on a fateful night. While preparing for university along the northern Vietnam-China border, a friend she had met online invited her to a group dinner. Despite feeling tired and wanting to go home, the group persuaded her to stay and socialize. Before she knew it, she was being smuggled across the border to China. \"I wanted to leave, but there were other girls there, and we were being guarded,\" Lan recalls. The villages along the border are notorious hunting grounds for human traffickers, who prey on young girls as young as 13. These girls are often tricked or drugged and then smuggled across the porous border by boat, motorbike, or car.\n\nIn China, where the one-child policy and cultural preference for sons have created a severe gender imbalance, young Vietnamese women are highly sought after as brides. According to Ha Thi Van Khanh, national project coordinator for the U.N.'s anti-trafficking organization in Vietnam, it can cost a Chinese man a significant amount of money to marry a local woman. This is because traditional Chinese customs require the groom to host an elaborate banquet and purchase a new home after the wedding. As a result, many Chinese men turn to neighboring countries, including Vietnam, to find brides.\n\nDiep Vuong, founder of the Pacific Links Foundation, estimates that Vietnamese brides can sell for upwards of $3,000 to the end buyer, making them a highly valuable commodity. Vietnamese women are often considered desirable due to cultural similarities with the Chinese. Nguyen's story is a stark reminder of the dangers of human trafficking. At just 16, she was drugged and smuggled into China by a friend's boyfriend, and then forced into a marriage against her will. For three months, she resisted, despite being subjected to physical abuse, starvation, and threats of death, she claims. Eventually, she relented. She says her husband was kind to her, but she never stopped longing for her family in Vietnam. \"My yearning to return home was unutterable,\" Nguyen said. \"I agreed to marry the man, but I couldn't stay with a stranger I didn't love.\" When her mother-in-law realized Lan would never accept the marriage, the family returned her to the traffickers. According to Nguyen, the family received a refund, after which she was forced into a second marriage.\n\nA refuge for escaped women, the Pacific Links Foundation operates a shelter for trafficking victims in Lao Cai, northern Vietnam. The young women typically stay for two to three years, during which time they attend school or receive vocational training, participate in art therapy, learn cooking and sewing skills, and tend to a large garden. Surrounded by others who have experienced similar trauma, the shelter helps them regain their footing and eventually find employment to support themselves. \"Once these young women can invest in themselves, it becomes much easier for them to lead independent lives,\" says Diep. The organization also conducts community outreach efforts to prevent more girls from falling prey to traffickers.\n\nOnce a month, a group of trafficking survivors visits the market in Bac Ha, a regional hub for buying food, fabric, and livestock. On this day, on a stage overlooking hundreds of shoppers, they share their stories, answer questions, and engage in games with the crowd. When they ask people to share their personal experiences related to trafficking, more than 20 individuals come forward. \"I believe awareness is the key to tackling human trafficking,\" says Diep. Ha, a representative from the United Nations, agrees that spreading awareness is the top priority, particularly in poor, rural areas along the border. She also believes that reducing poverty would help prevent women from being lured to China for work, another common tactic used by traffickers. During our visit to the border, we received a call from the government informing us that police had just rescued five girls who were about to cross the border with a trafficker. We met the girls, who were just 14 years old. They revealed that they had been promised $600 to work in China by a neighbor from their same village, and had not informed their parents of their plans. The neighbor is now under arrest.\n\nThe Vietnamese police have been able to rescue women even after they have crossed into China, thanks to cooperation with Chinese authorities. Nguyen Tuong Long, the head of the government's social vice prevention department in Lao Cai, notes that last year they successfully rescued and returned 109 Vietnamese trafficking victims. \"Our collaboration with the Chinese police has allowed us to dismantle trafficking rings and rescue women who were being forced into sex work at brothels deep inside China,\" Nguyen says.\n\nTrafficked women who are not rescued during raids often have to find ways to escape on their own. Some of them have reported contacting their families from China, but were unable to receive help from the police because they did not know their exact location. Lan and Nguyen, for example, ended up in the same town in China. After two years, they managed to sneak out of their homes and take a taxi to a local police station, all while fearing that their husbands' families would find them. The Chinese police investigated and eventually returned them to Vietnam. Although they were finally free from their forced marriages, the women paid a heavy price, as they were forced to leave their babies behind. Lan says that if she were to see her daughter again, she would apologize for abandoning her. \"I hope she'll have a better life there,\" she says.\n\nBoth Lan and Nguyen recall that their teachers had spoken to them about trafficking in school, but at the time, neither believed it could happen to them.",

        "Text": "The Trump brand, which was once synonymous with success, luxury, and elegance, has undergone a drastic transformation in just two years. What was once a symbol of sophistication and high-end quality is now associated with racism, sexism, and xenophobia. This shift in perception has not only tarnished the brand's reputation but also had a ripple effect on the Trump children's business ventures. The polarizing nature of the brand makes it a liability, as evidenced by Nordstrom's decision to drop the Ivanka Trump line. While the company claims the move was based solely on sales results, it's likely that the brand's negative connotations played a significant role. The Trump brand has become so controversial that Nordstrom may have seen it as a risk to be associated with it too closely. By dropping the line, Nordstrom can maintain a neutral stance while avoiding any perceived support for the Trump administration. At the same time, the company must tread carefully to avoid appearing opposed to the brand, as publicly provoking a president can be a risky move. This delicate balancing act is particularly challenging when selling a product line. Nordstrom's decision to stop carrying the Trump brand due to poor sales was likely an attempt to distance themselves from a controversy. However, with Donald Trump, things rarely unfold smoothly. Trump responded to the news on Twitter, defending his daughter Ivanka and attacking Nordstrom, writing \"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person...terrible!\" While Trump is not the first president to come to his family's defense, his habit of using social media to criticize individuals and companies has raised the stakes for brands.\n\nIn the past, politicians have defended their family members from criticism. For example, in 1950, President Harry Truman's daughter was the subject of a negative music review, prompting Truman to send a stern letter to the critic. However, Trump's behavior on social media has created a unique challenge for brands. As a father and businessman, Trump's tweets can have significant consequences for companies and individuals.\n\nMost brands aim to remain politically neutral, avoiding any perceived allegiance to one party or the other. Nordstrom, for instance, recently tweeted that \"We hope that offering a vendor's products isn't misunderstood as us taking a political position.\" Unfortunately, the Trump brand has become closely tied to the Trump administration, making it difficult for the brand to maintain a neutral stance.\n\nAs a result, the Trump brand, including the Ivanka Trump line, faces significant challenges moving forward. To succeed, the brand team must be prepared for a tough year and manage expectations accordingly. They should also be proactive in explaining any sales drops and conserve resources. Additionally, the team should focus on reducing polarization and finding ways to appeal to a broader audience. \"The Trump brand's fortunes will likely recover if it can secure early successes and broaden its appeal. For retailers and licensees, it's crucial to remain neutral and avoid being perceived as taking a stance on the Trump brand. In most cases, this means refraining from making statements or taking actions that could be misinterpreted as support. The goal is to maintain a neutral stance, rather than risking a public backlash from the President, as Nordstrom experienced. As Nordstrom and other retailers have already distanced themselves from the Trump brand, it's clear that a rebranding effort is necessary. Until then, most brands will likely keep a safe distance from the Trump brand.\"",

        "Text": "President Trump acknowledged on Wednesday that his travel ban would benefit from public approval, so he made a case for himself as an expert on terrorism. Trump suggested that many Americans, including those without access to classified briefings, underestimate the threat of terrorism against the United States. Speaking to a gathering of sheriffs at a Washington hotel, Trump stated, \"Terrorism is a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand.\" The President hinted at information gleaned from his classified briefings, saying, \"Believe me, I've learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\" Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who served under President Bush during the 9/11 attacks, noted that all presidents use \"realistic, worst-case scenarios\" to push their agendas. However, he cautioned that this tactic can be abused and undermine an administration if taken too far. \"Like anything, you can go too far,\" Fleischer said. \"You can exaggerate, get facts wrong, or hype it to a degree where you lose credibility.\" Nevertheless, using worst-case scenarios to drive an agenda is a long-standing tradition in American politics, Fleischer added. Trump has successfully employed this tactic in the past, using fear-mongering to rally his supporters during the 2016 campaign. In his June Republican National Convention acceptance speech, Trump declared, \"People are scared, and the attacks on our police and terrorism in our cities threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\" As a result, more Americans viewed terrorism as a pressing concern in 2016 than at any point since 2003. According to a CNN poll released in 2016, a staggering 71% of Americans believed that further acts of terrorism were highly likely to occur in the United States within the next few weeks, a level of concern not seen since March 2003. As President, Trump employed a two-pronged strategy. Firstly, he used alarmist language to promote his travel ban to a skeptical public. Secondly, he implied that he possessed confidential information about the need for the ban, which the judges overseeing the legal challenges did not have access to. The public is deeply divided on Trump's executive order, which prohibits citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days, suspends all refugee immigration for 120 days, and indefinitely halts the Syrian refugee program. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday, a majority of voters disapprove of key aspects of Trump's order. The poll found that 51% of the public opposes suspending travel to the US for 90 days from seven countries, 60% opposes suspending all refugee immigration for 120 days, and 70% opposes indefinitely suspending the Syrian refugee program. Trump's order was presented to a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday, where lawyers from Trump's Justice Department clashed with the states of Washington and Minnesota. The court is expected to rule on the order by the end of the week. In a recent address to a group of sheriffs, Trump dismissed the arguments against his travel ban, claiming that even a \"bad high school student\" could understand the language of his order and find in his favor. In contrast, after high-profile attacks in San Bernardino and Paris, President Barack Obama offered words of reassurance, stating, \"The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.\" Obama also urged vigilance, saying, \"Let's be vigilant, but not afraid,\" in his final speech as President. \"Islamic State (ISIS) will undoubtedly attempt to harm innocent people, but they cannot prevail against America unless we compromise our Constitution and fundamental values in the fight against them. Even George W. Bush, who, during the run-up to the Iraq War and in the context of homeland security, sometimes fueled fear, remained measured in his response to the 9/11 attacks. In the aftermath of the deadliest terrorist attack in US history, Bush urged Americans to carry on with their daily lives, saying, 'We cannot let the terrorists achieve their objective of instilling fear in our nation, causing us to abandon our daily routines, and disrupting our economy.' Bush also reflected on the United States as a beacon of freedom, where immigrants are drawn to the dream of liberty and where citizens demonstrate calm in times of crisis and compassion in the face of suffering.\n\nA notable example of Bush using fear to his advantage was his push to establish the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. At the time, Bush would regularly review his morning 'threat matrix' - a document detailing potential threats produced by the Department of Homeland Security - and use it to promote his plan to combat terrorism. In his speech announcing the new agency, Bush acknowledged that it's impossible to predict or prevent every attack, saying, 'In a free and open society, no department of government can completely guarantee our safety against ruthless killers who operate in the shadows.' Nevertheless, he emphasized that the government would take every necessary step to protect the country and its people.\"",

        "Text": "Senator Richard Blumenthal reported that Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's nominee, expressed disappointment and dismay to him about Trump's attack on a federal judge on Twitter. Within 30 minutes, Gorsuch's spokesperson, Ron Bonjean, confirmed that the nominee had indeed used those words during their meeting. Several other senators, including Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, later corroborated that Gorsuch strongly criticized Trump's public attacks on the judiciary. In an MSNBC interview, Blumenthal recalled that Gorsuch had specifically told him to feel free to share their conversation about the disheartening and demoralizing impact of Trump's attacks. However, Trump responded to Blumenthal's account by questioning his credibility, citing a long-standing controversy over Blumenthal's claims about serving in Vietnam. Trump's tweet accused Blumenthal of misrepresenting Gorsuch's comments, while also raising questions about the coherence of the White House's messaging. The controversy arose in response to Trump's recent criticism of federal judges who have ruled against his immigration ban, including a tweet in which he labeled one judge as a \"so-called judge.\" In the tweet, Trump called the judge's opinion \"ridiculous\" and predicted it would be overturned. On Wednesday, President Trump escalated his criticism of the judiciary, claiming that judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals might rule against his appeal to reverse a temporary stay on his travel ban due to political considerations rather than the law. Senator Richard Blumenthal reaffirmed his account of Neil Gorsuch's comments, telling CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" that he \"absolutely and accurately\" conveyed what Gorsuch told him. Blumenthal suggested that President Trump may not be aware of Gorsuch's views, stating, \"Maybe he simply hasn't been informed, and that's the reason for his tweet.\" Former Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is helping to advance Gorsuch's nomination, released a statement on Thursday saying that Gorsuch has expressed his disapproval of any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence, describing it as \"disheartening and demoralizing.\" Ayotte added that Gorsuch has made it clear he cannot comment on specific cases or political matters due to judicial ethics. Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska also confirmed that Gorsuch criticized Trump's attacks on the federal judge during a meeting, stating that Gorsuch \"got pretty passionate\" about the topic, particularly when discussing Trump's \"so-called judge\" tweet. Sasse described Gorsuch as a strong advocate for an independent judiciary, saying, \"This is a guy who welled up with some energy. He said any attack on any brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges.\" The President's jab at Blumenthal's military service is a reference to Blumenthal's past inaccuracies about his service during the Vietnam era. Blumenthal received multiple military deferments to avoid being drafted into the Vietnam War, ultimately joining the Marine Corps Reserve without being deployed to Vietnam. However, he has repeatedly claimed to have served in Vietnam, which he later apologized for in 2010. In contrast, Trump, who was also eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, did not enlist, instead obtaining multiple student deferments and a medical deferment for a bone spur to avoid the military draft.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, plans to ask Judge Gorsuch about his commitment to judicial independence during their personal meeting, citing President Trump's recent comments about judges. Coons stated in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota that Trump's involvement in the nomination process is not constructive and may hinder Gorsuch's chances of being confirmed. Coons emphasized that judicial independence is crucial, especially given Trump's recent comments.\n\nTrump's tweet on Thursday may complicate the upcoming hearings for Gorsuch, who will likely face questions from Democrats about the President's tweets. Liberals have expressed concerns about Gorsuch's record and have questioned how he will demonstrate independence from the President. Additionally, Trump is scheduled to meet with red state Democrats for lunch in an effort to win their support for Gorsuch's nomination. CNN's Ashley Killough, Jeff Zeleny, and Eugene Scott contributed to this report.",

        "Text": "Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two from Arizona, has been deported to her native Mexico, according to Carlos Garcia, director of Puente Arizona. Garcia de Rayos was taken into custody during her routine check-in with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Phoenix on Wednesday and was ordered to be deported. ICE officials said she was detained due to a removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which became final in May 2013.\n\nGarcia de Rayos, a mother of two, had gone to her regular check-in with ICE in Phoenix on Wednesday, but her meeting with immigration officials took an unexpected turn when she was taken into custody and ordered to be deported. \"Lupita has been doing yearly check-ins with ICE and nothing happened, but this is a different time,\" said Lucy Sandoval, an activist who has been working with Garcia de Rayos' family.\n\nImmigration advocates believe Garcia de Rayos' detention reflects the Trump administration's tough stance on illegal immigration. Her attorney told CNN affiliate KNXV-TV that she could be the first Arizonan to be deported under President Donald Trump's new executive order, which prioritizes removing undocumented immigrants with a history of arrests. Under the new policy, any undocumented immigrant convicted or simply charged with a crime who hasn't been adjudicated could be deported, a departure from the Obama administration's policy, which only prioritized deporting undocumented immigrants convicted of a felony, serious misdemeanor, or multiple misdemeanors.\n\nGarcia de Rayos was arrested in a workplace raid in 2008, convicted of felony impersonation, and served six months in ICE detention before being released later that year, according to CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK-TV. Originally from Mexico, she was living in the country without legal documentation. Immigration officials said she was detained due to a removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which became final in May 2013. According to ICE, Ms. Garcia De Rayos has a prior felony conviction from March 2009 for criminal impersonation, which she obtained a false Social Security card for employment. Before her meeting with ICE, Garcia de Rayos prayed, saying she wanted to confront the situation. Despite warnings from activists, who offered her sanctuary, she decided to attend the meeting. \"She wanted to confront this,\" said Sandoval, an activist. \"She was brave... She's a woman of faith, and they were praying and hoping for a change of heart.\" On Wednesday evening, seven people were arrested outside the Phoenix ICE office when protesters tried to block an agency van from taking Garcia de Rayos away. It was unclear whether she would be deported immediately or held at a detention center. The protests were mostly peaceful, but police reported that some individuals refused to stop despite repeated warnings. Garcia de Rayos' husband and teenage children joined the protesters outside ICE headquarters. When asked what she would ask President Trump if she could, Garcia de Rayos' daughter Jacqueline said, \"I'd ask him, 'Why would he want to take her from me?' She hasn't done anything wrong, and I'm not scared of him.\" Immigrant rights group Puente Arizona blames former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's policies for Garcia de Rayos' situation, saying she is a victim of his crackdown on immigration. One of Arpaio's most notable tactics to combat illegal immigration in Arizona was enforcing identity theft laws. Puente, a plaintiff, claimed that the workplace raids, including the one that resulted in Garcia's arrest nine years ago for using a fake Social Security number, were unconstitutional and amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. Although the case was lost on appeal, Arpaio eventually disbanded the task force responsible for the raids. \n\nPresident Trump's immigration executive orders could significantly expand the authority of individual immigration officers and dramatically increase efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. The order outlines specific categories of undocumented immigrants that immigration law enforcement officials should prioritize for removal, a response to criticism that the Obama administration did not enforce immigration laws stringently enough. \n\nUnder the Obama administration, immigration officials prioritized the removal of undocumented immigrants who posed a threat to public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gangs, committed serious felonies, or were habitual misdemeanor offenders. Trump's order goes further, using a broad definition of \"criminal\" and granting a single immigration officer the discretion to determine threats to public safety. The order prioritizes removing deportable immigrants who have been convicted of any crime, are charged with a crime and have not been resolved, have committed acts that could lead to a criminal charge, have engaged in fraud or misrepresented themselves in an official matter, have abused public benefits, have failed to comply with a final removal order, or, in the judgment of an immigration officer, pose a risk to public safety or national security.",

        "Text": "According to Russian state-run news agency Tass, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to express his condolences over the tragic accident that resulted in the deaths of several Turkish military servicemen.\n\nA statement released by the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that Russian fighter jets were engaged in a combat mission to destroy ISIS militants' positions in the area. The statement revealed that General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces, extended his condolences to Turkish General Hulusi Akar for the men killed in an unintended attack by a Russian plane. The statement added that the heads of the General Staff agreed to intensify their joint efforts and exchange information about the situation on the ground.\n\nTurkey and Russia have a history of tensions over military incidents. In November 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, killing one pilot and injuring another, sparking disagreements over whether the plane had violated Turkish airspace. Tensions escalated in December when the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, was assassinated at an art gallery in Ankara, with the shooting captured in real-time photos and videos that quickly went viral worldwide. Despite these incidents, Turkey and Russia have also collaborated to broker ceasefires in the Syrian civil war.  ",

        "Text": "A groundbreaking discovery has overturned a long-held theory in the archaeological community that the Dead Sea Scrolls were only found in specific caves at the Qumran cliffs, which are managed by Israel in the West Bank. According to Dr. Oren Gutfeld, one of the project's lead archaeologists, \"Until now, it was widely accepted that the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave.\" The entrance to the cave was littered with pottery shards, broken scroll storage jars and their lids, as well as neolithic flint tools and arrowheads. As the team dug deeper, they encountered a cave-in, which was later found to be intentional, hiding a 16-20 foot tunnel. Inside the tunnel, they discovered three broken storage jars with lids, cloth coverings, and a leather strap that once held the scrolls. The team believes that looters ransacked the cave in the 1950s, leaving behind pickaxes as evidence. \"I imagine they entered the tunnel, found the scroll jars, took the scrolls, and even opened them, leaving everything behind, including the textiles and pottery,\" said Gutfeld. Over the past few years, researchers have suspected that Dead Sea Scroll fragments have made their way onto the antiquities black market. Gutfeld notes that the recent resurgence of interest in the Dead Sea Scrolls has prompted authorities and researchers to conduct a thorough survey of all the caves at Qumran in the Judean desert. According to Gutfeld, this is likely just the beginning of a series of significant discoveries, given the hundreds of caves still to be explored. \"It's a massive project, a complex operation,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Despite 60 years of excavations, we're still finding new caves containing materials that shed new light on the scrolls.\" The excavations are part of \"Operation Scroll,\" a collaborative effort between the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, and the Civil Administration of Judea and Samaria, as announced in a recent news release.

        "Text": "Doctors at Narayana Health City in Bangalore gathered to brief local reporters on the intricacies of a rare case on Thursday. The unnamed boy was born with polymelia, a congenital defect characterized by extra limbs or organs, often deformed. Dr. Sanjay Rao, a senior pediatric surgeon at Narayana Health City, who performed the procedure, emphasized that such cases are unpredictable and not limited to any specific socioeconomic group. The boy's parents granted Rao permission to share the case publicly. According to a paper in the Journal of Clinical Imaging Science, polymelia is a genetic disorder that can arise from chromosomal abnormalities or environmental factors. In the boy's case, a \"parasitic twin\" developed when an embryo grew into conjoined twins, but one twin ceased to develop, leaving extra limbs or organs attached to the other. This rare condition made the surgery, which took place last week, particularly challenging, said Rao. The procedure required a team of 20 medical professionals, who had to meticulously map the boy's anatomy before the operation to ensure a successful outcome. Rao explained that the complex anatomy meant a significant amount of pre-operative work was necessary to identify shared structures, blood vessels, and define a \"road map\" to guide the surgery and minimize blood loss. The exact number of cases of polymelia and their likelihood of occurrence remain unknown, but Dr. Rao described it as an uncommon condition. The hospital has dealt with four cases in the past decade, including one in 2008 involving a baby girl named Lakshmi Tatma, who was born in Bihar with four legs and four arms. Tatma's story received widespread attention, attracting thousands of devotees who believed she was a reincarnation of Laxmi, the four-armed Hindu goddess of wealth.\n\nThe latest case involves a boy born on January 21 in a government-run rural health center in Puladinni village, Karnataka. Although the birth was uneventful, doctors quickly realized the boy's extra limbs required specialized medical care. He was transferred to a local hospital before being taken to Narayana Health City, over 200 miles away, with his parents the day after his birth. The arduous journey took a severe toll on the infant, who was admitted to the hospital on January 24, just three days old, and required oxygen support due to dehydration.\n\nIn India, cases like these are often shrouded in superstition and stigma, especially when children are born with characteristics reminiscent of Hindu deities. However, the boy's parents, Lalitamma and Chennabasava, were quick to recognize that their son's condition required immediate medical attention. \"Times are changing, and young parents are becoming more aware of superstitions,\" said Dr. Rao.\n\nThe baby is expected to be discharged within the next week, and Narayana Health City has pledged to provide his follow-up care, including corrective surgery, free of charge. The boy's father, a farmer, is grateful for this support. \"Rao notes that there may be some minor cosmetic concerns in the future that could potentially require minor surgical procedures, but overall, the child is expected to have a normal and healthy childhood.\"",

        "Text": "Vladimir Kara-Murza, 35, has been hospitalized in grave condition for the second time in two years, and his wife, Evgenia, blames the Kremlin for his illness. Evgenia claims that the Russian government and President Putin are responsible for what happened to her husband two years ago and are now creating a climate that encourages similar behavior. However, CNN cannot independently confirm her claims, and Russia has denied any connection to Kara-Murza's illness. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN that it is \"pure nonsense\" to link Kara-Murza's illness to President Putin.\n\nDoctors at the hospital where Kara-Murza is being treated say they are still unsure what caused his illness, but agree that it was triggered by a \"toxic substance.\" Kara-Murza's lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, said he has no direct proof that his client was poisoned, but doctors have diagnosed him with \"acute intoxication by an unidentified substance.\" Evgenia said the risks are now more serious due to her husband's previous illness in 2015.\n\nKara-Murza is still too weak and ill to speak, but has been communicating by blinking his eyes. As of Thursday, he began breathing on his own. Evgenia is terrified every time her husband returns to Russia, and this latest incident has left her worried about his safety.\n\nKara-Murza, who lives part-time in Virginia with his wife and three children, was in Russia to promote a documentary about the assassination of his late friend, Boris Nemtsov. Nemtsov was shot to death on a bridge near the Kremlin in February 2015. Kara-Murza became ill four months later. Evgenia, Kara-Murza's wife, told CNN that she is \"absolutely terrified\" every time her husband travels back to Russia to work on opposition projects, but she emphasizes that he is a \"Russian patriot\" committed to his cause. As the deputy leader of the Freedom Party and a member of the Open Russia foundation, Kara-Murza is part of an organization of anti-Putin activists advocating for open elections, a free press, and civil rights reforms.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with CNN, Kara-Murza described the severe illness that nearly killed him. \"I fell into a coma, and my major organs began failing, one by one,\" he said. \"It started with my kidneys, then my lungs, my heart, and my liver.\" Kara-Murza believes that his suspected poisoning in 2015 was a politically motivated attack. \"There is no other possible reason,\" he said. \"I don't have any financial dealings, I don't have personal enemies, and I didn't steal anyone's wife.\"\n\nThe hospitalization of Kara-Murza has sparked outrage among US lawmakers. Senator Marco Rubio has called on the White House and State Department to question Russian authorities about the case. \"Vladimir Putin does not deserve the benefit of the doubt when it comes to political assassinations and poisonings, given the frequency of such incidents under his regime,\" Rubio said. \"I am praying for Kara-Murza's recovery.\" In a statement about Kara-Murza's condition, Senator John McCain delivered a subtle rebuke to recent comments by President Donald Trump that seemed to equate the US and Russia morally. \"Kara-Murza knew that Putin is a killer, and he is a killer,\" McCain said. \"He might very well be the next target.\" Senator John McCain emphasized that there is no moral equivalence between the United States and Putin's Russia, given his long-standing criticism of Trump's rhetoric on Russia. McCain's comments came after Trump's interview with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, in which Trump seemed to defend Putin by saying, \"There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?\" O'Reilly had described Putin as a \"killer.\" Putin's spokesman subsequently called on Fox News to apologize, but O'Reilly responded by jokingly telling the Kremlin to \"check in with me around 2023.\" This exchange occurred amidst speculation about a potential meeting between Trump and Putin, which is still uncertain. According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, while there is a common understanding that the fight against terrorism and the Islamic State should be a priority, the format of the meeting has yet to be determined, and other issues will be addressed once that is settled.",

        "Text": "A series of violent clashes have erupted in the northern Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois after four police officers allegedly forced a 22-year-old man, identified as Théo, to the ground, beat him, and used a baton to anally rape him. The officers have been suspended pending an investigation into the excessive force they used during an identity check last week. All four officers involved in the February 2 incident have been charged with aggravated assault, with one officer also facing rape charges, according to the Interior Ministry.\n\nThéo described the incident, saying he was walking with his headphones on when he was approached by the police. \"I realized how violent their tone was, so I stood against the wall,\" he said. \"Then, one of the policemen beat me. I saw one of them take his baton and stick it into my bum. As soon as he did that, I fell on my belly. I felt weak. It was as if my body had given up on me. Then, they handcuffed me.\" From his hospital bed, Théo appealed for calm, expressing his faith in the justice system. \"I call to calm my city because I love it very much,\" he said. \"Violence is not the way to support me. Justice will do its job.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread outrage and racial tensions in the working-class Paris suburb where Théo was allegedly assaulted. Another night of violence gripped Seine-Saint-Denis, a region northeast of Paris with a large migrant population, on Wednesday, with 26 people arrested, according to a spokesperson for the local prefecture. A crowd of several hundred people gathered near Paris' Ménilmontant metro station to protest police violence. According to authorities, 17 people were arrested in Aulnay-sous-Bois on Tuesday night after protesters set fire to garbage bins and vehicles. Social media videos showed clashes between riot police and youths as fires raged through the streets. Police fired warning shots into the air to disperse the crowd, according to French reports. On Monday, hundreds of peaceful protesters marched in the same northern suburb, carrying banners that read \"Justice for Theo\" past a building with graffiti that read \"police, rapists\". Online, people shared images of the young man, accompanied by the hashtag #JusticePourTheo, and a photograph of him with bruises under his eyes and a bandage on his cheek circulated widely. The mayor of Aulnay-sous-Bois, Bruno Beschizza, released a statement on Facebook, saying he was not concerned about a repeat of the 2005 riots, which were sparked by the deaths of two teenagers while being chased by police in the nearby neighborhood of Clichy-sous-Bois. \"We are angry,\" the Mayor's office said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Sometimes our anger is expressed peacefully, and sometimes not.\" Beschizza, who had called for a strong government response, said President François Hollande's visit to Aulnay-sous-Bois on Tuesday showed that the state supported the community. Hollande visited Theo at the suburban hospital where he has been treated since the incident, and a photo shared on Twitter showed the President standing at Theo's bedside. In his tweet, Hollande said Theo \"reacted with dignity\" and urged him to trust in the justice system. Socialist presidential candidate Benoît Hamon has demanded a diligent and transparent investigation into the incident. A tweet from him stated that police \"represent the Republic that protects\" and emphasized the urgent need to \"restore trust.\" Those who know him, including friends who have described him as a fun-loving person who never speaks out of hate, say he is a sociable individual who loves to laugh with everyone. \"He's a person who loves to have fun with everyone,\" said Hicham, a friend who has played soccer with him. Théo, a soccer enthusiast who plays at the Institute of Private Football in Aulnay-sous-Bois, is a passionate fan of the sport. His athletic background is evident, as his sister Aurélie is a professional handball player for Le Havre AC, a French women's club. In an interview with BFM on Tuesday, Aurélie reported that her brother remains in critical condition, and it is still unclear what the consequences of the attack may be, although doctors are discussing the possibility of incontinence.",

In a video interview with former R&A chief executive Peter Dawson for Dubai's Vision Magazine at the Burj Al Arab hotel, Woods acknowledged that he may never feel great again due to his extensive medical history. \"I feel good, but not great,\" he said. \"I'll always be a little sore, but as long as I can function, I'm okay with that.\" Woods revealed that he experienced \"dark times\" during his lengthy recovery, doubting whether he would ever play golf again. \"It was a tough road,\" he said in an interview with CNN's Living Golf show. \"There were times when I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't move, the pain was too great. Anyone who's had nerve pain in their back knows what that's like. I didn't know if I'd ever play golf again, and I didn't know this time last year.\" Woods made his comeback in a limited field event in the Bahamas in December, showing promise by leading the field in birdies, although costly errors led to a 15th-place finish. He missed the cut in his next event, the PGA Tour's Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in California last month, and struggled to a five-over 77 on the first day in Dubai before withdrawing. Tiger Woods appeared to be moving cautiously around the Emirates Golf Club course, but denied feeling any pain afterwards, stating, \"I wasn't in pain at all. I was simply trying to hit good shots, and unfortunately, I wasn't doing a very good job.\" It's been over eight years since Woods' last tournament win, and nearly 14 years since his last major victory in 2008. Woods is set to compete in the Genesis Open at Riviera Country Club in California from February 16-19, followed by the Honda Classic at PGA National in Florida the following week. Beyond that, his schedule remains unclear, with the year's first major, the Masters at Augusta, set to take place in Georgia from April 6. ",

        "Text": "When announcing that Roger Federer would be his guest at an exhibition event in Glasgow, Andy Murray warned his rival against trying the deep-fried Mars bars, a sweet treat invented in Scotland. \"I tried one last year and it was absolutely horrific,\" Murray said with a smile. \"Trust me, stay away from them.\" The unusual snack, which originated in Scotland in the early 1990s, gained international recognition after being mentioned on the Jay Leno Show in 2004.\n\nAt the launch of \"Andy Murray Live 2017\" in east London, the Olympic champion expressed his excitement about Federer's upcoming appearance at the SSE Hydro on November 7. \"It's incredible that he's agreed to do it,\" Murray said. \"We're all very lucky to have him on board.\" Federer, 35, has been a popular figure in tennis for years, and Murray praised his willingness to play in places he hasn't been before. \"He wants to give his fans the opportunity to see him play,\" Murray explained.\n\nThis year's event will feature a singles match between Murray and Federer, as well as a doubles match between Murray and his brother, Jamie, and former British number one Tim Henman and showman Mansour Bahrami. All proceeds will go to charity. After offering Federer advice on avoiding the deep-fried Mars bars, Murray said he would also learn from Federer's recent Australian Open triumph and consider taking longer breaks from the sport. Despite being out of competitive action for six months due to injury, Roger Federer made a stunning comeback to win his 18th Grand Slam title in Melbourne last month, defeating Rafael Nadal, who was also recovering from injury, in the final. In contrast, Andy Murray, who had a busy but successful end to 2016, was eliminated in the fourth round by world No. 50 Mischa Zverev, the lowest-ranked player he had lost to at a major tournament since 2006.\n\n\"It's incredible what Roger did in Australia after such a long break,\" said Murray, who ended 2016 as the world's top-ranked player after winning five titles between October and December. \"In tennis, we often play a lot of matches in a short period, so coming into an event fresh can be a significant advantage. Roger and Rafa were both returning to action after a long break, and they both played exceptionally well, so maybe we can all learn from their approach.\"\n\nMurray emphasized that he didn't consider his early exit from the Australian Open, where he was considered the favorite after Novak Djokovic's second-round loss, as a missed opportunity. \"The end of last season was tough for me,\" he told CNN. \"I played a lot of tennis in a short space of time, and I needed to reflect on that. I've never been in a situation where I've competed in the latter stages of nearly every tournament for four months, so I had to adjust my approach.\"\n\nMurray also noted that even if he had advanced to the quarterfinals, he would have faced a tough draw, with Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, and Rafael Nadal all potential opponents. \"A lot of people think Roger is the greatest player of all time, and Rafa is certainly one of the best. Stan Wawrinka was also in my section of the draw, so it was always going to be a challenging path ahead.\" ",

In a recent interview with CNN, Gates discussed his commitment to combating disease and famine. According to Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is dedicated to addressing diseases prevalent in poor countries, such as malaria, HIV, diarrhea, and pneumonia. The foundation is investing heavily in combating mosquito-borne diseases in Latin America, and Gates proudly noted that significant progress has been made in reducing the number of children under five affected by diarrhea from 13 million to 6 million over the past 25 years.\n\nWhen asked about the biggest challenges facing the globe, Gates emphasized that while it may not be possible to completely eradicate disease, science has provided the tools to make significant progress in combating the leading causes of death. He believes that disease could be cut in half, ultimately reducing the risk of death for children in poor countries to a level comparable to that of children in other parts of the world.\n\nAs for inspiring scientific innovation in the next generation, Gates suggests that understanding the world's problems is a powerful motivator. He then rushed off to his next appointment, spreading his message and resources to further his mission.\n\nRegarding famine, Gates offered a straightforward solution: increasing food productivity. He noted that Africa, in particular, lags behind Europe and the United States in terms of food productivity, with the continent producing only one-fifth as much food per capita as these regions. \"To improve agricultural productivity, Gates suggested introducing better seed varieties, accessing fertilizer, and utilizing cell phones to enhance market information availability. He noted that African countries could learn from the experiences of certain Asian nations that have successfully overcome famine and significantly boosted crop production. Despite ongoing challenges, Gates maintains an optimistic outlook, stating that the current trend is positive. He cited the decline in violence, increased understanding of science, and improved treatment of women as evidence of progress. While there is still much work to be done, Gates believes that the world has made significant strides in the past 30 years, and the situation is far better than it was three decades ago.\" ",

        "Text": "Thanks to advancements in technology and innovative architecture, modern wine cellars can now replicate the natural environment almost anywhere. Whether situated atop a hill or built into a bunker, beautiful wine storage solutions can be found in unexpected locations. According to James Molesworth, senior editor of Wine Spectator, \"today, it's just as easy to install a wine cellar in a 33rd-floor apartment as it is in an underground cellar.\" Molesworth highlights Château Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux as a prime example of an above-ground wine cellar. \"For me, the key is combining visual appeal with practicality and efficiency,\" Molesworth notes.\n\nAbove ground, Château Cheval Blanc's undulating white facade, designed by Christian de Portzamparc, blends seamlessly into the French countryside, complete with its own lush rooftop. Spanning 19,685 square feet, the avant-garde cellar bathes artfully arranged rows of concrete white vats in natural light. \"All the vats are made of cement and have a pear-shaped design, corresponding to the parcel sizes on the vineyard,\" Molesworth explains. Each vat is carefully labeled with the plot number, capacity, grape variety, and date planted, allowing Cheval Blanc to meticulously manage the vineyard's fine details. \"By dedicating individual vats to each plot, the winemaking team can harvest each parcel at their discretion and manage smaller and smaller vinifications before blending,\" Molesworth says. \"In essence, they're handling the vineyards at its smallest scale, then assembling the final blend from that.\"\n\nAnother unconventional cellar is Hong Kong's Crown Wine Cellars in Shouson Hill, discreetly located on the south side of Hong Kong Island. Deep beneath the earth, 60 feet underground, lies a network of former military bunkers that now house a series of 1,000-square-foot wine cellars. The cellars are accessible through a concrete tunnel that opens into chambers protected by 3-foot-thick reinforced concrete walls. While the exterior may appear rugged, the interior features state-of-the-art climate-control technology to preserve the rare vintages stored within. According to Molesworth, an ideal cellaring environment requires a quiet, stable environment with minimal vibration, ideal conditions that include approximately 70% humidity, stable temperatures between 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit, and little to no light. As Adam Bilbey, a wine specialist with Sotheby's, notes, wine should be stored in a dark space to prevent ultraviolet light from destroying it, and it should be kept lying still at a perfectly horizontal angle. Among the most impressive wine cellars is that of US billionaire William Koch in Palm Beach, Florida, which pays homage to traditional European cellars. This underground labyrinth, featuring Austrian red bricks and custom-built arched doorways, houses a selection of wines from his 20,000-bottle collection, one of the largest in the US. According to Bilbey, the attention to detail required to create this masterpiece was fitting, given the legendary collection of wine it houses.

        "Text": "Researchers have found that women with brain characteristics typically associated with males are three times more likely to have autism than women with more \"feminine\" brain patterns. However, the opposite is not true, and there is no evidence to suggest that men with more \"feminine\" brain patterns are less likely to develop autism. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects children early in life, causing them to miss typical milestones of maturity. Common symptoms of autism include difficulties with communication and repetitive behaviors. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in 68 children in the United States has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The term \"spectrum\" refers to the wide range of symptoms, abilities, and challenges that individuals with autism can experience. For example, some people with autism may struggle with eye contact or following simple directions, while others may excel in math. As they grow older, some children with autism may learn to function independently, while others may require significant support to perform everyday tasks. Interestingly, autism spectrum disorder is two to five times more common in males than females, according to Christine Ecker, lead author of the study and a professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Some researchers believe that sex differences in symptoms contribute to the higher diagnosis rate among males, while others propose that sex-related variations in brain anatomy may also play a role. The new study aimed to investigate whether differences in brain anatomy could contribute to the higher risk of autism among males. Specifically, the researchers examined cortical thickness, which refers to the depth of gray matter across the surface of the brain's cortex. In an email, Dr. Ecker explained that previous research has shown that females tend to have a thicker cortex than males in various brain regions. Additionally, previous studies have found that cortical thickness is significantly altered in individuals with autism. The study included 98 high-functioning adults with autism (49 men) and 98 adults without autism (51 men) who were all roughly in their mid-20s. The researchers excluded participants with a history of psychiatric disorders, head injuries, genetic disorders, or medical conditions that affect brain function, as well as those taking mood stabilizers or other medications. Each participant underwent an MRI brain scan, and the researchers used a software program to derive cortical thickness patterns for each. After anonymizing the data, Dr. Ecker and her team made predictions about the participants' sex based on cortical thickness and physical characteristics, which they referred to as the \"brain phenotype.\" \"We found that brain phenotype ranged from being typically female to typically male, with varying degrees of male and female characteristics in between,\" Dr. Ecker said. She emphasized that, regardless of biological sex, brains fall along a continuum, with extreme male and female characteristics at either end, and that the middle range is healthy and normal. The study found that 68.1% of biological female brains fell closer to the female extreme, while 74.5% of biological male brains fell closer to the male extreme. While cortical thickness did not always accurately identify female or male brains, the researchers discovered a cluster of sex-related brain structure differences that allowed them to accurately separate males from females in most cases. Researchers have developed a method that can accurately predict biological sex based on brain anatomy, with an accuracy rate of approximately 74%. The team, led by Dr. Ecker, found that individuals with brain characteristics typical of males were more likely to have autism, regardless of their biological sex. Specifically, female participants with brain anatomy typical of males were three times more likely to have autism than those with typical female brain anatomy. According to Dr. Ecker, this approach could potentially be used to estimate autism risk by analyzing how \"male\" or \"female\" an individual's brain is. The researchers have only studied adult brains so far, but they hope to apply their method to younger age groups in future studies. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for children with autism, and early training has been shown to be effective in normalizing their behavior.\n\nDr. Tuong-Vi Nguyen, an assistant professor at McGill University, has reviewed the study and described it as \"provocative\" with \"good methodology.\" However, she suggests that the findings should be rephrased to accurately reflect the results. According to Dr. Nguyen, the study suggests that high-functioning female individuals with autism are more likely to have brain characteristics typical of males, but it does not confirm that a male-typic brain is a predisposition to autism. She notes that the study did not find a significant decrease in autism risk among males with female-typic brain anatomy. While the study is interesting, Dr. Nguyen emphasizes that it is too early to use neuroimaging tools to predict autism, and the results do not change current clinical management practices.",

Alongside this, sculptures, clothing, and ornaments from the same era are displayed alongside artwork to provide context. One of the exhibition's highlights is the loan of the gold treasures from Mapungubwe, which feature small gold figurines found in the royal graves of the former capital of the first kingdom of South Africa. These treasures take the form of animals and status symbols, such as crowns. Notably, one of these treasures, the golden rhino, is now featured on South Africa's highest honor, the Order of Mapungubwe, which has been awarded to notable individuals like Nelson Mandela, Zwelakhe Sisulu, and Doris Lessing.\n\nThe exhibition \"South Africa: the art of a nation\" offers a unique opportunity to explore the extensive and diverse history of South African art, said Hartwig Fischer, Director of the British Museum. \"It's a chance to challenge audience preconceptions, just as our visitors have come to expect from a British Museum exhibition.\" The exhibition is on display until February 26 at The British Museum.

        "Text": "The city of PyeongChang is set to welcome nearly 3,000 athletes from around 100 nations to the first Winter Olympics held in South Korea, from February 9 to 25, 2018. This event marks the beginning of a series of high-profile sporting events in Asia over the next four years, with Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing hosting the Winter Olympics in 2022. To avoid confusion with North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, the PyeongChang resort, located 50 miles south of the demilitarized zone, has changed its name for the Games, capitalizing the \"C\" for the first time. A record 102 gold medals will be up for grabs across 15 disciplines at PyeongChang 2018, with four events making their Winter Olympic debuts, including Big Air snowboarding, which will give the Games a youthful vibe. A $78 million, 50,000-capacity temporary Olympic Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies, is set to be completed in September and is one of six new venues being built. In total, 13 venues, split between PyeongChang and neighboring city Gangneung, will be used during the 17-day Games.\n\nAs the 12-month countdown begins, however, South Koreans have been distracted by other events. The country's Constitutional Court is deliberating a motion to impeach President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal, which sparked weeks of protests in Seoul. This is a far cry from the enthusiastic reception that greeted the 2011 announcement that PyeongChang, located 180km east of Seoul, would host the Winter Olympics. The organizing committee of the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, is facing a sponsorship shortfall due to companies' reluctance to sign up for deals. The total cost of the Games is estimated to be around $10 billion, a significant decrease from the $50 billion spent on the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Lee Hee-beom, president of PyeongChang 2018, acknowledged that the political scandal and economic situation have affected the Games' preparations. He expressed hope that the Olympics can help overcome the negative image created by unsubstantiated rumors surrounding the scandal. Lee emphasized that the Games are crucial for restoring national pride and encouraged critics to focus on the positive aspects of the event. He also expects the upcoming one-year countdown event to boost global awareness of the Olympics.\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics are taking place in a province that was heavily affected by the 1950-53 Korean War. Despite South Korea's initial rejection of North Korea's proposal to co-host the Games, Lee urged North Korea to participate by sending athletes to the event. He emphasized the importance of the Olympic principle of promoting peace, stating that anyone who loves peace should have the right to participate, without exception. \"North Korea is, in fact, the norm.\"\n\nOr, alternatively:\n\n\"North Korea is a typical example of the kind of regime that...\"\n\nOr, if you want to convey a sense of criticism or warning:\n\n\"North Korea is a stark reminder that rogue states can thrive in today's world.\"\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to suggest more rewrites!",

        "Text": "\"Do you have a romantic partner? How do you plan to achieve your career goals? When do you envision getting married and starting a family? Why not consider returning to your hometown and working with your uncle's company? And, more importantly, why do you feel the need to be concerned about your weight? The pressure to conform to societal expectations and start a family can be overwhelming, leading many young Chinese individuals to seek creative solutions. For instance, some young people have been known to hire actors to pretend to be their romantic partner during the Spring Festival holiday period, which ends on Saturday. According to Yue Qian, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia, \"Young people are delaying marriage, but their parents still expect them to follow the traditional timeline of getting married and having children.\"\n\nThe pressures to conform to societal norms have led to the widespread popularity of a viral video, \"A Spring Festival Survival Guide,\" which has garnered over a million views across various platforms in the past month. The video, which includes a song with a defiant chorus, is a humorous take on the traditional Spring Festival stresses and a celebration of individualism. Interestingly, the video was created by a traditional chamber choir, the Rainbow Chamber Singers (RCS), which was founded in 2010 by conductor Jin Chengzhi and a group of his fellow students at the prestigious Shanghai Conservatory of Music. The choir performs traditional-style choral pieces every six months, showcasing their talent and creativity.\" Since 2016, Jin has been experimenting with his own compositions, blending serious music with humorous lyrics and social commentary. One of the choir's earliest hits was \"Where On Earth Did You Leave the Key, Zhang Shichao?\", a kazoo-infused critique of ungrateful roommates. The group followed up with \"So Far, the Sofa is So Far\", an anthem for China's \"overtime dogs\" - millions of underpaid millennials working long hours for demanding bosses. The choir's music tackles the stresses common to young people, notes Eric Fish, author of \"China's Millennials\", and the growing resistance against them. \"Young people are increasingly pushing back against the pressure to get married quickly and pursue the most stable and lucrative job,\" Fish said. Jin, who describes himself as a \"rational optimist\", draws inspiration from his own experiences and anxieties, but hopes his songs can bring people understanding and hope for life. \"Although 'So Far, the Sofa is So Far' describes the miserable overtime life of young workers, the core of the song is about choosing one's own lifestyle,\" he said. \"These conflicts are worth discussing because they're happening in our daily lives. Whether it's working overtime or the generation gap, I believe we're responsible for society and can amplify young people's voices.\" In contrast to traditional Chinese choral music, which is often conservative and limited to groups singing \"red songs\" (music from the founding of the People's Republic or the Cultural Revolution), the Rainbow Chamber Singers aim to revitalize the genre. \"Good music should be diverse,\" Jin emphasized. \"'If you stick to something without a genuine passion, the art will lose its authenticity.' Their approach has resonated with audiences of all ages. After a performance, I was touched to find four elderly women from Anhui, aged 70, waiting backstage for my autograph,\" Jin shared. \"Speaking out is crucial As China's millennials become more confident and influential, they are creating and consuming pop culture that reflects their concerns and fosters a sense of unity around specific issues. In recent years, there have been numerous media articles, personal stories, and memes about the pressure to conform to traditional family expectations,\" Fish noted. \"I believe these reflect a growing discontent among young people with outdated attitudes towards life.\" In this sense, he added, the choir's song serves as \"a call to action to stand up and resist.\" \"Behind the increasing visibility of the pressures they face is also the younger generation's growing desire for self-expression,\" Yue said. \"It's not necessarily a rebellion. I think the younger generation wants to connect with the older generation and hope they can understand their perspectives and life choices.\" And for Jin, at least, one family has taken the message to heart: \"My relatives all listened to 'What I Do Is For Your Own Good.' So I had a very comfortable Spring Festival.\"\"\n\nNote: I made some minor changes to the wording and sentence structure to improve clarity and flow, while trying to preserve the original meaning and tone of the text.",

        "Text": "For law enforcement agencies investigating sex trafficking cases, online ads can hold crucial clues. However, the sheer volume of ads makes it impractical for them to manually scan each one for potential leads. That's where TraffickCam comes in - a simple phone app that leverages crowdsourced photos of hotel rooms to aid in locating victims and prosecuting traffickers. By turning on their phone's GPS and uploading photos of the room from four angles, travelers can contribute to TraffickCam's database, which law enforcement can then use to match suspected trafficking victims with their locations. TraffickCam's advanced image analysis tools convert the photos into valuable data points, including patterns on carpets, wall art, and landmarks outside the window. These data points play a critical role in identifying the location of the room. Developed by Exchange Initiative and Washington University researchers, TraffickCam was made possible by a $100,000 matching grant from the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph and private donations through the St. Louis Community Foundation. \"This is a straightforward way for citizens to take a stand against sex trafficking by simply taking photos,\" says Kimberly Ritter, director of development for Exchange Initiative. Since its launch in June 2016, TraffickCam has added over 150,000 hotels to its database, with over 100,000 users actively contributing. Ritter hopes that even more people will join the fight against sex trafficking by using the app. While tracking down traffickers, Ritter notes that even if a database identifies the location of a hotel room, it's a matter of luck whether the victim is still present. This is because traffickers often post photos from one location to advertise their services in another, she explains. Another common tactic is for traffickers to operate from a central location and post ads in multiple cities, then transport the victims to different cities based on the responses they receive. \"In most cases, local girls working with local pimps will use local photos,\" says Sergeant Adam Kavanaugh, supervisor of the St. Louis County Multi-Jurisdictional Human Trafficking Task Force. He believes TraffickCam could aid investigators in identifying hotels and preparing effective sting operations in these situations. However, when it comes to tracking down \"travelers\" - trafficking victims who are moved across the country - the app may be more useful in tracing their movements across state lines. \"We can then make a federal case based on interstate commerce,\" says Kavanaugh, which could result in a longer sentence for a convicted trafficker. Before rolling out TraffickCam to law enforcement agencies nationwide, it is being tested by Kavanaugh and the St. Louis County Police Department. \"We're currently beta-testing the St. Louis area, and we're getting positive hits,\" he says, referring to ads that match hotel room photos in the database. After initial testing in this small area, Kavanaugh is optimistic about TraffickCam's potential to identify both hotel rooms and the routes traffickers use. \"Technology plays a crucial role in modern law enforcement, and this app is just one more tool that can help make our job safer and more efficient,\" says Ritter. He hopes to make the app available to all law enforcement agencies in the US by Spring 2017 and eventually globally. \"As this is cutting-edge technology, we need to refine it in the US first, and then we can explore making it accessible worldwide,\" Ritter explains. While global users can already download the app and upload photos to the database, Ritter notes that all uploaded photos from around the world will be stored for future use.\n\nThe app focuses on hotels because the US National Human Trafficking Hotline found that they are a common venue for sex trafficking, with nearly 10% of reported cases in 2016 taking place in a hotel or motel. Although the hotline believes the actual figure is higher, only around 10% of cases were linked to commercial-front brothels, while nearly 8% of cases involved unknown venues. Less than 5% of cases were street-based. While the app can only narrow down exact locations with a sufficient number of photos in the database, Ritter is confident that people will continue to contribute. \"It's astonishing to see how many people are committed to fighting human trafficking,\" she says. \"The more we work together to combat this crime, the better our chances of eradicating it.\"",

        "Text": "NASA's quest to reach the moon got off to a dismal start 21 years ago, when the space shuttle Challenger disintegrated just 73 seconds into its flight, claiming the lives of all seven crew members on board. Last week, NASA paid tribute to the seven crew members who tragically lost their lives 14 years ago when the space shuttle Columbia broke apart during re-entry. Even on successful space missions, astronauts face numerous challenges. Those stationed at the International Space Station, for instance, are exposed to radiation levels 10 times higher than on Earth, increasing their risk of cancer. A staggering 79% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. In space, the heart deteriorates, the immune system weakens, and bones lose minerals and density at a rate of 1% per month. Fluids also redistribute themselves around the body, and for older astronauts, near vision can decline. It's no wonder that astronauts are considered heroes. Now retired, Captain Scott Kelly and Shuttle Commander Mark Kelly are part of a select group of individuals who have ventured into space, putting everything on the line for the greater good, not for personal gain. For this reason, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has chosen the identical twins for the CNN series \"My Hero.\" \"Looking back, it's easy to say that what they did was incredible,\" Gupta said. \"But the reality is that they had to take significant risks. They had to say goodbye to their loved ones without knowing if they'd ever see them again. That's a difficult thing to do in pursuit of advancing human knowledge.\" Mark Kelly was chosen as an astronaut in 1996 and went on to fly four missions from 2001 to 2011 on the space shuttles Endeavour and Discovery. He made four trips to the International Space Station (ISS) and spent over 50 days in space. Kelly's final mission, which was also the last flight of the space shuttle Endeavour, took place in January 2011, around the same time his wife, then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was recovering from an assassination attempt.\n\nScott Kelly was also selected for the space program in 1996 and flew four missions from 1999 to 2016. His missions included flights on NASA shuttles and Russian Soyuz spacecraft, and he spent a total of 520 days in space, the second-highest number of any astronaut. Scott's final mission was a unique one, as it allowed him to spend a year in space, a feat that his twin brother Mark did not achieve.\n\nIn 2012, Scott was chosen to participate in the One-Year Mission, a year-long stay on the ISS with cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko. The purpose of the mission was to study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body, and to do so, Scott underwent extensive testing on the ISS. However, to strengthen the results, a control subject was needed, which is where Mark came in.\n\nThe Twins Study, part of NASA's Human Research Program, brought together Mark and Scott with ten researchers to analyze samples taken from the twins before, during, and after Scott's mission. The initial findings, released in January 2016, have begun to shed light on the ways in which the human body changes when in space. At a biological level, the team found that Scott's body underwent changes, including a decline in bone formation during the second half of his mission, altered gene expression, and increased levels of a metabolite in his gut. The human body's response to the flu vaccine remained consistent in space, but the search for a hypothetical \"space gene\" that could have altered astronaut Scott Kelly's genome sequence continues. As part of the Twins Study, researchers conducted tests to measure the body's response, posture, and dexterity. The goal of the study is to understand how the human body will adapt to a six-month journey to Mars and how astronauts will fare when they arrive on the planet. The results of the Functional Task Test showed no significant differences between astronauts who spent six months and a year in space, but reaction time and accuracy did decrease in microgravity. According to John Charles, chief scientist at the Human Research Program, the study's findings have not identified any major obstacles to longer human spaceflight missions. The race to Mars is on, with NASA planning a mission to the planet in the near future. Scott Kelly, a retired astronaut, believes that the cost of the mission is the biggest impediment to its success, but if the cost can be overcome, the technology will follow. He has even volunteered to participate in the three-year mission. With a wealth of data on Scott's body in space, his insights are hard to ignore. The Twins Study not only aims to explore the effects of space travel on the human body but also lays the groundwork for a potential human settlement on Mars. NASA believes in redundant systems, and if it becomes feasible to make Mars similar to Earth, there would be significant value in doing so. However, as climate change affects our planet, it's essential to consider other places in the universe where humans may need to live one day. To achieve this, we must first understand the effects of space travel on the human body. The Twins Study is crucial in this regard, and when the full report is released this year, it will bring us one step closer to the Martian surface and potentially a new home for humanity.",

        "Text": "Every woman has likely experienced some form of sexism in the workplace, such as being ignored in meetings, excluded from important discussions, interrupted, belittled, or even asked to perform menial tasks. Recently, a panel of female CFOs shared their own stories of daily sexism with a crowd of thousands of women. One executive, the CFO of a $400 million company, recalled a humiliating experience where she was asked to take notes during a meeting with her male colleagues. This kind of behavior is not a relic of the past, but rather a symptom of a culture that continues to marginalize women. The recent behavior of politicians like Senator Lindsey Graham and former Governor Mike Huckabee, who dismissed Senator Elizabeth Warren's opinions as \"long overdue\" and \"scold-like,\" is a stark reminder that sexism is still prevalent. Moreover, research has shown that girls as young as five years old are more likely to assume that a \"really, really smart person\" is male, but by age six, they have already begun to doubt their own abilities. This shift in perception is alarming, and it highlights the need to teach confidence and self-acceptance to girls and women from a young age. By doing so, we can help break the cycle of self-doubt and hesitation that often holds women back from achieving their full potential. Confidence is a vital skill that can greatly impact one's life. I used to misunderstand confidence, viewing it as a personality trait or an emotion. However, it's actually a skill that can be developed through intentional actions. Confidence is the ability to listen to and trust your own ideas, and to take bold action despite uncertainty. It's about persisting in the face of challenges, knowing that you'll survive regardless of the outcome. As you take action, your competency grows, making it easier to step forward again in the future. Research shows that the most confident individuals are often the most respected, listened to, and admired. For women, developing confidence is particularly crucial, as a lack of confidence is often cited as a reason not to promote a woman, yet it's rarely explicitly stated. Elizabeth Warren is an exemplary model of confidence, fearlessly and unwaveringly pursuing her goals as a senator. Her courage is inspiring, as seen in her quote, \"Speak your mind -- even if your voice shakes.\" Warren's confidence is evident in her willingness to challenge Donald Trump at every turn. It's no surprise that her interruption, beration, and silencing by McConnell on the Senate floor resonated so strongly. While she may have technically broken an arcane rule, it's striking that her male colleagues were able to read from Coretta Scott King's letter uninterrupted. Senator Tom Udall, for example, read the letter in its entirety without incident. Mitch McConnell's comment about Senator Elizabeth Warren's persistence has sparked a powerful movement, with the hashtag #ShePersisted trending on social media. But Warren's determination is a reminder that we all need to persist in the face of adversity. Despite what others may say or think, we must continue to push forward and speak up for ourselves. Here's how to do it: even when your voice shakes, speak out. No one can take away your confidence except for yourself. You don't have to feel ready or qualified, but you can still take action. Just look at Rosa Parks, who famously refused to give up her seat on a bus despite feeling shy and uncertain. In a radio interview after her historic act of civil disobedience, she said she didn't think she was capable of such a bold move. But she did it anyway. When we take action, our minds follow. That's what confidence is all about: believing in yourself and making a decision to bet on your own abilities.\n\nWarren's bravery on the Senate floor is a perfect example of this. Despite being silenced by McConnell, she refused to be silenced and instead read the letter from Coretta Scott King outside the Senate chamber. The video of her defiance has been viewed millions of times, and her confidence has inspired countless women to speak up and take action. The message is clear: if it matters to you, persist. Confidence isn't about what others say or do, but about what you say and do. We women and our daughters need to say and do more, and we need to do it more often. It's time to take control of our own confidence and use our voices to make a difference.",

        "Text": "In this young presidency, a new trend is emerging: shifting blame away from the White House. If the administration loses its immigration case in court, the judges are to blame. And if an attack occurs, the judges are to blame for that too. Trump has tweeted that if something happens, people should blame the Washington state judge and the court system. Similarly, if there was confusion at airports worldwide, Trump is deflecting responsibility by blaming a Delta computer outage, protesters, and the tears of Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer. When asked about the decision to sign the executive order, Trump claimed that he wanted to take more time to implement it, but \"the law enforcement people\" told him otherwise. He said that he was hesitant to sign the order, but was convinced by the prospect of \"a whole pile of people... with very evil intentions\" entering the country before the restrictions took effect. In essence, Trump is saying that he's just a messenger, not responsible for the decision. It's worth noting that when was the last time a president went out of his way to stoke fear about a possible terror attack? Trump did just that on Wednesday, claiming that he knows more about the threat of terrorism than the public does, and that it's a greater threat than people understand. He said, \"Believe me, I've learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\" While spreading fear may be a deliberate tactic to garner support for a ban, it's a campaign strategy that doesn't sit well in the Oval Office. It's clear that there's more to learn about the complexities of government and public service. As President, Trump's connection to government is relatively short, unlike his predecessors who have spent years serving in public office. During his campaign, he frequently boasted about buying the favor of public servants, a stark contrast to the norms of public service. Moreover, he has never held a CEO position in a publicly traded corporation. Instead, he's been the chairman of a private family business, surrounding himself with individuals indebted to him and family members. This starkly contrasts with the realities of the presidency, where he must navigate co-equal branches of government and foreign leaders who are responsive to public opinion in their own countries. The exception, of course, is his friend Vladimir Putin. In the business world, Trump is accustomed to being the supreme authority, but in the political sphere, he struggles to accept the notion of separation of powers. When 9th Circuit judges questioned lawyers, he deemed them \"disgraceful.\" However, the idea that the branches of government don't simply obey the President's every command is anathema to him, rooted in his lifelong experience of being the ultimate authority. It's not a failure of democracy; it's the very essence of it. As Judge Gorsuch would attest, the system is designed to work this way. ",

        "Text": "The US ambassador to the United Nations has called for a strong condemnation of Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine, describing the situation as dire and demanding that Russia respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, who have endured nearly three years of Russian occupation and military intervention. The ambassador emphasized that the US will maintain its Crimea-related sanctions until Russia returns the Crimean Peninsula to Ukraine. This statement comes as violence in eastern Ukraine has surged, with dozens killed and over 11,000 explosions reported along the front line in a single day, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration's stance on Russia sanctions is unclear, as Vice President Mike Pence has suggested that the US may lift sanctions in exchange for joint action against ISIS and international terrorism. This mixed signal has left Ukrainian diplomats seeking clarification from the White House, as they believe sanctions are a crucial tool in their diplomatic efforts. In Kiev, there is concern that if the US withdraws its support for sanctions, it could trigger a chain reaction, with European Union states such as Italy and Greece following suit. The Trump administration has hinted that it will lift sanctions on Russia, but in a gradual process. As violence surged in eastern Ukraine, the White House announced that it would relax sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia's Federal Security Service. Could the next move be the reversal of the expulsion of Russian diplomats ordered by Obama in his final days in office? One thing is clear: tensions along the front line in eastern Ukraine have never been higher, and the risk of a full-scale escalation is real. Both sides have moved heavy weaponry out of storage and positioned it close to each other. Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, banned by the Minsk agreement, are back in use. The human toll is devastating: dozens of deaths in recent days have brought the total death toll since the conflict began in 2014 to nearly 10,000. The flashpoint industrial city of Avdiivka, home to 20,000 people, has seen most of the action. The city's coke and chemical plant, which provides heating to the surrounding community and raw materials for Ukraine's vital steel industry, is at risk of triggering a humanitarian and ecological disaster if shelling continues, according to Alexander Hug, Deputy Chief Monitor of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Moreover, fighting has resumed in previously quiet areas, including those near the strategic port city of Mariupol. Although Ukraine is better prepared for battle than it was at the start of the conflict, there are concerns that the rebel side is positioning itself to capture more territory. The aftermath of Debaltseve's crushing defeat makes it unlikely that Kiev will ignore the escalating aggression from the rebel side. If sanctions are lifted, they may have no choice but to escalate the situation, which could lead to anxious and unpredictable actions from Kiev. During my recent visit to Ukraine, I sensed a growing sense of abandonment among its people, who can no longer rely on traditional international security guarantees. As Ukrainian parliamentarian Nataliya Katser-Buchkovska emphasized, Ukraine needs reassurance from the \"guarantors of the Western order\" that it will not be left to face outside aggressors alone. While the Minsk agreements have had little effect in bringing peace to eastern Ukraine's battle-weary population, they remain the only framework signed by all parties, setting standards for behavior in a conflict that has displaced over 3 million people and could force many thousands more to flee. The White House's contradictory messages about Russia could be the spark that pushes this conflict beyond the point of no return.",

        "Text": "Despite suggestions that it should take a more active role, the country showed little interest in intervening in North Korea's military affairs, citing the strained relationships between Pyongyang and Washington and Seoul as the main reason. North Korean state media hailed Sunday's missile test as a success, claiming that a previously undisclosed part of its arsenal, the Pukguksong-2 intermediate-range missile, was launched under the supervision of leader Kim Jong Un. The test is in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, which prohibit North Korea from conducting ballistic missile launches aimed at curbing its development of nuclear weapons. China's Foreign Ministry condemned the launch, stating that it is opposed to any activities that violate the resolutions. \"Under current circumstances, it is crucial that all parties refrain from provoking each other or taking actions that escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\" said ministry spokesman Geng Shuang at a press briefing. \"As I have repeatedly emphasized, the root cause of the North Korea nuclear missile issue lies in the conflicts between North Korea and the United States, as well as between North and South Korea.\" Despite being North Korea's most important ally, China has taken a tougher stance on the country's nuclear program in recent years, voting in favor of UN sanctions and issuing condemnations after provocative military tests. Russia's Foreign Ministry also condemned the test, calling it a \"defiant disregard\" of UN resolutions, and the first since US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Russia and China were part of the Six Party Talks, a diplomatic effort launched in 2003 to curb North Korea's nuclear program, alongside the US, Japan, North Korea, and South Korea. The United Nations Security Council has scheduled an urgent meeting for Monday afternoon to discuss North Korea, following a request from the US, South Korea, and Japan. The meeting comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting President Trump in the US when North Korea launched the missile, which landed in the Sea of Japan. Abe condemned the test as \"absolutely intolerable,\" while President Trump pledged that the US \"stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%.\" Japan's chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, described the launch as a \"clear provocation to Japan and the region,\" and Tokyo has already lodged protests with North Korea through its embassy in Beijing. The Pukguksong-2 missile, which was tested on Sunday, has raised concerns that North Korea may be closer than previously thought to developing a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile. The nuclear-capable missile is capable of traveling between 3,000 and 5,500 kilometers, according to state media. A US official reported that the missile tested flew 500 kilometers before landing in the Sea of Japan, and was launched from North Pyongan province. The Pukguksong-2 is believed to use a solid-fuel engine, which enables faster launch and greater mobility, according to a South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that North Korea used a cold-launching system, where the missile is initially lifted off the ground using pressure and then ignited during its flight, rather than igniting it on the ground. This approach is considered less stable, according to the spokesman. In a statement, Kim expressed satisfaction over the country's acquisition of another powerful nuclear attack capability, which he said adds to the nation's overall military might.",

        "Text": "When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visits the US, he will find a White House that is vastly different from the one he encountered during his previous visits, when he found a leader with a similar liberal worldview and youthful energy. During those visits, then-President Barack Obama often met with Trudeau, offering guidance on how to effectively advocate for progressive policies. Now, Trudeau faces a new challenge, as he must balance his desire to maintain a strong relationship with the US with the need to represent the concerns of anxious Canadians who are eager for him to address Trump's more controversial views. This meeting marks Trump's third official visit from a head of government, following earlier visits from the British and Japanese prime ministers, as well as Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to arrive on Wednesday. In his first three weeks in office, Trump has focused on shared priorities in his bilateral sessions, but Trudeau, who is 45 years old and a liberal, will present a very different leader from the ones he has met with previously. Despite their differences, aides in Washington and Ottawa say that Trump and Trudeau will aim to emphasize their neighborly relationship during their first face-to-face meeting, but their distinct styles will be on full display during a midday news conference. While disputes between the US and Canada are rare and usually not contentious, there have been disagreements in the past, such as over the import of softwood lumber and the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Canada supports. However, under Trump's presidency, the differences between the two countries could become more pronounced. Trudeau has made a point of actively welcoming refugees fleeing war in Syria, even visiting the Toronto airport in 2015 to greet a planeload of migrants. When Trump issued his contentious executive order restricting Syrian refugees from entering the country, Trudeau took to Twitter to post a sharp message: \"To those fleeing persecution, terror, and war, Canada welcomes you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength. #WelcomeToCanada.\" The tweet was accompanied by a photo of the Prime Minister greeting a young girl during his 2015 visit to the airport. Although Trudeau didn't directly criticize the immigration order, which is currently facing legal challenges and remains on hold, he indicated that he would discuss a range of issues with Trump, including areas of agreement and disagreement. \"We'll be discussing all sorts of things that we align on,\" he said, \"and we'll also have respectful conversations about the areas where we don't see eye-to-eye.\" The refugee policy divide between Trudeau and Trump is just one of several areas of disagreement between the two leaders, who have also expressed vastly different views on climate change and economic policy. Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which includes Mexico, the US, and Canada, although detailed talks about the new accord's terms are unlikely to take place on Monday.

Adele's heartfelt words left Beyoncé visibly emotional, with the singer appearing to respond with \"I love you\" from the audience. Beyoncé's \"Lemonade\" album had already sparked controversy since its release, including criticism from police organizations over the imagery and themes in the video for her \"Formation\" single and her Super Bowl 50 halftime performance, which featured dancers in Black Panther-inspired costumes. The Beyoncé controversy is more significant than you might think. Throughout her career, Beyoncé has been unapologetic about using imagery to spark conversations about culture, race, and empowerment. During her acceptance speech for Best Urban Contemporary Album for \"Lemonade,\" she reiterated her commitment to this approach. She emphasized the importance of showcasing diverse images to her children, so they can grow up in a world where they see themselves reflected in their families, media, and society at large - from the news to the Olympics, the White House, and the Grammys. Beyoncé's goal is for every child, regardless of race, to feel confident in their beauty, intelligence, and capabilities. She believes it's crucial to learn from the past and recognize the patterns that lead to repeated mistakes, in order to create a more inclusive and equitable future. ",

        "Text": "The city has suffered irreparable losses since the terrorist group occupied it in May 2015, with many of its priceless antiquities, monuments, and historic sites destroyed. Russia's Defense Ministry reported on Monday that it has detected an increase in truck activity near the ancient site, indicating that ISIS is planning to cause further damage to the complex. According to the statement, \"We have detected an increase in truck movement near the ancient city as Syrian troops make progress in their advance on Palmyra. This suggests that Daesh (ISIS) intends to bring in explosives to inflict maximum damage on the remaining architectural relics before they withdraw.\" As rival forces close in on Raqqa, the question remains: when and how will they take control? Footage captured by a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) shows the uptick in ISIS truck activity, revealing the group's intention to deliver explosives and cause maximum damage to the ancient monuments before their retreat. The same footage also shows the destruction already wrought by ISIS, including the Roman theater, Tetrapylon column, Triumphal Arch, Lion of Al-lÄt, Temple of Baalshamin, Temple of Bel, and other sites. Russian topographers and archaeologists from the Institute of Material Culture History at the Russian Academy of Sciences collaborated with the Defense Ministry to conduct a photo survey of the site, producing high-definition 3D metric models of the terrain and architectural objects that offer greater detail than current satellite photos. \"This allows us to gain a comprehensive and complex understanding of what the ancient city was like before the destruction wrought by barbarians,\" the statement said. Meanwhile, rumors circulate that ISIS is facing financial difficulties. ISIS fighters ravaged a significant portion of the ancient Roman amphitheater in Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in January, nearly two years after recapturing the city in December of the previous year. The amphitheater, a historic landmark, has also been used as a site for the brutal executions carried out by the extremist group. In August 2015, ISIS beheaded Khaled al-As'ad, a university professor and former director of antiquities and museums in Palmyra, after he refused to reveal the location of valuable artifacts to the militants. The group initially seized control of Palmyra in May 2015, and despite a brief push by Syrian regime forces to drive them out, the city fell to ISIS once again in December when government troops withdrew and over 4,000 militants returned. Analysis: While the Syrian regime has made gains in this battle, the war in Syria remains far from over. ",

        "Text": "The Oroville Dam, the nation's tallest, remains structurally sound. However, the emergency spillway, which plays a crucial role in preventing water from overflowing the dam during periods of high water levels, was experiencing erosion on Sunday. The damage prompted a mandatory evacuation order for cities and counties near Lake Oroville, citing concerns that the situation could pose a risk to downstream communities. The evacuation order remains in effect, with Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea indicating that it will not be lifted until the risk is better understood. \"I won't lift the evacuation order until I have a clearer understanding of the potential risks involved,\" he said during a press conference on Sunday night. In response to the crisis, California Governor Jerry Brown issued a state emergency declaration to support local authorities with the situation and evacuations.\n\nThe situation unfolded due to heavy rainfall in Northern California this winter, which has filled Lake Oroville to the point of near overflow. The lake also receives water from the northern Sierra Nevada mountain range, which is experiencing one of its wettest seasons on record. This has raised concerns about the potential for the water to overflow the dam and flood nearby communities. Located approximately 75 miles north of Sacramento, the Oroville Dam is a critical component of the region's flood control system. The dam features two spillways - the primary and emergency spillways - designed to prevent overflow. Unfortunately, both spillways are currently experiencing significant problems. Last week, the primary spillway suffered damage due to erosion, according to the California Department of Water Resources, with photos showing a massive hole on the lower part of the structure. The emergency spillway, which is typically used as a last resort, is only activated when water levels reach 901 feet in elevation. For the first time in its 48-year history, the dam's emergency spillway was put to use over the weekend. On Saturday, a small amount of water began flowing into the emergency spillway, and the volume of water increased. By 3 p.m. on Sunday, authorities realized that the dam's emergency spillway was eroding, according to Honea. The erosion of the spillway is hazardous because it can cause the surrounding soil and debris to slide down the hill, potentially leading to a 30-foot wall of water, warned Kevin Lawson, California Fire incident commander. If left unchecked, the erosion could result in large, uncontrolled releases of water from Lake Oroville, authorities warned. Residents were urged to evacuate immediately, with Honea's office using the most urgent language possible: \"This is NOT a drill.\" The evacuation order included all of Yuba County on the valley floor, as well as the city of Marysville. Approximately 35,000 people from Butte County, 65,000 from Yuba County, 76,000 from Yuba City, and 12,000 from Marysville City evacuated, according to California Fire. Local businesses closed, shelters opened, and gas stations were flooded with cars as residents tried to leave the area. Evacuees were stuck in traffic for hours, including Sean Dennis, who was stuck in his car for 4.5 hours, 30 miles south of Oroville. \"It was pretty scary, just because of how quickly everything was developing,\" he said. \"My wife and I managed to fill as many garbage bags as we could with whatever items we could find. We loaded both of our cars to capacity. We're not taking any risks,\" a resident said. According to police, rumors of looting were unfounded, as there were no reports of such activity.\n\nFollowing evacuation orders, authorities observed a significant reduction in the water flowing over the emergency spillway. The flow of water on the emergency spillway eventually ceased Sunday night, after the Department of Water Resources withdrew more water from the other spillway. The primary spillway is releasing water at a rate of 100,000 cubic feet per second, aimed at reducing the amount of water flowing down the emergency spillway. Typically, the main spillway flows at a rate of 55,000 cubic feet per second.\n\n\"Our goal is to lower the lake level by 50 feet,\" said Cal Fire's Lawson. \"If we can achieve that, it will bring a sense of calm to our efforts.\" So far, repairs to the emergency spillway have been delayed due to teams' inability to access the damaged area. A team will assess the situation on Monday morning, according to Bill Croyle, the acting Director of the Department of Water Resources. Authorities must act quickly, as more rain is forecasted for Wednesday.",

The film had been nominated for seven awards and its BAFTA success comes just one day before the final Oscar ballot opens, further solidifying its position as the frontrunner for top honors at the 89th Academy Awards, which will take place on February 26. In the past decade, the BAFTA winner for Best Film has gone on to win the Oscar for Best Picture six times. Another big winner was \"Lion\", which received awards for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor for Dev Patel. Viola Davis once again took home the award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Rose in \"Fences\", extending her impressive awards streak heading into the Oscars. In a post-ceremony press conference, Davis expressed skepticism about the notion that black filmmakers and actors have had more success since the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, suggesting that the recent surge in success could be an anomaly. She noted that while African-American actors have had a lot of success in the past year, it's possible that this could be followed by a period with little representation. \"I believe that what still is a deficiency is that we can have a year with a plethora of African-American movies and then the next year, nothing,\" Davis said. **Winners of the Night:**\n\n* Best Film: **\"Arrival\"**, **\"I, Daniel Blake\"**, **\"La La Land\"**, **\"Manchester by the Sea\"**, and **\"Moonlight\"**\n* Director: **Denis Villeneuve** for **\"Arrival\"**, **Ken Loach** for **\"I, Daniel Blake\"**, **Damien Chazelle** for **\"La La Land\"**, **Kenneth Lonergan** for **\"Manchester by the Sea\"**, and **Tom Ford** for **\"Nocturnal Animals\"**\n* Original Screenplay: **\"Hell or High Water\"**, **\"I, Daniel Blake\"**, **\"La La Land\"**, **\"Manchester by the Sea\"**, and **\"Moonlight\"**\n* Adapted Screenplay: **\"Arrival\"**, **\"Hacksaw Ridge\"**, **\"Hidden Figures\"**, **\"Lion\"**, and **\"Nocturnal Animals\"**\n\n**Individual Awards:**\n\n* Leading Actor: **Andrew Garfield** for **\"Hacksaw Ridge\"**, **Casey Affleck** for **\"Manchester by the Sea\"**, **Jake Gyllenhaal** for **\"Nocturnal Animals\"**, **Ryan Gosling** for **\"La La Land\"**, and **Viggo Mortensen** for **\"Captain Fantastic\"**\n* Leading Actress: **Amy Adams** for **\"Arrival\"**, **Emily Blunt** for **\"The Girl on the Train\"**, **Emma Stone** for **\"La La Land\"**, **Meryl Streep** for **\"Florence Foster Jenkins\"**, and **Natalie Portman** for **\"Jackie\"**\n* Supporting Actor: **Aaron Taylor-Johnson** for **\"Nocturnal Animals\"**, **Dev Patel** for **\"Lion\"**, **Hugh Grant** for **\"Florence Foster Jenkins\"**, **Jeff Bridges** for **\"Hell or High Water\"**, and **Mahershala Ali** for **\"Moonlight\"**\n* Supporting Actress: **Hayley Squires** for **\"I, Daniel Blake\"**, **Michelle Williams** for **\"Manchester by the Sea\"**, **Naomie Harris** for **\"Moonlight\"**, **Nicole Kidman** for **\"Lion\"**, and **Viola Davis** for **\"Fences\"**\n\n**Other Awards:**\n\n* Outstanding British Film: **\"American Honey\"**, **\"Denial\"**, **\"Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them\"**, **\"I, Daniel Blake\"**, **\"Notes on Blindness\"**, and **\"Under the Shadow\"**\n* Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director, or Producer: **\"The Girl With All the Gifts\"**, **\"The Hard Stop\"**, **\"Notes on Blindness\"**, **\"The Pass\"**, and **\"Under the Shadow\"**\n* Film Not in the English Language: **\"Dheepan\"**, **\"Juileta\"**, **\"Mustang\"**, **\"Son of Saul\"**, and **\"Toni Erdmann\"**\n* Documentary: **\"13th\"**, **\"The Beatles: Eight Days a Week -- The Touring Years\"**, **\"The Eagle Huntress\"**, **\"Notes on Blindness\"**, and **\"Weiner\"**\n* Animated Film: **\"Finding Dory\"**, **\"Kubo and the Two Strings\"**, **\"Moana\"**, and **\"Zootropolis\"**\n* Original Music: **\"Arrival\"**, **\"Jackie\"**, **\"La La Land\"**, **\"Lion\"**, and **\"Nocturnal Animals\"**\n* Cinematography: **\"Arrival\"**, **\"Hell or High Water\"**, **\"La La Land\"**, **\"Lion\"**, and **\"Nocturnal Animals\"**\n* Editing: **\"Arrival\"**, **\"Hacksaw Ridge\"**, **\"La La Land\"**, **\"Manchester by the Sea\"**, and **\"Nocturnal Animals\"**\n* Production Design: **\"Doctor Strange\"**, **\"Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them\"**, and **\"Hail, Caesar!\"** The 89th Academy Awards honored several films, including \"La La Land\", \"Nocturnal Animals\", \"Allied\", \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", \"Florence Foster Jenkins\", \"Jackie\", and \"Doctor Strange\".\n\nThe winners in various categories included costume design for \"La La Land\" and \"Florence Foster Jenkins\", and make-up and hair for \"Doctor Strange\".\n\nThe awards also recognized excellence in sound, with winners including \"Arrival\", \"Deepwater Horizon\", \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", \"Hacksaw Ridge\", and \"La La Land\".\n\nIn the special visual effects category, the winners were \"Arrival\", \"Doctor Strange\", \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", \"The Jungle Book\", and \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\".\n\nThe British short animation category featured winners \"The Alan Dimension\", \"A Love Story\", and \"Tough\", while the British short film category included \"Consumed\", \"Home\", \"Mouth of Hell\", \"The Party\", and \"Standby\".\n\nThe public-voted Rising Star award went to Anya Taylor-Joy, Laia Costa, Lucas Hedges, Ruth Negga, and Tom Holland.",

        "Text": "\"In the heat, the whales' bodies can become pressurized and potentially explode, but we've taken precautions to prevent that,\" said Trish Grant, a spokesperson for New Zealand's Department of Conservation. \"Our staff has been using a specialized tool to puncture the dead whales and release the built-up gas inside their carcasses, which was designed by a local individual for us.\"\n\nExcavators will be used to relocate the dead whales further up Farewell Spit in Golden Bay, on the tip of New Zealand's South Island, to a secluded area within the nature reserve that is not open to the public. According to the Department of Conservation, approximately 400 whales died on Farewell Spit between Friday and Sunday, making it the third largest mass stranding of whales in the country's history.\n\nThe Department of Conservation spent Monday monitoring a pod of whales still in the Golden Bay area from the coastline, as concerns grew that they too might beach themselves. \"We've completed our monitoring for tonight, but we'll resume our searches tomorrow,\" Grant said. \"The whales are still in the Golden Bay area, relatively close to shore, and there's a risk they could strand overnight.\"\n\nThe whales were first spotted in the water late on Thursday night by a department staffer, before being found on the beaches of Farewell Spit the following morning. Hundreds of volunteers joined the rescue effort. According to Grant, Farewell Spit is considered a whale trap due to its shallow waters.\n\nThe largest whale stranding event in New Zealand occurred in 1918, when 1,000 whales stranded themselves on the Chatham Islands. The second largest was in Auckland in 1985, when 450 whales ended up on a beach. Grant noted that a variety of factors can contribute to whale beachings. \"According to Grant, sometimes a diseased member within the group can be the cause - because of their strong social connections, if one individual gets into trouble, it can have a ripple effect and affect the others as well.\" ",

        "Text": "A White House statement described the conversation between Trump and Xi as \"extremely cordial.\" Trump's reaffirmation of the US commitment to the \"One China\" policy was particularly significant for Xi. The phone call, combined with a personal letter from Trump to Xi sent two days earlier, which expressed the US interest in establishing \"constructive relations\" with China, helped to alleviate many of the uncertainties generated by Trump's earlier comments that the \"One China\" principle was negotiable. Trump's initial challenge to the \"One China\" principle and his threat to impose a 45% import duty on Chinese goods during the election campaign had raised concerns that the two countries were headed for a collision course. Domestic setbacks may have contributed to Trump's apparent return to the \"One China\" principle. Following the election, Trump felt invincible, with foreign leaders eager to court him and his popularity soaring at home and abroad. However, since taking office, Trump has faced significant domestic frustrations, with his policy initiatives facing fierce criticism and opposition from the public, media, and other branches of government. According to a CNN/ORC poll, a majority (53%) disapprove of Trump's job performance, the highest disapproval rate for a newly elected president since polls began tracking this data. As a result, Trump has become increasingly frustrated and vexed by domestic challenges, and a major confrontation with China would only add to his woes, promising to be a nasty and uncertain outcome. President Trump likely returned to the \"One China\" principle after reassessing the priorities of his administration's domestic and foreign policy agendas. China's successful diplomatic efforts, employing both conventional and unconventional tactics, may have contributed to Trump's reversal. In public, China has consistently emphasized that the \"One China\" principle is a core interest and will fight to maintain it. Meanwhile, China has pursued unconventional approaches to shape Trump's China policy, recognizing that he relies heavily on a small group of advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump. To smooth relations with Trump, China has attempted to directly influence the first family. For instance, Kushner attended a dinner hosted by Chinese business tycoon Wu Xiaohui soon after Trump's election, and Ivanka Trump paid a surprise visit to China's embassy in Washington to attend a Chinese New Year reception. Behind closed doors, China may have successfully shaped Trump's position on the \"One China\" policy through a combination of deterrence and accommodation. While Trump's commitment to the \"One China\" principle has temporarily alleviated a hurdle to Sino-US relations, the future of the bilateral relationship remains uncertain. Multiple issues, including trade, the South China Sea, and North Korea's nuclear challenge, may still lead to conflict between the two countries. The US and China can take several steps to reduce tensions and foster cooperation. While the US should avoid using the \"One China\" principle to pressure Beijing on trade issues, China must be willing to make significant concessions. The Trump administration has a legitimate grievance due to the massive trade deficit, and China needs to address the issue of fair trade. This could involve granting US companies greater access to the Chinese market. On the South China Sea issue, the Trump administration's recent statements have been encouraging, with Secretary of Defense James Mattis emphasizing the importance of diplomacy in resolving disputes. China should not misinterpret this as a sign of weakness, but rather refrain from taking actions that could escalate the conflict. Furthermore, China should make genuine efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, as greater efforts would not only contribute to regional stability but also strengthen Sino-US cooperation on this critical security issue. By doing so, China can demonstrate its commitment to helping the US address this complex challenge.",

        "Text": "President Trump held a news conference that lasted an hour and fifteen minutes, creating a memorable moment in modern American political history. He displayed a rare level of anger and grievance, which is unusual for a president, especially one who has only been in office for four weeks. Trump criticized the media, saying, \"I have never seen more dishonest media, frankly, than the political media.\" He later slammed leaks from the intelligence community, which had led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump emphasized that the leaks are real, but the news is often fake due to the prevalence of false information. This news conference was a departure from the usual dynamics of a presidential press conference, with Trump focusing on his own poll numbers, his victory over Hillary Clinton, and his views on cable TV ratings and panel discussions. Trump stated that he is taking his message directly to the people, citing the many problems his administration inherited from the previous government and economy. He described the situation as a \"mess\" at home and abroad. This kind of message, delivered in a straightforward and unvarnished manner, was a key factor in Trump's presidential victory. However, his approach may also offend or alarm some voters and may not alleviate concerns about Trump among political elites in Washington. Trump predicted how his news conference would be perceived by the press, saying, \"Tomorrow, they will say: 'Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.'\" He insisted that he was not ranting and raving, but simply stating the truth. President Trump, visibly frustrated with the media's portrayal of his administration, decided to take matters into his own hands and hold an impromptu press conference. The event was not scheduled until Thursday morning, but Trump's aides said he was eager to address the public and defend himself against negative reports.\n\nAccording to a senior administration official, Trump walked into the Oval Office that morning and told his top aides, \"Let's do a press conference today.\" The official confirmed that the idea was entirely the President's, stating, \"I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.\"\n\nTrump began the press conference by announcing his new pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, before launching into a defense of his administration's accomplishments. \"We have made incredible progress,\" he said. \"I don't think there's ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we've done.\"\n\nTrump expressed his resentment towards the media, saying he was tired of picking up newspapers and turning on the TV only to hear reports that his White House was in chaos. \"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,\" he insisted, despite apparent frustration with the coverage and possibly even his own aides.\n\nIn a statement that hinted at his frustration, Trump said, \"I don't mind a bad story if it's true,\" but complained that much of what was reported about his administration was unfair. President Trump criticized the media's coverage of his initial travel ban, which restricted nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries and caused chaos at US airports before being blocked by a federal court. \"We had a seamless rollout of the travel ban,\" Trump said. \"But we had a bad court decision, and that's the only issue with the travel ban.\" However, Trump also announced plans to issue a new executive order that would be tailored to the court's ruling to ensure its legality. In addition, Trump accused former Obama administration officials of leaking information about his alleged contacts with Moscow to discredit his administration. Trump faced repeated questions about whether his campaign staff had been in contact with Russia, which has dominated the news cycle. \"No one I know has had contact with Russia,\" Trump said. \"How many times do I need to answer this question? Russia is just a distraction. I haven't made a phone call to Russia in years, and I have no business dealings or financial ties to Russia.\" Trump also claimed, \"I own nothing in Russia, I have no loans in Russia, and I'm not involved in any deals there.\" He dismissed the Russia allegations as \"fake news.\"",

Trump highlighted Acosta's experience, stating that he has been confirmed by the Senate three times. Trump praised Acosta, saying, \"I have wished him the best, we just spoke and he is going to be a tremendous secretary of labor.\" Acosta was not present at the event with the President. If confirmed, Acosta would be the first Hispanic member of Trump's Cabinet. Acosta, currently the dean of the Florida International University School of Law, has a background in labor law, having served on the National Labor Relations Board and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. NBC News was the first to report Acosta as Trump's pick. Prior to his nomination, Acosta practiced law at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington. Trump's first pick for Labor Secretary, Andy Puzder, withdrew his nomination on Wednesday after Republican senators indicated they would not support him. Puzder, the CEO of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. fast food chains, faced opposition from both Democrats and Republicans due to his stance on labor issues and his employment of an undocumented immigrant housekeeper. Senior GOP officials informed the White House that Puzder lacked a viable path for confirmation. \"The tumultuous nomination process took a toll on Puzder, as those close to the nominee revealed to CNN that he was shocked by the intensity of the political fray.\" ",

        "Text": "President Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to block his travel ban, stating that the new order would be tailored to address what he considers a \"very bad decision\". Meanwhile, the Justice Department filed a 47-page brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that it doesn't need a larger panel of judges to rehear its appeal, as a new order is forthcoming. The brief criticized the Ninth Circuit's \"seriously flawed\" ruling, but indicated that the President plans to rescind the order and replace it with a revised one to address constitutional concerns. The revised order would allow the country to be protected immediately, rather than continuing with potentially time-consuming litigation. The Trump administration's next move has been a topic of speculation since the Ninth Circuit refused to lift a federal judge's temporary restraining order on the executive order, which banned foreign nationals from several countries and all refugees from entering the US for a certain period. Last Friday, an unidentified judge on the Ninth Circuit requested a full court vote on rehearing the decision, a move that came at a time of uncertainty regarding the Justice Department's plans to pursue the appeal. The states of Washington and Minnesota, which brought the lawsuit, argued in their court filing on Thursday that there is no basis for rehearing the case, as the three-judge panel's opinion is \"firmly grounded in precedent.\" Meanwhile, the nation awaits a new or modified executive order on immigration from the Trump administration, while at least one federal court is pushing forward with litigation over the original order. In Seattle, US District Court Judge James Robart, who previously halted key provisions of the travel ban, denied the Trump administration's request to delay further proceedings in his court, allowing the parties to move forward to the discovery phase of the case.

        "Text": "Following Flynn's resignation, Trump appointed Ret. Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg, who worked under Flynn, as the acting national security adviser. When asked if a new candidate for national security adviser was being considered, a White House official replied, \"Not to my knowledge.\" Harward stated in a release that he decided not to take the position because he wanted to focus on personal and family matters that would have been difficult to balance with the demands of the job. \"As military personnel understand, this role requires constant, 24/7 dedication and commitment. I'm currently unable to make that commitment,\" Harward said. He expressed his sympathies to those who carry the weight of national security responsibilities and added, \"God bless our great nation.\" A friend of Harward's revealed that he was hesitant to accept the position due to the perceived chaos in the White House, describing the offer as a \"s*** sandwich.\" According to a Republican official, Harward made it a condition of taking the job that he could assemble his own team, but ultimately felt this was not possible. A senior Republican familiar with the process said that Harward's decision was largely driven by questions about the lines of authority, which could not be resolved to his satisfaction. The official described the situation as more of a matter of uncertainty rather than a disagreement. Prior to his decision, Harward served as the deputy to General Mattis when he was commander of US Central Command, which oversees military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Michael Flynn was forced to resign from his position in the Trump administration after reports surfaced that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador before Trump's inauguration and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversation. The White House claimed that Flynn's failure to disclose the details of his conversation led to a breakdown in trust between Flynn and the President, ultimately prompting his resignation. After a 30-year military career, Robert Harward became the CEO of Lockheed Martin's United Arab Emirates division. As a former employee of the National Security Council's counterterrorism office from 2003 to 2005, Harward was well-versed in the role of national security adviser and the workings of the National Security Council. Following Flynn's resignation, Harward's name was floated as a potential replacement, alongside acting adviser Kellogg and retired Army General David Petraeus, who had pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information in 2015. Retired Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks, a CNN military analyst, described Harward as an \"incredibly talented guy\" in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett on \"OutFront.\" Marks declined to speculate on why Harward turned down the job, but suggested that the turmoil in the White House may have been a contributing factor. \"I'm sure Bob looked at this, Admiral Harward looked at this, and said, 'Look, there's a lot of forming and storming going on right now,'\" Marks said. However, Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, dismissed the idea that White House chaos led to Harward's decision not to accept the role, calling it \"hearsay.\" \"Am I surprised that we're still in the process of filling this position 72 hours after Flynn resigned? No, I'm not,\" Lankford said in an interview with Burnett. ",

        "Text": "Despite his efforts to reassure key allies, such as Germany, about the US's resolve on Russia and other issues, Vice President Mike Pence faces questions about his level of involvement in President Donald Trump's thinking on the Kremlin. On Monday, Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for misleading Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Pence, who had previously repeated Flynn's statements on television, only discovered he was misinformed last Friday - two weeks after Trump learned that the Justice Department was investigating the matter. As Pence seeks answers about why he was misled, Trump has shown little concern for his vice president's compromised position. Instead, Trump has portrayed Flynn as unfairly targeted by illegal leakers of classified information. At a news conference, Trump expressed frustration about how the press obtained classified information, saying, \"How do they do it? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.\" The incident has left Pence frustrated and dismayed, and has raised questions about how much he can be trusted as a credible representative of Trump's views in Europe, where the top concern is the US's stance on sanctions against Moscow. As Pence travels abroad for the first time since taking office, he will attend the Munich Security Conference, meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and hold talks with key European leaders in Brussels. According to Derek Chollet, executive vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, he expects Pence to maintain a consistent stance on Russia and commitment to Europe, similar to his views presented during the vice presidential debate last year. However, this may still leave allies wondering if Pence is truly speaking for Trump. White House aides revealed that Pence and Trump had discussed the upcoming trip, which will also involve meetings with the leaders of Iraq and Afghanistan. The aides emphasized that Pence will work to reassure US allies during his trip and dismissed concerns that he may be perceived as an unreliable voice for Trump. \"I don't think any of our allies will question for a second whether the vice president is speaking on behalf of the administration, in conjunction with the President, on any matter,\" said a senior White House official, speaking anonymously to preview Pence's trip.\n\nAs Pence arrives in Europe, leaders are expressing deep unease, with many viewing Trump with skepticism. Few believed Trump could win the election and did little to hide their disdain for the billionaire real estate developer as he campaigned. The frenetic first month of Trump's presidency has only deepened European leaders' concerns. The resignation of Flynn this week has brought some optimism among Western diplomats who were troubled by his desire to strengthen ties with Moscow. However, widespread uncertainty remains about what steps Trump may take to begin cooperating with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Western diplomats and US officials who have met with Trump administration envoys describe mixed messages about the future of US policy toward Russia. While some US officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, have reiterated that US sanctions against Russia will remain in place due to its incursion into Ukraine, others have been less definitive. The future of a separate set of sanctions imposed on Russia for its election cyber-meddling is also uncertain. The timing of Flynn's phone call to the Russian ambassador coincided with the Obama administration's imposition of those sanctions, and President Trump has left the door open to lifting them. This has raised concerns among some European leaders, who fear that the same Russian cyber intrusions could impact upcoming elections in France and Germany. The uncertainty surrounding the sanctions has also contributed to unease in European capitals, which were already on edge due to Trump's campaign trail criticisms of NATO. During his presidential campaign, Trump had described the defense alliance as \"obsolete\" and chastised member countries for not meeting defense spending requirements. However, since taking office, he has largely tempered these remarks. Last month, he reaffirmed the administration's support for NATO during a speech at US Central Command in Florida. Vice President Pence will aim to deliver a more consistent message during his upcoming trip to Munich and Brussels, where he will meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and other European leaders. Pence's message will focus on the importance of Russia adhering to the Minsk ceasefire agreement in Ukraine and the need for NATO to remain a cornerstone of Western security. According to a senior White House adviser on foreign policy, Pence wants to \"reaffirm that we're stronger together\" and reassure European leaders that the US is committed to its traditional foreign policy stance.",

However, some inside the White House are unhappy with the choice, with longtime Trump loyalists expressing a preference for a veteran from the campaign. \"Dubke and his Crossroads associates did everything they could to undermine the Trump movement and failed,\" said one loyalist. The position of communications director was initially offered to Jason Miller, Trump's transition spokesman, but he declined to take the role to focus on his family. Dubke did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Dubke founded Crossroads Media in 2001 and grew the company into a prominent national firm during the 2008 presidential campaign. According to the company's website, Crossroads is \"the premier Republican media services firm,\" and Dubke has a \"unique understanding of the relationship between political strategy and public policy development.\" The appointment is expected to alleviate some of the pressure on embattled Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who has faced a rocky start to his tenure as the administration's official spokesman. Until now, Spicer has served in both roles, which are typically filled by separate staff members.  ",

Tillerson's comments, made during a brief on-camera statement following the meeting, may help to alleviate concerns among US allies. \"As I emphasized during my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider collaborating with Russia when we can identify areas of practical cooperation that benefit the American people,\" Tillerson said. \"Where our interests diverge, the United States will stand up for its values and those of its allies. As we seek new common ground, we expect Russia to uphold its commitment to the Minsk Agreements and work to reduce tensions in Ukraine.\" The White House and the Kremlin have engaged in a war of words in recent days over Crimea, the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014. Speaking shortly before, Lavrov said that the two had a range of issues to discuss, mirroring the topics that were addressed during the January 28 phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. When asked whether the turmoil in Washington could impact US-Russian relations, Lavrov replied, \"We do not interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries.\" His comments came at the same time as US Defense Secretary James Mattis stated that there was \"very little doubt\" that Russia had interfered in or attempted to interfere in several democratic elections. Speaking after a NATO conference in Brussels, Belgium, Mattis described Russia's actions around the world as \"aggressive\" and \"destabilizing.\" Mattis dismissed the notion of strengthening military ties with Russia, stating, \"We are not currently equipped to collaborate on a military level, but our political leaders will engage and strive to find common ground.\" The trip to Germany by Secretary of State Tillerson comes as the Trump administration is working to alleviate concerns among European allies, while also exploring new avenues for cooperation with Russia, as advocated by President Trump despite opposition from some members of his own party. The White House is in disarray following the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who stepped down amidst questions about the nature of his conversations with Russia regarding sanctions before taking office. Meanwhile, Congress is investigating various aspects of Russia's alleged interference in the US election, and lawmakers are scrutinizing President Trump's ties to the country. ",

        "Text": "Selangor Police Chief Abdul Samah Mat has stated that the body of Kim Jong Nam will not be released and the autopsy report will not be made public unless DNA samples are provided by a next of kin. Kim Jong Nam died after being attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday. South Korean officials have alleged that he was poisoned. Three individuals have been arrested in connection with Kim's murder: an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man, and another woman carrying Vietnamese identification. Four days after the killing, many questions remain unanswered. Here's what is currently known:\n\nKim Jong Nam was on his way to catch a flight to Macau on Monday morning to visit his family, where he had been living since leaving North Korea years ago. Macau, a short ferry or helicopter ride from Hong Kong, is a popular destination for gamblers from mainland China. The details of Kim's murder are still unclear, but Selangor State Criminal Investigations Department Chief Fadzil Ahmat told Reuters that Kim \"felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind.\" Kim felt dizzy and immediately sought medical help at an airport customer assistance counter, which led to him being taken to the on-premises clinic. Unfortunately, an ambulance was called too late, and Kim died on the way to the hospital.\n\nThe exact cause of Kim's death is still unknown. Initially, local media reported on poison needles and deadly sprays, but it was unclear whether Kim had been killed or suffered a heart attack. Later, on Wednesday, South Korea's National Assembly Intelligence Committee Chairman Lee Cheol Woo publicly stated that Kim had been murdered by \"two Asian women\" using poison. South Korea has not disclosed how it discovered the poisoning or what toxin was used to kill Kim Jong Nam. The autopsy results, which were completed on Wednesday, have not been released. Deputy Prime Minister Hamidi of Malaysia stated that no next of kin have come forward to claim Kim's body. There is no known motive for the killing, and no explanation has been provided for how Kim was poisoned. South Korea's Lee told lawmakers on Wednesday that North Korea was responsible for Kim's death, but he did not offer any evidence to support his claim. A South Korean legislator, Lee Chul Woo, suggested that North Korea had been trying to assassinate Kim Jong Nam for the past five years, but he did not provide any concrete evidence. When asked about rumors of North Korean involvement, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi characterized the speculation as unfounded. North Korea has requested Kim's body, but Malaysian authorities have declined to release it until their investigation is complete. The police have released grainy security footage from the airport showing two young female suspects, one of whom was wearing a blue skirt and white t-shirt with \"LOL\" written on it. The first suspect, a 30-year-old Vietnamese woman named Doan Thi Huong, was arrested on Wednesday morning at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, two days after the attack. She was carrying Vietnamese identification documents. Later that evening, a 26-year-old Malaysian man named Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin was taken into custody to assist in the investigation. At 2 a.m. on Thursday, Jalaluddin led investigators to his 25-year-old Indonesian girlfriend, Siti Aishah, who was then arrested on suspicion of being involved in Kim's death. \"No charges have been filed. Who was Kim Jong Nam? If circumstances had unfolded differently, Kim Jong Nam could have become the leader of North Korea. Born in 1971, he was the eldest son of then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. His mother, actress Song Hye-rim, was one of Kim Jong Il's favored mistresses, and for a time, Kim Jong Nam was the most visible of his father's sons. However, in 2001, he reportedly lost his father's favor after attempting to use forged documents to visit Tokyo Disneyland. In contrast, his half-brother, Kim Jong Un, was born to a different mistress, Ko Yong Hui, who was politically ambitious and eager to see her son succeed Kim Jong Il as leader. According to author Yoji Gomi, who wrote a book in 2012 titled \"My Father, Kim Jong Il, and Me,\" Kim Jong Nam believed his younger brother was unfit to lead the country.\"",

In addition to the 200 injured, many more were transferred to larger hospitals in other cities of Sindh province, he added. Thousands of people, including families with children, had gathered at the ancient Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine for a Sufi ritual known as Dhamal, which involves music, chanting, and prayer. The Islamic State Khorasan, ISIS' affiliate in Afghanistan and Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to CNN. According to the Amaq news agency, which is affiliated with ISIS, the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosives vest. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack as \"brutal\" and ordered all state institutions to mobilize resources for rescue and relief efforts. In a statement, the Prime Minister said, \"I have directed all the state institutions to mobilize all resources for rescue and relief after this brutal terror attack on Lal Shahbaz Qalandar's shrine.\" The Pakistani military blamed operatives from Afghanistan for a recent surge in attacks on the country, with Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, the military's spokesman, tweeting, \"Recent terrorist acts are being executed on directions from hostile powers and from sanctuaries in Afghanistan. We shall defend and respond.\" In another tweet, he urged the public to remain calm, saying, \"Your security forces shall not allow hostile powers to succeed. We stand for our nation.\" Later, the military spokesman announced that the Pakistan-Afghanistan border had been closed due to security concerns. The attack comes just days after a bomb exploded during a protest in Lahore, Pakistan, on Monday, killing at least 14 people and injuring 59 others, according to government spokesman Malik Ahmad Khan. A splinter group of Pakistan's Tehreek-i Taliban, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, Jamat-ul-Ahrar, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack, which was emailed to CNN. ",

New Zealand resides on a massive landmass of approximately 1.8 million square miles, known as Zealandia. This new continent also encompasses New Caledonia and several other territories and island groups. The concept of a potential continent in this region has been debated for some time, with geophysicist Bruce Luyendyk introducing the term Zealandia in 1995. Over the past decade, dedicated research has revealed that Zealandia is not just a collection of continental islands and fragments, but rather a large and distinct continental crust that warrants official recognition as a separate continent. Previously, New Zealand and New Caledonia were grouped with Australia under the umbrella term Australasia. While many would refer to Zealandia as the eighth continent, geologists often consider Europe and Asia as a single continent, Eurasia. The Geological Society of America's recent publication comes on the heels of a breakthrough discovery just last week, where scientists uncovered a \"lost continent\" beneath the Indian Ocean.  ",

        "Text": "President Trump lashed out at reporters, resumed disputing the election results, and refused to acknowledge established facts. While some of his supporters appreciate his blunt honesty and willingness to counter critics, this approach is not suitable for the presidency. The recent news conference highlighted several concerns, not only among Democrats but also some Republicans, about Trump's behavior. By spreading false information about widespread voter fraud, he perpetuates the dissemination of misinformation from a position of power. When he insists he would have won the popular vote if not for fraud, and claims he had the largest Electoral College victory since Ronald Reagan, it's alarming for the political system and encourages legislation that could restrict voting rights. Trump remains fixated on the Hillary Clinton email scandal, despite increasing reports about his own security lapses being front-page news. Despite numerous reports linking Russia to his campaign team, Trump showed no indication of taking these revelations seriously or being troubled by them. His thin skin was evident in his insulting remarks about reporters and news organizations, leading him to prioritize attacking them over answering questions. Instead of addressing the \"mess\" he inherited, the President chose to deflect by criticizing the \"dishonest media\" for not giving him the recognition he feels he deserves. It's evident that he is not surrounded by advisors who are willing to challenge his most egregious behavior. He creates his own worldview, defends it zealously, and struggles to incorporate factual information that contradicts his beliefs. This approach can have devastating consequences for his foreign and domestic policies. It's also clear that the President remains embroiled in a bitter feud with the media, and journalists must be vigilant in monitoring and pushing back against a White House that appears reluctant to share meaningful information. History has shown that this kind of worldview can ultimately consume a President, as their paranoia, pettiness, and anger can drive them to unethical or illegal behavior in an effort to protect their reputation. During Wednesday's news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the President's impromptu statement that he was open to a one-state solution sent decades of diplomatic efforts into disarray and had the potential to spark violence rather than constructive dialogue. While Americans may have differing opinions about the President's actions, there are limits to what is acceptable. As President, the consequences of poorly thought-out statements and off-the-cuff attacks can be dangerous and far-reaching. The chaos that has engulfed the White House has created an environment in which powerful individuals, such as Michael Flynn, can act with impunity. This was a lesson learned by President Ronald Reagan, who witnessed illegal activities by members of his National Security Council in Nicaragua. As a role model for the nation, the President's behavior sets a tone that fuels rather than dampens partisan anger, which has plagued the country. The question is whether anyone in the Oval Office or the Republican Party will step in to restrain the President and whether Republicans will start to question his conduct. The withdrawal of Andrew Puzder as secretary of labor and Republicans calling for an investigation into the Trump-Russia connection are early signs that the Republican Party may be fragmenting. As Republicans on Capitol Hill watch Trump squander time on petty squabbles rather than sending them legislation, they will grow increasingly anxious about the impact on their future majority. If Trump pushes them to the brink, it would be a perilous moment for the administration. Despite boasting about his ability to make deals and get things done, President Trump's legislative record is sparse compared to other presidents at this point in their term. Most of his presidency has been marked by public spectacle rather than genuine governance. Even Trump supporters must be disappointed by the White House's handling of the immigration executive order, which was left dead in the courts due to sloppy execution. While there is still time for Trump to recover, Democrats should not be overconfident about this challenging moment. However, CNN's Jake Tapper was correct in highlighting the President's impression on voters and lawmakers, which will only deepen as these events unfold and raise questions about the kind of President we have.",

        "Text": "President Trump has issued a series of executive orders aimed at dismantling barriers to deportations and hiring new law enforcement officials to spearhead the effort, utilizing the Department of Homeland Security to fulfill his campaign promise of tackling undocumented immigration. In a statement, Trump boasted, \"We're removing really bad individuals from this country at a rate that's unprecedented. And they're the bad ones. It's a highly organized and efficient process.\" He also claimed, \"You're seeing what's happening at the border. For the first time, we're getting gang members out, drug lords out.\" A White House spokesperson defended Trump's characterization of deportations as a \"military operation,\" saying the President meant it as an adjective describing the orderly and professional manner in which his executive orders are being implemented. However, Trump's administration has clarified that it is not using the military to deport undocumented immigrants. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly explicitly stated that there would be \"no use of military force in immigration operations, none.\" Despite earlier denials, the Trump administration has expanded the number of undocumented immigrants who are subject to deportation. According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, \"Everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time,\" a policy consistent with international standards. \"If you are in this country illegally, there must be a provision that allows for your removal.\" ",

        "Text": "Mexican official Osorio Chong expressed disagreement with the US government's recent measures, stating, \"We do not agree on the different measures that have been stated by the government of the United States, which affect Mexico.\" US Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Mexico to mend the strained relationship and address the growing differences between the two nations. The visit comes after months of heated rhetoric from US President Donald Trump and the implementation of new immigration measures that have significant implications for Mexico, including the potential for a significant increase in deportations back to the southern border. Osorio Chong expressed Mexico's concern about the rise in deportations during meetings with Kelly and Tillerson on Thursday. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray also addressed the tensions, saying that Mexico perceives the Trump administration's policies as potentially harmful to Mexicans. He emphasized the importance of respecting the human rights of Mexicans living in the US, particularly in regards to illegal migration. Videgaray noted that it would take significant progress to overcome the current negative feelings between the two nations, adding that facts were needed to achieve this goal. Tillerson acknowledged that differences between sovereign countries are inevitable, but focused on shared concerns during his public comments, stating that the US and Mexico had listened carefully to each other's concerns and raised them respectfully and patiently. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the importance of the rule of law on both sides of the US-Mexico border, vowing to work with Mexico to curb the flow of cash and weapons from the US. However, according to a senior administration official, Tillerson's message in meetings was more forceful, stating that a successful relationship and border requires reciprocity. Ahead of their remarks, President Donald Trump predicted that Tillerson's visit to Mexico would be a challenging one, citing the need for Mexico to be treated fairly. Trump told manufacturers at the White House that the trip would be difficult because \"we have to be treated fairly by Mexico.\" Upon his arrival, Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray publicly reiterated that Mexico would not accept measures imposed unilaterally by another government. The trip by US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Tillerson aimed to establish relationships and coordinate on bilateral issues, including counterterrorism, border security, and trade, which totals $1.5 billion daily. The officials also met with President Enrique Peña Nieto and Mexican military officials. However, their Mexican debut was marred by controversy, as the Trump administration has introduced policies that target Mexico and Mexicans as a security threat and economic burden on the US. On Tuesday, the administration issued guidance expanding the scope of deportations from a focus on criminals to include all undocumented immigrants in the US. The proposal also grants state and local law enforcement agencies the authority to act as immigration officers. Another aspect of the asylum procedure change would allow immigration officers to more easily send non-Mexican migrants back to Mexico if they entered the country on their way to the US. This could potentially result in tens of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, gangs, and drug cartels being sent back to Mexico. According to a Mexican official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters ahead of a meeting with Kelly and Tillerson, Mexico would not accept deportees who are not Mexican nationals. A second official pointed out that there is no bilateral agreement requiring Mexico to take these immigrants and that Mexico is not bound by any US presidential order. While the US may try to apply pressure, Mexico has some leverage, the official said. For over two years, Mexico has been stopping Central American migrants before they reach the US, and if Trump does not drop his \"orders,\" it will make it more difficult for Mexico to continue this cooperation. Trump has also suggested alternative ways to apply pressure, including imposing a 20% tariff on Mexican goods entering the US and seizing remittances from Mexicans in the US. Additionally, the President has ordered Cabinet agencies to inform him of the total direct and indirect aid the US provides to Mexico, a move that some see as an attempt to gain leverage in the debate over the border wall that Trump insists will be built and that Mexico will pay for. Mexican officials have repeatedly denied that they will pay for the wall. Under the Merida Initiative, the State Department has provided Mexico with $2.6 billion since 2008 to strengthen rule of law, counter narco-trafficking, support judicial reform, and police professionalization. This does not include aid from other State Department programs. Mexico also receives funding from various other US government agencies, including Defense, Energy, Labor, Health and Human Services, Interior, the Peace Corps, the US Agency for International Development, and DHS. Kelly recently distributed an implementation memo asking his staff to calculate the amount of direct and indirect aid DHS provides to Mexico, a process that is still underway.",

        "Text": "A correction has been made to a previous version of this story, which incorrectly reported the status of the case against Senator Leila de Lima. Although a court has ordered her arrest, she has not yet been taken into police custody. Senator Leila de Lima is accused of abetting the illegal drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison during her tenure as Justice Secretary from 2010 to 2015. On Thursday, a judge in the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court found sufficient probable cause to issue arrest warrants against de Lima and two others. A team from the Philippine National Police arrived at de Lima's residence south of Manila and then at the Senate, where she sought refuge after learning the warrant would be served that evening. At the Senate, the sergeant-at-arms agreed to serve the warrant the following morning, as requested by de Lima earlier in a televised statement. De Lima's fellow party members in the Senate have expressed outrage over the \"haste\" of the arrest warrant, with a graphic reading \"One for Leila\" circulating on social media. Senator Kiko Pangilinan, a close ally of de Lima, urged social media users to share the graphic as a sign of their opposition to political persecution. At a press conference shortly after the arrest warrant was issued, de Lima reaffirmed that she would not flee from the cases against her. She has consistently denied any involvement in the illegal drug trade. The allegations against de Lima were first raised by President Duterte in a speech in August, which accused her of receiving payoffs from convicted drug lords who were able to continue their illegal operations from behind bars while she was Justice Secretary. The New Bilibid Prison is managed by the Bureau of Corrections, an arm of the Department of Justice. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte won the presidency on a campaign promise to crack down on crime, particularly illegal drugs. Since taking office in June, his police force has engaged in a brutal crackdown on drug dealers and users, resulting in the deaths of thousands of suspects at the hands of law enforcement and vigilantes. Senator Leila de Lima became the target of investigations launched by Duterte's political allies after she initiated a Senate inquiry into alleged extrajudicial killings during Duterte's war on drugs. A Senate committee, led by a close ally of Duterte's, decided in October to drop its inquiry into the deaths of drug dealers and users during the early months of Duterte's presidency. In December, Duterte publicly admitted to having killed drug suspects during his time as mayor of Davao City. A former leader of the notorious Davao Death Squad has accused Duterte of ordering bombings. Duterte has responded by telling de Lima to \"face the music\" and claiming that the charges against her are airtight. De Lima, however, has been linked to the drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison by convicted felons who have testified against her. De Lima has countered that the government pressured these convicts to testify and that they have a personal vendetta against her. As justice secretary, de Lima had previously conducted a raid at the maximum security area of the New Bilibid Prison, which revealed a luxurious lifestyle among high-profile inmates who are now among the witnesses against her. Duterte has denied allegations that he personally threw a person from a helicopter. De Lima has vowed to take legal action to protect herself from what she perceives as political persecution. Last week, Duterte expressed confidence in the Justice Department's case against de Lima, stating that she \"will have to face the music\" and the charges against her. ",

        "Text": "Malaysian Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters that the police have formally requested an interview with the North Korean embassy's second secretary, Hyong Kwang Song, who is wanted for questioning in connection with the death of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Kim Jong Nam died last Monday after allegedly being poisoned while on his way to catch a flight to Macau from Kuala Lumpur. North Korea has strongly denied any involvement in his death, publishing an article in its state media, KCNA, which criticized the Malaysian investigation and claimed that Malaysia was responsible for his death. The article quoted a spokesman for the Korean Jurists Committee, saying that the investigation was full of weak points and contradictions.\n\nThe Malaysian police have issued Interpol notices for four suspects, believed to be back in Pyongyang, and are also seeking three North Koreans for questioning, including Hyong Kwang Song and Kim Uk Il, an Air Koryo staff member. Both are believed to still be in Malaysia. However, the North Korean embassy will not be searched, as it has diplomatic immunity.\n\nTwo women, Indonesian Siti Aishah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, have already been taken into custody in connection with the alleged murder. At a press conference, Inspector-General Bakar revealed that the two women were trained to apply a liquid substance to Kim's face and then wash their hands immediately. \"He dismissed their earlier claims that they thought they were on a prank show. 'They knew it was toxic, of course they did,' Bakar said. Aishah's boyfriend, Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin, who was taken in for questioning, was released on bond on Wednesday. North Korea denies poison reports: Tensions between North Korea and Malaysia are escalating as the rogue state continues to criticize Malaysia's handling of the investigation. In response, Malaysian Prime Minister recalled his ambassador from Pyongyang after the North Korean ambassador accused their country of conspiring with hostile forces. A recent article published on KCNA accused South Korean conservative media of spreading a false report that Kim had been poisoned. The article also strongly rebuked Malaysia for its refusal to hand over Kim's body without DNA from a next of kin, claiming that this was a politicized move that disregarded international law and morality, and was instead motivated by sinister purposes.\" ",

        "Text": "Pope Francis criticized Christians who scandalize others, saying that their hypocrisy can be a grave offense. He noted that many people have been led to question the faith due to the actions of these individuals, saying that it is better to be an atheist than to be a Catholic like that. According to Francis, scandal is when one's words and actions do not align, and this is a serious issue in the Catholic Church. He gave examples of such scandals, including money launderers and business owners who take lavish vacations while neglecting their employees. In his sermon, Francis drew on the Gospel of Mark, where Jesus says it is better to be drowned than to cause others to sin. The Catholic Catechism defines scandals as including business leaders who encourage fraud, teachers who agitate students, and manipulators who turn people away from moral values. Francis' comments were aimed at protecting his flock from the negative influence of hypocritical Christians. In the United States, some Catholics have cited the church's teachings on scandal to argue that priests should not distribute Holy Communion to politicians who support abortion rights. However, Francis instead focused his criticism on greedy businesspeople, highlighting the need for authentic Christian behavior. The Pope's comments also touched on an ancient debate in Christianity: whether salvation is open to all believers or only those who live a good life on earth. The Pope made a provocative suggestion, characteristic of his straightforward manner. He envisioned a wealthy Christian arriving at the gates of heaven and boasting, \"Here I am, Lord! I attended Church, I was close to you, I'm a member of this group, and I did this... Don't you remember all the sacrifices I made?\" In response, Jesus might say, according to the Pope: \"Yes, I remember. The sacrifices, I recall them: All tainted. All taken from the poor. I don't know you.\" The Pope was criticizing those who lead a double life, pretending to be devout while engaging in scandalous behavior.\n\nThis is not the first time Pope Francis has targeted Christian hypocrites. In a previous sermon, he condemned the \"hypocrisy\" of Christians who speak piously but fail to help others. \"To be a Christian means to act: to do the will of God, and on the day of judgment, we will be asked about our actions, not just our words. The Lord will ask us, 'What did you do?'\"\n\nPope Francis has also addressed atheists in the past. In 2013, he suggested that heaven might be open to all people, regardless of their beliefs. \"The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone.\" When asked about atheists, the Pope replied, \"Even the atheists. Everyone!\" He emphasized the importance of working together, saying, \"We must meet one another through good deeds. 'But I don't believe, Father, I'm an atheist!' But do good, and we will meet one another in heaven.\" The Vatican later issued a clarification, stating that the Pope was simply emphasizing God's universal love and urging Christians and non-believers to collaborate.

        "Text": "\"I believe one of the most significant moments in modern American history was President Trump's immediate withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This move allowed us to exit a trade deal and reclaim our sovereignty,\" Bannon said, referring to the massive trade agreement. According to Bannon, this decision was just the first step in rethinking US trade policies, and he pointed to it as one of three crucial steps Trump has taken since taking office. On the national security front, Bannon highlighted Trump's executive orders on building a border wall and strengthening immigration enforcement policies. He also emphasized the importance of Trump's efforts to dismantle the administrative state by appointing private sector individuals to key economic Cabinet positions, which will help reduce federal regulations. At CPAC, Bannon joined White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus onstage, crediting Priebus with helping launch Trump's political career. The two men discussed Trump's electoral victory, the administration's agenda, and criticized the media together, aiming to dispel the notion that they are rivals vying for power and influence within the West Wing. \"In terms of our relationship, I think the biggest misconception is everything you're reading,\" Priebus said. \"The opposition party, or mainstream media outlets, have consistently gotten it wrong in their portrayal of the campaign, the transition, and now the administration,\" Bannon added. The two praised each other, insisting that their working relationship is extremely close. (\"We share an office suite and are together from 6:30 am until about 11 pm each day,\" Priebus said.) While praising Bannon as \"incredibly loyal\" and \"extremely consistent,\" Priebus described Bannon as someone who admires his \"determination\" and noted that he is \"always kind of steady.\" The forum provided a rare glimpse into Bannon's thinking, which was marked by dark views of the news media, visions of a \"new political order,\" and grand plans to reshape the US's global posture. Bannon credited Trump with staying committed to his campaign promises, saying, \"Every day in the Oval Office, he tells Reince and I: 'I committed to this with the American people, I promised this when I ran and I am going to deliver on this.'\" Despite their efforts to present a united front, Bannon acknowledged that he and Priebus don't always see eye-to-eye, which he believes makes them \"good partners.\" The joint appearance was the latest attempt by the two men to dispel reports of division, instead portraying their relationship as chummy and symbiotic. In recent interviews, Bannon has praised Priebus, saying, \"He's doing an amazing job.\" Priebus echoed this sentiment, stating, \"We are executing on President Trump's agenda in record time. That's because Reince is getting the job done.\" The two men also joked about giving each other massages and said they talk all day long \"until somebody falls asleep.\" According to White House sources, their account has been supported in recent weeks. A source who spoke with both Bannon and Priebus separately last week revealed that while Bannon had no negative comments about Priebus, the White House chief of staff was critical of Bannon over the phone. The two men's professional backgrounds couldn't be more contrasting. While Priebus has a long history in establishment Republican politics, having risen to Republican National Committee chairman before becoming chief of staff, Bannon built his career in the private sector, amassing wealth before leading the provocative and anti-establishment Breitbart News. Following Trump's election, their appointments to the West Wing were jointly announced, with Trump describing them as \"equal partners\" who would work together.",

        "Text": "A White House official revealed on Thursday evening that the request for FBI assistance was made only after the agency expressed skepticism about the accuracy of the reports. White House officials had sought the help of the FBI and other agencies investigating the Russia matter to verify that the reports were false and that no contacts had taken place, officials said. The reports of contacts were first published by The New York Times and CNN on February 14. The direct communication between the White House and the FBI was unusual due to decade-old restrictions on such contacts. A request from the White House to influence an ongoing FBI investigation is a violation of established procedures limiting communications with the agency. Late on Thursday night, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer disputed CNN's characterization of the White House's request to the FBI, saying, \"We didn't try to discredit the story. We asked them to tell the truth.\" The FBI declined to comment on the matter. The discussions between the White House and the FBI began with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus at a separate White House meeting the day after the stories were published, according to a US law enforcement official. Initially, the White House disputed this account, claiming that McCabe had called Priebus early that morning to say that The New York Times story greatly exaggerated what the FBI knew about the contacts. However, a White House official later corrected their version of events to confirm the account described by the law enforcement official. A White House official revealed that Priebus later reached out to FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, asking them to discuss the New York Times story on background with reporters to dispute the allegations. According to a law enforcement official, McCabe did not share details about the case, but would not specify what he told Priebus. Comey declined the request for the FBI to comment on the story, citing the ongoing investigation into alleged communications between Trump associates and Russian nationals known to US intelligence. The White House issued a denial, with Priebus labeling the New York Times story \"complete garbage.\" In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Priebus criticized the story, saying it was based on \"no direct sources\" and contained \"treasonous type of accusations.\" He claimed that the top levels of the intelligence community have assured him that the story is inaccurate and grossly overstated, but refused to provide evidence to support this claim. CNN has previously reported that there was frequent communication between high-level Trump campaign advisers and Russian officials during the summer of 2016. Members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, however, confirm that their investigations into these alleged Russian contacts with the Trump campaign are ongoing, despite Priebus' assertion that there is nothing to the reports. It remains unclear what the committees will ultimately find and whether any of the information will be declassified and made public. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to push back, the investigation into Capitol Hill is delving deeper into areas that may not be comfortable for the White House. The Justice Department's procedures, outlined in memos from 2007 and 2009, prohibit direct communications between the White House and FBI on pending investigations, except in limited circumstances. According to the memos, only the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Counsel to the President, Principal Deputy Counsel to the President, President, or Vice President can initiate communication on pending or contemplated criminal investigations. The memos emphasize that such communication should only occur when it is essential for the President's duties and appropriate from a law enforcement perspective. A Department of Justice spokesperson stated that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reviewing the memos and that the Department is following the guidelines in its communications with the White House.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns about Russia's efforts to influence individuals with ties to Trump are growing, with increasing numbers of congressional members voicing their concerns. On February 17, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a briefing with Comey, during which new information about Russia was reportedly discussed. Senators James Lankford and Angus King, both members of the committee, declined to provide details about the briefing, but Senator Lankford noted that every briefing yields new information. In response to a question about Priebus' denial of the claims, Senator King expressed surprise at Priebus' categorical denial.\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, emphasized that his panel's inquiry will follow leads wherever they may lead, even if they are uncomfortable for Republicans. \"The American public will want to know if the President had personal or financial ties to the Russian government,\" Swalwell said. This story has been updated to reflect new information and comment from the White House.",

        "Text": "Malaysian police announced on Friday that tests on Kim's eyes and face had revealed the presence of a toxic substance. Nerve agents, such as VX, are considered the most toxic and fast-acting substances in chemical warfare, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Kim, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, died on February 13, just before he was set to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau. Malaysian police claim that two women were instructed by four North Koreans to apply a liquid to Kim's face, which caused him to feel dizzy minutes later and ultimately led to his death. However, North Korea has rejected this version of events, stating that the women would have died if they had indeed applied a lethal chemical to their own hands. The country vehemently denies any involvement in Kim's death.\n\nIt's worth noting that VX is a binary chemical weapon, which requires two compounds to be mixed together before it becomes lethal, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). This design is typically used for the safe storage of chemical weapons.\n\nVX works by inhibiting the function of an enzyme that helps the body's nervous system operate, leading to paralysis and suffocation. \"VX is probably the state-of-the-art nerve agent,\" said CNN military analyst Rick Francona. \"It is probably the most lethal of all the nerve agents ever designed.\" Symptoms can appear within seconds, and even small doses of as little as 10 milligrams on the skin can affect individuals. Larger exposure can lead to convulsions, paralysis, and deadly respiratory failure. VX is particularly dangerous when inhaled, rather than absorbed through the skin, according to Nial Wheate, a chemical weapons health expert at the University of Sydney. The official emphasized that the substance is not a skin agent, but rather a chemical that can be dispersed through the air. The nerve agent is classified as one of the most deadly substances under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea has not ratified. While it's highly lethal, experts say it's not particularly difficult to manufacture. North Korea has had the capability to produce and use nerve agents for some time. According to a 2009 report by the International Crisis Group, the country possessed a significant stockpile of chemical weapons, estimated to be between 2,500 to 5,000 tons, which could be delivered via artillery, rocket launchers, and ballistic missiles. However, an expert noted that the blast from a delivery system like a missile would likely destroy much of the VX, making it more suitable for use in close quarters through aerosol dispersal. The investigation has identified 11 individuals, although not all are considered suspects. Three individuals are currently in custody, including a North Korean man and two women, Siti Aishah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam, who are believed to have wiped Kim's face. Indonesian police previously stated that Aishah believed she was participating in a prank for a TV show, but this was vehemently denied by Malaysian authorities. \"These two ladies were trained to apply the substance to the deceased's face,\" said a Malaysian official. \"They knew it was toxic.\"\n\nDiplomatic tensions between North Korea and Malaysia are escalating over the investigation. North Korea has accused Malaysia of being influenced by South Korea's initial claim that Kim was poisoned by the North, and has denied any involvement in the incident. North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, accused the host country of conspiring with hostile forces, prompting Malaysia's Prime Minister to recall his ambassador to North Korea and summon Kang. A state media article in North Korea on Thursday strongly rebuked Malaysia for its refusal to hand over Kim's body without DNA from a next of kin, claiming that Malaysia was politicizing the transfer and seeking a sinister purpose. Malaysia's police inspector-general, Bakar, accused North Korea of obstructing the investigation, stating that the North Koreans had failed to respond to requests to hand over four suspects in Pyongyang and had not assisted in locating three North Koreans believed to be in Malaysia, including an embassy employee, who are wanted for questioning. Bakar warned that if the three individuals do not come forward, Malaysia will seek arrest warrants. Malaysia has also requested assistance from Interpol, asking the international police organization to issue an alert for the four suspects believed to have trained Aishah and Huong and then returned to Pyongyang.",

        "Text": "VX nerve gas was first developed in the United Kingdom in the 1950s as a highly toxic and deadly chemical warfare agent. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the formula has been replicated by various countries, including the United States, Russia, Syria, and Iraq. Here's what we know about VX nerve agent:\n\nVX is an oily liquid with an amber color, but it is odorless and tasteless. As a nerve agent, VX is chemically similar to pesticides but much more potent. In fact, it is the most toxic and deadly of all nerve agents, including Sarin, which was developed in Germany in 1938 as a pesticide. Due to its extreme lethality, VX is considered a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nWhen inhaled as a vapor, VX is the quickest and deadliest form of the agent. As a liquid, it can be released into a water supply or used to contaminate food, posing a significant threat to human life. Like all nerve agents, VX works by disrupting a vital enzyme, ultimately leading to respiratory failure and death.\n\nVX is not only the deadliest nerve agent but also the most persistent in the environment. It evaporates slowly, especially in cold conditions, making it a long-term threat. The symptoms of VX exposure vary depending on the amount of the agent ingested, with immediate effects ranging from convulsions and loss of consciousness to paralysis and death due to respiratory failure. Smaller, non-fatal doses can cause a range of symptoms, including increased heart rate, blurred vision, nausea, diarrhea, drooling, pain, and weakness. Small doses of the toxic gas VX can cause confusion and drowsiness, even in small quantities. Fortunately, antidotes are available for exposure to VX, and they are most effective when administered immediately. Is VX banned? Yes, it is prohibited as a chemical weapon under several international agreements, including the 1925 Geneva Protocol and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. The 1925 Geneva Protocol was established in response to the use of poisonous gas in World War I, and it was later expanded by the 1993 Convention to include a ban on the development, production, stockpiling, retention, and transfer of chemical weapons. According to the Chemical Weapons Convention, VX is classified as a Schedule 1 chemical, which means it poses a high risk to the convention and is rarely used for peaceful purposes. Signatories to the Convention are only permitted to possess small quantities of Schedule 1 chemicals for research, medical, pharmaceutical, or defensive purposes. Both the US and Russia have previously admitted to possessing stockpiles of VX and are obligated to destroy them under the Convention. When was VX first used? It was deployed during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. VX is part of the same family of toxic substances as Sarin, which was used in the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway that killed 12 people and sickened over 5,500 commuters. Due to its relatively simple production process, VX can be made in a reasonably sophisticated laboratory. According to CNN military analyst Rick Francona, \"Any country with a sophisticated chemical weapons program can produce VX. The formula has been around since the 1950s, so it's not a new discovery – it just requires the political will and determination to build the weapon.\" ",

However, she broke her silence 24 hours later with a tweet and video message. Dressed in a pink blouse with a \"pussy bow\" design, Jenner addressed the camera directly. \"I have a message for President Trump from one Republican to another,\" she said, holding up her hand as if on a phone. \"This is a disaster, and you can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\" In June, when Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee, Jenner told STAT that she believed he would be better for women than Hillary Clinton. \"Many people view the Democrats as more supportive of LGBTQ issues,\" she said. \"However, Trump seems to be very supportive of women and the LGBTQ community, particularly in the wake of the North Carolina bathroom issue, where he backed the community. Although there are many unknowns about Trump's stance, with Hillary, you know what you're getting in terms of LGBTQ support.\" Jenner was spotted attending an inauguration eve dinner at Washington's Union Station alongside House Speaker Paul Ryan. \"Republicans need help understanding LGBTQ issues, and I'm here to help,\" she tweeted. As a transgender woman who publicly came out in 2015, Jenner documented her life after transition in the E! docuseries \"I am Cait.\" The show often tackled political issues, with Jenner frequently discussing transgender rights and featuring LGBT activists in nearly every episode. Her video message also included a message for transgender kids and bullies, with a dig at Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \"I want to send a message to the transgender youth of America: you are making progress. Although it may not feel like it every day, you are on the path to achieving full freedom and acceptance nationwide, and it will be a bipartisan effort. To support this cause, I encourage you to visit the National Center for Transgender Equality and make your voices heard in Washington.\n\n\"To the bullies who target vulnerable individuals, including transgender youth and women, I say: your actions are misguided and weak. Instead of picking on others, you should focus on addressing your own insecurities.\n\n\"I'm not the only one speaking out against this policy. Celebrities like Jackie Evancho, who has a transgender sister, and Ellen DeGeneres have also expressed their support for the transgender community. Jackie Evancho has even asked for a meeting with the President, while Ellen DeGeneres has encouraged everyone to know that we will continue to fight for the rights of transgender individuals.\" ",

        "Text": "Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, a staunch Trump supporter, stopped short of calling for Congress to subpoena President Trump's tax returns. Gaetz, who campaigned with Trump over the weekend and held a town hall meeting at the Oops Bowling Alley in Pensacola, surprised the audience by saying, \"Donald Trump should release his tax returns.\" During the meeting, Donna Waters, a 56-year-old lawyer from Pensacola, became emotional as she pressed Gaetz for an answer. Waters, who claimed to be a descendant of an immigrant who arrived in Jamestown in 1607, stated that her family has a long history of military service, including fighting in every major US war. She said, \"Whenever there's a threat to this country, my family has stepped forward,\" and then referred to the allegations of Russian interference in the government. Waters asked Gaetz, \"You're on the Judiciary Committee, you've said you'll investigate the Russian allegations. Will you call for the release of President Trump's income tax returns?\" The crowd erupted in shouts of \"Yes or no!\" before Gaetz took the microphone again and said, \"If you hear me out, you'll like my answer.\" He then called for Trump's tax returns, receiving some rare applause from the crowd, which was otherwise upset over Gaetz's stance on issues like abolishing the Environmental Protection Agency. During his presidential campaign, Trump made history by becoming the first major-party nominee since 1972 to refuse to release his tax returns, citing ongoing IRS audits and promising to do so once the audits were complete. However, last month, Trump's top adviser Kellyanne Conway revealed that the President has no intention of releasing his tax returns, citing ongoing business advice urging him not to disclose the documents. Meanwhile, at a town hall meeting in Florida, protesters booed, chanted, and jeered Congressman Matt Gaetz, with some shouting \"Impeach Trump!\" when a questioner asked if he would vote to impeach the President. Gaetz responded by saying he doesn't agree with Trump on every issue, but he supports the President and will stand by him. Throughout the event, Gaetz engaged directly with the protesters, who occasionally interrupted him with shouts and chants. At one point, a constituent confronted him about his bill to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, prompting protesters to shout \"Your last term!\" as Gaetz walked away. Gaetz also took steps to control access to his earlier events, holding a meeting with constituents in a back room of a restaurant with limited access. Later, he was escorted past a crowd of over 100 protesters by sheriff's deputies and members of Bikers for Trump, who claimed to be providing security. ",

        "Text": "Leicester City's manager, Claudio Ranieri, who took the helm in July 2015, guided the team to an astonishingly successful season, defying 5,000-to-1 odds to win the league title. However, the club's recent domestic results have put their Premier League status in jeopardy, prompting the Board to reluctantly decide that a change in leadership is necessary for the team's long-term interests. Ranieri was honored with The Best FIFA Men's Coach award just last month for his remarkable achievement. \"This has been the most difficult decision we've made in nearly seven years since King Power acquired the club,\" said Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, the club's vice chairman. \"But we must prioritize the club's future over personal sentiment, no matter how strong it may be.\" Leicester City's fairy tale story has not continued into this season, with the team now just a point away from the relegation zone, which would see them drop to a lower league next season - a feat not achieved by a defending champion since Manchester City 79 years ago. Ranieri's dismissal sent shockwaves through the football world, with widespread condemnation from fans, rival managers, and pundits alike. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho paid tribute to Ranieri on Instagram, garnering over 100,000 likes in just three hours. \"CHAMPION OF ENGLAND and FIFA MANAGER OF THE YEAR sacked... keep smiling AMICO. Nobody can delete the history you wrote,\" the post read. Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand expressed his shock, while ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid striker Michael Owen called the decision a \"total and utter disgrace.\" Owen tweeted, \"I've lost a lot of love for the beautiful game today. The players and fans of Leicester have been massively let down.\" Gary Lineker, a former England national team captain and Leicester's most prominent ex-player, described the move as \"inexplicable, unforgivable, and gut-wrenchingly sad.\" Leicester City has announced that its board will begin searching for a new manager and will refrain from making any further comments until the process is complete.

        "Text": "North Korea has lashed out at its only significant ally, China, accusing it of \"following the US's lead\" after China announced it would no longer import coal from the country. Without directly naming China, North Korea's official state news agency, KCNA, stated that a \"neighboring country\" had taken \"inhumane steps\" to block trade. In response, the Global Times, a state-sanctioned tabloid, fired back, saying that the ban had \"left Pyongyang in a state of pain and fury.\" The Global Times added that China is accustomed to handling sensitive issues with North Korea, just as it does with the US administration, and will always approach such issues with confidence. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded more calmly, stating that it is willing to work with North Korea to promote the \"healthy and sound development\" of their bilateral relations. China announced on Saturday that it would halt all coal imports from North Korea by the end of 2017, following Pyongyang's recent missile test. Analysts believe this move indicates that Beijing has had enough of the Pyongyang regime. Coal is North Korea's primary export and a vital source of foreign currency for its fragile economy, with most of its exported coal being shipped to China, its main ally and economic benefactor. According to KCNA, China is \"dancing to the tune of the US\" while trying to justify its actions, claiming that they are meant to curb North Korea's nuclear program rather than harm the livelihoods of its people. China's Ministry of Commerce described the decision to ban coal imports from North Korea as \"utterly childish,\" stating that it was made to comply with a UN Security Council resolution that China helped draft and pass last November. The resolution, which imposed some of the toughest sanctions yet on North Korea, aimed to reduce coal imports by 62%, according to Kevin Gray, a reader in international studies at the University of Sussex in the UK. Gray notes that the ban could also be seen as a form of \"payoff\" for US President Donald Trump's recent acceptance of the One China policy, as Trump has repeatedly urged China to take a tougher stance on North Korea. In an interview with Reuters, Trump acknowledged China's significant influence over North Korea, stating, \"China has tremendous control over North Korea and could solve the problem.\" However, analysts suggest that Trump may overestimate China's ability to control its neighbor, given the strained relations between Pyongyang and Beijing since Kim Jong Un took power. Kim's purge of government officials with ties to China and the murder of his older brother in Malaysia, who was living in China and advocated for Chinese-style economic reforms, have likely further deteriorated ties between the two countries. \"Despite China's latest sanctions, North Korea remained calm, insisting that the ban would have little impact on its nuclear weapons program. According to the KCNA report, it is 'childish' to believe that a few dollars would deter the DPRK from producing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\"",

The interviewer asked, \"It seems that Obama's organization is involved in organizing some of these protests against you. Do you think President Obama is behind it, and if so, is that a violation of the unwritten code of conduct for presidents?\" Trump replied, \"I think he is behind it. I also think it's politics, that's just the way it is.\" He then discussed the leaks that have disrupted his first month in office, saying, \"You never know what's really going on behind the scenes. You might be right, or possibly right, but you never really know.\" Trump suggested that Obama's people are involved in the protests and that some of the leaks may be coming from the same group, which he described as a serious threat to national security. However, he also acknowledged that this is just politics, and it's likely to continue. Trump did not provide any evidence to support his claim in the clip released by Fox News on Monday night. CNN has reached out to Obama's office for comment. A coalition of groups, including Organizing For Action, the SEIU, MoveOn.org, and the Center for American Progress, have been working to help with grassroots organizing around GOP town halls. Organizing for Action, a group formed from Obama's campaign organization, has 14 professional organizers who are teaching local activists how to effectively voice their opposition to the GOP's top agenda items. \"In an interview with Fox News earlier this month, Trump attributed reports of his conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia to leaks from individuals who served under his predecessor, President Obama. Trump's administration has struggled with a persistent problem of internal leaks to the media, a issue he has repeatedly criticized since taking office.

According to sources, Trump had given his blessing for the move before it was carried out by Press Secretary Sean Spicer last Friday. When CNN reached out to Spicer, he denied that Trump was involved in the decision, claiming that he had not been informed about the gaggle and had not discussed it with anyone. Trump met with regional media outlets on Friday, but CNN and other news outlets were excluded from attending an off-camera press briefing that was attended by hand-picked reporters. Meanwhile, Politico reported that Spicer was cracking down on leaks from the White House, where staffers were even asked to surrender their phones for a \"phone check\" at one point. Sources also revealed that Trump and his top advisors were aware of Spicer's efforts to contact intelligence chairmen and government officials in an attempt to counter news stories about Russian links. The sources noted that Spicer has gained higher standing within the West Wing in recent weeks, having proven his loyalty to Trump by carrying out orders without question. One person close to the situation described Spicer as the \"enforcer\" of the administration's policies.  ",

        "Text": "A statement released by the firm on Monday evening confirmed that PwC managing partner Brian Cullinan mistakenly handed the backup envelope for Actress in a Leading Role to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway instead of the envelope for Best Picture. According to the statement, once the error occurred, the protocols for correcting it were not followed quickly enough by Cullinan or his partner, Martha Ruiz. As a result, \"Moonlight\" was eventually crowned the best picture winner. Ruiz and Cullinan, the two employees responsible for managing the envelopes containing the names of Oscar winners, had alternated handing envelopes to presenters from opposite sides of the stage during the ceremony. In a statement, PwC acknowledged that it had failed to uphold the integrity of the awards process, saying, \"For the past 83 years, the Academy has entrusted PwC with the integrity of the awards process during the ceremony, and last night we failed the Academy.\"\n\nThe Academy also released a statement on Monday evening, apologizing to the cast and crew of \"La La Land\" and \"Moonlight\" whose experience was affected by the error. The statement praised the \"tremendous grace\" displayed by those involved and apologized to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, filmmakers, and fans worldwide. The Academy added that it had spent the night and day investigating the circumstances and would determine what actions to take going forward, stating that it is \"unwaveringly committed to upholding the integrity of the Oscars and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\"\n\nThe controversy surrounding the mistake comes after it was revealed that Cullinan had tweeted a photo of Emma Stone with her new Oscar shortly before the mistake was made. The tweet, which has since been deleted, showed Stone smiling with her award backstage at 9:05 p.m. on Sunday. PWC, a company responsible for tabulating Oscar results, issued a statement apologizing for the mistake and said they were investigating how it occurred. The company's tweet, which is still available on Google's cached page, was posted just minutes before presenters Dunaway and Beatty were given the envelope containing the already announced best actress results. As of Monday evening, PWC had not responded to CNN's request for comment. In a related article, it was noted that this was not the first time an envelope mix-up had occurred at the Oscars. In 1964, Sammy Davis Jr. was given the wrong envelope and accidentally announced the winner of a different category. PWC has implemented various measures to prevent such mistakes, including printing the category names on the outside of the envelopes in large text to prevent confusion. However, it's worth noting that this year's envelope design was changed to red paper with gold lettering, which may have been harder to read in dim backstage lighting. Photos taken during the ceremony confirmed that Dunaway and Beatty had the wrong envelope on stage. Dunaway, who announced \"La La Land\" as the winner of best picture, has declined to comment on the incident. After the envelopes containing the winners' names are filled, they are sealed by the only two people who know the results beforehand - Ruiz and Cullinan. Two sets of envelopes are prepared, and Ruiz and Cullinan are responsible for transporting them to the ceremony, accompanied by security personnel. As an added precaution, Ruiz and Cullinan commit the winners' names to memory, enabling them to respond swiftly if a wrong name is announced or to share the winner with presenters if something goes awry with the envelopes. This protocol was put to the test in 2017, when Sharon Stone and Quincy Jones accidentally handed the wrong envelope to the first winner during a presentation. Fortunately, the PwC representative on site was able to discreetly inform Jones of the correct winner offstage. The mistake was acknowledged on stage by three \"La La Land\" producers before the correct winner, \"Moonlight\", was announced, ultimately taking home three Oscars. Despite the error, \"La La Land\" still earned five Academy Awards.",

According to police, the women applied a highly toxic VX nerve agent to Kim's face before fleeing the scene. Kim died en route to the hospital just 20 minutes later. Malaysia's Attorney General, Mohamed Apandi Ali, announced that the women will be formally charged on Wednesday. In Malaysia, murder can carry the death penalty. Aisyah has claimed that she did not intend to kill Kim, telling Indonesian officials that she believed she was participating in a prank show and was using baby oil on his face.

A third suspect, Ri Jong Chol, a North Korean citizen, remains in custody.

The officials are believed to have been executed for making false reports to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee.\n\nThe State Security Ministry, which is responsible for North Korea's intelligence service, prison camps, and domestic surveillance, is at the center of the controversy. The ministry is accused of making false reports to Kim Jong Un, which led to the executions of the officials.\n\nLawmaker Lee Cheol-woo, who was present during the briefing, added that the ministry controls and monitors the public and party officials, and that false reports were made to Kim Jong Un. The dictator was reportedly furious by this finding and ordered the execution of the five officials and the removal of a statue of his father, Kim Jong Il, from the Ministry's grounds as punishment.\n\nThe US Treasury has accused Kim Won Hong of directing and managing activities in the prison camps, including beatings, forced starvation, sexual assault, forced abortions, and infanticide. The Ministry for State Security reports directly to Kim Jong Un. In January, Kim Jong Un fired Kim Won Hong, one of his top officials, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. As Minister of State Security, Kim Won Hong was responsible for overseeing North Korea's notorious prison camps, rooting out spies, and conducting counterespionage operations abroad. According to Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee, Kim Won Hong was punished for human rights abuses committed during interrogations at the State Security Department and other offenses.\n\nA report released in 2016 claims that Kim Jong Un has ordered the execution of 340 people since taking power in 2011. The report, \"The misgoverning of Kim Jong Un's five years in power,\" by the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean think tank, details how the North Korean leader uses executions to maintain his grip on power. Of those killed, approximately 140 were senior officials in the government, military, and ruling Korean Worker's Party.\n\nThe regime has also used gruesome methods of execution in the past. In May 2015, Kim Jong Un had his Defense Minister, Hyon Yong Chol, killed with an anti-aircraft gun at a military school in Pyongyang, in front of an audience. According to Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, the execution would have torn the victim's body apart. Kim Jong Un ensured that the Defense Minister's family was present to witness the execution.\n\nThe article concludes by questioning whether Kim Jong Un is a madman or a mastermind, highlighting his brutal methods of maintaining power.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group, reported that al-Masri was killed on Sunday in a missile strike that targeted his vehicle near al-Mastoumeh village in Idlib. Several Syrian opposition activists also confirmed that al-Masri was killed in a missile strike. Abdallah al-Muhaysini, a senior member of Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, paid tribute to al-Masri in a eulogy posted on his official Telegram channel, saying, \"May Allah accept Abu al-Khayr in His heaven.

        "Text": "China has made a significant shift away from its decades-long one-child policy, which previously imposed harsh penalties, including fines and forced abortions, on families having more than one child. According to Wang Peian, vice-minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, the commission is exploring \"birth rewards and subsidies\" for second children, as reported by China Daily on Tuesday. Wang made this announcement during a meeting of the China Social Welfare Academy, a Chinese non-governmental organization that closely collaborates with the government. However, a spokesperson for the organization declined to comment on Wang's speech to CNN. The decision to offer incentives for second children was partly prompted by a 2015 survey conducted by the NHFPC, which found that 60% of families were hesitant to have a second child due to financial constraints. China abolished its one-child policy in October 2015, allowing couples nationwide to have two children. Since then, birth rates have increased, but the government aims to meet higher birth rate targets as the population ages. Lu Jiehua, a sociology professor at Peking University, views financial incentives for a second child as a \"positive signal.\" However, the success of such incentives will depend on the government's ability to cover the increasing costs of living and education in China. \"The financial incentives would require more effort from other government agencies to cover the cost of raising a child, which is more important than giving birth,\" Lu emphasized. The one-child policy was introduced in 1979 in response to concerns about a rapid population growth following the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s. China's fertility rate plummeted sharply, dropping from nearly six births per woman between 1960 and 1965 to 1.5 per woman between 1995 and 2014. In response, the government launched a two-child policy in 2016 as part of a program to boost the declining birth rate, particularly due to China's rapidly aging population and looming shortage of working-age residents. With over 114 million people aged 65 or older, and an expected 90 million retirees in the next three decades, China is facing a significant labor shortage. By 2030, the government warns that China will have the world's oldest population, with over 400 million people aged 60 or older.\n\nWhile the two-child policy has shown some success, with or without subsidies, in increasing the birth rate, there are still challenges to building a robust workforce. According to experts, many women of childbearing age in China were raised under the one-child policy and may be less inclined to have children, let alone a second pregnancy. \"It's difficult to change their mindset,\" said Lu, citing the long-term impact of strict family planning policies. Experts predict that the effects of the two-child policy won't be fully felt until the new babies are old enough to join the workforce. ",

        "Text": "President Trump's inaugural address on January 20 seemed to echo the divisive tone of his campaign, but his remarks on Capitol Hill surprisingly resembled those of his predecessors. Critics may argue that, despite the rhetoric, Trump's words didn't stray far from his most controversial plans. However, his nods to traditional presidential tropes created an intriguing contrast. Let's compare his inaugural addresses from then and now.\n\nOn prosperity, Trump's words were starkly different. Then, he said, \"For too long, a small group in our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost... while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\" In contrast, his current message is one of unity, stating, \"While we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\"\n\nOn unity, Trump's tone shifted dramatically. Then, he famously declared, \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\" Now, he's emphasizing unity, saying, \"That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\"\n\nRegarding globalization, Trump's views have also evolved. Then, he criticized the US for making other countries rich while its own wealth disappeared, saying, \"We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\" Now, he's touting the benefits of international cooperation, stating, \"America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\"\n\nFinally, on the American dream, Trump's message has changed significantly. Then, he lamented the decline of the middle class, saying, \"The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.\" Now, he's promoting a sense of optimism, declaring, \"A new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\" Original: \"We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action -- constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\"\n\nRewritten: \"We demand accountability from our leaders, rejecting empty rhetoric and instead seeking results-driven individuals who can effectively address the pressing issues facing our nation.\"\n\nOriginal: \"Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\"\n\nRewritten: \"To overcome the complex problems we face, we must transcend partisan divisions and tap into the resilient American spirit that has consistently guided us through times of adversity and propelled us towards a brighter future.\" ",

        "Text": "Sixty-six Democratic women representatives and delegates who make up the House Democratic Women's Working Group wore white clothing, paying homage to the suffragette movement of the early 1900s, where supporters wore white to represent purity. According to Florida Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel, the group's chair, they wore white to unite against the Trump administration's attempts to roll back women's progress in the last century and to continue advocating for women's advancement. The members' white attire represents their support for Planned Parenthood, affordable healthcare, reproductive rights, equal pay, paid leave, affordable childcare, and lives free from fear and violence.\n\nIn a tweet, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi expressed her support for the movement, saying, \"Tonight, our Democratic #WomenWearWhite in support of women's rights -- in spite of a @POTUS who doesn't!\" Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican Conference, responded by calling for unity, stating, \"I think this is an important time for us to be coming together. Typically, when a president is elected, you have that coming together as a country, which we haven't had, and I'm hopeful that people will listen to his message tonight and that they'll be willing to come together, find the common ground, so that we can do the important work that the people expect us to do.\"\n\nThe color white has become a symbol of celebrating women in politics throughout history, with many notable instances of women wearing white to represent their unity and solidarity. In 2016, a social media movement called #WearWhiteToVote emerged on Election Day as a nod to the suffragettes, who bravely fought for women's right to vote. On the night of the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton made a powerful statement by donning a white suit as she accepted the presidential nomination. Since President Trump's inauguration, many women who disagree with his policies have been organizing against him, spearheading global women's marches in January and planning further protests in the months ahead.

        "Text": "The White House delayed the announcement of the revised travel ban until late Tuesday night, after Trump's speech received widespread positive reviews for its optimistic and unifying tone. This decision was likely influenced by the desire to avoid undercutting the favorable coverage, as the administration had originally planned to sign the executive order the following day. According to an official, the administration wanted the executive order to have its own \"moment\" and not be overshadowed by the president's speech. The sudden change in plans occurred as Trump and his top advisors returned to the White House after his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump's initial executive order, signed a week after his inauguration, had banned citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US and temporarily suspended the entry of all refugees. However, a federal court issued a temporary stay, which was later upheld by a federal appeals court, halting the implementation of the travel ban. The new travel ban, expected to be signed soon, will exclude legal permanent residents and existing visa holders from the ban entirely, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. The document is still subject to change, but it is expected to make significant revisions, including excluding legal permanent residents and those with validly issued visas from the ban. Additionally, the new order is likely to revise or exclude language prioritizing the refugee claims of certain religious minorities.\n\nIn Munich, Germany, earlier this month, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly promised a \"phased-in\" approach to minimize disruption when implementing the revised travel ban. The remaining aspects of the new executive order are yet to be revealed, particularly with regards to refugees. Specifically, it is unclear what will happen to the 120-day suspension of the refugee program, whether Syrian nationals will still be indefinitely barred, and whether the cap on the number of refugees will be changed. The initial executive order capped the number of refugees at 50,000 for fiscal year 2017. Two sources expect the President to formally revoke the earlier executive order, despite earlier statements from White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggesting the two orders would coexist on a \"dual track.\" The administration may argue that the legal challenges to the original executive order are moot, but those challenging the order tell CNN that the legal battles are likely to continue even after the new order is signed. According to ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, exempting lawful permanent residents and current visa holders will not address the core legal issue - that the ban was motivated by religious discrimination, as evidenced by the President's repeated calls for a Muslim ban. Gelernt notes that the discriminatory intent cannot be removed simply by modifying a few words or making legal adjustments. ",

Dressed in white to honor women's suffrage, Pelosi shook her head and pursed her lips in disapproval. Other Democrats, such as Rep. Jackie Speier, unequivocally rejected the idea of repealing Obamacare, giving it a thumbs-down. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan appreciated President Trump's reference to negotiators needing to secure better deals to repair the nation's infrastructure, a topic dear to the President's heart. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Rep. Keith Ellison maintained somber faces when the President mentioned crime in inner cities, while the President enjoyed the full support of Republican leaders Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Steve Scalise on his \"America first\" agenda. The half-and-half crowd, a standard feature of Joint Sessions of Congress, was on full display, with Republicans largely backing President Trump's views on immigration and Democrats displaying less enthusiasm. However, there were moments that brought the crowd to their feet, including support for the troops and their families. Carryn Owens, the wife of Ryan Owens, a Navy Seal killed in a raid in Yemen, received a prolonged standing ovation of over two minutes.  ",

        "Text": "During his confirmation hearings, Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not mention his meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, despite stating that he knew of no contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. A Justice Department official maintains that Sessions did not intentionally mislead senators during his confirmation. The Washington Post was the first to report on Sessions' meetings with Kislyak.\n\nKislyak, the Russian ambassador, is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and recruiters in Washington, according to current and former senior US government officials. However, Russian officials dispute this characterization.\n\nSessions met with Kislyak twice: once in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention and again in September in his office, when he was a member of the Senate Armed Services committee.\n\nAs an early Trump supporter and regular campaign surrogate, Sessions was well-positioned to discuss campaign-related issues with Kislyak. However, Sessions swiftly denied any such discussions, stating in a statement, \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\"\n\nIn response to the news, key Democratic lawmakers immediately called for Sessions' resignation. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi characterized Sessions' earlier comments as \"apparent perjury\" and demanded his resignation.\n\nThe potential connection between Kislyak and Russian spying is one reason why former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's interactions with Kislyak and his failure to disclose their discussions raised concerns among intelligence officials. During his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, Sessions was asked about Russia and responded that he \"did not have communications with the Russians.\" A spokesperson for Senator Sessions, Sarah Isgur Flores, defended his testimony, stating that there was no misinformation provided to Congress. According to Flores, Sessions was asked about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign, not about meetings he took as a senator and member of the Armed Services Committee. In fact, Sessions had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors last year, including those from the UK, South Korea, Japan, Poland, India, China, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Russia, as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee.\n\nA Justice Department official confirmed the meetings, noting that Sessions met with the ambassadors in his capacity as a senator on the Armed Services Committee. The White House also issued a statement, saying that this was just another attempt by partisan Democrats to attack the Trump Administration. The statement emphasized that Sessions met with the ambassador in an official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is consistent with his testimony.\n\nIn response to the report, Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, called for Sessions' resignation. Cummings stated that there is no longer any doubt that a truly independent commission is needed to investigate potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. It is unacceptable that even after Michael Flynn was fired for concealing his conversations with Russia, Sessions would keep his own conversations with Russian officials for several weeks.\n\nCummings also criticized Sessions' claim during his confirmation hearing that he had no communications with Russia, calling it \"demonstrably false.\" Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, who asked Sessions about Russia during his confirmation hearing, stated that if the reports of Sessions' contacts with Kislyak were true, then Sessions' response was \"at best misleading.\" Senator Franken stated, \"It's now clearer than ever that the Attorney General cannot, in good faith, oversee an investigation into the Trump-Russia connection at the Department of Justice and the FBI, and he must recuse himself immediately.\"\n\nThe news about Sessions' contacts with Kislyak came as a report from the New York Times revealed that officials in the Obama administration had shared information throughout government about potential Russian contacts with Trump's associates and interference in the 2016 election. According to the report, these officials took this step to preserve the information after Obama left office.\n\nRegarding the Obama administration's efforts, Eric Schultz, Obama's spokesman, told CNN that the situation was serious, as evidenced by President Obama's call for a review and the US response. Schultz explained that when the intelligence community conducts a comprehensive review, it is standard practice for a significant amount of information to be compiled and documented.\n\nTwo days before Trump's inauguration, the State Department sent a batch of classified documents related to Russian attempts to meddle in elections worldwide to Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin's spokesman, Sean Bartlett, told CNN that the senator had received the documents on request and that they were shared with both Republican and Democratic committee staffers.",

        "Text": "\"Lindsey Graham, a senator who was a strong supporter of Jeff Sessions' appointment as Attorney General, said that Sessions 'cannot make this decision' regarding the Russian ambassador meetings. However, Graham sidestepped a question about a Washington Post report that Sessions had two meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying he needed more information. Graham told CNN's Dana Bash at a town hall event with Senator John McCain that he wants to know the facts about any contacts between the Trump campaign, the Clinton campaign, and Russian officials. 'If there were contacts, they may be legitimate; they may be okay. I want to know what happened,' Graham said. The meetings between Sessions and Kislyak took place in July and September, when Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Justice Department had previously disclosed the meetings, stating that Sessions did not mislead senators during his confirmation hearing when he said he knew of no contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. As a senator, Sessions was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign and regularly appeared on behalf of the candidate. Sessions' spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, defended the Attorney General's answers to Congress, saying that he was only asked about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign, not about his meetings as a senator. 'Last year, the Senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including ambassadors from Britain, Korea, Japan, Poland, India, China, Canada, Australia, Germany, and Russia,' Isgur Flores stated. Both McCain and Graham criticized Trump's approach to Russia and its President, Vladimir Putin, with Graham saying that Trump has a 'blind spot' when it comes to Russia. 'The bottom line is that Putin is disrupting democracy everywhere,' Graham said.\" Senator McCain, who has advocated for a special committee to investigate Russia's interference in the US election, emphasized that the country's efforts demand greater attention. \"Make no mistake, the Russians' attempts to manipulate our election could have had devastating consequences for democracy,\" he stated. \"That's why it's crucial we devote a significant amount of attention to the Russians and their activities in Europe, particularly their efforts to influence the outcome of the French election, which they are attempting to do using cyber means.\" Additionally, Sergey Kislyak, who is viewed by US intelligence as one of Russia's most senior spies and spy-recruiters in Washington, according to current and former senior US government officials.

During his confirmation hearings in January, Sessions failed to disclose these conversations with Sergey Kislyak, despite the fact that some Americans viewed Russia as an adversary due to numerous reports of its interference in the US election. Here's how Sessions responded to questions about interacting with Russian officials during his confirmation hearings:\n\nSenator Al Franken asked, \"If there was any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign, what would you do?\" Sessions replied, \"I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at times, and I did not have communications with the Russians.\" (January 10)\n\nSenator Patrick J. Leahy asked in a questionnaire, \"Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\" Sessions responded, \"No.\" (January 10)\n\nIt was later revealed that Sessions, as a senator and top Trump surrogate, met with the Russian ambassador twice: in July at the Republican National Convention and in September during his membership on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

However, Russia's foreign affairs ministry has denied these allegations. Interestingly, Kislyak is the same individual who had a meeting with Mike Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, before the President took office. Flynn ultimately resigned from his position after just 23 days, citing his contacts with Russia as the reason. ",

The tweets violate French law, which prohibits the distribution of violent images and inciting terrorism. Parliamentary President Antonio Tajani announced that a \"clear majority\" of members voted in favor of lifting Le Pen's immunity. As a member of the European Parliament, Le Pen enjoys immunity for freedom of speech, but this can be lifted if requested by a member state's authorities. Under French law, distributing violent images can result in a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a fine of up to 15,000 ($79,000). The lifting of Le Pen's immunity only relates to this specific case, and any further action is unlikely to occur before the first round of voting on April 23. Le Pen is already under scrutiny over allegations that her European Parliament staff were paid for non-existent jobs. Initially, Le Pen admitted that her staff had been paid while not working, according to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). However, she later denied making this statement.  ",

        "Text": "The outings of the two men, both 32, were often so brief that they were back home with their families before anyone had a chance to ask where they had been. Despite the brevity, the bar remained a sanctuary where they could laugh and unwind after a long day's work, surrounded by familiar faces and a sense of comfort. However, for Madasani, the memory of that night is now tainted with a sense of regret and longing. \"I just wish we hadn't gone there that night,\" he said, his words heavy with sorrow.\n\nOn the evening of the University of Kansas basketball game, which was playing on the big screen TV, Madasani and Kuchibhotla were sitting on the patio, engaged in their own conversation and laughter. \"We were having a good time,\" Madasani recalled. But their tranquility was disrupted just minutes into their first beers, around 6:15pm, when a stranger approached them. The man, who was unknown to them, pointed a finger at them and Madasani sensed immediately that something was amiss. \"He had this angry look on his face, and you could tell something was wrong,\" Madasani said.\n\nMadasani didn't respond to the stranger, but Kuchibhotla did, politely trying to diffuse the situation. \"He said, 'No sir, we are here legally, we are on H1B, we are from India,'\" Madasani recalled. After the exchange, Madasani got up and went back into the bar, feeling surprised and uneasy about the random encounter. \"Typically, those things happen after a few hours when people have gotten to know you,\" he said. \"You've been hanging around for a while, and then they come up and start a conversation.\" But this encounter was different, and it would have far-reaching consequences. It was just before half past six when this incident occurred. The attack came out of nowhere; we hadn't spoken to the stranger or said anything that could have provoked him. Madasani and his friend were speaking English, their second language, rather than their native Telugu. Kuchibhotla made a point to speak English in public, Madasani noted. The stranger left the patio at 6:45 p.m., and the group began to relax, enjoying the fading sunlight. \"It was a peaceful atmosphere,\" Madasani recalled. \"You're in that relaxed zone, and we see him leaving. Everyone on the patio was watching because he was disturbing not just us, but everyone around us.\" The tranquility was short-lived. Within 30 minutes, the friends learned that the man had returned with a gun. Madasani remembered how events unfolded quickly, leaving little time to react. \"I heard a loud pop right next to my ear,\" he said, describing the sound of the gunshot. He then dropped to the ground and started crawling. \"I just wanted to survive,\" Madasani said, thinking about his unborn child with his wife. As he crawled towards the door, he tried to stand, but it was then that he realized he had been injured in his leg. He fell to the ground once, managed to make his way to the patio, and fell again. \"It was just too much pain, and a lot of blood,\" he said. On the patio, patrons tended to Madasani's injury, tying a shirt over his leg as he lay there. As he looked on, he saw his friend, Kuchibhotla, motionless on the ground. The alleged shooter, Adam Purinton, 51, remains in jail after being arrested hours after the incident at an Applebee's restaurant in Clinton, Missouri, approximately 70 miles from Olathe. He is facing one charge of first-degree murder and two charges of attempted first-degree murder, with a bond set at $2 million. Despite the FBI's investigation, a motive for the shooting has not yet been established, and it is unclear whether the incident will be considered a federal hate crime. In the days following the shooting, Srinivas Madasani has struggled to understand why he and his friend ended up at the bar that night. \"I could have said no, but when Kuchibhotla asks you to go, you go,\" Madasani said, recalling his friend's persuasive nature. \"He was the kind of guy who didn't drink during the week because he wanted to work, and when he asks, you go.\"\n\nMadasani reflected on the events leading up to the shooting, revealing that he was the one still working that night. \"I was emailing with a coworker in California, and I could have told Srinivas that I had work to do and suggested we postpone our plans,\" he said. \"I should have done that.\" Madasani described his friend as a kind and gentle person who rarely got angry, didn't gossip, and was loved by everyone around him. \"He was the kind of guy I wanted to be, and he made me a better person,\" Madasani said.\n\nAs he grapples with the loss of his best friend, Madasani acknowledges that the violence is not an isolated incident. \"Other things happen in this country, in the world, and here in Kansas, and I can confidently say that what happened is not what this country or community believes in,\" he said. Despite receiving support from friends of different racial backgrounds, Madasani admits that the events of the past week have left him feeling unsettled. \"I still feel like this isn't reality,\" he said. \"It's still not sunk in. I still don't want to believe what's happening.\"",

        "Text": "Malaysian Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali told CNN that police lack sufficient evidence to charge Ri Jong Chol, a North Korean national. After his release, Chol will be deported back to North Korea, Ali said. The murder of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, occurred on February 13, before he was set to depart for Macau. Two women have been charged with his murder, which investigators believe was carried out by smearing the deadly nerve agent VX on his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Ri was the only North Korean to be detained in the case, although police have identified four other North Korean suspects who are believed to be back in Pyongyang. Three additional North Koreans are wanted for questioning, but Malaysian authorities say the North Korean government is not cooperating and is hindering the investigation. The suspects are thought to be hiding in Malaysia. South Korea has accused North Korea of orchestrating the murder, while North Korea has denied any involvement and blamed Seoul and Washington for attempting to destabilize its government. The brazen public killing has also strained diplomatic relations between North Korea and Malaysia. In response, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi announced that North Koreans will need to obtain a visa to enter the country starting March 6, according to Malaysia's state news agency Bernama. Currently, Malaysian nationals are the only individuals who can travel to North Korea without a visa. A diplomatic crisis unfolded when North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, declared on February 17 that his country would reject the results of an \"imposed\" autopsy on one of its citizens and demanded the immediate release of the body. Kang subsequently accused Malaysian officials of colluding with \"hostile forces\" during the investigation, prompting a stern rebuke from Malaysia. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak responded by calling Kang's statement \"completely unwarranted\" and \"demonstrating a lack of diplomatic courtesy.\" \"Malaysia will not be influenced or controlled by any other country,\" Razak emphasized. VX is a highly potent nerve agent and one of the most dangerous chemical weapons ever developed. It is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention and works by inhibiting an enzyme that regulates muscle function, leading to paralysis and suffocation. VX is lethal in doses as small as 10 milligrams. \"VX is likely the most advanced nerve agent,\" said CNN military analyst Rick Francona. \"It is likely the most lethal of all the nerve agents ever designed.\" ",

        "Text": "Threatening phone calls have been made to Jewish community centers and schools in nearly 33 US states and two provinces in Canada, with callers claiming that a bomb is hidden in one of the children's backpacks and will detonate shortly. Some of the callers made anti-Semitic statements, with one voice warning, \"The Jews will be decimated.\" The FBI and the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division are investigating possible civil rights violations. So far, there have been no reports of actual devices being found at any of the targeted locations.\n\nJewish community centers and leaders across more than a dozen states and in Canada have shared their experiences with the threatening calls. The sex of the callers varied, and the details provided were often vague, suggesting that some callers may not have known the specific locations they were targeting. At several community centers, staff members were trained to handle the calls and followed established procedures. For example, a receptionist at the Merage Jewish Community Center of Orange County in California attempted to keep a caller talking, despite the caller becoming agitated and telling the receptionist, \"You're asking too many questions.\" The receptionist continued to ask questions, trying to get more information about the bomb, but the caller provided no specific answers. In Los Angeles, Brian Greene, executive director of the Westside Jewish Community Center, described the caller's voice as \"mechanical\" and distorted, sounding like a woman but possibly not. The caller claimed there was a bomb in the building and instructed everyone to evacuate within an hour. When asked about the bomb's location, the caller replied, \"That's not important, just get everyone out of the building.\"\n\nAt the Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland, an automated bomb threat was received, warning that \"Jewish souls would be destroyed,\" according to Laurie Ehrlich, the school's director of marketing and communications. The front-desk receptionist managed to obtain a callback number from the caller, which was then given to the police.\n\nIn Maryland, the caller on January 9 to another Jewish community center sounded like an older woman, but it's possible that it was an automated message. The person who answered the call tried to engage the caller but received no response and was hung up on.\n\nThe bomb threat received on Monday at the Hebrew Day School of Ann Arbor in Michigan was made by a person who had disguised his voice, according to David Shtulman, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Ann Arbor. The caller claimed, \"There is a bomb in one of the children's backpacks and it's going to detonate shortly.\" There were no demands made and no conversation with the caller, who quickly hung up. The school received a threatening call in May 2016, which was particularly unsettling because it was the first of its kind, according to Shtulman. The caller claimed that his brother had placed a bomb in a backpack and hung up, but remained on the line when the school called him back. \"Why are you arguing with me when you should be getting out?\" the caller said, according to Shtulman.\n\nIn New York, the Jewish Community Center of Greater Buffalo in Buffalo received a bomb threat, with the caller claiming there was a bomb in the lobby. \"They evaded any questions we had for them and it was clear to us they didn't know our building specifically,\" said Rick Zakalik, the center's executive director. Zakalik addressed parents at a meeting, likening the experience to \"duck and cover\" drills from elementary school days. He noted that bomb threats are relatively rare and that Jewish institutions are often targeted.\n\nIn Connecticut, the Mandell Jewish Community Center of Greater Hartford refreshed its training to deal with bomb threats after receiving its first and only threat the day after training, said David Jacobs, the center's executive director.\n\nIn Arizona, the Tucson Jewish Community Center was able to keep the caller on the phone by asking questions, said Todd Rockoff, the center's CEO. The caller's voice was hard to make out, Rockoff said.\n\nIn Delaware, the Siegel Jewish Community Center in Wilmington received a bomb threat, but Executive Director Ivy Harlev declined to provide further details. Harlev praised the community's resilience in the face of adversity, saying, \"I can tell you that my community has been incredibly strong in the face of this adversity. This affects more than just the Jewish community.\"",

        "Text": "According to a CNN report on Tuesday, the US military is seeking to increase intelligence-gathering raids in Yemen, similar to those conducted during the first week of Donald Trump's presidency. It remains unclear whether this adjustment to the approval process will apply to these operations. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer described the discussions about the authorization process as a philosophical shift rather than a policy change. Spicer emphasized that President Trump trusts the experts in the field, saying, \"He believes these are the experts in this field.\" However, Spicer also clarified that the protocol for signing off on decisions is not changing, and that certain decisions still require the President's approval. A senior defense official noted that while the President may not be directly involved in the approval process, Defense Secretary James Mattis and senior military commanders can brief him at any time and seek his specific approval for high-risk missions. The official emphasized that the goal is to streamline the approval process for time-sensitive missions, which are fundamentally judgement calls. However, military analysts have warned that pushing decision-making authority below the President for high-risk missions could create problems. According to retired Col. Cedric Leighton, greenlighting missions without the President's direct approval poses a significant risk. \"If something goes wrong, the President would be left holding the bag, and it would be difficult for him to do that if he wasn't part of the approval process,\" Leighton said.\n\nLeighton also emphasized the importance of centralized control, stating that while it may seem appealing to some, it can lead to unintended consequences. \"If something goes terribly wrong, there will be significant political fallout, even if the President didn't directly approve or understand the details of the mission,\" he explained.\n\nFrom a military perspective, Leighton believes that the President's authority is essential, particularly for high-stakes operations. \"What you really need is a commander in chief who is involved in the approval process, especially for sensitive missions like those in Yemen,\" he said.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the White House maintained significant control over high-risk missions, such as those involving significant opposition forces, new military techniques, or specialized units like SEAL Team Six or Delta Force. According to several defense officials, President Barack Obama was cautious about these types of missions and often sought to review and approve them personally. ",

        "Text": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated at a Moscow press conference that the ambassadors are appointed to maintain relationships. He explained that these relationships are maintained through meetings, talks, and establishing contacts with officials from both the executive and legislative branches of power. Lavrov dismissed the controversy surrounding Kislyak, saying, \"I can only quote what the media said today - this all looks like a witch hunt.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, US intelligence considers Kislyak to be one of Russia's top spies and recruiters in Washington. However, Russia's Foreign Ministry has strongly denied allegations that Kislyak, the top diplomat in Washington, is a spy. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described Kislyak as a \"well-known, world-class diplomat\" who has worked with American colleagues for decades in various fields. She expressed shock at CNN's accusation that Kislyak is a Russian spy, saying, \"He was deputy minister of foreign affairs in Russia, who has communicated with American colleagues for decades in different fields, and CNN accused him of being a Russian spy... of recruiting? Oh my God!\"\n\nUS Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation related to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose two pre-election meetings with Kislyak in Washington. The meetings occurred at a time when Russia was accused of interfering in the presidential race. The pressure on Sessions to recuse himself grew as prominent Republicans broke ranks with the administration, calling for him to step down. Despite this, Trump expressed his support for Sessions shortly before the recusal announcement. Trump defended Jeff Sessions, saying that while Sessions could have been more accurate in his responses during the confirmation hearings, he did not intentionally make any misleading statements. \"Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He didn't say anything wrong. He could have been more precise, but it wasn't intentional,\" Trump stated. Trump then shifted the focus to the Democratic Party, accusing them of \"overplaying their hand\" and losing their grip on reality after losing the election. He also criticized the media for spreading \"total misinformation\" and described the leaks of classified information as a \"total witch hunt.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson, described media reports about Sessions' meetings with Kislyak as \"shameful\" and an \"attempt at total misinformation.\" She defended the role of Russian diplomats, saying that it is normal for them to make contacts with foreign officials. When asked about the characterization of Kislyak as a spy, Zakharova's colleague, Dmitry Peskov, said that there has been no official statement from US intelligence agencies confirming such allegations. Peskov also reiterated that Russia has never interfered in the domestic affairs of another country and has no plans to do so.\n\nPeskov expressed concern about the \"overly emotional environment\" surrounding the relationship between Russia and the US, saying that it was affecting the prospects of a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He noted that the negative atmosphere was building resistance to developing a relationship with Russia, which was having an obvious negative impact. Kislyak's interactions with Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, ultimately led to Flynn's dismissal last month. According to the Justice Department, Sessions met with Kislyak on two occasions in 2016: once in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention, and again in September in his Senate office, where he was a member of the Senate Armed Services committee. As a Republican senator from Alabama, Sessions campaigned on behalf of Trump throughout the 2016 presidential election. During his confirmation hearings, Sessions stated that he was unaware of any contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians, failing to mention his two meetings with Kislyak. In response to reports of these meetings, Sessions' spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, claimed that there was nothing misleading about his previous answer, as he was only asked about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign, not about his meetings as a senator. Sessions also strongly denied ever discussing campaign-related issues with anyone from Russia, stating, \"I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\" The House Intelligence Committee has recently approved a plan to investigate Russia's alleged interference in the US elections, which will involve examining contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, as well as looking into who leaked the details. Democrats have called for an independent investigation into the matter. Russia has consistently denied allegations that it meddled in the US election campaign.",

        "Text": "Kushner and Flynn met with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, at Trump Tower in December, according to a senior administration official. The official described the meeting as an \"introductory meeting\" and \"a brief, inconsequential hello\" that lasted around 10 minutes. Kislyak is a key figure in the ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the US election. Flynn was fired from his role as national security adviser after he was accused of misleading the administration about his conversations with Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has also been linked to Kislyak, and announced on Thursday that he would recuse himself from investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. The initial reports of Kushner's meeting with Kislyak came from The New Yorker, while Flynn's meeting was first reported by The New York Times. An administration official downplayed the significance of the meeting, saying it was simply an attempt to meet with key international players during the transition period. The official noted that Kushner met with dozens of other ambassadors during this time. Another national security adviser, J.D. Gordon, also revealed on Thursday that he had met with Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in July. Gordon told CNN that he, along with other national security advisers, had expressed a desire to improve relations with Russia, but emphasized that there was no inappropriate discussion about colluding with Russia to aid the Trump campaign. Gordon's statement was consistent with his previous public comments on the matter. Gordon had previously pushed for language in the GOP platform that would prevent Ukraine from being armed in its conflict with pro-Russian separatists, an effort that ultimately succeeded. However, Gordon claims he was simply advocating for a position that Trump himself had expressed, which was a desire to avoid a major war breaking out in Ukraine. In a statement to CNN, Page declined to comment on any meetings and maintained that he had never engaged in any improper activities with regards to Russia. Page did confirm that he had met with Kislyak in Cleveland, acknowledging as much in an interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes on Thursday night, stating, \"I do not deny that.\" ",

Kim Jong Nam was killed with a VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13. In addition, a request has been made through the Foreign Ministry to cooperate with Hyon Kwang Song, the second secretary at the North Korean embassy, as part of the ongoing investigation. Earlier, Ri Jong Chol, the only North Korean man detained in connection with the case, was released from custody and deported under heavy police escort. Malaysian authorities have not yet gathered sufficient evidence to charge Ri, according to the country's attorney general. Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi stated that Ri will be flown from Malaysia to Pyongyang, via Beijing, accompanied by two officials from the North Korean embassy. Malaysia's Director General of Immigration, Seri Mustafar Ali, revealed that Ri has been blacklisted from re-entering the country. North Korea has consistently denied any involvement in the murder.\n\nIn a separate development, two women, Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, have been charged with Kim's murder. Both women have pleaded not guilty and claimed they believed they were participating in a TV prank show. According to their home countries, the women maintained that they thought the substance they applied to Kim's face was a harmless substance, such as baby oil. However, Malaysian authorities have identified the substance as VX nerve agent, a deadly chemical weapon banned under international law. \"Following the application of the liquid to Kim's face by the women, he began to feel disoriented and ultimately succumbed to his injuries shortly after being transported to the hospital, according to Malaysian authorities. VX is the most toxic nerve agent in the world, and one of the most hazardous chemical weapons ever produced. It is prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention.\" ",

        "Text": "At the Scottish Conservative Party conference in Glasgow, Theresa May emphasized that there would be no benefits to Scotland becoming independent when the UK leaves the EU. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has sparked speculation that the Scottish National Party might demand a second independence referendum, following last year's referendum in which 62% of Scottish voters opted to remain in the EU. May accused the SNP of having an \"obsession\" with independence and neglecting other domestic issues, describing their focus as a \"tunnel-vision nationalism\" that prioritizes independence above all else. She vowed that the UK government would negotiate a deal with the EU that would safeguard Scottish interests after Brexit. \"I am committed to ensuring that as we leave the EU, we do so as one United Kingdom, thriving outside the EU as a single nation,\" May said. \"This means securing a deal with the EU that benefits all parts of the UK - England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland - as well as the UK as a whole.\" \n\nScotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly argued that Scotland should remain in the European Single Market even after the rest of the UK has left. In a recent speech, she criticized the UK government for disregarding Scotland's views and refusing to compromise as it prepares to trigger Article 50, initiating the formal process of leaving the EU. If Scotland fails to secure a special deal in the UK's negotiations with the EU, Sturgeon suggested that a second independence referendum would be a legitimate and necessary way to give the Scottish people a say in their future direction. \"The proposed deal would give Scotland a genuine choice about whether to remain part of the UK after Brexit, a UK that is now taking a fundamentally different path than the one envisioned in 2014. In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, 55% of voters chose to remain part of the United Kingdom. The Scottish government has recently published a report outlining ways for Scotland to maintain its current position within the single market, which ensures the free movement of goods, services, and people, even if the rest of the UK leaves the EU. However, Prime Minister May has indicated that the UK government will pursue a 'hard Brexit', which would result in the UK's withdrawal from the single market and European customs union.\" ",

        "Text": "The US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York has indicted 13 members of the MS-13 gang, also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, on charges including seven counts of murder, racketeering, attempted murder, assault, obstruction of justice, and arson. The 41-count indictment was unsealed in federal court in Central Islip, New York, on Thursday. According to US Attorney Robert L. Capers, law enforcement was determined to prevent the brutal murders from becoming cold cases. Two students, 15-year-old Nisa Mickens and 16-year-old Kayla Cuevas, were brutally beaten with baseball bats and a machete, Capers said. The girls attended Brentwood High School in Brentwood, a working-class community in Suffolk County, about 45 miles east of New York City. Initially, police believed gang involvement in the girls' deaths and the deaths of two others, whose skeletal remains were found after months of being missing. However, no arrests have been announced in the latter two cases. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Timothy Sini said, \"The Brentwood family has spent the last six months in mourning, but today marks the beginning of the healing process for this beautiful and resilient community.\" Authorities revealed that Kayla had been involved in a series of disputes with MS-13 gang members and associates months prior to her death. The altercation at Brentwood High School a week before the girls' deaths, in which Kayla and her friends were involved, was seen as a catalyst for the gang's vow to seek revenge. On September 13, gang members went on a rampage, seeking to kill rival gang members in Brentwood. According to prosecutors, the girls, who had gone for a walk that night, were spotted by gang members, including one of the indicted individuals, News 12 Long Island reported. According to authorities, the gang leaders responsible for the murders of Nisa and Kayla were also under indictment, and they gave permission for the killings. A passerby found Nisa's body on a Brentwood street on September 13, just one day before her 16th birthday. The next day, Kayla's body was discovered in the backyard of a nearby home. Suffolk County Executive Steve Sini delivered a message to the community, stating that while the loss of Nisa and Kayla can never be undone, the fact that their killers will be held accountable can bring some solace. A third Brentwood High School student, 18-year-old Jose Pena, was killed on June 3, 2016. His skeletal remains were discovered on October 17, 2016, in a wooded area used as a burial ground for MS-13 victims. Authorities believe Pena was killed because he was suspected of violating gang rules. A forensic examination revealed that Pena's bones showed signs of repeated stab wounds and beatings with a blunt force instrument. Suffolk police have taken steps to combat gang activity, including collecting intelligence on MS-13 members and creating a list of gang members to be placed under surveillance. The police have also arrested numerous gang members for various crimes. Since September 2016, 125 MS-13 members have been arrested, according to Sini. Sini vowed to eradicate MS-13 from the community, stating, \"We are going to eradicate MS-13 from these communities.\" MS-13 is one of the largest criminal organizations in the United States, with over 6,000 members operating in at least 46 states and the District of Columbia, according to federal authorities. The organization has a significant presence in El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala, with over 30,000 members operating in these countries, federal authorities said. According to the US Attorney's Office, MS-13 is the largest and most violent street gang on Long Island. Two of the suspects are US citizens, while a third is a legal permanent resident, and the remaining individuals are undocumented immigrants, said Capers. If found guilty, the defendants could face sentences ranging from life in prison to the death penalty.",

        "Text": "The Swedish government announced on Thursday that it will reintroduce compulsory military service, a move that has not been seen in the country since 2010. This time, however, the service will be gender-equal, marking a significant change in the country's military policy. Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist cited Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 as a key factor in the decision, stating that the move is a response to the new security situation created by Russia's actions. \"After Russia's annexation of Crimea against international law, and their increased military exercises near the border, we have a new security situation,\" Hultqvist said. The minister also emphasized that Sweden is strengthening its military cooperation with Finland and NATO partners, despite not being a member of the alliance. Sweden had previously suspended conscription in 2010 and instead relied on a volunteer recruitment system. However, the country's defense forces have been struggling with low numbers, with a shortage of 1,000 full-time personnel. To address this issue, the government has announced a plan to increase defense spending by $720 million over five years and aims to have 6,000 full-time members and 10,000 part-time personnel serving. Under the new plan, those born between 1999 and 2000, as well as older volunteers, will undergo testing in July to determine their eligibility for military service. Of the approximately 100,000 individuals in the correct age category, 13,000 men and women will be selected to undergo physical and psychological assessments. This marks the first time that Sweden has conscripted women. Not all individuals will be required to enlist, with only 4,000 people per year expected to be conscripted until 2019. According to Radebo, while there will be no quota system in place to ensure a specific ratio of male to female recruits, the \"gender equal\" policy for the 1999 generation is expected to lead to an increase in the number of women serving in the armed forces. The new recruits will participate in their first military exercises on January 1, 2018. Conscripts will undergo training for nine to 11 months before deciding whether to pursue a career in the military or join as a reserve soldier.\n\nRegarding the country's military activities, Radebo stated, \"We see that we have more military activities in our neighborhood, and also that the illegal annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine are certainly factors in this.\" She added, \"We react to these activities and do not speak of threats, which is why we have a parliamentary decision with 70% support behind our decision to strengthen our military capacity and increase cooperation with neighboring countries.\" Sweden, a neutral country, has recently stepped up its defensive efforts. In September, it deployed 150 troops to the island of Gotland, which is located between the mainland and several former Soviet Baltic states amid rising tensions with Russia. According to a Swedish government report, a full battalion will be established on the island by 2018. ",

Palmyra was captured by ISIS from regime forces in December after a coordinated attack by hundreds of ISIS militants in and around the city. Strategically important to both sides in Syria's more than five-year civil war, Palmyra is located in Homs province, approximately 225 kilometers (140 miles) from Raqqa, considered ISIS' headquarters in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Syrian government forces completed their operation with the assistance of Russian air power, as reported by Russia's state news agency TASS. Control over the city has repeatedly changed hands, with the regime and ISIS alternating control. Syrian forces recaptured Palmyra from ISIS in March, after it was seized by ISIS the previous May, during which ISIS began demolishing ancient ruins in the city. At a peace talk gathering in Geneva, Syrian rebel leaders refused to congratulate the regime. Nasser al-Hariri, a member of the Syrian Coalition, likened the struggle for Palmyra to watching a cartoon, stating, \"This is the second time we've seen the handover [of Palmyra] and this is obviously being used for political reasons.\" Al-Hariri added, \"If we want to follow the game of (Syrian President) Assad and Palmyra, it will be like watching Tom and Jerry.\" The Syrian army has previously claimed that capturing Palmyra would be a launchpad for expanding military operations into Raqqa and Deir Ezzor provinces. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, also confirmed Palmyra's recapture. \"According to Rami Abdulrahman, the founder of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the city was seized following intense battles between ISIS and government forces that began on Wednesday.\" ",

        "Text": "After expressing concern about WikiLeaks' release of documents allegedly revealing CIA surveillance techniques, Spicer's message became muddled. He linked the latest WikiLeaks document dump to surveillance efforts during the Obama administration, days after President Trump claimed, without evidence, that President Obama had tapped his phones during the 2016 campaign. Spicer then argued that there is a \"double standard\" when it comes to the level of outrage elicited by different leaks. In a statement, he said, \"I love WikiLeaks!\" The White House has repeatedly argued that too much attention has been devoted to the investigation into contacts between Trump campaign officials and suspected Russian operatives, and not enough to the leaks of confidential information. \"It's interesting how there's a double standard when leaks occur, and how much outrage there is,\" Spicer said. Spicer's comments came as he relayed Trump's \"concern\" about the leaks and said Americans should be \"outraged\" by the release of classified information. \"This kind of disclosure undermines our country, our security, and our well-being,\" Spicer said. Spicer's claims on Wednesday came as he faced questions about a double standard on the President's part in condemning this leak while he praised WikiLeaks' publication of emails related to his rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Trump had proclaimed, \"I love WikiLeaks!\" as he read hacked emails before crowds of cheering supporters. Spicer said there is a \"massive, massive difference\" between the two disclosures. \"There's a big difference between disclosing John Podesta's personal emails and leaking classified information,\" Spicer said. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump frequently praised WikiLeaks for releasing hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's account, many of which portrayed Hillary Clinton in a negative light. However, the US intelligence community concluded that these emails were hacked and released by Russian sources as part of a campaign to harm Clinton. Trump's comments on hacking during the campaign went beyond praising WikiLeaks, as he also applauded the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and downplayed the severity of various election-related hacks. At one point, he even urged Russia to find and release the 33,000 emails allegedly deleted from Clinton's private email server, which she used while serving as Secretary of State.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, criticized White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's claim that there was no comparison between Trump's praise of WikiLeaks' campaign-related document dumps and the recent leak of CIA documents. \"The reality is that both were wrong and both were serious threats to our national security,\" Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, arguing that the Democratic document release was part of the Russian campaign to undermine US democracy. \"Both should be condemned.\"\n\nSpicer's decision to mix politics with his condemnation of WikiLeaks' latest dump departed from the approach taken by his predecessors, who focused solely on expressing the government's concerns about leaks without drawing in tangential issues. This simpler approach was exemplified by Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary in 2010, who only commented on the government's concerns about WikiLeaks' publication of classified diplomatic cables without getting involved in political debates. \"Gibbs stated that by releasing stolen and classified documents, WikiLeaks has not only compromised the cause of human rights, but also jeopardized the safety and efforts of these individuals. He also unequivocally condemned the unauthorized disclosure of classified documents and sensitive national security information, expressing strong disapproval.\"\n\nI made some minor changes to improve the clarity and flow of the sentences, while trying to maintain the original meaning and tone. Let me know if you have any specific requests or preferences!",

He made this remark during a discussion on cybersecurity at a Boston College conference, referencing the 2013 revelations by Edward Snowden about US spy practices. Comey noted that even private communications with spouses, clergy members, or attorneys are not entirely private in America, as a judge can compel individuals to testify in court about these communications in appropriate circumstances. However, he also emphasized that Americans have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their homes, cars, and devices, which is a vital part of being an American. The government cannot invade this privacy without a valid reason, which is reviewable in court, Comey added.\n\nIn the last four months of 2016, the FBI lawfully accessed 2,800 devices recovered in criminal, terrorism, and counterintelligence investigations, but was unable to open 43% of those devices. Comey emphasized that Americans' desire for privacy and security should never be seen as mutually exclusive. \"We all value privacy. We all value security. We should never have to sacrifice one for the other,\" he said.\n\nComey's comments come amidst controversy surrounding his leadership of the FBI, including the handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and President Donald Trump's baseless accusations that President Barack Obama ordered wiretapping at Trump Tower. Comey did not address the wiretapping claim or WikiLeaks' recent claim that it obtained internal CIA documents. James Comey stated that he intends to complete his 10-year term. \"You'll have to endure my presence for approximately another 6.5 years,\" he said, \"and I would be delighted to be invited back for another term.\" ",

The home team seemed to be cruising, but just past the hour mark, Edison Cavani's volley brought PSG back into the game, leaving Barcelona needing to score three more goals, given PSG's crucial away goal. Nevertheless, with just two minutes of normal time remaining, Neymar's exquisite free-kick gave Barcelona new hope, and two goals in stoppage time completed the most incredible comeback. The final five minutes of stoppage time were almost impossible to describe. In the 91st minute, Luis Suarez, who had given Barcelona an early lead, won a penalty, which Neymar converted. With time running out, Barcelona threw everyone forward, including their goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen. And just as the game was about to end, Barcelona's sixth goal came from an unlikely source - not their star strikers Messi, Neymar, or Suarez, but defender Sergio Roberto, a product of Barcelona's youth academy born in Catalonia. Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery, who had played for the German club in their 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal on Tuesday, described the game as \"unbelievable.\" Former Bayern and Chelsea star Michael Ballack tweeted, \"That's Champions League,\" followed by a series of fire emojis. In the 2005 Champions League final, Liverpool staged an incredible comeback from 3-0 down to defeat AC Milan on penalties, but Barcelona's remarkable turnaround against Paris Saint-Germain is arguably the greatest comeback in Champions League history. Barcelona's president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, hailed the achievement as \"historic\" and said it would be remembered forever.\n\nAhead of the second leg, Barcelona coach Luis Enrique exuded quiet confidence, citing his team's recent league victories over Sporting Gijon and Celta Vigo. \"We're in good form, and we have to be confident,\" he said. \"We're in the middle of the tie, and we have nothing to lose and everything to gain. If they score four, we can score six.\"\n\nThe aftermath of the match was marked by shock and disappointment from Paris Saint-Germain, with their English Twitter feed summarizing their defeat with a single word: \"gutted\". Their website's headline for a report on the game was equally stunned, using the word \"speechless\". The Qatari owners of PSG had appointed Spanish coach Unai Emery in June 2016, hoping his tactical expertise would help the club win the Champions League. Emery had previously led Sevilla to three consecutive Europa League titles, and PSG's billion-dollar budget was expected to fuel their quest for the top prize. However, in the first leg, PSG's high-intensity press had initially left Barcelona looking subdued. PSG's fortunes didn't seem to be on their side on Wednesday, as Barcelona's second goal came courtesy of an own goal from Layvin Kurzawa, while Edinson Cavani's shot hit the post and the home side's first penalty resulted from Thomas Meunier's slip, which allowed Neymar to fall and win a foul. Despite their commanding performance and first-leg lead, the French side will be left wondering how they exited the Champions League. For more news and videos on the match, visit cnn.com/football.\n\nPSG's CEO and chairman, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, said he hadn't spoken to the players yet, but it wasn't the right time. \"Everyone is annoyed, it's normal. We're going to calm ourselves down,\" he added. Unai Emery, the PSG coach, reflected on the game, saying, \"In five minutes, we lost everything. We weren't able to defend. It's an experience. A negative experience, but an experience all the same. I'm learning for the future.\"\n\nThe scene in the Nou Camp press area was chaotic, with journalists struggling to process the events on the field. \"This is a crazy, unique sport,\" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. \"I dedicate this win to all Barça fans who kept faith in us. No one stopped believing,\" he added. \"The team were spectacular. We were rewarded in the end.\" Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund beat Benfica 4-0 in the other quarterfinal match, winning their tie 4-1 on aggregate.",

        "Text": "During a 60-minute meeting, sources revealed that President Trump scolded the conservative groups, including Club for Growth, the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, and the Tea Party Patriots, for labeling the House GOP proposal \"Obamacare lite.\" Trump reportedly warned the tea party activists, \"You're helping the other side.\" In characteristic Trump fashion, he shifted into salesman mode, telling the group, \"This is going to be fantastic. You're going to make it even better.\" He also assured them, \"I'll work hard to get it done.\"\n\nThe meeting, which took place in the White House, involved senior advisers Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway, and Marc Short, as well as other top West Wing staff. According to sources, White House aides expressed a willingness to discuss one aspect of the House GOP plan that has been a point of contention for tea party-aligned groups: the provision that delays the overhaul of expanded Medicaid funding until 2020. The conservative groups present at the meeting requested that the date be moved up to January 1, 2018. White House aides reportedly indicated that they were open to discussing the issue.\n\nConcerns were also raised about the tax credits in the House GOP plan, which provide financial assistance to lower-income Americans to purchase health insurance. Tea party groups view these credits as subsidies. According to a source at the meeting, the White House responded forcefully to these concerns. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, a former member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, delivered a passionate defense of the tax credits, surprising attendees from the conservative groups. One attendee described Mulvaney's defense as \"very defensive.\" President Trump expressed confidence that the healthcare plan would pass the House and outlined his strategy for securing Senate passage. He plans to campaign extensively in red states where vulnerable Democrats are up for re-election, telling a meeting that he will hold large-scale events at football stadiums in states where he won by a significant margin. \"I'm going to dare people to vote against me,\" Trump said, according to a source at the meeting. The President also expressed optimism about winning over prominent Republican opponents of the plan, including Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a former primary rival. \"I love him. He's a friend. He's going to end up voting for it,\" Trump said. A source at the meeting was surprised by the White House staff's lack of preparation for the initial conservative backlash against the GOP plan, given that they had \"telegraphed\" their intentions for weeks. A White House official countered that the meeting was a genuine policy discussion focused on specific details. Trump made it clear that he was open to suggestions for improving the bill, but emphasized that this was the opportunity to repeal and replace the existing healthcare system. ",

On Wednesday, CNN affiliate WEWS reporter John Kosich asked Vice President Mike Pence a straightforward yes or no question: Did he believe Trump's allegation? Pence dodged the question and attempted to shift the conversation to healthcare, a topic the Trump administration has been pushing to reform. Kosich followed up, \"The President has accused former President Obama of committing a felony by wiretapping Trump Tower. Can you simply answer 'yes' or 'no' as to whether you believe that?\" Pence sidestepped the question, saying, \"What I can say is that our administration is confident that the congressional committees investigating issues surrounding the 2016 election will conduct a thorough and fair inquiry. They will examine the allegations and other concerns. However, we remain focused on the issues that matter most to the American people, including creating jobs in Ohio and building a healthcare system that prioritizes consumer choice.\"  ",

They were among 11 Malaysian citizens who became stranded in the country after North Korea imposed a ban on Malaysian departures. The group included four embassy staff members and their family members. In response, Malaysia also banned North Koreans from leaving the country, with officials declining to disclose the number of North Koreans currently in Malaysia. The strained relations between Malaysia and North Korea date back to the murder of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, on February 13. Kim was poisoned with the deadly VX nerve agent while checking in for a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau, according to Malaysian police. Two women, one from Indonesia and the other from Vietnam, have been charged with murder and face the death penalty if convicted. Malaysian police are currently searching for seven North Koreans in connection with the murder, including four suspects believed to be back in their home country and three others thought to be hiding at the North Korean embassy in Malaysia. Kim's family is reportedly in hiding, with his son, Kim Han Sol, making his first public appearance since the murder in a video on Wednesday.  ",

        "Text": "The state's attorneys filed a 40-page request with a federal judge just before midnight on Tuesday, seeking a temporary restraining order to block the implementation of a new executive order. The order, signed by President Trump on Monday, prohibits foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and bans all refugees for 120 days. Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin stated that the filings ask the court to declare sections 2 and 6 of Trump's executive order unconstitutional and contrary to US laws. \"Sections 2 and 6 of the March 6, 2017 Executive Order violate the Immigration and Nationality Act by discriminating on the basis of nationality, ignoring and modifying the statutory criteria for determining terrorism-related inadmissibility, and exceeding the President's authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\" Chin said. The executive order is having a significant impact on the economy, according to the state's attorney. \"The new executive order is establishing religion in the state of Hawaii contrary to its constitution, inflicting immediate damage to our economy, educational institutions, and tourism industry, and subjecting a portion of our citizens to second-class treatment and discrimination, while denying all Hawaii residents the benefits of an inclusive and pluralistic society,\" the state's attorneys argued in court filings. \"The executive order means that thousands of individuals across the United States and in Hawaii who have immediate family members living in the affected countries will now be unable to receive visits from those persons or to be reunited with them in the United States.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the filing, but will have an opportunity to respond to the state's amended complaint against the travel ban on March 13. Hawaii's entire history and culture are built on the principles of nondiscrimination, not only in its constitution but also in its laws, according to Chin, a spokesperson for the state. Hawaii has a significant number of foreign-born residents, with approximately 20% of its population consisting of non-citizens, and 20% of its workforce comprising individuals who are not foreign-born.\n\nUS District Court Judge Derrick Watson has approved an expedited briefing schedule for the case, allowing it to be heard before the new executive order takes effect on March 16. Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued that the ban is necessary to ensure national security, as some governments are unable or unwilling to provide necessary information to vet visitors responsibly or actively support terrorism.\n\nHawaii had previously sued over Trump's original travel ban, but the case was put on hold temporarily while a nationwide temporary restraining order was in place. However, Judge Watson lifted the hold on Wednesday, allowing the state to proceed with its lawsuit against the new executive order.\n\nAccording to Neal Katyal, one of the lead attorneys for Hawaii and former acting US solicitor general, the new travel ban \"covers fewer people than the old one\" but still suffers from the same constitutional and statutory defects. The state's amended complaint primarily emphasizes the new executive order's alleged discriminatory intent and effect, as well as the harm it poses to Hawaii's economy. Hawaii is also a party to the lawsuit, represented by an American imam who has lived in the state with his wife and children for over a decade. However, his Syrian mother-in-law is now unable to visit them because she lacks a valid visa to enter the US. While many immigrant rights organizations and state attorneys general had expressed strong reservations about the new travel ban when it was announced on Monday, no new lawsuits or amended filings had been filed until now. The Justice Department filed a flurry of notices in federal courts on Monday, including in this Hawaii case, alerting judges to the new order and arguing that it falls outside of the injunctions that blocked the original ban. The government cited the significant changes to the new order, including its exemption of green card holders and those with valid visas.",

        "Text": "US-backed fighters are gearing up to launch an assault on Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of ISIS, within the next few weeks, according to officials. However, the Pentagon and Marine Corps have declined to confirm the deployment due to security concerns in the region. They have also refused to disclose the exact location or number of troops involved. The Washington Post was the first to report the deployment of Marines. The news is not surprising, as military commanders have been discussing the possibility of deploying artillery forces to the area for weeks, with the aim of boosting the capabilities of US-backed Arab and Kurdish forces. A similar deployment was made last year near Mosul, Iraq, where several hundred Marines equipped with artillery guns provided covering fire for advancing forces. Since Marines were already stationed in the region, the deployment to Syria did not require specific approval from President Donald Trump or Defense Secretary James Mattis, although both the White House and Pentagon were aware of the plan. The Marines were deployed from ships in the Persian Gulf region. This marks the second significant expansion of US ground forces in northern Syria in recent days, following the deployment of approximately 100 Army Rangers in and around Manbij, Syria. US officials have taken the unusual step of publicly discussing the Ranger deployment and its location to prevent them from inadvertently coming under fire from forces in the region or Turkish, Russian, or Syrian forces. The US troops in Manbij are present to deter hostilities, rather than their typical mission of training, advising, and assisting local forces. The deployment of Marines and Rangers in Syria raises questions about whether it violates the current cap on US forces in the country. The cap restricts the US to having more than 500 forces in Syria at any given time, and until now, troops in the area have primarily consisted of Special Operations Forces. Despite this, the US believes the pressure on ISIS in Raqqa is yielding results. According to a US official, intelligence suggests that some ISIS leaders and operatives are still attempting to flee the city. The official also revealed that US intelligence has detected extensive booby traps in Raqqa, including trenches, tunnels, roadside bombs, and buildings and houses rigged to explode. This suggests that the US has likely gathered intelligence from both aerial surveillance and ground sources. However, the official noted that Raqqa is unlikely to be the final battle against ISIS, as the group still has personnel scattered in areas south and east of the city. Estimates suggest that ISIS may have as many as 4,000 fighters in Raqqa, according to rough US calculations. ",

        "Text": "White House press secretary Sean Spicer clarified that President Trump's tweet about wiretapping was not referring to the specific surveillance activity, but rather \"broadly, surveillance and other activities\" that took place during the 2016 election. Spicer explained that Trump used the term \"wiretaps\" in quotes to encompass a range of surveillance methods, not just the narrow definition of wiretapping, which involves tapping into a telephone or telegram wire to obtain information. Spicer also emphasized that Trump's tweet was not accusing former President Obama of personal involvement, but rather referring to the Obama administration's actions in general.\n\nThe White House has yet to provide any evidence to support Trump's claim, despite the deadline for the Justice Department to do so. Numerous former officials have denied the existence of any warrant to wiretap Trump Tower. Spicer's comments came on the same day that the deadline passed, and a week after he initially declined to provide further explanation for Trump's tweet.\n\nIn his initial tweets, Trump specifically referred to phone tapping, using quotation marks only in two of the four tweets. However, Spicer claimed that Trump was referring to means of surveillance beyond wiretapping when he made the accusation. Despite this, Spicer did not reject the concept of a \"Deep State\" or other shadowy forces operating within the government. Trump's question about the legality of wiretapping a presidential candidate sparked controversy. In response, Trump tweeted that Obama had tapped his phones in October, claiming that he had stooped low to do so during the election process. However, not only Spicer, but also other White House officials, including Counselor Kellyanne Conway, attempted to redefine the term \"wiretap\" despite Trump's clear language. In an interview with the Bergen County Record, Conway discussed the wiretapping claims, suggesting that the Obama administration may have used other covert surveillance methods, such as those revealed by Wikileaks, to monitor Trump Tower. During the interview, columnist Mike Kelly asked Conway if Trump Tower had been wiretapped. Conway replied that there are many ways to surveil each other, and went on to suggest that surveillance could take place through phones, TVs, or even microwaves that can turn into cameras. ",

        "Text": "The House Intelligence Committee has given the Department of Justice until Monday to provide evidence supporting President Trump's claims of wiretapping, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The committee has also sent letters to various intelligence agencies this week to obtain records related to Russia. Former President Barack Obama has denied the allegations through a spokesperson, and his former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, has publicly refuted them. Sources close to the FBI have told CNN that Director James Comey has also disputed Trump's claims. Despite making the allegations over a week ago, Trump has yet to provide any evidence to back them up. In a Sunday night interview, Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to the President, appeared to expand on the allegations, suggesting that the Trump campaign may have been spied on using unconventional methods such as microwaves and television sets. However, she did not provide any concrete evidence to support her claims, and later clarified that she was speaking generally about surveillance. As the deadline set by the House Intelligence Committee approaches, calls for Trump to produce evidence are growing louder, including from some within his own party. Senator John McCain told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that Trump has two options: retract his claims or provide the information the American people deserve. McCain expressed skepticism about the allegations, but urged Trump to clear up the matter. Two congressmen with access to sensitive intelligence information have also said they have found no evidence to support Trump's claims. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, told ABC's \"This Week\" that he does not expect to see evidence of wiretapping. House Speaker Paul Ryan, asked directly on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" if he had seen evidence of wiretaps, responded, \"No.\" On Sunday, Conway clarified that \"surveillance\" encompasses more than just phone tapping. \"There are many ways to surveil each other,\" she told the Record, \"including through phones, television sets, and potentially other means.\" Conway also mentioned the possibility of using \"microwaves that turn into cameras,\" stating, \"This is a fact of modern life.\" She reiterated Trump's request that a congressional investigation into the wiretapping claims be included in the investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nOn ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Monday, Conway was asked to clarify her previous comments. She explained that she was discussing \"surveillance in general\" and not specifically suggesting that Trump Tower was under surveillance. \"I have no evidence,\" Conway said, \"but that's why there is an ongoing investigation in Congress.\" Later, she tweeted that the Record's headline, \"Kellyanne Conway suggests even wider surveillance of Trump campaign,\" was inaccurate. \"My response to the Record was about surveillance techniques in news articles, not about the Trump campaign,\" Conway said. \"The headline is just wrong.\" The article has been updated to reflect these clarifications.

        "Text": "Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu expressed frustration in an interview with CNN's Connect the World, questioning why he was deemed a terrorist and unable to attend a rally in Rotterdam over the weekend. The decision was met with a refusal by the Dutch to allow Turkish Family Affairs Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya to enter the Turkish consulate in the city, leading to her forced departure from the country. The move sparked violent clashes in Rotterdam, with Cavusoglu complaining that he had received no explanation from the Dutch for their concerns over public order and safety. \"Is there a single radicalized Turkish Turk?\" he asked, suggesting that the security concerns were an excuse to hide the real reasons behind the decision. Cavusoglu blamed a rise in racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia in the Netherlands and other European countries, and accused the Netherlands and other European countries of attempting to obstruct the \"yes\" campaign for a Turkish referendum on April 16 that would grant new powers to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The minister was visiting Rotterdam to rally support among Turkish expatriates who can vote in the referendum. In response to the blocked visit, Turkish President Erdogan compared the Dutch government to Nazis, prompting a response from Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who demanded an apology for Erdogan's inflammatory remarks. The Netherlands suffered a significant loss of over 200,000 citizens during its occupation by Nazi Germany in World War II. In a statement that appeared to justify Turkish President Erdogan's controversial remarks about the Nazis, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said: \"Such attitudes, policies, and violations of European standards, values, and Vienna conventions did not occur since World War II. Not even during World War II, and perhaps not even during the Nazi era. That's why we're making the comparison.\" Çavuşoğlu also announced that he has recommended taking action against the Dutch government in response to the events of the weekend, but declined to specify what this would entail. On Monday, the Dutch government issued a travel advisory on Twitter, warning Dutch citizens in Turkey to avoid demonstrations and remain vigilant amid the escalating tensions between the two countries. However, Çavuşoğlu told CNN that Turkey would not target the Dutch people or harm them, as it was not their fault. He emphasized that the Dutch people are friends of Turkey and that many tourists visit the country each year, citing a 400-year history of friendship between the two nations. ",

        "Text": "A bitter diplomatic dispute and public unrest erupted as voters in both countries prepared to cast ballots that could fundamentally alter the political landscape. What sparked the conflict? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been working to rally the approximately 4.6 million Turkish expatriates living in Western Europe to vote in an upcoming constitutional referendum. If passed, the referendum would transform Turkey's parliamentary system into a presidential one, giving Erdogan's office unprecedented power. Germany, Austria, and Switzerland sought to prevent Turkish referendum rallies from taking place on their soil, citing security and overcrowding concerns. On Saturday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu attempted to enter the Netherlands to address a rally in Rotterdam, but was blocked by the Dutch due to security concerns. Another minister was also barred from entering the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam. How did the Turks react? Protests broke out in both countries. Cavusoglu vowed \"tenfold\" retaliation against the Netherlands. According to Turkish state-run news, the Dutch diplomatic missions in Ankara and Istanbul were closed due to security concerns. The Turkish foreign ministry told the Dutch ambassador, who is currently on leave, not to return \"for a while.\" Erdogan condemned the Netherlands, saying it was \"sacrificing Turkish-Dutch relations.\" He accused the country of Nazism and likened it to a \"banana republic.\" He also called for sanctions. \"Nazism is still widespread in Europe,\" he said. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte responded by calling Erdogan's remarks inflammatory and demanding an apology. The Turkish government's verbal attacks on the Netherlands prompted Denmark's Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen to postpone a meeting with his Turkish counterpart. The Dutch government's decision to ban Turkish politicians from campaigning in the Netherlands may be linked to its domestic politics, particularly in the run-up to the country's general election on Wednesday. Immigration from Muslim-majority countries is a contentious issue in the election, with populist far-right leader Geert Wilders of the Freedom Party advocating for stricter measures. Wilders has called for the ban on immigration from Muslim countries, the closure of mosques, and the imprisonment of radical Muslims who have committed no crimes. In response, Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who is running for re-election, has shifted his stance to the right, urging immigrants who do not assimilate to \"behave normally or leave.\" Some critics, including freelance journalist David Chesal, have accused the government of engaging in \"election-time grandstanding.\" Chesal believes that Prime Minister Rutte is unlikely to allow a large Turkish campaign in Rotterdam or elsewhere in the Netherlands, as it would be a political liability. Meanwhile, Turkish President Erdogan is using the controversy to demonstrate his influence over Europe and gain support for his referendum on expanding his powers. European governments have been critical of Erdogan's commitment to basic freedoms since a failed coup attempt earlier this year, citing his crackdown on opposition, including journalists, academics, and public servants. The country has shut down nearly 140 media outlets, arrested over 41,000 people, and dismissed about 100,000 public sector workers. Turkey, a NATO member, jailed more journalists than any other country in 2016, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Critics have labeled the proposed referendum as anti-democratic, viewing it as a symptom of Erdogan's increasing authoritarian tendencies. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel sounded a warning, stating that Turkey's approach to democracy and the rule of law poses \"deeply problematic\" challenges to the country's future cooperation with the European Union.",

        "Text": "\"Turkish President Erdogan has taken on an unprecedented global role, and any hint of humiliation or rejection in the Netherlands is likely to spark backlash at home, where he is accustomed to getting his way. After being rebuffed by Germany and the Netherlands, Erdogan accused both countries of having Nazi inclinations, sparking a sharp rebuke from both nations, with the Dutch reminding him of the 200,000 people killed by Nazi forces. This weekend, Erdogan's ministers were scheduled to address expat Turks in the Netherlands to drum up support for a Turkish referendum that would consolidate his powers. However, Erdogan appears to have underestimated the Netherlands' upcoming elections, where immigration is a key issue. The Netherlands, where Erdogan's Foreign Minister and Minister of Families were denied permission to hold rallies, is set to hold elections on Wednesday. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte believes Erdogan was not intentionally trying to disrupt the elections, but rather his ministers were attempting to force their way into the country against the direct wishes of the Dutch government. According to Rutte, his government was negotiating with Foreign Minister Mevlet Cavusoglu to speak at a small gathering in Rotterdam, but the talks were halted when Cavusoglu threatened unspecified action if he didn't get his way. This was a red line for Rutte, who stated, 'We stopped talks when the Turkish Foreign Secretary started threatening us with sanctions.' As a result, Cavusoglu was denied permission to land at Rotterdam airport. Undeterred, another of Erdogan's ministers, Families Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, attempted to drive to Rotterdam from Germany, but was later escorted back to the border by Dutch police.\" Geert Wilders, a populist nationalist who has built his campaign on an anti-Muslim platform, has been in a dead heat with Mark Rutte's People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. Over the weekend, Wilders attempted to capitalize on the diplomatic tensions by taking to Twitter, where he urged the Dutch Families Minister to \"leave and never return\" and to take her \"Turkish fans\" with her. Wilders has long advocated for the Netherlands to withdraw from the EU and close its borders, which he believes allowed Turkish Minister Erdogan's entourage to enter the country without restriction. However, in this extraordinary political climate, what would have been a minor diplomatic incident in the past has taken on a much greater significance. In the wake of Brexit and the Trump presidency, Europe is bracing for a series of elections that could see populist nationalists like Wilders gain power, fueled by anti-immigration sentiment and posing a existential threat to the EU. Meanwhile, Erdogan has emerged as a key global player, partnering with the US on counter-terrorism and Syria, and with Russia in the same conflict. However, his political reforms in Turkey have raised concerns among European diplomats, who see them as benefiting only Erdogan and his allies, rather than moving Turkey closer to EU membership. Since the failed coup attempt in July, Turkey has cracked down on media outlets, arresting 41,000 people and dismissing around 100,000 others from their jobs. As a result, Erdogan now wields significant influence over the continent, a development that is uncomfortable for European governments. The Brexit campaign, which was fueled by concerns over immigration and fueled by images of refugees entering Europe, was also driven by fears of radical Islamist terror attacks. The same fears that drive the populist narrative in the UK are also present across northern Europe. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders is not alone in his anti-EU sentiments; French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has also vowed to lead her country out of the EU if she wins, with elections scheduled for next month. As more European countries head to the polls in the coming months, many established parties are facing a decline in support, with nationalist populists gaining ground in various forms. Turkish President Erdogan holds significant sway over Europe's current situation, having brokered a 6 billion euro deal with the EU to stem the flow of refugees from Turkey and cooperating on counter-terrorism efforts to combat ISIS' presence in Europe. However, Erdogan's recent diplomatic spat has raised concerns about his growing authoritarian tendencies, as his actions have reinforced European fears that he is becoming increasingly autocratic.",

        "Text": "At the first meeting of his Cabinet at the White House, Trump declared that the upcoming health care negotiation would be a \"big, fat, beautiful\" one, hoping to come up with a \"terrific\" solution. Earlier in the day, Trump tempered expectations for immediate drops in health insurance costs, telling a group of Americans affected by the Affordable Care Act that it could take several years for prices to decrease. He explained that increased competition and reduced regulation would eventually lead to lower costs, but noted that it would take time for the marketplace to kick in. Trump acknowledged that it would take a year or two for the effects to be seen, but promised that the outcome would be \"a thing of beauty.\" His comments came as Republicans awaited a crucial score from the Congressional Budget Office on their health care replacement plan, which was unveiled and debated last week. Democrats argue that the American Health Care Act will force millions off their insurance plans and increase costs. The CBO score is expected as early as Monday. Trump expressed frustration that Obamacare's popularity seems to be rising among Americans, placing blame on the media for focusing on the law's success stories without highlighting its flaws, such as skyrocketing premiums and canceled insurance plans. \"'The media is suddenly portraying Obamacare in a very positive light,' Trump said. 'I'm watching the news, and it looks great.' Trump also noted that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, was gaining popularity now that he was no longer in office. 'When he left office, people began to appreciate him more. When he was still in office, people didn't have the same affection for him. That's just human nature,' Trump said.\" ",

        "Text": "According to a new report published by the organization, at least 652 children lost their lives in the past 12 months, a 20% increase from 2015. Alarmingly, nearly half of these children were killed in or near their schools. The report only includes verified figures, which means the actual death toll could be much higher. A 6-year-old boy, Ahmad, shared his heartbreaking story, saying, \"I wanted to become a doctor, but maybe I won't become anything because our school was attacked. We used to play a lot in the schoolyard, but now I'm afraid of coming here.\" The report also reveals that in 2016, at least 850 children were recruited to fight in the conflict, more than double the number from the previous year. Children are increasingly being used in combat roles, including as executioners, suicide bombers, and prison guards, leaving them with life-altering scars. According to Geert Cappelaere, the UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, \"Each and every child is scarred for life with horrific consequences on their health, well-being, and future.\" UNICEF estimates that nearly six million children now rely on humanitarian assistance, a staggering 12 times the number in 2012. Moreover, the organization is unable to access some of the most hard-to-reach areas of the country, where an estimated 280,000 children are living under siege, cut off from humanitarian aid and dying in silence from preventable diseases. Last week, a report by British charity Save the Children highlighted the devastating impact of the civil war on Syrian children, who are suffering from \"toxic stress\" caused by the war's brutality. \"At least three million Syrian children under the age of six have grown up in a war zone, with Save the Children warning that prolonged exposure to conflict could have devastating effects, including self-harm and suicide attempts. According to a report, one father, Firas, shared a heartbreaking story about his 3-year-old son, Saeed, who had been deeply traumatized by the violence. Firas described how Saeed would wake up in the middle of the night, filled with fear, after witnessing a child being slaughtered. He asked, 'How can a child not be afraid after seeing something like that?' The conflict in Syria, which began in 2011, has already claimed an estimated 400,000 lives, making it one of the worst humanitarian crises since World War II, according to the United Nations.\" ",

On March 2, Mubarak was acquitted of charges related to the killing of protesters during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, a verdict upheld by Egypt's Court of Cassation, the country's highest criminal court. While Mubarak was acquitted of the killing charges, he and his sons were convicted of corruption. On Monday, Ibrahim Saleh, the attorney general of the East Cairo prosecution, accepted Mubarak's request to have time spent in prison pending trial counted towards his sentence in the corruption case, according to state media. State media sources have confirmed that there are no longer any pending court cases against Mubarak.

        "Text": "The deployment of Japan's Izumo helicopter carrier, primarily used for anti-submarine missions, marks a rare display of naval power from Japan amidst escalating tensions in Asia, underscoring the Trump administration's commitment to maintaining a collaborative military presence in the region. The Malabar military exercises, held on a rotational basis in the West Pacific and Indian oceans since Japan joined in 2007, will see the Izumo transit through the contested South China Sea to reach the Indian Ocean. China has already expressed its discontent with the exercises, with a Global Times editorial in December warning that they would \"jeopardize the peace and stability in the region.\" The 2017 exercises coincide with a period of heightened tension in the Asia-Pacific, following North Korea's recent missile tests, which sparked concerns in Tokyo about Kim Jong Un's regime's intentions. The tests were claimed to be carried out by the North Korean military unit tasked with targeting US military bases in Japan. Tensions are also running high between Japan and China over the disputed Senkaku Islands, which Beijing claims as the Diaoyu Islands. Furthermore, the ongoing construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea has escalated tensions with US allies in the region, prompting criticism from President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. In his confirmation hearing, Tillerson likened China's actions to Russia's annexation of Crimea, stating that building islands and placing military assets on them is akin to taking territory that others claim. The US is set to send a clear message to China, with Secretary Tillerson's upcoming visit to Asia this week, including stops in South Korea, China, and Japan. Next month, President Trump plans to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for a summit. The US has also announced that it will permanently station attack drones in South Korea, a move that comes just days after South Korea received the first parts of the controversial THAAD missile defense system. According to Yvonne Chiu, a professor at Hong Kong University, the US needs to be seen as responsive to developments in the region.\n\nThe Japanese navy has added the 816-foot Izumo to its large-scale exercises, which highlights the importance of Japan's anti-submarine warfare capabilities in deterring Chinese expansion in the region. The Izumo, a helicopter carrier, is one of Japan's few tools that allow it to project military power beyond the defense of its own territories. As Corey Wallace, a security analyst at Freie University in Berlin, noted, Japan's subsurface detection and reaction capabilities are a strength, while China's is a weakness, despite China's larger subsurface fleet. Japan has a history of using its submarine hunting vessels, helicopter carriers, and sub-hunting aircraft to great effect, including helping the US keep the Soviet Pacific subsurface fleet \"bottled up\" in the North Pacific during the Cold War. The Japanese destroyer Izumo was initially planned to participate in exercises with US ships as part of the Malabar exercise, but the US Navy declined to comment on whether the vessel would be deployed to the disputed South China Sea. When asked about the Japanese Navy's movements, a US Navy official simply stated, \"The US Navy does not comment on Japanese Navy movements.\" The Japanese government did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. While Japan does not have any territorial claims in the South China Sea, the country's concerns about China's growing military presence in the area have prompted Tokyo to increase its patrol and training activities in the region. The South China Sea dispute is expected to be a topic of discussion during Secretary Tillerson's trip to Asia this week and during Chinese President Xi's visit to the US in Florida.",

        "Text": "The announcement came a week after North Korea launched four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, and amid the annual joint military exercises between the US and South Korea. The US Forces Korea (USFK) stated that the stationing of the company, which will be assigned to the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, directly supports the US Army's strategic plan to deploy a Gray Eagle company to each division. The Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) will significantly enhance the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of US Forces Korea and its Republic of Korea (ROK) partners. The Gray Eagle UAS can stay airborne for 24 hours and is equipped with Hellfire missiles, according to the US Army's website. Compared to the Predator drones, the Gray Eagle has upgraded reconnaissance and surveillance technology, said Corey Wallace, a researcher at the Graduate School of East Asian Studies at Freie Universit?t Berlin. The system can also integrate with Apache helicopters, which could be useful in navigating bad weather on the Korean Peninsula, where the US military has recently begun rotating 24 AH-64D Apaches. According to Wallace, the US and its regional partners aim to demonstrate their conventional deterrence and readiness, rather than just reacting to a full-scale attack by North Korea. The deployment is likely a show of force in response to increased provocations from North Korea, said Daniel Pinkston, a professor at Troy University in Seoul. North Korea has conducted a series of missile tests in recent months, a concerning development for the US and its allies in the region, as it suggests the country is refining its missile technology. \"North Korea's accelerated pace of weapons testing and deployment has been met with a response, and they were wrong to assume otherwise,\" said Pinkston in an interview with CNN. \"Given North Korea's recent behavior and the ongoing Foal Eagle exercise, I believe it's a good time to deploy our forces.\" This is the first time US forces have publicly announced the movement of drones, according to USFK spokesman Christopher Bush. It's no coincidence, said Yvonne Chiu, a professor at Hong Kong University. The US wants to make it clear to Pyongyang and Beijing that it is a significant player in Asia. \"The US needs to be seen as responsive to developments in the region, and North Korea should know that,\" Chiu told CNN. The timing of the drone deployment may be a reaction to North Korea's missile launches and threatening posture, but it also coincides with political upheaval in South Korea. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye on Friday, who was ousted in the aftermath of a corruption scandal. Park took a hardline approach to dealing with North Korea, but the current front-runner in the race to succeed her, Liberal candidate Moon Jae-in, has historically advocated for improving relations between the two countries. Wallace suggested that the announcement could be a way to ensure that a future government doesn't reverse the decision, much like the controversy surrounding the acceleration of THAAD deployment, which raised concerns that a left-leaning government might be less willing to confront North Korea directly. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, a US-built missile defense system, was agreed upon by Park's government to be deployed in South Korea. At a rally celebrating the impeachment ruling, balloons read \"No THAAD! Yes peace!\" THAAD is designed to intercept incoming missiles from North Korea, and its first components arrived in South Korea last week. Despite its defensive nature, THAAD's deployment is highly controversial. Some South Koreans support THAAD as a means of protecting themselves from North Korean provocations, although it's not a foolproof system. Others are angry about the damage it has caused to diplomatic relations between Seoul and Beijing, which opposes THAAD due to concerns it poses a threat to its own security interests. China worries that THAAD's advanced radar system could be used for surveillance purposes, and many in the Chinese foreign policy establishment view THAAD as a significant threat, comparable to North Korea's nuclear program. According to Professor John Delury of Yonsei University, the radar and surveillance capabilities of THAAD are a major concern for China. With the announcement of attack drones being deployed in South Korea, Beijing will now have to worry about the presence of military assets in its backyard. Chiu noted that the US has a reputation in China for not being strong or interested in defending its interests, which will likely lead to a negative reaction from Beijing.",

        "Text": "The bill, introduced by Rep. Jessica Farrar, a Democrat, would impose a 24-hour waiting period for men seeking certain medical procedures, including colonoscopies, vasectomies, and prescriptions for Viagra. Farrar acknowledges that her bill is unlikely to pass, but she hopes it will spark a conversation about the double standard in healthcare. As an advocate for women's health, Farrar has long been frustrated by Texas's restrictive abortion laws, which have made it difficult for women to access essential healthcare services. Her bill is designed to highlight the obstacles women face in their healthcare journeys, by applying the same standards to men. \"Let's examine the challenges women in Texas face,\" Farrar said. \"What if men had to undergo the same intrusive procedures?\"\n\nThe bill's name, \"A Man's Right to Know Act,\" is a nod to a pamphlet that Texas doctors are required to give women seeking abortions, titled \"A Woman's Right to Know.\" However, Farrar's bill is a jab at the pamphlet's inaccuracies and ideological bias, which has been criticized for linking breast cancer to abortion and discouraging women from seeking abortions. Farrar points out that Texas has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, and that the rate of women who died from pregnancy-related complications doubled between 2010 and 2014. In response, political opponents have launched a backlash against Farrar's bill. Representative Tony Tinderholt expressed disappointment with Representative Farrar's attempt to compare her stance on a recent bill to the abortion issue, stating that it reveals a lack of understanding of human biology. He suggested that Representative Farrar take a high school biology class to better educate herself on the matter before introducing future legislation.\n\nIn Texas, women face significant barriers to accessing abortions. The state has strict laws governing the procedure, and the scarcity of clinics further hinders women's ability to obtain an abortion. Under current law, women who are beyond 20 weeks pregnant can only obtain an abortion if their life is at risk, forcing them to carry an unviable fetus to term. Additionally, women must receive state-mandated counseling, undergo an ultrasound, and have the image of the unborn child described to them by their provider.\n\nAs of 2014, nearly 96% of Texas counties lacked clinics that provided abortions, affecting roughly 43% of the state's women. Since then, the number of facilities offering abortions in Texas has plummeted from 44 to 18, following the implementation of restrictions on abortion doctors and clinics. Although the Supreme Court later struck down these restrictions, the damage had already been done. Today, women in Texas can only access abortions in seven cities, leaving a vast area of the panhandle and west Texas without a single abortion clinic. ",

        "Text": "The White House announced that Trump had paid $38 million in additional taxes, on top of tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales, excise, and employment taxes. Journalist David Cay Johnston published Trump's tax returns ahead of his appearance on MSNBC. \"You're willing to break the law for ratings when you're pushing a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,\" a White House official said on Tuesday. Trump had promised during his presidential campaign to release his tax returns after the conclusion of a routine audit, but the White House has not specified a timeline. Recently, aides have suggested that Trump will not release his returns since winning the election. During the presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton and Trump's Republican rivals attempted to make the returns a campaign issue, but were unable to generate enough pressure to force their release. In October, The New York Times obtained a single year's return anonymously, which showed that Trump declared a $916 million loss and listed tax benefits he used after a turbulent financial period in the early 1990s. According to tax experts, Trump could have used his loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income for nearly two decades.  ",

        "Text": "As the first round of the French presidential election approaches and Germany prepares for its own election later this year, the Dutch political landscape is under intense scrutiny for signs of broader trends. Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte is facing a closely contested battle with far-right challenger Geert Wilders, whose anti-immigrant and anti-Islam rhetoric has sparked controversy and attracted widespread support in a country increasingly divided by issues of austerity and immigration. According to the latest poll by Leiden University's Peilingwijzer, Rutte's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) holds a slim lead over Wilders' Freedom Party (PVV), but the outcome is far from certain. With 28 parties on the ballot, the Dutch system of proportional representation virtually guarantees a coalition government. For Rutte, securing a third term in office will depend on his party's ability to form the largest group in the 150-seat House of Representatives, which would likely require a coalition with at least three other parties. However, many Dutch voters are disillusioned with the status quo and Wilders has gained popularity due to his uncompromising rhetoric and controversial views. Other parties, including Rutte's VVD, have shifted to the right in response. Amsterdam resident Ron Mesland, a musician and actor, expressed concern about the broader implications of Wilders' popularity: \"I'm worried about Geert Wilders, but more so about the influence he has on other parties,\" he said. \"It seems like most other parties are adopting his language and ideas, and that's what really troubles me.\" According to Ruud Koole, a politics professor at the University of Leiden, if Wilders' party secures the most seats in the House of Representatives, it would be challenging for him to govern due to the country's political system, which typically involves coalition governments. Koole explained that Wilders would need to form a coalition with other parties, but these parties are unlikely to partner with the PVV. In an interview, Koole said that Wilders' popularity stems from his ability to address the specific concerns of a particular segment of the electorate, including issues related to unemployment, healthcare, and the Dutch national identity. He noted that voters who support Wilders do not necessarily believe he has the solutions to these problems, but rather appreciate that he acknowledges and expresses their concerns. However, Wilders' popularity has recently declined, with one expert suggesting that this may be due in part to the rise of US President Donald Trump. Quentin Peel, an associate fellow at Chatham House, observed that Wilders' support has slipped below 20% in recent weeks, and that this decline may be attributed to concerns among moderate Dutch citizens about the events unfolding in Washington. Peel noted that predicting the election results is difficult due to the unpredictability of voter behavior. \"You have at least 28 parties running in this campaign, and you're likely to end up with a complex coalition, and Mr. Wilders won't be part of it,\" Geert Wilders said.\n\nGiven its bellwether status as the first major election in Europe this year, the Netherlands has taken center stage globally. According to preliminary Eurostat data, the country's economy grew by 2.1% last year, and investors have remained relatively calm throughout the campaign. However, Prime Minister Rutte's tough austerity measures aimed at combating the 2011-2012 recession have disproportionately affected the country's poorest, weighing heavily on their minds as they prepare to vote.\n\n\"My biggest concern is that the working class is being pushed down,\" said Tony Regnerus, a delivery driver. \"Immigrants are coming in and getting a better life than working-class people. They're not motivated to do anything with their lives or get a job. Every day, I see people in big cities like Rotterdam and Gouda and Delft wearing expensive Canada Goose jackets, but I, a working man, can't afford it. It's the other way around that should be.\"\n\nThe Netherlands' relationship with the European Union has been a hot topic on the campaign trail. As founding members of the union, attitudes have cooled in recent years, and Wilders has pledged a Brexit-style referendum on whether to leave the EU. Fisherman Jan de Boer is concerned about the future of his industry, which he believes is threatened by EU regulations, and this will be at the forefront of his mind when he casts his ballot on election day. \"The rules are very bad for fishermen in the Netherlands,\" he said. \"We want to fish, and our children want to fish.\" Until now, de Boer has always voted for the Christian Party, but this time, he said, that will change. \"Geert Wilders is the only party that fights European rules, and that's important to me.\"\n\nHowever, bus company worker Leonard Schaab is skeptical about Wilders' chances: \"The polls are often a bit off, and when the real elections take place, most people will vote for other parties.\" \"The man doesn't have the skills to do it,\" he added. \"The only thing Geert Wilders does is shout about problems... he creates problems, but he never has solutions.\"",

        "Text": "Turkey and the Netherlands had already been at odds, with high-level diplomatic relations frozen, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized the Dutch for failing to prevent the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica. During a speech in Ankara, Erdogan referenced the Dutch UN peacekeepers who were present during the massacre, saying, \"We know the Dutch and the people of Holland from Srebrenica. We know how they massacred people there, and we don't need anyone to teach us about civilization.\" The Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, responded to Erdogan's comments, calling them a \"disgusting falsification of history.\" In an interview with RTL, Rutte said, \"Erdogan continues to push the limits. This is of unbelievably low quality and style. We won't stoop to his level. It's unacceptable and extremely irritating.\" The Turkish president's inflammatory remarks added fuel to the fire, as tensions between the two countries had already been escalating. The row began over the weekend, when Turkish officials were blocked from addressing political rallies in the Netherlands. The Dutch refused to allow Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to visit Rotterdam, and later stopped Turkey's Family Affairs Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya from entering the Turkish consulate. Violent clashes broke out after the ministers were prevented from speaking. Erdogan had already made angry remarks about the Dutch government, comparing it to the Nazis, since the incidents in Rotterdam. The Netherlands suffered a devastating loss of over 200,000 citizens during its occupation by Nazi Germany in World War II, and Prime Minister Rutte has called for an apology. In response to the escalating tensions, Turkey announced on Monday that it would not allow the Dutch ambassador to return to Ankara and suspended high-level diplomatic relations between the two countries. The escalating diplomatic row has also prompted threats from Turkey to withdraw from the EU-Migrant deal, aimed at stemming the flow of migrants to Europe. The growing tensions come ahead of the Dutch general election on Wednesday, with far-right candidate Geert Wilders' anti-Islam, anti-EU Party for Freedom (PVV) expected to make a strong showing. Wilders has sought to capitalize on the discord between the Netherlands and Turkey to gain political advantage. Meanwhile, it is believed that Turkish President Erdogan is attempting to demonstrate his leadership strength on the world stage. During a speech on healthcare, Erdogan made controversial comments about Srebrenica, which drew loud applause from the audience. Erdogan also urged Dutch voters of immigrant backgrounds not to vote for Wilders, whom he described as an \"extreme racist\" or Prime Minister Rutte in Wednesday's election. ",

        "Text": "Rex Tillerson will need a strong diplomatic hand when he embarks on his first trip to Asia on Wednesday, as tensions escalate in the region. North Korea's missile program is rapidly advancing, posing a threat to the United States and its key allies in East Asia, Japan and South Korea. The latter is still reeling from the sudden ousting of its president. To succeed, Tillerson must convince both nations that it's in their best interests to maintain their commitment to the United States and its controversial missile defense system. His biggest test will come when he visits China, becoming the first Trump Cabinet member to do so, and attempts to leverage the country's perceived influence over North Korea. Our Asia correspondents outline the challenges Tillerson faces on each stop: South Korea, China, and Japan.\n\nIn Japan, Tillerson's most pressing concern is the growing nuclear threat from North Korea. The country's leader, Kim Jong Un, has test-fired ballistic missiles, including one during a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US President Donald Trump in Florida. The timing of this test-fire was seen by some analysts as a message to Tokyo. More recently, North Korea launched four ballistic missiles simultaneously, with state media implying that the launch was a practice run for striking US military bases in Japan, where around 52,000 US service members are stationed. Tillerson will meet with Abe and his counterpart, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, to reassure Japan that it remains the United States' closest and most trusted ally in the Asia-Pacific. Although Trump had questioned US alliances in the region during his presidential campaign, the new administration has largely backed off from that rhetoric. As US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeks to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, he may face a significant hurdle in the form of tensions between Japan and South Korea, two of the region's major allies. The Japanese ambassador was recalled from Seoul in January after a statue depicting \"comfort women\" who were forced into sexual slavery by Japanese forces during World War II sparked controversy. To address this challenge, Tillerson will need to employ his diplomatic skills to encourage Japan and South Korea to resolve their issues, allowing the three countries to focus on the growing threat posed by North Korea to regional and global security.\n\nWhen Tillerson arrives in Seoul, his South Korean counterparts will face the daunting task of convincing him that business as usual can continue, despite the country's current state of political turmoil. Park Geun-hye's recent ousting from office has left the country deeply divided, and the government has been largely paralyzed since the corruption scandal broke months ago. However, those in power will work tirelessly to secure the assurances they desire from the US Secretary of State. During his visit, Tillerson will meet with acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, whom he previously met at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Bonn, Germany. South Korean officials will be looking for reassurances from Tillerson, similar to those offered by US Defense Secretary James Mattis during his recent visit, that Washington is committed to an \"overwhelming\" response to any North Korean attack. The timing of Tillerson's visit is also significant, as Seoul claims that Beijing is imposing economic sanctions in retaliation for the country's decision to install the US missile defense system, THAAD, which Washington believes is necessary to counter the North Korean missile threat. Now that Park is no longer in power, the new leader of South Korea will also be expected to uphold the agreement. Snap elections are scheduled to take place by the end of May. The first components of the THAAD system arrived in South Korea last week, with the goal of having it fully operational by July at the earliest. In Beijing on Saturday, Tillerson's first priority will be to finalize details for a potential summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in April. This would be the first meeting between the two leaders, a relationship that many consider the most important in the world. There are many pressing issues to discuss, including the ongoing crisis in North Korea. Since 2016, North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of ballistic missile tests, significantly escalating tensions on the peninsula. The Trump administration wants China to take more action to address the threat. China is likely to bring up the THAAD anti-missile defense system and Gray Eagle attack drones in South Korea, which Beijing has strongly disapproved of. Tillerson will likely leave China with a clear understanding of Beijing's disapproval. He will also likely raise concerns about China's military build-up in the South China Sea. During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson suggested that China should be denied access to the artificial islands it has built in the disputed waters. Despite campaign rhetoric, the Trump administration has taken a relatively hands-off approach to China so far, not following through on threats to label China a currency manipulator or impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump has also endorsed the \"One China\" policy, which has governed US-China-Taiwan relations for decades, after initially questioning its legitimacy. Tillerson's visit to China sets the stage for the upcoming Xi-Trump meeting and could mark a turning point in the Trump administration's approach to China, potentially marking a shift from calm relations to a more confrontational stance.",

        "Text": "Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse claims that FBI Director James Comey made a promise to him and Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, during a March 2 meeting. According to Whitehouse, Comey assured them that he would confirm the existence of an investigation and its scope, specifically regarding the Russia-Trump probe, as he had not been able to do so at that point. Whitehouse and Graham have requested evidence from the Justice Department to support President Trump's claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. The two lawmakers are leading one of three Congressional investigations into Russia's interference in the US elections. The FBI has not commented on whether Comey will respond to the request by Wednesday. Graham expressed frustration on Tuesday, stating that the Trump administration has not provided any evidence of wiretapping and plans to \"go tough\" on the administration during Wednesday's hearing. The White House has wavered in its stance on Trump's claims over the past two days. Initially, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump did not mean his wiretapping claim literally, but on Tuesday, Spicer stated that Trump is \"extremely confident\" he will be vindicated by the evidence. Without providing specific examples, Spicer mentioned that there is \"significant reporting\" about surveillance techniques used during the 2016 election. Spicer said that Trump believes he will ultimately be vindicated. Meanwhile, Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a separate investigation, have expressed doubt that Trump has evidence of wiretapping, but the issue could be easily settled if the administration provides the necessary evidence. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that all concerns could be resolved with a single phone call, before attending a committee hearing on Tuesday. Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said he has seen no evidence to support President Trump's claim that President Obama wiretapped him. Warner expects the first public hearing on Russia from the Senate Intelligence Committee to take place later this month. He expressed a desire to hear from Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser, who had contact with \"Guccifer 2.0,\" the online persona claiming responsibility for hacking the Democratic National Committee. Warner emphasized that Stone's involvement in the investigation is significant, as he has acknowledged being in contact with Russians. Stone has disputed these claims, stating that his contact with Guccifer was limited to a brief Twitter exchange, and any other suggestions are \"fabrications.\"\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has scheduled its first hearing for Monday, during which current and former intelligence chiefs will testify. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said on Monday that he has requested information about Trump's wiretap claims from the \"appropriate people\" and has received \"sufficient\" responses. However, Senate Democrats on the Intelligence Committee have not yet seen any evidence to support the claims. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a veteran member of the panel, stated that she has heard nothing to support the wiretap claims and is convinced that no wiretapping occurred. Warner also expressed frustration with the administration's response to information requests, saying, \"I'm not sure why this is taking any time.\" ",

        "Text": "A woman told the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) that she was sleeping and listening to music on a flight when she heard an explosion about two hours into the journey. She said she felt burning on her face as she turned around, and then grabbed her face, causing her headphones to wrap around her neck. The woman, who remained anonymous, claimed she ripped off the headphones and threw them to the floor, where she saw sparks and small flames shooting out. She added that as she attempted to stomp on the flames, flight attendants were already there with a bucket of water to extinguish them. The attendants managed to pour the water on the flames and put the headphones in a bucket at the back of the plane, but not before they had melted into the aircraft floor. The passenger said that the cabin was filled with the smell of melted plastic and burnt hair, and that people were coughing and choking throughout the rest of the flight. The ATSB released a statement saying that it was likely the batteries inside the headphones that had caught fire, rather than the headphones themselves. However, the agency refused to disclose the type of batteries or headphones involved in the incident, which occurred on February 19. The incident came just a day after an Airbus A320 made an emergency landing in Nagoya, Japan, after a portable power pack started a fire in an overhead locker. Lithium batteries have been known to cause fires on board planes. In 2016, the US authorities prohibited Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices from being carried on all US flights due to concerns over their lithium batteries, which were prone to spontaneous ignition. The ban also extended to shipping the phones as air cargo. Samsung attributed the issue to faulty lithium-ion batteries, which were overheating and causing the devices to catch fire. Despite efforts to rectify the problem, the company ultimately ceased production of the device. Meanwhile, Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority has reported a significant increase in incidents involving electronic devices in recent years, from just three in 2011 to 106 in 2015, according to Flight Safety Australia. When asked about the specific brand of headphones or batteries involved in these incidents, the authority declined to provide further information. ",

        "Text": "According to estimates, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is likely to be followed closely by a three-way tie for second place, with the Party for Freedom (PVV), Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), and Democrats (D66) all vying for position. Geert Wilders, the PVV's leader, a far-right figure known for his controversial views, tweeted a message of gratitude to his supporters, saying, \"PVV voters, thank you. We've won seats, and it's a first victory. Rutte hasn't managed to get rid of me yet.\" Other parties expected to win seats include GroenLinks (Green Left), the Socialist Party, and the Labour Party (PVDA), led by Deputy Prime Minister Lodewijk Asscher. The election was widely seen as a test of the spread of populist sentiment across Europe, following the victories of US President Donald Trump and the Brexit referendum in the UK. Wilders, a controversial figure known for his anti-immigrant and anti-EU views, had campaigned on a platform of \"de-Islamification,\" calling for the closure of Islamic schools and the ban of the Quran and burqa. His message resonated with many ordinary Dutch voters who have been hard hit by austerity measures and feel that the country has taken in too many refugees and migrants. \"The Netherlands is full,\" said Wilders supporter Jack outside a polling station in Volendam. \"If it were up to me, I would have stopped all Turkish people at the border.\" Others, however, were disturbed by the tone of the campaign and said they had voted tactically to prevent the far right from gaining power or to support parties that align with their values. \"I thought it was important to vote strategically,\" said Amsterdam resident Kathie Somwerwil. \"I usually vote more left of center, but with Wilders, I felt that wasn't the Dutch way, so I voted for Mr. Rutte's VVD.\" Author Bert Nap explained that he voted for the progressive PvdA party because it showed courage by forming a government with Rutte's party, despite being unpopular with many supporters. \"I want to support a party that has taken a strong stance,\" he said. \"They will likely suffer heavy losses in this election, but they need to be able to recover for the next election, so they must be sustained.\" \n\nThe fragmented political landscape in the Netherlands, with 28 parties on the ballot, and the country's system of proportional representation, often lead to coalition governments. However, this can also result in prolonged periods of political instability and uncertainty. According to the House of Representatives website, the average time taken to form a coalition cabinet in the post-war era is 89.5 days. In 1977, it took 208 days for Dries Van Agt's Christian Democrats to reach a power-sharing deal. Voters expect a prolonged period of negotiations before the next government is formed. \"I think there will be a lot of negotiations,\" said research analyst Robin Vanstraalen. \"Given the fragmentation and the polls showing it will be a long process. And eventually it will end up in the middle -- which is where we have been for the last few years already.\"\n\nThe support for Rutte, the leader, was boosted by factors that included his move to the right in response to Wilders' popularity. At one stage, Wilders and Rutte were neck-and-neck in the Peilingwijzer poll of polls by Leiden University, but in recent days Rutte had taken the lead. Andre Krouwel, a political scientist at the Free University Amsterdam and owner of the election website Kieskompas, believes that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ongoing feud with the Dutch government has inadvertently boosted support for Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The tensions between the Netherlands and Turkey have been escalating since the Dutch government refused to allow Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to hold a political rally in Rotterdam last weekend. In response, Erdogan accused the Netherlands of being responsible for the Srebrenica massacre in 1995. Traditionally, voter turnout in the Netherlands is high, with nearly 75% of the electorate casting their ballots in the last election in 2012. This year's election is shaping up to be no exception, with reports of long queues forming at polling booths in The Hague's central station as commuters returned home from work. According to NOS, by 5:45 p.m. local time, 55% of the electorate had voted, up from 48% at the same time in 2012. Hanneke Spijker, a volunteer at an Amsterdam polling station, reported that large numbers of people had been coming out to vote since early Wednesday morning. \"It's incredible,\" she said. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it's a record turnout. We never have lines like this.\"",

        "Text": "On his first official trip to Asia, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will navigate a delicate diplomatic landscape, particularly in Beijing, North Korea's closest ally and protector. In Beijing, Tillerson will convey the US's frustration with Chinese companies facilitating North Korea's weapons program, while also seeking Chinese support for a broader effort to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, similar to the international coalition that achieved the Iran nuclear deal. This visit will also lay the groundwork for Chinese President Xi Jinping's trip to the US in April. Tillerson will also address other contentious issues between the US and China, including territorial disputes in the South China Sea, trade, Taiwan's status, and the recent deployment of a defensive missile system and drones to South Korea. However, the situation with North Korea is the most pressing and potentially dangerous issue, as Pyongyang has accelerated its nuclear program in recent months with the aim of developing a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver it to the US. \"China has been part of the problem rather than part of the solution\" in addressing North Korea's nuclear threat, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. China has \"acted like North Korea's lawyer at the UN Security Council, denying evidence of wrongdoing, insisting on loopholes, and watering down effective resolutions\" at the United Nations, Klingner added. \"When North Korea engages in provocative or violative behavior, they often respond by urging both Koreas not to escalate tensions, despite being the primary aggressor,\" said [Name], continuing his thought. Meanwhile, Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner revealed that discussions between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Chinese counterpart have already begun to explore ways to pressure North Korea. \"We're looking at what additional steps we can take to make the regime feel the consequences of their actions and pay a price for their behavior,\" Toner explained. He acknowledged that the US wants China to play a more significant role in addressing the North Korea issue. \"We recognize China's influence over North Korea and encourage it to use that leverage to implement the existing sanctions regime more thoroughly or explore other ways to exert pressure,\" Toner said. Notably, China's influence over North Korea is significant, as the country accounts for 90% of North Korea's economic activity, according to [Name]. Chinese firms can operate as front companies, allowing North Korea to sell weapons and goods abroad and import goods. The US is considering imposing sanctions on Chinese firms that engage in economic activities with North Korea, given evidence that some of them are facilitating the country's weapons trade. \"We can influence Chinese banks and businesses that deal with North Korea, as we have done in the past,\" [Name] said. In the mid-2000s, the Bank of China took a bold step by cutting off its ties with North Korea to avoid the risk of US sanctions. According to Klingner, this means that even if Beijing doesn't want to comply, we can still influence the behavior of Chinese entities that engage in economic activity with North Korea. The Trump administration has already begun to follow in the footsteps of the Obama administration, which started cracking down on Chinese companies last year. Just last week, the Commerce Department imposed a $1.2 billion fine on ZTE, a Chinese tech firm, for violating sanctions by selling equipment to Iran and North Korea. In September, the Obama administration took a significant step by targeting the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd, a Chinese company, for its ties to North Korea and support of its nuclear program. On the same day, the Justice Department unsealed four indictments for money laundering against the same firm and four individuals, all of whom were acting on behalf of Pyongyang.",

        "Text": "A massive hack, initiated in January 2014, compromised at least 500 million Yahoo accounts. The stolen information was used to gain unauthorized access to email accounts at Yahoo, Google, and other webmail providers, including those of Russian journalists, government officials, and private-sector employees from various industries, according to the Department of Justice. The hackers obtained names, email addresses, and passwords, but not financial information, Yahoo announced in a statement about the breach. The two FSB officers, Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin and Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, allegedly conspired with Russian national Alexsey Alexseyevich Belan and Canadian resident Karim Baratov, also known as \"Kay,\" \"Karim Taloverov,\" and \"Karim Akehmet Tokbergenov.\" Dokuchaev was arrested in Russia in December and accused of spying for the US, although a lawyer for one of the men charged with Dokuchaev said the agency has not confirmed this. Baratov was arrested without incident in Ancaster, Ontario, on Tuesday morning. Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord described the hacking as \"beyond the pale\" at a news conference in Washington. The stolen Yahoo data is being sold on the dark web. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer publicly thanked US authorities on Wednesday, expressing her gratitude to the FBI and DOJ. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in San Francisco has scheduled a news conference for later on Wednesday afternoon to discuss undisclosed topics. Yahoo has suffered at least two breaches, with a 2014 attack attributed to state-sponsored hackers, although the company declined to name the responsible party. The latest cyberattack, attributed to Russian hackers, comes at a time of strained relations between the US and Russia. This announcement is the latest in a series of cyberattacks blamed on Russia, which has been a point of tension between the US and Russia under President Donald Trump's administration. Previous attacks attributed to Russian hackers include the exposure of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta's, emails and the internal workings of the Democratic National Committee. Russia's cybercrime underworld has traditionally focused on financial crimes rather than economic espionage. However, the recent indictment marks a significant shift, as it links the cybercrime operation to the Russian government's intelligence apparatus - a connection that has long been suspected by cybersecurity experts but not explicitly acknowledged by the US government. The Department of Justice's national security division has previously maintained that traditional government-to-government espionage is not criminal, but economic espionage crosses a line. Wednesday's indictment appears to blur the lines between government espionage and cybercrime more broadly. Russia has consistently refused to extradite or cooperate in the arrest of cybercriminals indicted in the US, although the DOJ has been able to apprehend many of them while they were traveling abroad. The Department of Justice has previously brought a comprehensive indictment against state-sponsored hackers, specifically Chinese military hackers in 2014. The indictment accused China of orchestrating economic espionage, targeting the theft of corporate secrets. The US has repeatedly urged China to cease its sponsorship of economic espionage against American companies. Despite this, the Chinese military hackers remain at large, and the DOJ has stated that it does not expect to be able to apprehend them unless Beijing chooses to extradite them or they travel abroad. The indictments were part of a broader strategy to publicly expose and condemn the cyber activity, making it clear that the US is aware of the actions and willing to hold perpetrators accountable. This story has been updated to reflect new developments.",

        "Text": "An adviser to a senator who attended the meeting said that the acknowledgment from the White House was essentially that the House GOP bill in its current form lacks the necessary votes to pass in the Senate. The meeting was attended by a small group of conservative senators who have expressed significant concerns about the bill. According to multiple aides, Vice President Mike Pence made a brief visit to the closed-door briefing with lawmakers. A senior Republican aide to a senator in the room said that the White House is considering significant changes to the Ryan bill. \"It's unrealistic to think that a single individual or a small group can impose their will on 535 people,\" said a Republican senator, emphasizing that revising the bill is a normal part of the legislative process. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas described the talks as \"productive\" and said that discussions are ongoing with the White House, the administration, the House, and the Senate. Cruz also expressed his dissatisfaction with the current House bill, stating that it doesn't adequately address the issue and that more work is needed. A senior administration official confirmed that the White House has continued to advocate for changes to the bill, including some tailored to moderate concerns, in an effort to secure conservative votes in the House. However, the official also noted that the White House did not challenge the claim that the House bill cannot pass the Senate in its current form. A White House official stated that they believe significant progress has been made in shaping language that will be appealing. However, the official declined to specify which changes have already been implemented, noting that the White House's private stance remains to advocate for an earlier sunset of the Medicaid expansion. \n\nThe House bill is currently facing significant challenges. Following a warning from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office that 24 million Americans could lose insurance coverage over the next decade if the bill is passed, moderate Republicans Reps. Leonard Lance and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen have publicly expressed their opposition to the legislation, and others have shared their concerns. \n\nModerates are not the only obstacle to overcome, however. House conservatives, particularly members of the Freedom Caucus, have been vocal in their opposition to the bill in its current form, and House Speaker Paul Ryan can only afford to lose 21 of his own members on the bill. \n\nIf House leaders address conservatives' concerns by rolling back Medicaid expansion sooner than 2020, they risk alienating moderates. Conversely, if they attempt to win over moderates by making tax credits more generous for older Americans, they may lose more conservatives. \n\nAnother pressing concern from the White House is whether the House bill can even pass through the Senate under reconciliation rules or the Byrd Rule. Lawmakers have long agreed that the best way to repeal and partially replace Obamacare is through the process of budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority vote in the Senate. However, budget reconciliation comes with strict requirements. Members cannot simply pass anything through reconciliation. \"A senior Republican aide to a senator present at a meeting on Tuesday revealed that there is a growing awareness that certain aspects of the House bill may not comply with the Senate's reconciliation rules. If this is the case, the Senate parliamentarian could potentially disallow certain parts of the legislation. Some conservatives are urging the White House to override the parliamentarian's decision, but if they are willing to take that political risk, they should do so with a bill that they truly believe will lead to lower premiums in the future, rather than the Ryan bill. According to the Republican aide, some senators are advocating for a more comprehensive package that would allow states to sell insurance across state lines, make additional changes to Medicaid, and help reduce drug prices, rather than overriding the parliamentarian to pass the House package.\"",

The body was found in a pool of blood with severe head injuries, Deputy Superintendent of Police Sammy Tavares revealed. The case is being treated as a murder, and an investigation is underway. One person has been arrested in connection with the woman's death, and authorities are also investigating whether she was sexually assaulted. The suspect had visible marks on his face that could have been inflicted by the victim during a struggle, Police Superintendent Kartik Kasyap told CNN. The results of the post-mortem examination have not been released yet. The woman was found to be carrying a British passport.

Last year, two men were acquitted of the rape and murder of British teenager Scarlett Keeling, whose body was found on Anjuna beach in Goa in 2008. Initially, police suggested that Keeling had drowned after taking drugs, but her mother disputed this account and launched a campaign for a second autopsy. The investigation later confirmed that Keeling was sexually assaulted before her death.

        "Text": "Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte took to the stage in The Hague on Wednesday night, basking in the adoration of his enthusiastic supporters as they cheered and whistled loudly. \"Tonight belongs to the Netherlands,\" he declared, \"after Brexit and the American elections, where we stood up against the wrong kind of populism.\" According to the Netherlands' state broadcaster NOS, voter turnout reached an impressive 81%, the highest in three decades. With 94% of the votes counted, Rutte's VVD party is projected to win 33 seats out of a total 150, narrowly ahead of Wilders' PVV party, which secured 20 seats, just one more than the mainstream Christian Democratic Appeal and D66 parties. Despite the celebrations, Rutte's party won eight fewer seats than in the 2012 election, when it claimed 41. The election was widely seen as a test of populist right-wing sentiment in Europe, ahead of the French Presidential election in April and the German national vote in September. Wilders, a vocal critic of mass immigration and the European Union, delivered a defiant speech, claiming he was \"part of the winners.\" \"Rutte says the elections have put a stop to the wrong type of populism,\" he said, \"but he hasn't gotten rid of me yet.\" In his speech to supporters, Rutte revealed that many European leaders had already contacted him to congratulate him on his victory. French President Francois Hollande issued a statement the next morning, hailing the result as a \"clear victory against extremism.\" \"The values of openness, respect for others, and faith in Europe's future are the only true response to the nationalist impulses and isolationism that are shaking the world,\" he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault congratulated the Dutch on Twitter, saying, \"Congratulations to the Dutch for preventing the rise of the far right and for their willingness to work towards a stronger Europe.\" Germany's foreign ministry echoed the sentiment, stating, \"The large majority of Dutch voters have rejected anti-European policies, which is good news. We need the Netherlands to be strong partners in a united Europe.\" Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentilioni tweeted that the \"anti-EU right\" had suffered a defeat in the Netherlands, adding, \"Let's work together for change and revitalize the European Union.\" Notably, Wilders' anti-EU allies across the continent, including French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, remained silent on the issue. Wilders, who had been leading polls for much of 2016, had campaigned on a platform of \"de-Islamification,\" calling for the closure of Islamic schools and the ban of the Quran and burqa. Despite his election loss, Wilders remained optimistic, saying, \"I still expect to see a 'European spring' for my supporters. Our influence has been immense, and our patriotic spring will continue to unfold. If the parties need me or the PVV for coalition talks, I'm happy to participate. If not, then they haven't seen the last of me.\" The Netherlands is deeply divided, according to Andre Krouwel, a political scientist at the Free University Amsterdam and owner of election website Kieskompas. \"The only conclusion from the election result is that the Dutch are deeply divided,\" he said, noting that the result is a very polarized outcome, with people abandoning centrist parties and the left-wing project. The left-wing parties together won 37 seats in the 150-seat parliament, Krouwel said.\n\nDespite his slight gain in seats, Krouwel believes that Geert Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom, will be almost powerless in the new political environment. \"The very vocal minority that dominated the elections and focused on Wilders has now abandoned him,\" Krouwel said, adding that nobody wants to form a coalition with him.\n\nThe election took place against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the Netherlands and Turkey, which had escalated over the Dutch government's refusal to allow Turkish ministers to address political rallies inside the country. Krouwel suggested that the war of words between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Dutch government may have boosted support for Mark Rutte, the leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy.\n\nThe Netherlands has a complex political landscape, with over 28 parties participating in the vote. Since no party won a majority of seats, a multi-party governing coalition will need to be formed. The final results may not be known until Friday, with 22 of 388 municipalities still to report.\n\nOnce the results are official, Rutte will begin negotiations to form a government. Potential coalition partners include the GroenLinks (Green Left) Party and the Socialist Party, which are poised to win 14 seats each. The PVDA (Labour) party, which had previously partnered with Rutte's party in government, suffered a significant decline in support, losing 29 seats.\n\nIn his victory speech, Rutte emphasized the need to unite the country and form a stable government. \"In the next couple of weeks and months, it is important to unite the country, to make sure that we form a stable government so that the country can be governed wisely for the next four years,\" he said.",

        "Text": "US District Court Judge Derrick Watson issued a scathing 43-page ruling just hours before President Trump's revised travel ban was set to take effect on Thursday. In his ruling, Watson criticized the government's arguments, saying they were \"palpably illogical.\" The revised ban would have temporarily barred travelers from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.\n\nWatson's ruling came after he heard Hawaii's case against the revised ban, which replaced the original ban signed by Trump in January that was blocked by another federal judge.\n\nHere are five key facts about Judge Derrick Watson:\n\n* He was nominated by President Barack Obama in 2012 to serve on the US District Court for the District of Hawaii.\n* Obama described Watson and six other nominees as \"qualified and ready to serve\" and praised their \"talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness.\"\n* The Senate unanimously confirmed Watson with a 94-0 vote.\n* Watson was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991. He attended Harvard College, graduating in 1988.\n* Watson made history as the fourth person of Native Hawaiian descent to serve as an Article III judge in the United States, according to the Congressional Asian Pacific Americans Caucus. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard praised Watson's confirmation, saying he would \"serve Hawaii with distinction and honor.\" Article III judges serve on the US Supreme Court, federal courts of appeals, and district courts. President Trump's travel bans are a significant topic in the news. Watson, a seasoned lawyer, has a strong background in the law. Prior to becoming a judge at the US District Court, Watson worked as an assistant United States attorney in the District of Hawaii and Northern District of California. Before that, he was a partner at a San Francisco law firm, where he focused on product liability and environmental cost recovery litigation. Additionally, Watson served as a US Army Reserve captain. Watson has also done pro bono work throughout his career. In his confirmation hearing questionnaire, Watson revealed that he spent hundreds of hours representing pro bono clients while in private practice. Specifically, he supervised a team of attorneys and paralegals who brought human trafficking and wage and hour claims on behalf of two Mexican nationals against a chain of Bay Area taquerias. After conducting extensive discovery, including much of it in Spanish, they recovered significant sums for both plaintiffs and their families. Watson has also worked on landlord/tenant cases and partnered with a civil rights group to challenge a high school district's electoral system, which prevented the election of a Hispanic member. ",

        "Text": "The 297-foot MS Caledonian Sky crashed into the coral reefs at Raja Ampat on March 4. Raja Ampat, known for its stunning and untouched coral reefs, is often included on lists of the world's most beautiful beaches. The destruction of the coral reefs, which took nature hundreds of years to develop, was caused by the Caledonian Sky and its captain in just one day, according to Djoko Hartoyo, of the Information and Law Bureau of the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs. \"It's impossible to restore that part of Raja Ampat,\" Hartoyo said. \"All the fish that normally inhabit that area were gone.\" The ship destroyed nearly 140,000 square feet of reef, making it one of the worst environmental disasters in the area, said Ketut Putra, vice president of Conservation International Indonesia. The ship crashed into one of the best diving spots in the region, Putra added. Noble Caledonia, the cruise company operating the vessel, apologized for the incident and acknowledged that the ship had gone aground, but did not provide a reason for the accident. The company said it is working with local experts to help restore the reef and is establishing a fund to support the local economy and repair efforts. However, local residents are outraged by the damage, which not only harms the environment but also threatens the livelihoods of communities that depend on healthy reefs, said Doug Meikle, who runs a website supporting the local Papuan community's tourist accommodation association. \"It's astonishing that the ship was so close to the reef,\" said Ruben Sauyai, owner of the nearby Koranu Fyak Bungalows and president of the professional divers association in Raja Ampat. Sauyai was approximately 200 feet away with some divers when the incident occurred. \"You could hear the ship crushing the reef,\" he recalled.\n\nMeikle believes there is a strong case for banning ships of this size from the area. \"In addition to the risk of accidents, anchoring such large ships causes immense damage to reefs,\" he said.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about potential criminal charges. While insurance may cover some of the environmental damage, Indonesian authorities believe the captain committed a crime and could face prison time if convicted. \"Insurance coverage may pay for environmental damages, but it does not excuse the captain's criminal actions,\" authorities stated.\n\nThe company described the master on duty at the time of the crash as one of the world's leading expedition captains, with many years of experience.\n\nThe incident highlights a larger problem affecting the local tourism industry and economy. Putra, a local official, expressed concern that the damaged reef will deter tourists and reduce the number of fish in the area due to their damaged habitat. \"I'm genuinely worried,\" he said.\n\nCruise ships are also a source of pollution that threatens coral reefs, particularly in Southeast Asia, according to Marine Insight. The ships often dispose of massive amounts of sewage, food waste, and oily bilge water into the ocean. A 2016 study published in Nature found that the shipping industry is a significant contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in Asia. \"While coral reefs worldwide face ongoing environmental threats, the Great Barrier Reef experienced its worst mass bleaching event on record last year, according to a report from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. The report attributes the surge in devastating bleaching events to rising water temperatures.\"",

        "Text": "The National University of Singapore (NUS) has been named the best university in Asia by the Times Higher Education supplement, outperforming strong competition from China, which otherwise dominated the top three spots. According to Phil Baty, editor of the Times Higher Education Rankings, NUS has set a benchmark for the continent, and in his opinion, \"Asian universities can now rightfully challenge the traditional Western elite universities in the US and UK.\" The influential London-based guide evaluates universities based on 13 performance indicators, including research output and teaching environment. Peking University took second place, followed by Tsinghua University, both located in Beijing, China. While the top five institutions remained largely unchanged, with Singapore's Nanyang Technological University and the University of Hong Kong coming in fourth and fifth respectively, there were significant movements elsewhere in the rankings. India made a notable effort, with its representation more than doubling from 16 to 33 institutions, while Pakistan's presence tripled from two to seven. For the first time, Japan emerged as the most-represented nation, with 69 universities featured in the ranking, accounting for nearly a quarter of the 300-strong list. Thailand was the most represented country in Southeast Asia, with 10 universities ranked. However, the researchers noted that Malaysia showed the greatest potential among emerging university nations, with the University of Malaya taking a top-60 position in its first appearance on the list. The university attributed its success to increased international enrollment and the introduction of English-language programs to cater to this shift. Mohd Amin Jalaludin, vice-chancellor of the University of Malaya, expressed a different view, suggesting that smaller countries like Malaysia should be compared with giants like China, given their differing strengths and challenges. \"Singapore has celebrated another triumph in the realm of education, marking its second recent achievement in the field. In December, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey revealed that Singaporean teenagers are globally top-ranked in math, science, and reading. Notably, Singaporean students showcased knowledge and skills equivalent to almost two extra years of education compared to their peers in the US, France, and Sweden.

At the time of the attack, Kim was at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, en route to Macau, when two women used the highly toxic VX nerve agent to wipe his face, resulting in his death within 20 minutes, according to Malaysian police. Both South Korea and Malaysia have accused North Korea of being responsible for Kim's murder, while North Korea has vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nMalaysian authorities did not publicly identify Kim's body until last week, after obtaining a DNA sample from the child of the deceased, according to Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. However, Hamidi declined to elaborate on how the DNA sample was obtained. Kim's family is believed to be in hiding, with his son, Kim Han Sol, making a rare public appearance in a 40-second video posted online by the Cheollima Civil Defense group last week. The identity of the son was verified by a South Korean National Intelligence Service spokesman to CNN.\n\nThe dispute over Kim Jong Nam's body has escalated into a diplomatic row between Malaysia and North Korea. North Korea demanded that Malaysia hand over the body, citing Kim's nationality, but Malaysian authorities refused, insisting on a DNA match before releasing it. This led to both countries imposing dual travel bans, prohibiting Malaysians from leaving North Korea and North Koreans from traveling out of Malaysia. Nine Malaysians are currently in North Korea, while the number of North Koreans in Malaysia is unclear. Malaysian police believe that three individuals wanted for questioning in connection with Kim's murder are hiding in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Four suspects are still at large and are believed to have returned to North Korea, while two individuals are currently in custody in connection with the case. Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam are both facing murder charges and could face the death penalty if convicted. According to authorities from both Indonesia and Vietnam, the women were led to believe they were participating in a prank TV show. However, Malaysian authorities have disputed this claim, suggesting that the women's involvement was not as innocent as initially thought. ",

        "Text": "A group of dairy drivers claimed they were entitled to overtime pay for certain tasks they had completed, but the company disagreed. The issue ultimately came down to a matter of punctuation, specifically the Oxford comma. An appeals court ruled in favor of the drivers, stating that the ambiguity in the guidelines was due to the lack of an Oxford comma. The relevant section of the law reads: \"The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: (1) Agricultural produce; (2) Meat and fish products; and (3) Perishable foods.\" The court's decision hinged on the interpretation of \"packing for shipment\" - was it a distinct activity or simply a part of the larger process of \"distribution\"? The drivers argued that they distributed perishable food, but did not pack it. The court agreed, finding that the lack of an Oxford comma led to ambiguity and, under labor laws, ambiguity is often resolved in favor of the laborers. As the judge noted, \"For want of a comma, we have this case.\" The irony of the situation is that Maine state guidelines for drafting documents do not include Oxford commas, despite the importance of clarity in legal language. \"For the sake of fairness, it's worth noting that there are guidelines available to help prevent unclear language, which could potentially benefit even the most fastidious drivers seeking to receive what they're owed. (To all you Oxford comma enthusiasts, feel free to revel in your triumph. We're proud to follow AP Style at CNN, which doesn't use the Oxford comma.)\"\n\nI made some minor changes to improve clarity and flow, while also maintaining the original tone and humor.

        "Text": "The authors of a new paper are sounding the alarm, warning that the resilience of the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef, is rapidly declining. A series of aerial and underwater surveys has revealed that a severe heatwave in 2016, which saw record-breaking sea temperatures in Australia, triggered the most devastating and widespread coral bleaching event on record. A staggering 50% of the reef is now severely bleached, with a further 91% showing signs of bleaching, according to Sean Connolly, a leading expert on coral reefs. \"In just 27 years, coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef has halved,\" Connolly said. \"It's gone from 28% to 13%, and our preliminary estimates suggest we've lost half that amount again in the past year. This level of mortality is unprecedented.\" Rising sea temperatures, linked to global warming, are causing coral bleaching, where the expulsion of algae turns the reefs white and deprives them of their main energy source. If left unchecked, sustained bleaching will lead to coral death. The recent heatwave's impact was worse than expected, sparking serious concerns about the future of the reef ecosystem. The study highlights the bleaching of hardy, century-old reefs as a particular cause for concern, as slow-growing corals may not have time to recover. \"If all the coral bleaches and dies, it's no longer a coral reef,\" Connolly warned. Coral skeletons are rapidly colonized by algae, which turns them dark in color, according to David Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong's Swire Institute of Marine Sciences. Eventually, these skeletons collapse, resulting in the complete loss of the natural habitat for fish and other marine life, Baker added. The paper's authors also concluded that the reef has not adapted to high temperatures over time, whether it was bleached or not. Connolly noted that as temperatures continue to rise, reefs will eventually die off and be replaced by more stress-tolerant species, such as seaweeds. \"We've known for decades that this would happen, and unfortunately, our international system of government and policy has failed to take relatively inexpensive action to mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change, not just on reefs, but on other ecosystems we rely on,\" he said. The United Nations estimates that around 275 million people globally rely directly on reefs for their livelihood and sustenance, and reefs provide nurseries for about a quarter of the world's fish. The Great Barrier Reef is worth approximately $3.7 billion annually to the Australian economy through fishing and tourism, and supports around 70,000 jobs, according to Connolly. \"If reefs are unable to provide the same source of livelihood, we're looking at a potentially unfolding human tragedy over the decades,\" he added. Last year's mass coral bleaching event was the third on record for the Great Barrier Reef, and scientists suspect that a fourth may already be underway. The Great Barrier Marine Park Authority is currently conducting aerial surveys of the reef, and last week, Greenpeace released photos and video footage highlighting the ongoing damage. \"Greenpeace has recently conducted a documentation mission to the Great Barrier Reef with a marine biologist, and the findings are deeply disturbing,\" said Alix Foster Vander Elst, Campaigner for Greenpeace Australia Pacific. \"We expect to learn the full extent of this year's disaster in the coming days or weeks.\"",

        "Text": "Speaking in Tokyo ahead of stops in Seoul and Beijing, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson criticized the past 20 years of diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea, saying they have been unsuccessful. \"The approach of the past 20 years has failed, so we have 20 years of a failed approach,\" Tillerson stated at a press conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. China is set to present its own plan to Tillerson on Saturday, according to a senior Chinese diplomat who spoke to CNN on Thursday. The Chinese proposal calls for North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile tests and nuclear activities, as well as for the US and South Korea to halt large-scale military exercises that have been a source of tension with Pyongyang. According to Xiao Qian, director general of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, North Korea wants to see the US take action first to demonstrate its commitment, and vice versa. China's proposal suggests doing these things simultaneously, Xiao Qian told CNN in an exclusive interview. This is the second time in as many weeks that China has floated this plan, which was previously rejected by the US State Department. \"There is no equivalence between North Korea's illegal missile and nuclear activities and our lawful, longstanding joint security exercises with our allies in the region,\" said Mark Toner, acting State Department spokesman, in response to China's initial proposal. North Korea has also rejected the proposal, with Pak Myong Ho, chargé d'affaires at the North Korean embassy in Beijing, rebuffing China's proposal in a rare and hastily called press conference on Thursday. The North Korean government has stated that it will continue to strengthen its defense and preemptive strike capabilities in response to the US and its allies' continued nuclear threats and military drills along the country's border. Speaking together in Tokyo, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida reaffirmed their commitment to standing united against North Korea's provocations. Kishida emphasized that Japan will take on a greater role in the alliance, while Tillerson suggested that the US needs to stop pouring money into a solution that isn't working. He noted that the US provided $1.35 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, primarily for food aid and energy assistance, but that this effort has been met with North Korea's continued development of nuclear capabilities and increased missile launches. Analysts say that there are few new options for North Korea policy, and that Secretary Tillerson's comments lack a clear vision for the future. According to John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Affairs, the US policy towards North Korea is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple talking point about the lack of progress. The US, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia have repeatedly attempted to negotiate a solution with North Korea through the Six-Party Talks, which began in 2003, but have so far been unsuccessful. The sanctions imposed on Pyongyang are among the most severe in history, yet North Korea's nuclear and missile programs seem to be accelerating. In a CNN interview, Xiao addressed criticism that China is not doing enough to stop North Korea, arguing that the situation is complex and cannot be resolved simply. Xiao suggested that the key to resolving the issue lies in direct talks between the US and North Korea, rather than relying solely on economic pressure. \"This is a very complicated situation,\" Xiao said. \"The North Korean government has long claimed that it is the US threat that forces them to consider alternative options, including nuclearization. So, to a large extent, it is up to the US and North Korea to sit down and talk, and find a way to resolve the issue.\" Xiao also denied allegations that China has been systematically retaliating against South Korean businesses in response to its opposition to the THAAD missile defense system. However, he warned that if the US and South Korea proceed with the deployment, there will be consequences, which will ultimately be borne by the Americans and South Koreans.",

In a secretly recorded video, Loeuillet downplayed the systematic murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust, claiming that there were not six million deaths. He made these comments in a documentary that will be shown in France. Loeuillet has denied the allegations and threatened to take legal action against the journalists involved. However, his statement has been met with criticism, as French law strictly prohibits Holocaust denial. In response to the controversy, the National Front's Secretary-General, Nicolas Bay, suspended Loeuillet and announced that he will face a disciplinary hearing, where he could potentially be expelled from the party. This is not the first time that the National Front has been embroiled in controversy over anti-Semitic comments. In 2011, Le Pen, who is now the party's leader, sought to distance herself from allegations of anti-Semitism by expelling her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from the party. Her father had made comments denying the Holocaust, and referred to the gas chambers used by the Nazis as \"a detail of history.\" The expulsion caused a significant public rift between the two. Meanwhile, Le Pen is facing increased scrutiny ahead of the French presidential election, with allegations that several members of her staff were paid for non-existent jobs at the European Parliament. Initially, she admitted to the payments, but later denied making the statement. Marine Le Pen's already strained relationship with Europe was further complicated when European Parliament members voted to strip her of her parliamentary immunity in a case involving violent images she posted on Twitter. The inquiry was launched under a French law that prohibits the distribution of violent images, following Le Pen's December 2015 tweets featuring images of ISIS militant killings. Under French law, the maximum penalty for distributing such images is three years in prison and a fine of up to 15,000 (approximately $79,000). It's worth noting that the loss of her immunity only applies to this specific case and does not affect the investigation being conducted by OLAF. ",

        "Text": "President Trump was questioned by a German reporter about why his White House had cited a Fox News report claiming that the British surveillance agency GCHQ had wiretapped Trump Tower during the election campaign. The President did not apologize to the British government after they dismissed the report as \"ridiculous.\" Turning to Chancellor Merkel, who was previously revealed to have had her phone tapped by the US National Security Agency through Edward Snowden's leaks, Trump remarked, \"At least we have something in common.\" Trump seemed irritated to be asked the question by the German reporter, amidst a two-week controversy sparked by his earlier tweets claiming that former President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps against him last year. Senior members of the intelligence committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate have confirmed that there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower. Trump also criticized NATO nations that do not pay their \"fair share\" for defense, as he stood alongside Merkel. He stated that many nations owe \"vast sums\" of unpaid dues to the organization, adding, \"These nations must pay what they owe.\" However, the President also expressed strong support for the NATO alliance, despite previously questioning its relevance during his election campaign. The German government fell short of its NATO target of 2% last year, reaching only 1.19%, and although it has committed to increasing defense spending this year, it will still not meet the target. President Trump welcomed German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House, following his earlier criticism of her. Trump also emphasized the importance of respecting \"historic institutions,\" which may have been a nod to the European Union, a key player in Western security. However, Trump's administration has previously expressed skepticism about the EU. In her remarks, Merkel acknowledged past tensions with Trump and sought to build a new relationship with the third US president she has encountered as German Chancellor. She emphasized the importance of direct communication, saying, \"It's always much better to talk to one another than about one another.\" Merkel also expressed relief that Trump supports NATO and has committed to the Minsk process, which aims to monitor the ceasefire in Ukraine and find a solution to the crisis. The meeting comes at a critical time for US-German relations, which have been strained by Trump's political views. Merkel had previously congratulated Trump on his election win, while also defending Western values, which she felt were under threat due to his stance on issues like immigration. Germany, the most influential power in the European Union, has also been concerned about Trump's criticism of NATO and the skepticism within his administration about the EU. The meeting aims to foster a personal connection between the two leaders, who have distinct temperaments and instincts. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, known for her cautious and analytical approach to politics, formed a strong bond with President Barack Obama, with whom she shared a similar outlook. In contrast, President Donald Trump is more outspoken and impulsive, with little patience for diplomatic formalities. Trump has been vocal in his criticism of Merkel's decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany, a move that has been a contentious issue in her re-election campaign. Despite past tensions, both sides are likely to try to put their differences aside and move forward. Merkel, a pragmatic leader, is now dealing with her third US president and is seeking to establish a working relationship with Trump without compromising her own values. An administration official stated before the meeting that Trump hopes to seek Merkel's counsel on how to navigate his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who allegedly ordered cyber-meddling in the 2016 presidential election and attempted to support Trump's campaign. Merkel plans to appeal to Trump's business-focused mindset by bringing the CEOs of Siemens and BMW to Washington, companies that employ thousands of American workers. She hopes to leverage this point when discussing trade issues, including Germany's trade surplus, which has been a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

        "Text": "In a recent interview with an American magazine, Angela Merkel, the former businesswoman, shared her philosophy on life and her political views. One characteristic that defines Merkel is her meticulous preparation and her ability to understand her opponents. It's unlikely that meeting with Donald Trump would intimidate her, as she has a track record of dealing with strong personalities. Throughout her career, she has clashed with leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Silvio Berlusconi, Gerhard Schröder, and Alexis Tsipras, all of whom have attempted to assert their dominance over her. However, Merkel has consistently demonstrated a calm and composed demeanor, even in the face of intimidation.\n\nFor instance, during her 2007 visit to Russia, Putin famously brought his dog Koni into the meeting room, which Merkel reportedly found unsettling. Nevertheless, she used small talk to diffuse the situation and later imposed economic sanctions on Russia, which had a significant impact on the country. Merkel's approach to dealing with these leaders is often likened to that of an older sister who is accustomed to handling the mischievous behavior of her younger brothers.\n\nDespite her tough exterior, Merkel is known for being warm, personable, and charming when meeting with other leaders. During my research for my book, \"Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader,\" I heard stories about how she won over both David Cameron and Barack Obama by teaching them how to swear in German. Additionally, she is said to have a impressive impression of former Pope Benedict, which Putin reportedly found particularly amusing. We caught a glimpse of this more human side of Merkel in 2012, when she unexpectedly broke off G8 talks on Syria to watch the penalty shootout of a Champions League final. However, Merkel is also notorious for her attention to detail. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a holder of a doctorate in quantum mechanics, is renowned for her meticulous approach and unwavering patience. Unlike Donald Trump, who often tweets in the early hours of the morning, Merkel typically takes days or even weeks to respond to matters. When faced with a problem, she meticulously gathers facts before making a decision. As she has acknowledged, she has honed the art of cautious deliberation. In fact, the Germans have coined a verb, \"Merkeln,\" which means to be indecisive or to withhold opinion, and it was named the Youth Word of the Year in Germany in 2015. However, Merkel will not be swayed or intimidated by Trump's bombastic posturing. As a pastor's daughter who grew up under communist rule and speaks Russian, she is unlikely to welcome Trump's overtures towards Putin. Similarly, Germany, a significant exporter of goods, is unlikely to be enamored with Trump's protectionist policies. Should Trump be concerned? Should he accommodate his awkward German ally? Or could he simply ignore her? It would be unwise to do so. Despite Trump's desire for a more cordial relationship with Moscow, the European Union is a vital trading partner for the US. Millions of American jobs rely on trade with the EU. Damaging this relationship would make it challenging to bring back jobs to the American Rust Belt, the region that elected Trump. To establish positive relations with Germany, Trump must adopt a very different approach. Upsetting Europe's strongest power is simply not an option. ",

        "Text": "National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster had a \"cordial\" conversation with his British counterpart on Thursday to discuss Press Secretary Sean Spicer's comments about a Fox News report that alleged British intelligence helped wiretap Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. According to a White House official, McMaster described Spicer's comments as \"unintentional\" and assured his counterpart that their concerns were heard and would be relayed to the White House. The official added that there were at least two calls from British officials on Thursday, including a conversation between Spicer and the British ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch. A senior administration official told CNN that Spicer and McMaster effectively apologized to the British government for the comments.\n\nThe White House later confirmed that Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May, had separate conversations with Spicer and McMaster on Thursday. According to one official, Spicer and McMaster explained that Spicer was simply pointing to public reports and did not endorse any specific story. The UK government had earlier protested to the Trump administration, calling the claims \"ridiculous\" and urging them to be ignored. According to May's spokesman, the US administration has since provided assurances that the allegations will not be repeated. During a Thursday press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer read aloud allegations made by legal analyst Andrew Napolitano on Fox News the previous Tuesday. According to Napolitano, three intelligence sources had informed Fox News that President Obama had ordered surveillance on Trump, bypassing the NSA and CIA by using the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) instead. Spicer quoted Napolitano as saying, \"President Obama went outside the chain of command... he didn't use the NSA, he didn't use the CIA... he used GCHQ.\"\n\nThe strong statement from Downing Street, which followed a rare and blunt statement from GCHQ itself, indicated that the British government was outraged by the US's incendiary allegations. GCHQ quickly responded, calling the claims \"nonsense\" and urging them to be ignored. The agency rarely comments on specific operations, and its blunt language was unusual.\n\nLater, during a regular press briefing, a Downing Street spokesperson said that the UK had sought and received assurances that the allegations would not be repeated. The spokesperson noted that this development showed the administration did not take the allegations seriously. The spokesperson also emphasized the close special relationship between the White House and Downing Street, which allows for concerns to be raised and addressed as needed.\n\nBritain is particularly sensitive to the suggestion that the US would use GCHQ to keep \"American fingerprints\" off its surveillance activities. The UK's intelligence agencies work closely with their US, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand counterparts as part of the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence sharing agreement. The spokesman for May argued that the pact precludes the kind of spying alleged by Napolitano, stating, \"In fact, under the 'Five Eyes' intelligence agreement, we cannot use each other's capabilities to circumvent the law. It's a situation that wouldn't arise.\" The controversy over GCHQ's relationship with the NSA was sparked by claims made by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. In 2015, a UK tribunal censured GCHQ for not being transparent enough about how it shares internet surveillance data with the NSA. Susan Rice, former national security adviser in the Obama administration, expressed concern that Spicer's claims could damage the intelligence-sharing relationship between the US and UK, tweeting, \"The cost of falsely blaming our closest ally for something this consequential cannot be overstated.\" Tim Farron, leader of the UK Liberal Democrat party, described the White House claim as \"shameful\" and warned that it could harm US and UK security, tweeting, \"Trump is compromising the vital UK-US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment.\" The Senate Intelligence Committee had previously stated that it found no evidence of Trump Tower being under surveillance in 2016, contradicting Trump's earlier claims. Committee chair Richard Burr said, \"Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016.\" On the same day, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN that he had not seen any evidence of a wiretap or surveillance order against Trump Tower. Representative Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, called for an apology from Trump for his \"reckless\" comment on wiretapping, while Representative Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, warned that Trump's comments and the White House's decision to stand by them were undermining the President's credibility and depleting his political capital at a critical time. Trump originally made the allegations against Obama on March 4, tweeting, \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" Two weeks later, in an interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to walk back his original wiretapping allegations, stating, \"Wiretap covers a lot of different things. I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\"",

        "Text": "Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump, expressed concerns about Trump's decision to stand by his wiretap allegations. During an appearance on CNN's Erin Burnett \"Outfront,\" Santorum warned that Trump's actions are causing more harm to himself than to his political opponents. \"We're no longer in an election cycle, and Trump's behavior is not directed at his opponents,\" Santorum said. \"Instead, he's throwing himself off course.\" As president, Trump has no rival to blame, and his actions are only hurting his own reputation, Santorum argued. \"People don't care about Barack Obama anymore; they care about the president, and that's Trump,\" he said. Santorum suggested that Trump focus on issues that resonate with Americans, such as immigration, healthcare, taxes, and trade. \"I'd like to see the president speak from a position of authority, based on what he knows, rather than what he's read in the news,\" he added. As president, Trump is expected to have access to better information than what's reported in the media, Santorum noted, and he should be communicating with the public based on his own knowledge and expertise.

The stolen laptop cannot be traced or erased remotely, leaving the confidential data at risk of being discovered. The agent described the incident as a compromise of national security, according to an official. In addition to the laptop, the thief also stole the agent's lapel pins, which granted access to security details protecting prominent figures such as Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, the Pope, and the United Nations General Assembly. The stolen items were found in a backpack taken from the agent's driveway. Although the backpack has been recovered, the laptop remains missing. The Secret Service has confirmed the theft and launched an investigation. In a statement, Secret Service spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan emphasized that the stolen laptop was equipped with multiple security layers, including full disk encryption, and should not have contained classified information. The investigation is ongoing, and the Secret Service is urging anyone with information about the crime to contact the New York Police Department and the US Secret Service New York Field Office.  ",

        "Text": "At a joint press conference in Seoul with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that Washington's policy of \"strategic patience\" had come to an end. When asked about the possibility of military conflict, Tillerson emphasized that the US does not seek a conflict, but would respond appropriately if North Korea's actions threaten South Korean or US forces. He also stated that if North Korea's weapons program poses a significant threat, the US would consider taking action. Later that day, President Donald Trump tweeted about North Korea's behavior, accusing it of \"playing\" the US for years and criticizing China for not doing enough to help. Tillerson's remarks come as US intelligence officials and the Defense Department anticipate that North Korea may soon conduct new missile and nuclear tests. The Secretary of State is currently on a three-country tour of the region, amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula following recent North Korean missile launches and fears of an impending nuclear test. In Tokyo, Tillerson had previously stated that efforts to halt North Korea's nuclear development over the past 20 years have been unsuccessful, and it is time for a new policy. He did not provide details, but it is clear that he sees China, his next destination, as a key part of Washington's new approach. A senior Chinese official told CNN that Beijing plans to present its own plan to Tillerson during his visit. Despite Beijing's suggestion that the US should suspend joint military exercises with South Korea as a gesture of goodwill towards Pyongyang, Tillerson rejected the idea. The US does not believe that the conditions are right for talks to resume, whether they are five-party or six-party talks. \"Conditions must change before talks can resume,\" Tillerson emphasized. He also urged China to abandon its opposition to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system or take steps to address the threat that makes THAAD necessary. The missile defense system is currently being deployed in South Korea's south. Additionally, Tillerson called on Beijing to refrain from any retaliatory action against South Korea, citing allegations that businesses and the tourism industry are being targeted for Seoul's stance on the issue. \"China's economic retaliation against South Korea is inappropriate and troubling,\" he said. Earlier in the day, Tillerson visited the demilitarized zone, the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea, becoming the highest-ranking US official to do so since President Barack Obama in 2012. During his visit, he met with some of the over 28,000 US troops stationed in the region and toured the Joint Security Area, where North and South Korean soldiers stand facing each other. A Military Armistice Commission briefing room straddles the border. Tillerson's visit to South Korea comes at a sensitive time, as the country is preparing for a snap election on May 9 following the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye last week. The election has raised questions about the future of the THAAD system, with some candidates calling for its deployment to be reviewed by the National Assembly. The US is looking forward to a productive relationship with the next President of South Korea, whoever the people may elect, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. He also expressed his expectation that the new government in South Korea will continue to support the THAAD system. Tillerson emphasized the need for a new approach in North Korea policy, stating that the US has spent $1.3 billion in assistance since 1995, yet North Korea has detonated nuclear weapons and launched ballistic missiles in return. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump suggested that he would be willing to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but Tillerson ruled out the possibility of talks at this time. Instead, he called on China to fully implement UN-approved sanctions against North Korea and stated that the US will urge other countries to join future actions against the regime.",

        "Text": "\"I've spent 32 years, three months, and 14 days behind bars,\" Wilson told CNN. He was just 30 years old when he was first imprisoned, convicted of murder. Now, at 62, he is finally a free man after evidence emerged that the prosecution had withheld crucial information in his case all those years ago. A Superior Court Judge, Laura Priver, ruled that Wilson's constitutional right to a fair trial had been violated, leading to the vacating of his conviction and his immediate release. Just one day later, Wilson walked out of prison a free man.\n\n\"I always say, don't stop fighting, don't give up,\" Wilson emphasized. \"It seems like that's what the justice system wants you to do, but I never lost hope. And I owe it all to the grace of God, who brought me in contact with Loyola Law School.\" Wilson's attorneys and students from the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent worked tirelessly to uncover the new evidence, which revealed that the prosecution had withheld critical information during his trial.\n\nThroughout his 32-year ordeal, Wilson maintained his innocence, despite being arrested for the 1984 stabbing death of a 21-year-old man who was sleeping in his truck. His girlfriend, Saladena Bishop, was also in the truck at the time of the murder. Wilson's attorneys pointed out that the prosecution had withheld key evidence related to the main witness, Bishop, who had picked Wilson out of a lineup only after a police officer pointed to his photo and asked, \"What about him?\" Before Wilson's trial, police had deemed Bishop an unreliable witness due to her history of filing false reports, including one accusing someone of kidnapping and attempted rape. Bishop's friend had testified in court that Bishop had a history of violence, revealing that he had stabbed his girlfriend in the past and was likely responsible for the crime. However, Loyola's innocence project claims that none of this crucial evidence was shared with Wilson's defense attorney. As a result, Wilson has spent half his life behind bars, missing out on 32 years of milestones, including Christmas dinners, graduations, and even the birth of his granddaughter. Yet, despite his ordeal, Wilson remains unbroken, saying, \"I'm past it. I just want to get something to eat right now and love my family.\" His sister, Gwen Wilson, chimed in, \"Anything he wants.\"\n\nThe emotional reunion was palpable as Wilson walked out of the LA County jail, flanked by his daughter and sister, and surrounded by a sea of cameras and reporters. Wilson's daughter, Catrina Burke, struggled to contain her tears when asked about the moment she heard her father was finally free. \"I couldn't breathe. I started crying,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"I don't have words. I don't have words at all. But I still have a parent.\" Wilson's granddaughter snuggled up against him, her eyes welling up with tears as he spoke. Meanwhile, his sister, Gwen Wilson, beamed with pride, choosing to focus on the joy of her brother's release rather than the injustice he had faced. \"We just needed to love on him and keep him encouraged through it all. All we can do is keep our heads up and trust that God's grace has brought us to this day,\" she said. Wilson's 96-year-old mother, who had fought tirelessly for her son's release from her home in Missouri, was overjoyed to finally see her son walk free. She had always believed in her son's innocence. As he walked out, he knew he had to call her right away. \"I spoke with her,\" he said with a smile, \"and let me tell you, my 96-year-old mother is a force to be reckoned with - she's a pit bull in the best sense of the word.\" Wilson's sister Gwen jumped in to provide evidence, repeating their mother's exact words when Wilson called her after his release: \"I didn't ask if you were okay. I asked, 'Are you out?' And indeed, he was.\"",

        "Text": "Despite growing bipartisan agreement that the wiretapping allegations are unfounded, President Trump has refused to back down, leaving his aides and allies scrambling for excuses and explanations. In a recent news conference, Trump even brought up the notion of \"spying microwaves\" - a claim made by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway - to justify his claims. This move not only embarrassed German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose phone was once tapped by the NSA, but also reinforced Trump's affinity for conspiracy theories. This is not a new phenomenon for Trump, who in 2011 launched a precursor to his presidential campaign by embracing the birther movement. He spent years clinging to the theory that President Obama was not born in the US, despite the release of his birth certificate. Now, Trump appears to have found a new conspiracy theory that may have equal staying power. His recent wiretapping claims have drawn parallels to birtherism, with Trump positioning himself as the great unmasker of Obama, a fraudulent figure who is not who he says he is. For Trump's base, Obama has become the embodiment of the \"deep state,\" a villain who is supposedly working against the President's interests. \"Despite widespread skepticism from Congress, the press, even Fox News hosts, and intelligence agencies, Trump finds himself isolated, a familiar comfort zone. Like his birtherism claims, Trump is pitted against nearly everyone, allowing him to maintain the persona of the embattled, populist outsider, even from the White House. The Justice Department has provided wiretap documents to Congress. Key to his wiretapping claims is the promise of a big reveal, just as it was with birtherism. Initially, Trump claimed investigators had been sent to Hawaii to uncover the truth. As that narrative wore thin, his relationship with birtherism devolved into a constant cliffhanger, and the same is true now with his wiretapping claims. Does Trump genuinely believe Obama wiretapped or spied on him at Trump Tower or elsewhere? For now, Trump seems content to string the public along, repeating what he's said for five years about Obama's origins: 'tay tuned.' Let the countdown begin.\" ",

        "Text": "Sources familiar with the classified report's contents spoke on condition of anonymity, saying that the report does not support President Trump's unsubstantiated claims. When asked if the report would confirm Trump's allegations, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes told CNN, \"I don't think so,\" as he entered a room to review the report. Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, expressed absolute confidence that the report would not back up Trump's claim. \"There's no question about this,\" Schiff said. \"The president's previous statements and tweets have no basis in fact.\" The Justice Department declined to comment on the report's contents, but earlier in the day, a spokeswoman confirmed that the department had delivered the document to the relevant committees. The department's spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, said that the Justice Department had complied with requests from the House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees seeking information about surveillance during the 2016 election. The House Intelligence Committee has scheduled a hearing for Monday, featuring National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and FBI Director James Comey. The Senate Intelligence Committee announced that it will hold a hearing on March 30 to investigate Russia's meddling in the US election. House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes released a statement confirming receipt of the report from the Justice Department and part of the information requested from the National Security Agency. However, he noted that the committee still has not received information requested from the CIA and FBI, which is necessary to determine whether information collected on US persons was mishandled and leaked. Before receiving classified documents from the DOJ, both Nunes and Schiff had already explicitly stated that Trump Tower was not wiretapped. However, Nunes has left open the possibility that communications between Trump's aides and others may have been incidentally collected. \n\nAccording to Nunes, \"We need to figure out what happened here, there are a lot of unanswered questions. I don't want anyone jumping to conclusions on either side of this, except for the fact that we know Obama didn't physically wiretap Trump Tower. But everything else is still unknown.\" The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee have also stated that there was no surveillance of Trump Tower during or after the 2016 election. \n\nRepublican Rep. Will Hurd, speaking on CNN's \"OutFront,\" stated that while he hadn't yet read the DOJ report, he believes \"there's no evidence to suggest\" Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Trump has continued to stand by his claim, repeating it again on Friday while standing alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" Trump said, referencing the US National Security Agency's past tapping of Merkel's phone.

        "Text": "Security forces opened fire, killing the attacker during the morning assault at the airport. The attacker, who was known to the police and intelligence services, had been involved in a shooting at a police traffic stop north of Paris earlier that morning, according to Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux. He fled the scene, leaving a police officer injured, who is currently undergoing treatment. At the airport, the attacker attempted to overpower a soldier and seize her weapon, but was shot dead by two of her colleagues, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. This marked the fourth attack against security forces deployed as part of France's Operation Sentinel, which was launched in response to the Paris terror attacks in January 2015. Le Roux praised the swift response of security forces at the airport, where no one else was injured. An investigation is underway. The airport was evacuated as an elite operations unit and bomb squad officers rushed to the scene, and a search for explosives was completed. Air traffic at both Orly South and Orly West terminals remains suspended, with some flights being rerouted to Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport, according to Augustin de Romanet, president of Paris Airports. De Romanet also discouraged people from coming to the scene and urged travelers to avoid the airport and follow instructions. With roads around the airport closed, some travelers had attempted to walk to the airport with their luggage, but the police have urged the public to avoid the area and not cross the security perimeter.

        "Text": "The boat, carrying up to 160 people, was attacked early Friday by an unknown assailant, according to International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Joel Millman. At least 24 of the injured are receiving treatment at nearby hospitals, while dozens more remain unaccounted for, Millman said. Witnesses have provided conflicting accounts of whether a helicopter or a military vessel opened fire on the boat, but the IOM has not received any claims of responsibility for the attack. Civilians are disproportionately affected by the violence, with many of the victims believed to have originated from Somalia, although the exact number is still unclear, according to Ahmed Abdi Hassan, the General Consul for the Somali General Consulate in Yemen. The attack occurred in a \"military area,\" Hassan said. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that the refugees were being transported across the Red Sea to Sudan when the attack occurred. On Saturday, UNHCR's spokeswoman in Yemen, Shabia Mantoo, told CNN that 39 people were injured, with some suffering critical injuries. \"Those injured are receiving medical treatment and are understandably shaken by this traumatic event,\" Mantoo said. \"Our staff have visited them and are providing necessary support.\" Due to the ongoing conflict in Yemen, medical supplies for the survivors are limited, Mantoo said. The UNHCR is working with authorities to determine the next step for the Somali refugees, with the top priority being to ensure they receive proper medical and psychological treatment. Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war since 2015, when Houthi rebels, a minority Shia group from the north, ousted the US-backed government led by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and took control of the capital, Sanaa. The crisis in Yemen rapidly spiralled out of control, creating a multi-faceted conflict that inadvertently allowed al Qaeda and ISIS, rival groups of the Houthis, to gain strength in the midst of the chaos. The Houthis, backed by Iran, are pitted against a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, which supports the government of President Hadi. As the humanitarian crisis and conflict in Yemen worsen, refugees and asylum seekers are increasingly fleeing the country, following established migration routes, including across the Red Sea to Sudan, with the ultimate goal of reaching Europe. The UNHCR lamented the latest incident, which adds to the tragic toll of innocent civilians, including Yemenis, refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants, who are disproportionately affected by the conflict in Yemen. According to the UNHCR, Yemen is currently hosting over 255,000 Somali refugees. In February, the organization launched a campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of crossing the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea from Africa to war-torn Yemen. ",

        "Text": "US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Beijing on Saturday, delivering the administration's most direct warning to North Korea yet. The warning included the possibility of military action, which Tillerson said was not off the table. For two hours, Tillerson met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, who urged the US to return to negotiations to resolve the North Korean crisis. Tillerson described the tensions with North Korea as \"dangerous\" and said China had agreed to work together to change Pyongyang's course, but he did not provide further details. Beijing was the final stop on Tillerson's first official trip to Asia, following visits to Japan and South Korea. The trip comes amid concerns over North Korea's recent missile launches and its plans for another nuclear test. China is North Korea's sole ally and main economic benefactor, accounting for 70% of the country's trade. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on China to use its influence over North Korea, tweeting on Friday that China has done little to help. On Sunday, Tillerson will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is expected to meet with Trump next month. Tillerson is expected to discuss the possibility of financial penalties on companies and banks that do business with North Korea. According to Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, the Trump administration is counting on threats of US military action in South Korea and tougher sanctions on Chinese entities to pressure Beijing into changing its policies. On his trip, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has signaled a shift in the US approach towards North Korea, stating that the policy of \"strategic patience\" has failed to halt the country's nuclear development over the past 20 years. China, however, has been upset by the suggestion that it is not doing enough to reduce tensions in the region.\n\nWang, a Chinese official, noted that China has made significant contributions to supporting US engagement with North Korea, but emphasized that the issue is ultimately between the US and North Korea. An opinion piece in the Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, echoed this sentiment, arguing that the US and South Korea are trying to shift the responsibility of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue onto China and involve it in their strategy towards Pyongyang.\n\nHowever, this approach could have unintended consequences, the piece warned, including the possibility of China and North Korea becoming enemies, further complicating the conflict. The North Korean nuclear issue is rooted in the confrontation between the US and North Korea, and China has no obligation to take on all the responsibilities, the article stated.\n\nWang also expressed hope that the US would re-examine its plans to reduce tensions, although Tillerson has already rejected the proposal to suspend joint military exercises with South Korea as a gesture of goodwill towards North Korea. Tillerson stated on Friday that the US does not believe the conditions are right for talks at this time. However, on Saturday, he did not rule out negotiations entirely, saying that he would work with China to bring North Korea to a point where a dialogue could begin. Tillerson's visit to Beijing is also aimed at finalizing the details of a proposed summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, scheduled to take place in April. This would be the first meeting between the two leaders, which many consider to be the most important bilateral relationship in the world. Despite Trump's fiery rhetoric during the campaign and early days of his presidency, his administration has taken a relatively cautious approach to China so far. Tillerson's visit has the potential to set the tone for the relationship and may influence the trajectory of US-China relations.",

        "Text": "The Syrian Arab News Agency, a state-run outlet, is reporting that the first group of \"gunmen and their families\" has begun leaving Al-Waer, the last opposition stronghold in Homs city. This marks the end of another rebel enclave that has endured some of the worst bombardment and attacks. The Syrian government's \"reconciliation agreements\" allow civilians and fighters to evacuate to other rebel-held areas in exchange for surrendering. These initiatives aim to bring an end to the country's long-running civil war and restore stability to former war zones. Critics and opposition groups have denounced these agreements as forced displacement, part of the government's \"starve or surrender\" strategy, where rebel-held areas are besieged and bombarded until surrender is reached. In recent weeks, the area has been subject to intense bombardment. The evacuation of Al-Waer is being supervised by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, Russian, and Syrian officials. The Al-Waer reconciliation agreement was reached last week, according to state media. Russia is a key ally of the Syrian government, led by President Bashar al-Assad. The Homs Media Center, an activist group, reports that 2,000 residents, including 400 rebel fighters, have left Al-Waer and are headed to Jarablus in the Aleppo countryside. Sources from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights say at least 10 buses have entered the neighborhood. This reconciliation agreement comes as Syria enters its seventh year of conflict and as the capital, Damascus, has faced deadly attacks in recent days, including one at a courthouse and another targeting Iraqi Shiite pilgrims near a historic cemetery.

Initially, he was upset by the suspension, but he saw it as an opportunity to focus on his online projects full-time, which ultimately helped him advance his business. Baratov's social media profiles showcase his thrill-seeking personality and his luxurious lifestyle in Ancaster, a wealthy community just outside of Toronto. While still in high school, he was able to afford a BMW 7 Series and pay off the mortgage on his first house. In his Facebook post, Baratov wrote that his suspension marked a turning point in his life, after which he changed his entire plan. However, the exact nature of his online work remains unclear, with his attorney, Amedeo DiCarlo, describing him only as an \"entrepreneur.\" DiCarlo refused to elaborate on Baratov's business ventures or how he was able to afford his lavish lifestyle. However, federal prosecutors in Northern California have alleged that Baratov made his fortune by hacking into at least 500 million Yahoo accounts, along with three other individuals, including two Russian intelligence officers. The hackers allegedly used the stolen information to gain access to accounts from other internet companies, such as Google. DiCarlo maintains that his client is innocent. Since his arrest by Canadian authorities on Wednesday, Baratov's Facebook and Instagram accounts have been made private. **Early social media posts reveal lavish lifestyle**\n\nPhotos on his social media accounts show Baratov posing with luxury cars, including an Aston Martin, outside his home, which is valued at around $700,000. The property is now on the market. Neighbors believe he lived alone in the house. His lawyer acknowledged that Baratov was not secretive about his life, with everything publicly visible.\n\n**A life of luxury and speed**\n\nBaratov's YouTube page features dozens of videos showcasing his love for luxury and adrenaline. One video shows his cerulean Lamborghini Gallardo performing donuts on a snow-covered field near his home. Other videos capture point-of-view shots of him speeding his luxury cars through upscale neighborhoods.\n\n**Forfeiture allegations and charges**\n\nUS authorities are seeking to forfeit certain assets if the four defendants are convicted. The allegations specifically mention a black Mercedes and a gray Aston Martin with the license plate \"MR KARIM.\" Baratov faces four charges, including conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, and aggravated identity theft.\n\n**Court appearance and extradition battle**\n\nBaratov made a brief court appearance in Canada and a bail hearing is scheduled for April 5. US authorities claim the hack began in January 2014 and was used to access unauthorized accounts at Yahoo, Google, and other webmail providers, including those of Russian journalists, government officials, and private-sector employees. The indictment alleges that Baratov was paid to access target email accounts, with a focus on Google accounts belonging to Russian government officials. His lawyer, DiCarlo, described the extradition battle as a \"political uphill battle.\" Karim Baratov has not been charged with any crimes in Canada. According to DiCarlo, this is an attack and a challenge by the US government. A search of domains registered to Baratov reveals multiple sites, including one advertising \"email hacking on demand.\" The domain registrations include an Ontario area code and an email address that features aliases Baratov allegedly used, such as \"Kay\" and \"Taloverov.\" When asked about these websites, DiCarlo declined to comment, stating only that everything previously reported had been unfounded.\n\nDespite flaunting his wealth on Facebook and Instagram, accounts from friends and neighbors show that Baratov not only shared his wealth but also showed generosity. For example, a fellow auto enthusiast, who wished to remain anonymous, owns an auto body shop called Autokloak that Baratov frequently visited. The auto enthusiast described Baratov as \"generous\" and said that he was well-respected and often paid for others' outings.\n\nOne neighbor, Silvia, who lives near Baratov, recalled that last Halloween, her grandson and a group of friends went trick-or-treating at Baratov's house. Baratov answered the door and threw handfuls of American dollars at the children, saying \"Take it, take it, get off my property, take it!\" The money was blown away by the wind, and Silvia described the scene as unusual.\n\nOther social media posts show Baratov spending time with friends. In a YouTube video posted to his \"Mr Karim\" account in February 2016, Baratov is seen at a restaurant table with a friend. He asks the friend to record him as he grabs a knife and nimbly stabs it between his fingers. When his friend asks if he has practiced this feat, Baratov responds that he has not, and they both laugh as he completes the stunt without injury.",

        "Text": "Ukrainian prosecutors in Kiev have made seven separate appeals over the past two years to obtain assistance in questioning Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign manager. The appeals, which included letters to FBI Director James Comey and US Justice Department officials, were sent in accordance with a mutual legal assistance treaty between the two countries. However, Ukrainian officials claim that the US has not responded to these requests. Under the treaty, the two countries agree to regularly cooperate in law enforcement efforts, including gathering statements and evidence for prosecutions. US authorities have confirmed receipt of the requests, but declined to comment further.\n\nPaul Manafort served as Trump's campaign chief until August 2016. The official requests from a special prosecution unit in Kiev began in December 2014 and are related to a corruption case involving Ukraine's former Justice Minister, Oleksandr Lavrynovych. Although Manafort has not been charged with a crime, Ukrainian prosecutors want him to testify in their investigation. The prosecutors allege that Lavrynovych illegally diverted over $1 million in government funds to the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Lavrynovych had hired Skadden to review the 2011 jailing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly harming Ukraine's interests in gas supply negotiations with Russia.\n\nTymoshenko was a political rival of the Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort advised until Yanukovych was ousted in 2014. Tymoshenko was released from jail at the same time as Yanukovych's ousting. Many saw her sentencing as politically motivated by the pro-Russian government. In 2012, Ukraine faced the possibility of an unfavorable ruling from the European Court of Human Rights due to the sentencing, which led to US lawmakers considering sanctions. In response to the deteriorating international climate, Ukrainian prosecutors claim that Paul Manafort drafted a public relations strategy, which included hiring Skadden to review the Tymoshenko case and demonstrate the conviction's legal legitimacy. However, a US State Department spokeswoman in 2012 criticized the report Skadden ultimately produced, saying it was incomplete and did not provide an accurate representation. Prosecutors told CNN that Ukraine's Justice Ministry had signed an agreement with Skadden to provide legal services for a fee equivalent to $12,000, which was below the threshold requiring a public competition to award a government contract. Prosecutors provided CNN with documentation showing that on May 30, 2013, the Justice Ministry transferred more than $1 million ($1,075,381.41) to a Citibank account allegedly belonging to Skadden. This payment is what prosecutors accuse was a misappropriation of government funds. According to prosecutors, Ukrainian officials likely undervalued the contract to avoid a time-consuming competition to hire the law firm legally, and then paid the true fee in cash. When Tymoshenko's legal team publicly pointed out the impossibility of securing Skadden's services for just $12,000, Skadden allegedly requested that Ukrainian officials draft a second contract reflecting a more realistic fee. In response to CNN's inquiry about its involvement in the matter, Skadden issued a statement saying it would continue to cooperate with relevant requests. Members of Gorbatyuk's office showed CNN a record of seven separate occasions when they sought assistance from US authorities. In December 2014, a letter was sent to the US Justice Department's Office of International Affairs, requesting an interview with Skadden partner Gregory Craig, who had previously served as White House counsel under President Obama. In December 2015, the Ukrainian prosecutor's office sent a follow-up letter to the Department of Justice, asking to question Paul Manafort. The request was triggered by two emails discovered by prosecutors, which included one between Craig and Manafort, in which Craig asked Manafort to help obtain necessary documents from Ukraine for Skadden's report, and another between a Skadden employee and a Ukrainian official, mentioning Manafort's presence at a meeting with the Justice Minister. The prosecutors also provided documentation to the DOJ, stating that their investigation had established that Manafort was implicated in the relationship between Skadden Arps and the Ukrainian Justice Ministry. The letter alleged that Manafort likely advised Ukrainian officials to hire Skadden and was present during discussions about the matter. Manafort declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nThe final letter was sent in September 2016, when Ukraine's Prosecutor General, equivalent to the US Attorney General, wrote directly to FBI Director James Comey, seeking clarification on why the US authorities were not cooperating with the investigation. Some of the attempts to question Manafort coincided with a period when the FBI was deciding whether to subpoena him as part of its separate investigation into his business dealings in Ukraine, which took place last summer. Comey has faced criticism for his handling of legal matters related to the Hillary Clinton campaign, including his decision to send a letter to Congress announcing the FBI's renewed interest in her use of a personal server just 11 days before the election. Manafort is currently under FBI investigation for allegedly receiving millions of dollars in payments while working for Yanukovych. He has denied the allegations.",

        "Text": "The US-Mexico border wall requirements, released by the federal government late Friday, have kicked off a bidding process that will lead to one of the largest government construction projects in US history. According to the notice for contractors, the wall design should be \"physically imposing in height,\" with a minimum height of 30 feet, although designs with a height of at least 18 feet may also be acceptable. The wall must be designed to prevent climbing without a ladder and make it difficult to use common or sophisticated climbing aids, such as grappling hooks. Additionally, the wall must be able to withstand attempts to penetrate through or under it. Specifically, the wall must be able to resist attempts to bore through it with hand-held tools, such as sledgehammers, car jacks, pick axes, chisels, and battery-powered tools, for at least 30 minutes, and ideally more than four hours. The requirements also state that the wall should be \"aesthetically pleasing in color\" and blend in with or match the surrounding landscape on the US side, with no specific guidelines for the Mexican side. Initially, the government suggested that the wall be made of concrete, but later widened the call to consider other designs, which may not be entirely solid and could feature a see-through component to provide situational awareness to border patrol agents. Contractors now have about two weeks to develop and submit their proposals, which will outline their design ideas for the border wall. A federal contracting expert told CNN that this approach is typical when the government has a general idea of what it wants, but is open to different ideas for achieving its goals. The government will select several 30-foot-long prototypes to be built, with each prototype expected to cost between $200,000 and $500,000, according to the government notice. In addition to the full-scale prototypes, companies will also build smaller 10-foot models for penetration testing. The prototypes will be used to determine the final design for the border wall. The wall, which was a central promise of President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, is expected to be tall and \"beautiful,\" with a provision requiring contractors to use American materials whenever possible. The government's proposal did not address the overall cost of the wall, which has been estimated to range from $10 billion to $25 billion. Trump's recent budget proposal requested $1 billion to begin the project. In recent weeks, hundreds of companies have expressed interest in the project. However, a construction contracting expert told CNN that there are only a handful of construction firms with the size, capability, and experience to handle a contract of this magnitude. The expert noted that federal requirements require contractors to set aside significant funds as a guarantee that the project is completed satisfactorily. The selection process will be handled by a secretive committee, which will evaluate proposals based on the merits of the design and the contractors' ability to complete the job. The committee will select up to 20 plans to move to the next phase, where contractors will provide detailed cost estimates and answer additional questions. \"The government plans to issue multiple contracts to build wall prototypes, with the possibility of reopening the bidding process in the future. The current process is not designed to cover the entire procurement of the border wall solution with Mexico, officials clarified.\"",

        "Text": "The Secret Service released a statement on Friday, providing details about the incident and confirming that an investigation is ongoing. The agency said that so far, more than 50 interviews have been conducted and a review of radio transmissions and video footage has been completed. The review revealed that the intruder, who was identified as Jonathan Tran, climbed a five-foot fence, an eight-foot gate, and then a three-and-a-half foot fence while Secret Service agents struggled to locate him. According to the review, Tran even managed to rattle a door handle at the South Portico entrance to the White House, but did not make it inside. House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz expressed concern about the breach, saying that despite the agency's significant resources, the intruder was able to get close to the White House and evade capture for 17 minutes. \"That's unbelievable,\" Chaffetz said. In response to the incident, the Secret Service took immediate steps, including adding additional posts, enhancing technology, and modifying response protocols. The agency also acknowledged that its agents were \"extremely disappointed and angry\" about the breach. According to a source, Tran, a 26-year-old man from California, was able to avoid detection by setting off multiple alarms and sensors, and jumping multiple fences at the White House complex. He was eventually discovered just steps from a main door to the mansion. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz has launched an investigation into the incident, citing new allegations that were not included in the original affidavit. According to Chaffetz, the committee has learned that triggered alarms were ignored, and the suspect may have moved undetected on the White House grounds for an extended period. Additionally, the suspect may have attempted to enter the building. Chaffetz expressed concern that if these allegations are true, they raise questions about the adequacy of the Secret Service's security protocols. He has requested that Acting Director William Callahan provide documents and video footage related to the incident and brief the committee on Monday at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nSeparately, a Secret Service source revealed that the suspect, Tran, was observed loitering on Pennsylvania Avenue as early as 6 p.m., nearly six hours before his arrest on the White House grounds. Surveillance footage shows Tran jumping a fence in the Northwest corner of the Treasury Building, adjacent to the White House, and activating a sensor alarm in the Treasury Moat. Secret Service officers responded to the alarm, but Tran had already moved beyond one post and closer to the White House before an officer arrived to investigate. The source believes Tran then crossed the East Executive Drive, jumped the White House gate near an unstaffed East Wing guard post, and activated another alarm sensor while hiding behind a pillar. Tran then jumped a low wall and traversed along the East Wing, triggering multiple sensors, although it is unclear if they were properly investigated. The White House complex is surrounded by a network of detection systems that operate in overlapping zones, primarily utilizing infrared and microwave technology. However, these systems are not foolproof and can be prone to malfunction or false alarms. The incident occurred just before midnight on March 10, when President Donald Trump was at the White House. According to reports, the President was not notified about the intrusion until late Friday night. In a statement, Trump described the suspect as \"disturbed\" and praised the Secret Service for their swift response, calling their work \"fantastic.\" During a lunch meeting with Cabinet officials at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia, the President characterized the situation as \"sad\" and emphasized the importance of the Secret Service's role in maintaining the safety and security of the White House.",

        "Text": "During a meeting with Tillerson, Xi Jinping emphasized that there are more shared interests between the two countries than disputes, and stressed the need for increased communication and coordination on regional hotspots, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry. The meeting took place just hours after North Korea announced that it had successfully tested a new type of rocket engine, with leader Kim Jong Un overseeing the test. The event was hailed as having \"historic significance\" and potentially marking the \"new birth\" of North Korea's indigenous rocket industry. Beijing was the final stop on Tillerson's first official trip to Asia, which also included visits to Japan and South Korea. The trip came amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, following a series of North Korean missile launches and fears of another nuclear test. China, North Korea's only major global ally, provides a significant political and economic lifeline to Kim's increasingly isolated regime, with bilateral trade accounting for 70% of North Korea's total trade. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on China to use its influence over North Korea, singling out the country again on Friday in a tweet that read, \"North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!\" Despite earlier warnings that all options, including military action, remained on the table in dealing with Pyongyang, Tillerson refrained from using harsh language during his visit to Beijing, instead adopting a more measured tone. Following his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the \"renewed determination\" of both Beijing and Washington to collaborate in persuading the North Korean government to adopt a better path and future for its people. However, Tillerson did not provide any specific details. Although neither side publicly addressed the issue, it was expected that Tillerson would bring up the possibility of imposing financial penalties on Chinese companies and banks that conduct business with North Korea. According to Ashley Townshend, a research fellow at the United States Studies Center at the University of Sydney, the Trump administration is counting on threats of US military action in South Korea and stricter sanctions on Chinese entities to intimidate Beijing into changing its policies. During his trip, Tillerson signaled a shift in Washington's approach towards North Korea, stating that the policy of \"strategic patience\" pursued over the past 20 years aimed at halting North Korea's nuclear development had failed. The US and North Korea have been at odds, with Beijing expressing frustration over being asked to do more to reduce tensions in the region. Wang noted that China had made \"important contributions\" to supporting US engagement with Pyongyang, but emphasized that the issue ultimately lies between the US and North Korea. A recent opinion piece in the Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, made a similar point, stating that Washington and Seoul are trying to shift the responsibility of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue entirely onto China and include it in their strategy towards Pyongyang. However, the piece warned that this approach would only serve to complicate the conflict, as China and North Korea would become enemies. The North Korean nuclear issue, the piece argued, is primarily a result of the confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang, and China has no obligation to shoulder the entire burden of responsibility. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang reiterated China's stance that the US should return to the negotiating table for a peaceful resolution. Wang also expressed hope that Washington would consider Beijing's proposals to ease tensions, despite US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's earlier rejection of the idea that the US should suspend joint military exercises with South Korea as a gesture of goodwill towards North Korea. Tillerson stated on Friday that the US does not believe the conditions are right for talks at this time, but left the door open on Saturday, saying he would work with China to bring North Korea to a point where dialogue is possible. Meanwhile, Tillerson was in Beijing to finalize details for a potential summit between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping in Florida in April, which would be the first meeting between the two leaders and a significant event in the world's most important diplomatic relationship. According to a Chinese foreign ministry statement, Tillerson said that Trump expects the two leaders to meet as soon as possible, although the April summit was not confirmed. Additionally, Xi Jinping extended an invitation to Trump to visit China. Despite his campaign rhetoric and early statements, President Trump and his administration have taken a relatively hands-off approach to China, failing to follow through on threats to label China a currency manipulator or impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump has also endorsed the \"One China\" policy, which has governed US-China-Taiwan relations for decades, after initially questioning its legitimacy shortly after his election.",

        "Text": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made it clear that the US is no longer pursuing a policy of strategic patience with North Korea. He also ruled out the possibility of negotiating with Pyongyang until it has dismantled its weapons of mass destruction, and left the door open to military action if the US believes the North's nuclear program advances too far. While Tillerson's statements may seem radical, they do not necessarily signal a coherent strategy for the region. The \"strategic patience\" policy, which was implemented during the Obama administration, was not simply a policy of inaction. It involved supporting the US alliance with South Korea, approving a free trade agreement with Seoul, and deploying the THAAD missile defense system. In contrast, the Trump administration's devaluation of the US-South Korea alliance makes the Obama-era policy seem more sensible. It is unrealistic to expect North Korea to eliminate its nuclear program as a precondition for negotiations. Tillerson likely recognizes this, which is why he has ended the possibility of negotiations. In reality, North Korea's nuclear program is the only thing that keeps the regime afloat, and it is more important to Pyongyang than its relationship with China. Even if North Korea were to agree to give up its weapons, it would require an intrusive inspections regime to ensure compliance, which is unlikely. Critics may point out that similar concerns were raised about Iran, but the situation with North Korea is different in two key ways. Firstly, the Iranian government has a degree of concern for its own people, whereas North Korea does not. Secondly, Iran sought to rejoin the international community, whereas North Korea prefers to remain isolated. Tillerson's suggestion of a preemptive strike on North Korea presents another problematic option. It raises further questions about America's commitment to its alliances. The implication is that North Korea's ability to target American interests is unacceptable, but it can already strike South Korea, which the US is obligated to defend. The time for a preemptive strike ended when North Korea first detonated a nuclear device. Even if the US could guarantee the simultaneous destruction of every nuclear weapon in North Korea, tens of thousands of artillery shells would still be pointed at Seoul, making it impossible for South Korea and American forces to escape a conflict unscathed. From the outside, it appears that there is no clear American policy on North Korea. Tillerson's statement, \"all options are on the table,\" is a standard diplomatic phrase, but it raises two crucial questions. First, how effectively is the interagency process functioning? Are Tillerson's remarks part of a well-thought-out or poorly conceived foreign policy towards North Korea? Has that policy been debated and discussed among North Korea experts at the State Department, Defense Department, CIA, and other agencies, and filtered through the National Security Council? The fact that many positions in these agencies remain unfilled suggests not, as do Trump's previous statements about speaking directly to Kim Jong Un and his claims that he could \"talk him out of having his nukes.\" More importantly, does Tillerson speak for Trump? His absence from key meetings with foreign leaders, unlike Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon, suggests that he may not be fully \"in the loop.\" \"Tillerson's statement in Seoul may have carried more weight if it had come from someone else, or perhaps even from the President himself. The Korean Peninsula is a hotbed of turmoil. The next president of South Korea may be more open to dialogue and economic cooperation with North Korea. Against this backdrop, Tillerson's visit is significant, given the ongoing controversy surrounding the deployment of THAAD in South Korea, which has led to economic retaliation from China. His next stop is Beijing, where he will likely seek China's assistance in curbing North Korea's actions. However, it's unclear what incentive China has to help an administration that has consistently clashed with it at every turn.\"",

        "Text": "The significance of Chuck Berry's \"Maybellene\" lies in its ability to defy categorization. It topped the rhythm and blues charts, where most black recording artists, including Berry, were typically found. Yet, its rhythm and sensibility were equally rooted in the country blues and western swing traditions, which were predominantly white. This crossover was unprecedented, as it was customary during the Jim Crow era for white artists to \"cover\" African-American hits. However, \"Maybellene\" transcended these boundaries, making them less imposing. It's difficult to imagine how anyone could \"cover\" this song, as it was too monumental to contain within a single genre or style. Its impact was enormous, embracing generations, continents, and changing the world. In short, \"Maybellene\" was rock and roll, and Chuck Berry was its chief architect, mastermind, and – as the evidence suggests – one of its inventors. Berry's passing at 90 was announced on Saturday.\n\nOf the founding fathers of rock 'n' roll, who brought the simmering 1950s culture to a boil, Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis – an improbable survivor – are now the only ones still alive. It's worth noting that during a rock-star revue, Lewis was so incensed that Berry was chosen to close the show that he gave a set that ended with him setting his piano on fire. As Lewis stormed off, he passed Berry and muttered, \"Top that!\" And, as Lewis reportedly said later, \"He damn near did, too!\" Chuck Berry's stage presence was undiminished by age, and his guitar playing was a major part of his enduring appeal. He didn't need flashy pyrotechnics to electrify his audiences; his iconic duck walk and mastery of the guitar were enough to send them into a frenzy. Rolling Stone magazine has declared that Berry was the starting point of rock guitar, and it's hard to argue with that assessment. His licks and riffs were fluid, supple, and multi-dimensional, inspiring generations of guitarists to explore the blues and experiment with rhythm. Berry's influence can be heard in every guitarist who followed in his footsteps, from Keith Richards to countless others.\n\nBerry's songs are a testament to his enduring legacy. His \"great twenty-eight\" recordings for Chess in the 1950s and 1960s are more than just catchy pop hits - they're anthems of adventure, mischief, and possibility. Songs like \"Roll Over, Beethoven,\" \"Back in the U.S.A.,\" \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"You Never Can Tell,\" and \"School Days\" are invitations to explore, to take risks, and to push boundaries. Their titles alone convey a sense of excitement and freedom, and the songs themselves carry listeners on a journey of discovery and exploration. Every lyric roars, spins, and takes curves into the listener's mind, much like Berry's fiery red Cadillac, now on display at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. \"'Chuck Berry's legacy, rooted in the innovation he pioneered or contributed to, liberated us from the past, leaving behind a lasting American icon. The challenge with true originals, like 45-RPM records, is that they arrive as individual releases. For the rest of us, the best we can do is harness his influence to propel our own paths to exhilarating discovery. The time is now.'\"",

        "Text": "Rodney James Hess, 36, of New Orleans, was streaming on Facebook Live when he was shot on Thursday afternoon, according to a statement from his family on their own Facebook page. The video does not show the officers shooting, and his relatives have asked anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward. According to a statement from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), Hess was shot after Crockett County sheriff's deputies approached his sport utility vehicle, which was parked at a perpendicular angle along Highway 412 near the town of Alamo in west Tennessee. The deputies had responded to the vehicle because it was parked in an unusual location. Officers reported that Hess refused their commands, made erratic statements, and attempted to strike them with his vehicle at least twice. As the situation escalated, at least one Crockett County deputy fired his service weapon through the front windshield of the vehicle, striking Hess. The TBI has stated that they do not believe Hess was armed during the incident. In the video, Hess can be seen standing outside his vehicle, with officers nearby, and he can be heard saying, \"I would like the higher commands to come out.\" The video then becomes distorted, capturing sounds of a commotion and a loud, sharp noise, followed by a man's screams. The video shows the interior of the vehicle and passing scenery until a crashing sound is heard, indicating that Hess drove for a distance before wrecking his vehicle. The video ends with an image of broken glass and the sound of a woman's voice, apparently coming from a phone. According to Hess's family attorney, Don Rouzan, Hess was asking to speak with a ranking officer when he used the phrase \"higher commands.\" Rouzan stated that Hess was not acting aggressively or raising his voice at the time and that there was no apparent threat. \"He was requesting a supervising officer, and they opened fire on him,\" said the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI). Rodney Hess, who was airlifted to a hospital in Memphis, died shortly after the incident. No law enforcement officers were injured, and the officers involved in the shooting have not been identified, according to the TBI.\n\nHess' family members took to Facebook, asking anyone with information about the shooting to come forward. \"We're praying that justice will be served and that if there's anything covered up, it will be brought to light,\" said Lee Smith, Hess' grandfather. \"All we're asking for is justice.\"\n\nHess was a father of three children, aged 14, 3, and 18 months. According to the TBI, Hess grew up in the Memphis area and had been living in Texas and New Orleans before his death. He was likely traveling to Memphis to visit family when the shooting occurred.\n\nThe TBI is gathering evidence and will present it to the district attorney general. Dash cam and body camera footage has been obtained, and agents are working to determine the timeline of events. \"In all investigations, the TBI acts solely as fact-finders,\" said the TBI's statement. \"The decision on whether the deputy's actions were justified rests solely with the district attorney general.\"\n\nThe use of Facebook livestreaming was a factor in a similar police shooting in Minnesota last year, in which Philando Castile was fatally shot by a St. Anthony police officer during a traffic stop. Castile's fiancée livestreamed the aftermath of the shooting, and the officer has pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter charges. ",

        "Text": "George Conway, a corporate lawyer, is expected to lead an office that would handle legal challenges to major Trump administration initiatives, including the controversial travel ban, if confirmed by the Senate. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that Conway was being considered for the position. Previously, Conway was a contender for the role of US solicitor general, according to sources who spoke to CNN in December.\n\nAs a partner at the corporate law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Conway has spent 28 years honing his skills in securities, contract, and antitrust litigation. He is currently a partner in the firm's litigation department, where he has represented high-profile clients such as the National Football League and Philip Morris, which he successfully defended in a defamation lawsuit against ABC News.\n\nThroughout his career, Conway has argued before the Supreme Court, including a case in 2010, Morrison v. National Australia Bank. He also has experience representing high-profile clients, including Paula Jones, who he helped represent in her sexual harassment lawsuit against then-President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Conway's work on that case established a legal precedent for a sitting president to be sued in civil court.\n\nConway graduated from Yale Law School in 1987 after attending Harvard College. He also clerked for US Circuit Judge Ralph Winter, Jr. of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, who was nominated to the court by President Ronald Reagan.  ",

        "Text": "In response to a loudspeaker announcement, teachers and students quickly drop to the ground, awaiting further instructions. \"This is a drill,\" the voice echoes, \"a missile has been launched.\" Moments later, the entire school body rushes from the athletic field into the school gym, joined by elderly volunteers who line up in rows beside the children seated quietly on the wooden floor. This is Japan's first evacuation exercise, simulating a scenario in which a North Korean missile attacks the country. \"A missile fell approximately 20 kilometers off the coast of Oga, within Japan's territorial waters,\" another announcement states. \"The extent of the damage is unknown, so please remain sheltered inside the gym.\" Following the drill, a government official thanks participants in the gym, tactfully avoiding any specific mention of North Korea. \"The government is making every effort to maintain good relations with other countries to prevent a missile attack,\" says Chief Cabinet Counselor Atsushi Odani. \"If a missile is launched, our self-defense forces will attempt to intercept it,\" he adds, referring to Japan's military. Japan is not defenseless against ballistic missile threats. Recently, guided missile destroyers from the US, Japan, and South Korea participated in trilateral naval exercises aimed at improving missile defense. The warships are equipped with the Aegis missile defense system, designed to detect missile threats early on. These ships can also fire interceptors to destroy the ballistic missile early in its flight, or transmit tracking data to other ships along the missile's path, allowing it to be destroyed at its highest point. Despite the close military ties between Japan, the US, and South Korea, North Korea was able to launch four ballistic missiles on March 6, with three of them landing in the sea just 370 kilometers off Japan's western coast. The United Nations has repeatedly banned North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technology, but Pyongyang has continued to defy these resolutions. In 2016, the country conducted at least two nuclear tests and fired over a dozen missiles. In the small fishing port of Oga, locals are growing increasingly concerned about the threat from North Korea. \"It's terrifying,\" says Zen-ei Nishikata, who hauls in freshly caught octopus at the local docks. \"You never know what the North Koreans might do next.\" For some residents of Oga, the recent missile evacuation drill brought back painful memories of World War II, when sirens would sound and people would hide in air raid shelters. \"If a war breaks out with North Korea, Japan will be the target,\" says 89-year-old Reinosuke Ishigaki, who helped coordinate the town's disaster preparations. \"And they have their finger on the nuclear button.\" The principal of Oga's elementary school believes the missile evacuation drill provided his students with a valuable lesson. \"Even though they're still young, they're starting to understand the potential threat from a missile,\" says Shin Kikuchi. \"It's beyond their imagination.\" The school's hallway is decorated with fearsome masks representing the namahage, a mythical ogre that serves as the community's mascot on the Oga peninsula. \"In this region, a long-standing tradition on New Year's Eve is for actors to don eerie straw costumes and menacing masks, all in an effort to frighten children into behaving. However, as North Korea's ballistic missile program becomes increasingly advanced, residents now face a very real and far more terrifying threat to keep them up at night.\"",

        "Text": "On Sunday morning, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman made a stern warning on Israel's public radio, saying, \"The next time Syria uses its air defense systems against our planes, we will destroy them all without hesitation.\" This threat comes after Syria fired anti-aircraft missiles at Israeli military jets overnight on Thursday into Friday. The Syrian military claimed the jets struck a military site near Palmyra, while Israel maintains they targeted a weapons shipment to Iran-backed Hezbollah. Syria alleged that their missiles downed one Israeli jet and hit another, but Israel rejected this as \"completely false.\"\n\nLiberman emphasized that Israel's main concern is the transfer of advanced weapons from Syria to Lebanon. \"Every time we identify a transfer like this, we will work to prevent the transfer of game-changing weapons. On this issue, there will be no compromise,\" he stated firmly. This is not the first time Liberman has used threatening rhetoric since taking over the Defense Ministry last year.\n\nThe recent encounter between Israel and Syria marks the most serious clash between the two countries since the start of the Syrian civil war six years ago. While tensions between the two nations had decreased as the conflict progressed, they have increased in recent months, along with Israel's reported strikes. An airstrike near Palmyra would be one of the deepest inside Syria since the beginning of the fighting.\n\nThe military actions did not go unnoticed, both in the Middle East and internationally. In a sign of Russia's displeasure with the strike, Moscow summoned Israel's ambassador to Russia, Gary Koren, within 24 hours of the incident. For the first time in recent years, Moscow has summoned Israel's ambassador over a strike in Syria, a move that comes just a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to reaffirm their countries' military coordination in Syria. The two nations established this coordination last year to avoid conflicts in Syrian airspace, allowing them to operate freely in the region. Palmyra, a strategic location once held by ISIS and later retaken by the Syrian government, is crucial to both the regime and its opponents. An intercepted Israeli strike triggered alarm sirens in the Jordan Valley and sent shrapnel from the explosion landing in western Jordan, which was heard as far south as Jerusalem, according to the Jordanian military. Most of Israel's reported strikes have targeted areas around Damascus, the Syrian capital, which is approximately 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, seized from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel has long focused on preventing the transfer of weapons from Syria to terrorist groups. In December, Defense Minister Liberman told European Union envoys that Israel will \"prevent the smuggling of sophisticated weapons, military equipment, and weapons of mass destruction from Syria to Hezbollah.\" This statement marked another acknowledgment of Israel's ongoing operations in Syria. Last April, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel had launched strikes against Syria \"dozens of times,\" breaking with the policy of remaining silent about its involvement in the war-torn region. In a video statement released Friday, Netanyahu defended Israel's actions, stating, \"When we identify attempts to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah and we have intelligence and it is operationally feasible, we act to prevent it. That's how it was yesterday and that's how we shall continue to act.\" \"We are fully committed and our actions are evidence of that. Everyone must take that into account.\" Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran, has been at odds with Israel over territory along their shared border. The group has also supported the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, deploying thousands of fighters to battle alongside his forces. While the United States, Israel, and the Arab League classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, the European Union only considers its military wing to be a terrorist group. Recently, Syrian media reported that Israeli jets targeted military positions and weapons convoys near Damascus. In November 2012, Israel fired warning shots at Syria after a mortar shell hit an Israeli military post, marking the first time Israel had fired on Syria since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Israeli jets have been striking targets in Syria since at least 2013, when US officials believed IDF jets had attacked Syrian territory. In 2014, both the Syrian government and an opposition group claimed that an IDF strike had hit Damascus' suburbs and airport. Israeli strikes have also targeted ISIS fighters in Syria. Last year, IDF troops operating in the disputed Golan region came under fire from ISIS militants affiliated with the Khalid ibn al-Walid Army. The soldiers returned fire, sparking an exchange of gunfire. An Israeli airstrike later destroyed a vehicle carrying four militants, according to Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner.",

        "Text": "A president's golf game is typically uncontroversial, as it's a common pastime among leaders. However, before running for office, Trump was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's frequent golf outings with friends, aides, and advisors, arguing that it showed a lack of seriousness about addressing the country's problems. Now, Trump's own golf habit is coming back to haunt him. In the first two months of his presidency, Trump has visited his two nearby golf courses - Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Course in Jupiter - a total of 10 times. Trump's top aides have been trying to downplay the frequency of his golf outings, particularly given his previous comments about the sport and the White House. \"I'm going to be working for you; I'm not going to have time to go play golf,\" Trump said during a 2016 event in Virginia. Despite this, aides have been reluctant to confirm that Trump plays golf on weekends in Florida, instead repeatedly stating that the President \"may\" hit a few balls at his course, but they're not sure. However, multiple instances of Trump's golf games have been publicly documented, including a recent sighting of him driving up the 12th hole on his championship course at Trump International Golf Course. Additionally, it has been revealed that Trump has played with top professional golfers such as Rory McIlroy, one of the world's top-ranked golfers. During a recent visit from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump even played a full round of golf with the foreign leader and professional golfer Ernie Els. President Trump's favorite golf course is the one closest to his Florida home, Trump International Golf Club. He has visited the course every time he has golfed since taking office, a total of 10 times. On only one occasion, when hosting Japanese Prime Minister Abe, did Trump also visit Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter. Additionally, he stopped by his course in Sterling, Virginia, on March 11 for a meeting, although it's unclear whether he played a round. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump criticized his predecessor, Barack Obama, for golfing, saying, \"I love golf, but I don't have time.\" Trump also tweeted about Obama's golfing habits, calling them \"worse than Carter.\" Now, citing the President's privacy, Trump's aides are struggling to keep his frequent golfing outings out of the public eye.

        "Text": "There is a significant amount to pay attention to, but the fate of this story will largely depend on the testimony of five key individuals. Firstly, James Comey, the enigmatic figure, will likely shed more light on the controversy surrounding his \"October Surprise\" and its impact on Hillary Clinton's electoral chances. Although Comey's neutrality is questionable, he has already confirmed that Trump's claims of wiretapping have no basis in fact. The crucial question is whether he will confirm or sidestep a direct inquiry about whether there is a criminal investigation into the Trump team's potential collusion with Russia during the election. If he confirms, the political landscape will be significantly altered.\n\nSecondly, Sally Yates, the \"rock star\" of the story, will take the stand on Monday to address the controversy surrounding her early firing as Acting Attorney General. Yates' brief tenure was marked by her warning to the White House about the potential compromise of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn due to his ties to Russia. The White House failed to act on this information until it was leaked to the press. Yates' testimony is likely to shed more light on what she told the White House about Flynn's situation. The Intelligence Committee's power duo, Chairman Devin Nunes and Ranking Member Adam Schiff, have taken center stage in the investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election. Nunes, who was part of Trump's transition team, has expressed skepticism about Russia's involvement, while Schiff has been a vocal critic of the President, accusing him of downplaying the issue. Schiff has also made it clear that he intends to call former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, author of the unverified dossier containing allegations about Trump's ties to Russia, to testify before the committee. The dynamic between Nunes and Schiff is complex, with Schiff determined to keep Nunes in check and ensure that the questioning remains focused. This was evident when Nunes recently acknowledged that there was no evidence to support Trump's wiretap claims, a significant departure from his earlier stance. Meanwhile, Schiff has emerged as a party star, refusing to let Nunes dominate the questioning.\n\nOne notable absentee from the March 20 hearing will be Michael Flynn, a key figure in the investigation due to his ties to Turkey and Russia. Flynn, a former national security advisor, received significant payments from Russia for speeches and consulting work, and it's only a matter of time before he is called to testify before either the House or Senate Intelligence Committee. Although Flynn won't be present at the hearing, his absence will likely be a topic of discussion among other witnesses.\n\nFinally, President Donald Trump is likely to be watching the proceedings closely, given the intense scrutiny he has faced over his campaign's ties to Russia. \"His provocative tweets have dominated the national conversation, but it's essential to remember the true significance of the Russia scandal. The real story is not about Trump's tweets, but about Russia's interference in our elections and what the President knew about it. This investigation will unfold gradually, with no dramatic breakthroughs expected. Today's hearing is just the beginning, and there will be many more to come, including a comprehensive review by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Unlike some in Congress, few have bought into the administration's claims that these reports are 'fake news.' As the Russia issue continues to unfold, the narrative will shift from partisan squabbles to bipartisan demands for transparency and accountability. Unfortunately, it seems the President is not yet prepared to face the consequences.\"",

        "Text": "House Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Adam Schiff expressed his thoughts on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" stating that he believes there is circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception. He emphasized the need to determine whether these findings are indicative of more. Schiff's comments contradict those of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who recently stated that he had not seen any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Schiff responded by saying he was surprised by Clapper's claim, as he does not believe it can be made so categorically.\n\nThe congressman's remarks came as his committee prepares to take testimony from FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers regarding the administration's investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the US election and any relationships between Russian officials and Trump's associates. Sen. Tom Cotton previewed the upcoming House hearing on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" stating that Comey's testimony will address \"unsubstantiated allegations\" of dealings between Moscow and President Donald Trump's campaign. Cotton emphasized the importance of considering the broader context, noting that the House committee hearing will focus on unsubstantiated allegations of collusion between Trump associates and Russian intelligence.\n\nThe US intelligence community has concluded that Russia was responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which it believes was part of an effort to aid Trump in the election. The Russian government has denied any wrongdoing. According to CNN and other reports, current and former law enforcement, intelligence, and administration officials have revealed that there were communications between Trump's associates and Russians known to US intelligence during the campaign. Michael Flynn, a retired Lt. Gen., resigned as Trump's national security adviser after media reports surfaced about his post-election conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. However, Devin Nunes, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stated on Fox News Sunday that there is \"no evidence of collusion\" between Russia and the Trump campaign. In a CNN interview, Tom Cotton cited James Clapper and Michael Morell, who have both publicly stated that they have seen no evidence of collusion. Morell, a former acting CIA Director who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, emphatically denied any connection between the Trump campaign and Russia, saying, \"On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians, there is smoke, but there is no fire. There's no little campfire. There's no little candle. There's no spark.\" Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties largely echoed each other in dismissing Trump's unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower during the campaign. Republicans such as Cotton, Nunes, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Maine Sen. Susan Collins reiterated that they have seen no evidence to support Trump's accusation, which has been refused to be corroborated by the administration. On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee received a classified report from the Department of Justice regarding the claim, which is expected to be discussed at Monday's hearing. According to sources, the report is unlikely to back up Trump's accusation. Nunes, a California Republican, stated on Sunday that, based on his briefing with the Department of Justice, there were no physical wiretaps of Trump Tower. He added that a classified report from the department on Friday reinforced his belief that Trump's claims were \"literally\" incorrect. Nunes also said that there was no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nCotton, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, expressed skepticism about Trump's wiretap claims, stating that he had seen no evidence to support them. When asked if Trump should apologize to his predecessor if Comey's testimony contradicts his claims, Cotton deflected the question, saying, \"We'll see what Director Comey testifies about.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, seemed to back Trump's claims, saying that they were \"not necessarily outlandish.\" However, he also emphasized the need for the administration to provide evidence to support the claims. Cruz also brought up the IRS scandal involving conservative groups and accused the Obama administration of politically motivated behavior.\n\nCotton, a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, discussed major military issues, including the influx of Marines and other service members into Syria. He did not advocate for a specific policy, but stated that the US should not set arbitrary troop caps. Cotton also called for the defeat of ISIS and emphasized the need to counter Iran's activities in the region, which he blamed for the rise of ISIS. He assured the public that those responsible for the nude photo scandal in the Marine Corps would be identified and punished.\n\nLet me know if you have any further requests!",

        "Text": "NATO's Secretary-General, Ursula von der Leyen, released a statement on Sunday, clarifying that there is no debt account in NATO and that the 2% defense spending target is not solely related to the alliance. Von der Leyen emphasized that defense spending also goes towards UN peace missions, European missions, and counter-terrorism efforts against ISIS. Her statement was in response to claims by US President Trump that some NATO allies owe money for not meeting defense spending targets. Germany, for instance, spent 1.19% of its GDP on defense last year.\n\nIn a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump reiterated his support for NATO and emphasized the need for allies to pay their fair share of defense costs. He claimed that many nations owe vast sums of money from past years and that it is unfair to the US. Trump demanded that these nations pay what they owe.\n\nHowever, NATO members have committed to a defense spending target of 2% of GDP, but this is not a debt obligation. According to the alliance's annual report, only five members (the US, Greece, Poland, Estonia, and the UK) currently meet this target, while many others plan to reach it by 2024. Trump also thanked German Chancellor Merkel for her commitment to increasing defense spending during their meeting. In a Twitter rant, Donald Trump took aim at media reports that his summit with Angela Merkel had gone poorly. He also reasserted his incorrect claim that NATO member countries, such as Germany, owe \"vast sums\" of money to the alliance and that the US must be \"paid\" for its defense contributions. Trump tweeted, \"Despite what you've heard from FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\"\n\nIn response, former US Ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder pushed back against Trump's claims, explaining how NATO's treaty commitments actually work. \"Sorry, Mr. President, that's not how NATO works,\" he tweeted. \"The US decides for itself how much it contributes to defending NATO.\" Daalder went on to clarify that NATO member countries are increasing their defense budgets, a development he viewed as positive.\n\nBefore taking office, Trump had raised concerns about NATO, calling the organization \"obsolete\" in a joint interview with the Times of London and the German publication Bild. \"I said a long time ago that NATO had problems,\" he said. \"Number one, it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago. Number two, the countries weren't paying what they're supposed to be paying.\" Trump claimed that this was unfair to the US. \"Following the president's statement, several members of his administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, have reaffirmed the United States' unwavering commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\"",

        "Text": "Fierce clashes erupted in Damascus, the Syrian capital, which had not seen such intense fighting in months, possibly even years, according to Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The rebel fighters launched their attack from the Jobar district in northeastern Damascus, an area that is divided between rebel and government control. The rebel factions appear to have been preparing for this offensive, said Rahman. The Syrian regime and its allied militias have maintained a firm grip on the capital since the start of the conflict. The opposition holds only a few isolated pockets of control around Damascus, including a portion of Jobar. The assault was led by Islamist groups, including Ahrar al-Sham and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a recently formed umbrella organization that includes Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. Syrian state media reported that government forces had repelled an attack by jihadist fighters, who also used tunnels to target government positions. The status of the fighting on Sunday evening was unclear, and there was no immediate word on casualties. The assault comes after a series of suicide bombings in March, which targeted a courthouse and restaurant in Damascus, killing more than two dozen people and injuring others, according to Syrian state news.

        "Text": "The Indus Water Treaty, a 57-year-old agreement that governs the sharing of water resources between India and Pakistan, has been under threat due to rising tensions in the disputed region of Kashmir. The treaty, brokered by the World Bank, is set to be discussed again on Monday, following a period of heightened tensions between the two nations. The Indus River system, which supports livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India, originates in Tibet and flows through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan. The treaty has been a crucial component of the relationship between India and Pakistan, governing how the two countries manage the vast volume of water that is vital to both nations. However, the talks in Islamabad come after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suspended water talks with Pakistan seven months ago. The discussions are expected to focus on India's plans to use the rivers to generate hydropower, which Pakistan has strongly objected to. Modi's decision to review the terms of the treaty has been seen by some analysts as a threat to the deal. The 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pakistani wars, as well as numerous subsequent standoffs between the two nations, have not deterred the treaty from remaining a crucial part of their relationship. However, recent tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors have once again put the treaty's strength to the test. In September, militants infiltrated an Indian army base in Uri, a garrison town near the de facto border, killing 18 soldiers in one of the deadliest attacks on an army base in the region since 1989. The aftermath saw tensions escalate on both sides of the disputed border, with India launching a \"surgical attack\" across the Line of Control with Pakistan. The repercussions were far-reaching, with India evacuating villages along the border and Pakistan temporarily restricting Indian film imports. Following the Uri incident, Prime Minister Modi met with officials to review the water treaty's provisions. At the meeting, it was announced that India would utilize to its maximum capacity the water from Pakistan-controlled rivers, including the Jhelum, while remaining within the treaty's historical boundaries. Pakistan appeared unsettled by the move and subsequently approached the World Bank to express its concerns. In November, Modi reiterated India's rights over the eastern rivers, as stipulated by the treaty. \"This water belongs to India's farmers,\" Modi said. \"It is not intended for your farms, but rather flows to Pakistan and ultimately to the ocean. I am committed to bringing every drop of that water back to the farmers of Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir... for India's farmers.\" The Indus Water Treaty, according to analyst Rebecca Keller from Stratfor, provides a crucial level of consistency for a vital natural resource shared by both Pakistan and India, despite being situated over disputed borders. The Indus river basin is essential for Pakistan's agriculture, supporting a massive 75% of its irrigated land, making it the largest contiguous irrigation network in the world, Keller notes. Agriculture is a significant contributor to Pakistan's economy, accounting for roughly a quarter of its GDP and a major source of foreign exchange earnings. While India has other river basins that support its agricultural sector, the Indus remains a vital component for regional farming. The dam dispute has been ongoing, with India seeking to harness the rivers for hydropower, a move Pakistan initially objected to a decade ago. In 2010, Pakistan filed a complaint with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, citing concerns that India would gain control over the water flow into Pakistan's agricultural heartland. However, the court ruled in India's favor three years later, allowing the construction of the Kishanganga dam to proceed. Pakistan has since renewed its opposition to the dam, arguing that it would draw too much water from the Indus River Basin, exceeding India's allotted share under the treaty. India, on the other hand, claims it utilizes only a fraction of its allocated water for hydropower and agricultural projects, with estimates suggesting it uses only 4% of its total allocation. Despite the ongoing dispute, experts believe it is unlikely that either country will seek to abandon the treaty when they meet this week. However, negotiations are likely to be tense, with both nations keen to protect their interests, especially with general elections on the horizon. \"Both countries can use the dispute as a tool to advance their political aims in the coming year,\" Keller says. \"This is not the first dispute that has occurred under the Indus Water Treaty, and it won't be the last.\"",

        "Text": "As Haider Abadi departed Iraq for the United States on Sunday, he announced that Iraqi forces were nearing the end of their campaign against ISIS and planned to discuss the final stages of the operation with the US administration. In a video statement, Abadi declared, \"We are in the final chapter, the last stages of eliminating ISIS militarily in Iraq.\" He expressed hope that the US and its allies would continue to provide economic assistance to Iraq, which is facing a financial crisis due to the war against ISIS. Meanwhile, President Trump recently announced a $54 billion increase in defense spending, with over $3 billion allocated to the fight against ISIS, including a flexible fund worth $2 billion to support the Pentagon's new counter-ISIS strategy.\n\nThe upcoming meeting between Trump and Abadi may touch on sensitive topics. The Iraqi government had objected to its citizens being included on the January executive order banning travel from certain Muslim-majority countries to the US. However, after intense lobbying from Baghdad, Iraq was removed from the revised order. This followed a phone call between Trump and Abadi on February 10, as well as an in-person conversation between Abadi and Vice President Mike Pence in Munich on February 18. The discussions were further fueled by talks between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Iraqi officials about vetting measures in place to prevent suspected terrorists from leaving Iraq and entering the US. While Iraq did not implement new measures, the country provided more details to US officials about its traveler screening process. According to a readout of the phone call from Baghdad, President Trump told Abadi that he intended to find a solution to his counterpart's concerns about Iraqi citizens being unable to enter the United States. Trump asked Secretary of State Tillerson to provide more clarity on the vetting measures in Iraq, a US official said. However, the move was criticized by some US veterans who argued it would harm Iraqis who had applied for asylum in the US after helping American forces in Iraq as translators and contractors. Additionally, some American national security officials pressed Trump to remove Iraq from the travel ban, citing the restriction's burden on a key partner in the fight against ISIS. Notably, over 5,000 US military personnel are currently stationed in Iraq, providing critical support in the war against ISIS. In January, Trump had suggested that if the US had kept Iraq's oil after the invasion, ISIS would not have emerged, stating, \"We should have kept the oil when we got out. And you know, it's very interesting. Had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS, because they fuel themselves with the oil. That's where they get their money.\" However, ahead of his visit to Baghdad, US Defense Secretary James Mattis clarified that the US was not in Iraq to seize oil, saying, \"All of us in America have generally paid for our gas and oil all along, and I'm sure that we will continue to do so in the future.\" ",

        "Text": "Nadia Murad, accompanied by her counsel, renowned international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, recounted her harrowing experience to Zakaria. Her ordeal began in 2014 when ISIS militants invaded her village in Sinjar, Kurdistan. \"On August 3, 2014, at dawn, they launched a brutal attack,\" Murad recalled. \"In that single day, nearly 6,500 women and children from the Yazidi community were abducted, and approximately 5,000 people were killed. For eight months, we were forcibly separated from our mothers, sisters, and brothers, and some were killed, while others vanished.\" Murad's mother and six of her brothers and stepbrothers were brutally executed. As an unmarried woman, Murad was taken as a sex slave and repeatedly passed around various ISIS militants. She recounted that as punishment for a failed escape attempt, she was gang-raped until she lost consciousness. Murad emphasized that under ISIS's twisted rule, which justified the enslavement of Yazidis on religious grounds, the brutal treatment was deemed legal. \"They sold underage girls, believing it was permissible under Islamic law,\" Murad said. \"ISIS didn't just target specific individuals; they came for all Yazidis.\" The violence against the Yazidi community continues to this day, Clooney, who represents Murad, pointed out. Over 6,000 Yazidis are believed to remain in captivity, including some from Murad's own family, according to Clooney. It's time, she said, to hold ISIS accountable for committing some of the worst crimes of our generation. \"We know that there's a military campaign underway to defeat ISIS on the battlefield. What we're seeking is to see ISIS members face justice in a courtroom.\" No court has attempted to prosecute ISIS for the crimes it committed against the Yazidi people. Not a single prosecution has taken place against ISIS in any court worldwide for the international crimes it committed against the Yazidis. Last week, Clooney addressed the UN, urging the Security Council to establish an investigation in Iraq to collect evidence of ISIS's atrocities. \"ISIS is a global threat, and it requires a global response,\" Clooney said. \"We cannot defeat ISIS solely on the battlefield, as we must also address future recruiting. Trials and exposing the brutality of ISIS through the media can help counter their propaganda and show that it's not a holy war.\" Clooney emphasized the importance of an investigation to ensure that evidence is properly collected and preserved. \"ISIS has established a bureaucracy for its slave trade, complete with committees, courts, and documents, including DNA samples and mass graves. Unfortunately, nobody is collecting this evidence, and if it's lost, we'll never be able to have trials or achieve justice.\" Clooney noted that a resolution is already drafted and ready, and she is asking the Iraqi government and the UN to establish a thorough investigation. To make this happen, Iraq only needs to send a letter to the Security Council requesting an investigation. She explained, \"A resolution is already drafted and ready. If Iraq simply sends a letter, a vote will be held. From my conversations with the Russian ambassador, the United States ambassador, and others, it appears that there is broad support in the Council. Therefore, this should move forward. It aligns with the Iraqi government's interests, as they are targeting ISIS.\"\n\nMurad, who now resides in Germany, expressed her hope that ISIS would finally face justice. She then switched to a halting English, saying, \"I wonder... maybe if I can speak English, maybe the UN will understand... what we want. But I can't.\" Zakaria responded, \"We can hear you regardless of the language you speak.\"",

        "Text": "When his initial threats didn't have the desired effect, President Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning Republicans that if they didn't vote with him, they'd never get another chance to reform healthcare. The Republicans gathered for an emotional pre-vote meeting in the Capitol's basement, where many described it as one of the most impressive conferences they'd ever attended. However, the sense of defeat was palpable when House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered a brief statement and hastily departed without answering reporters' questions. Trump, who had relied on his usual method of deal-making, then walked away from the arduous process of political negotiation. Despite White House spokesman Sean Spicer's assertion that there was no \"plan B,\" Trump's confidence seemed to wane. As Ryan struggled to rally his party, Trump climbed into a tractor parked outside the White House, honked the horn like a child, and pretended to drive, appearing happier than he had in weeks. Despite these displays of confidence, the Republicans who run Washington were unable to unite behind Trumpcare. Just hours before the vote, The Daily Beast reported that Trump's top adviser, Steve Bannon, had suggested the President make a list of his House GOP enemies to punish. When this tactic failed, Trump and Ryan abruptly canceled the showdown vote. CNN and other networks broadcast the debacle in real-time, leaving both men humiliated and diminished. It's no surprise that Trump's first major legislative initiative collapsed in chaos. Aside from the development of his enormous ego, nothing in Donald Trump's life experience prepared him to effectively serve as President of the United States. During the presidential transition, it became clear that Trump was unable to bring the country together. Instead, he immediately began spreading falsehoods and distortions about various topics, from the size of the inauguration crowd to claims of widespread voter fraud in the recent election. One of the most striking aspects of the Trump presidency is how we expected him to behave differently. Trump's propensity for dishonesty and deception began to manifest in his early years, when he would boast about his accomplishments before they had even happened. Despite experiencing four major corporate bankruptcies, Trump continued to assert his business acumen, claiming to be a great leader despite his limited experience. In reality, he was a successful entrepreneur who controlled family-held companies with an iron fist, dismissing anyone who disagreed with him. As President, Trump's inability to fire members of Congress proved a significant obstacle. His campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare was met with resistance, as few voters liked the proposed Trumpcare. Perhaps it was the plan's proposed cuts to healthcare coverage, which would have left 24 million people without insurance, or the elimination of essential coverage requirements for policies, including pregnancy care, drug benefits, and mental health coverage. House members, who must face re-election every two years, were more concerned with facing angry constituents than dealing with a President whose approval rating had plummeted to 37%. \"As Trump's withdrawal from his healthcare bill unfolded, it seemed like a significant defeat. However, with the passage of time, the magnitude of the loss has become even more apparent, and it's striking to compare it to Trump's self-image. This is a man who touts himself as a dynamic winner with unparalleled abilities. During his campaign, he famously declared, \"Only I can fix\" America's problems. He also viewed his primary opponents and President Obama as losers and failures. In contrast, most of the other Republican candidates in 2016 had successful government careers before running for office. Moreover, Obama managed to pass his healthcare bill despite significant opposition. Trump's inability to pass his own bill raises questions about his understanding of the legislative process and his willingness to listen to those around him who do. It also highlights his lack of leadership skills when dealing with hundreds of powerful lawmakers. Furthermore, Trump's temperament appears to be at odds with that of respected presidents like Johnson, Reagan, and Clinton, who valued the legislative process. The weak bill and clumsy vote-seeking tactics suggest a lack of conviction from Trump and Ryan. As a result, it's likely that Trump will deflect blame, targeting Ryan and others in the administration. Eventually, Trump will likely try again, but the problem is that Congress has shown that his usual approach of intimidation won't work. Moreover, Trump has yet to demonstrate an alternative leadership style.\"",

        "Text": "Americans were sharply divided on the meaning and implications of the bill, and their reactions to its withdrawal were varied. Here are some reactions from individuals after House Republicans pulled the bill:\n\nDebby Goodwin, a 63-year-old from Arkansas, expressed disappointment and shame at her decision to vote Republican, stating that she was relieved the House did not vote on the bill. \"Our family is experiencing undue stress due to Trump and the Republicans' lack of concern for people in our economic situation, and they need to start listening to us,\" she told CNN.\n\nGoodwin's son, Nathan Dodson, who is not covered by Obamacare, welcomed the lack of a vote. \"It shows that the citizens' voices have been heard. The polls and town hall meetings indicated that this was a major issue,\" he said.\n\nThe CEO of a Kentucky-based healthcare company, Mike Caudill of Mountain Comprehensive Health Corporation, viewed the bill's withdrawal as an opportunity for President Trump to work across party lines. \"This gives President Trump the chance to reach out to the other side,\" he told CNN. \"I hope he bridges the divide between the parties.\" Caudill, whose company employs over 300 people, described the development as encouraging, stating that it would prevent immediate adverse effects on the people they serve under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSusan Levin, a resident of Los Angeles, hailed the decision as a victory for women. \"Hooray, it didn't pass!\" she exclaimed. \"I think it was very masochistic.\" Levin, a woman of the 1960s, reflected on the difficulties she faced during that era and emphasized the need for a thorough overhaul of the healthcare system. \"The current system is deeply flawed, with significant shortcomings, including a lack of provisions for women and inadequate maternity care,\" she said. \"If they want to make meaningful changes, they need to take the time to carefully consider all the implications.\"\n\nRomero, a staffing professional in California, expressed hope that Republicans would continue to work towards replacing Obamacare. \"The Affordable Care Act has had a negative impact on my business, forcing us to pass the cost on to our associates,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, many of them can't afford the coverage even with the subsidy, so they're still forced to buy it.\" Romero believes Trump anticipated the challenges the GOP would face and is prepared to present an alternative plan.\n\nStack, a 34-year-old bartender in Denver, was critical of Trump's healthcare plan, calling it \"horrible.\" For now, she relies on her employer for health insurance, but she thinks the government should focus on more pressing issues, such as resolving the situation with Russia. As a first-generation American, Stack expressed frustration with the country, saying, \"I hate this country.\" However, she noted that her support for Brexit has led her to consider the possibility of moving to the UK, pending the outcome of events there.\n\nEidenberg, president of an insurance company in Chicago, was relieved that the healthcare bill did not pass and warned against manipulating Medicaid. \"I've been glued to the TV, following the developments closely, and I'm glad the bill didn't go through,\" she said. \"We need to focus on creating a healthcare system that works for everyone, not just a select few.\" Eidenberg, a critic of the Affordable Care Act, expressed concerns about the bill's effectiveness, citing high rates and issues with Medicaid. \"I don't think the ACA is working as intended, and the Ryan-Trump bill would have had significant negative impacts on communities and states,\" she said. Despite the setback, Eidenberg remains hopeful that the failure to pass the bill will ultimately lead to positive change. \"The turmoil in healthcare is finally sparking a national conversation, and I believe we may see meaningful reforms emerge from this chaos.\"\n\nA 65-year-old business owner from Nashville, Tennessee, Nick Patel, believes that Obamacare needs to be strengthened. \"The healthcare bill needs significant revisions to benefit everyone,\" he said. Patel, who works in the hospitality industry, suggested two key changes: reducing the cost of medicine and insurance. \"The bill needs to be overhauled to make healthcare more accessible and affordable for all,\" he said.\n\nCurtis Chipley, a California resident, felt that pulling the bill without a vote was a lack of transparency. \"If you're going to claim you were close to passing the bill, then let the vote happen and deal with the consequences,\" Chipley wrote on Facebook. \"Instead, the administration is leaving the American people in the dark about how close they really were to success.\"",

        "Text": "After nearly three months in office, Speaker Paul Ryan is now facing a significant challenge that could define his tenure: deep divisions among his fellow Republicans. \"Transitioning from an opposition party to a governing party comes with its challenges,\" Ryan said in a press conference on Friday. \"And right now, we're feeling those challenges.\" The setback was particularly tough for Ryan, who rose to prominence in Washington as a conservative policy expert committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act and became House speaker in 2015. The bill that failed to pass was based on Ryan's signature policy agenda, \"A Better Way.\" \"I don't know what else to say - Obamacare is the law of the land, and it will remain so until it's replaced,\" he said. \"We'll be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.\" This reality check is a stark reminder that life is different for Ryan now that Trump is in office. During the Obama administration, the Republican-controlled House could pass symbolic bills repealing Obamacare, knowing they would die in the Senate or be vetoed by the President. \"This is how governing works when you're in the majority,\" Ryan said. \"We need to get 216 people to agree on legislation, not 210 or 215. We were close, but we didn't have 216. That's how legislation works.\" Democrats were jubilant after the healthcare bill's defeat, while Republican lawmakers had expressed concerns about the potential consequences of a defeat even before the bill was pulled. Representative Chris Collins of New York warned on Friday that if the healthcare bill failed, it would leave a \"black eye\" on his party's ability to govern. \"If we don't pass this, I don't think we'll pass a 2018 budget,\" he said. \"We couldn't pass a 2017 budget, and if we couldn't pass a 2017 budget and this happens today, how will we pass a 2018 budget?\" Collins added. \"This bill is also the vehicle for tax reform, and if we don't do tax reform, where will the money come from for infrastructure? That's how critical this vote is.\" However, both President Trump and Speaker Ryan have announced plans to move on to tax reform. Ryan delivered a solo statement from behind the podium, without any Republican colleagues or White House officials who had worked tirelessly with him to pass the healthcare legislation. Despite questions about Ryan's relationship with Trump, the two have publicly insisted that they have a healthy dialogue. Ryan said he had informed Trump directly that he didn't have the votes, and Trump accepted his recommendation to withdraw the bill. Trump publicly blamed Democrats for the failure, rather than Speaker Ryan. \"I like Speaker Ryan, he worked very hard,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. However, it will take more than words to unite the Republican Party, especially after both conservative and moderate factions demonstrated their strength this week. The GOP's internal divisions were Ryan's greatest challenge, and one he never managed to overcome. The Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative lawmakers, refused to support the bill, calling it \"Obamacare Lite\" and arguing it didn't go far enough in dismantling the Affordable Care Act. However, when Speaker Ryan and his team attempted to placate the Freedom Caucus by proposing even more significant changes to Obamacare, they only alienated more moderate members of the House conference. In the final days, Ryan worked tirelessly to bridge the gap between the two factions, holding marathon meetings and one-on-one sessions. Despite his efforts, the differences proved insurmountable. \"We came very close today, but ultimately fell short,\" Ryan said at a press conference. \"I won't sugarcoat it - this is a disappointing outcome for us.\"",

She approached him and asked if she could take a photo with him. Little did she know, just moments later, the area would be plunged into chaos and tragedy, and the smiling officer who had posed for her picture would lose his life. Martin, a tourist from West Palm Beach, Florida, was visiting her son who was studying abroad in London.

        "Text": "Among the recent fatalities were five Russian diplomats, including a prominent politician who had spoken out against the Russian government. While some deaths have been deemed natural and governments have ruled out foul play, questions still linger in other cases. The uncertainty has been filled by online speculation, with some claiming that the deaths are connected to Russia's interference in the 2016 US presidential election, despite the lack of concrete evidence. Here's a summary of the eight deaths and one near-fatality:\n\nOne of the most notable fatalities was Denis Voronenkov, a 45-year-old Russian politician who was shot dead outside a hotel in Kiev, Ukraine. Voronenkov and his wife had spoken out against Russian President Vladimir Putin after fleeing Russia for Ukraine in October. Voronenkov had also testified in a treason trial against a former Ukrainian president who was seen as a puppet of Putin. Ukraine's president described the shooting as a \"Russian state terrorist act,\" while Russian authorities denied the accusation.\n\nTwo other high-profile Russian officials died under circumstances that have raised questions. Vitaly Churkin, the 64-year-old Russian ambassador to the United Nations, died on February 20 of an apparent heart attack while working in his office. Alexander Kadakin, the 67-year-old Russian ambassador to India, died on January 26 after a brief illness. The Russian embassy in New Delhi described his death as unremarkable, with no extraordinary circumstances surrounding it. Kadakin had served in India since 2009. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised him as a \"great friend of India\" who made significant efforts to foster stronger ties between the two nations.\n\nAndrey Malanin, a senior diplomat at the Russian embassy in Greece, was found dead in his Athens apartment in early January. The 54-year-old head of the Russian embassy's consular section in Athens had not reported to work for a few days, prompting worried colleagues to alert authorities. Police discovered his body on January 9th and initially suspected that he died suddenly from natural causes, with no signs of foul play.\n\nOleg Erovinkin, a former intelligence official with ties to Russian intelligence, was found dead in his car on December 26 in Moscow. The 61-year-old, who had previously served as a general in the FSB and as chief-of-staff to Igor Sechin, president of state-owned oil giant Rosneft, had no official cause of death announced by Russian government agencies.\n\nAndrey Karlov, the 62-year-old Russian ambassador to Turkey, was fatally shot in the back on December 20 while speaking at an art exhibition in Ankara. The gunman, who struck at point-blank range, was identified as the assassin. A Turkish police officer assassinated the Russian ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, in an attack that occurred on December 19. Karlov was shot multiple times as he was opening an art exhibit in Ankara. The shooter, who was later killed by police, shouted \"Do not forget Syria\" during the attack.\n\nOn the same day, Petr Polshikov, a 56-year-old senior Russian diplomat, was found dead in his Moscow home. According to reports, his wife discovered his body with a pillow over his head, and police found a head wound underneath the pillow. The Russian Foreign Ministry initially stated that Polshikov's death was likely an accident and unrelated to his official duties.\n\nOn November 8, the day of the US presidential election, Sergei Krivov, a 63-year-old Russian diplomat who served as duty commander at the Russian consulate in New York City, was found dead at the consulate. The initial report stated that he was found with an unknown trauma to the head, but the autopsy later revealed that he died from bleeding in the chest area, likely due to a tumor. The police investigation did not suspect foul play, as Krivov had been in poor health.\n\nIn a separate incident, Nikolai Gorokhov, a 53-year-old Russian lawyer who represented the whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, fell from the fourth floor of his Moscow apartment and suffered severe head injuries. He remains in the intensive care unit of a Moscow hospital. Gorokhov has been a vocal advocate for Magnitsky, who was jailed and beaten to death in a Moscow detention center after exposing Russia's largest tax fraud.",

        "Text": "At the Economic Times Global Business Summit in New Delhi, India, former US Vice President Dick Cheney stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government had made a concerted effort to significantly interfere with the United States' fundamental democratic processes. Cheney characterized this interference as a serious threat, noting that in some cases, it could be considered an act of war. While emphasizing that he was speaking only for himself, Cheney warned that Russia would likely continue to attempt to influence the US's internal political processes in the future. He also accused Putin of trying to sway the outcome of elections in Baltic countries, but did not suggest that Russia had compromised the legitimacy of President Donald Trump's electoral victory. Cheney acknowledged that the Russian government's efforts to interfere in US politics carried significant weight, given the importance Americans place on protecting their internal political processes. In contrast to his former boss, President George W. Bush, Cheney expressed support for Trump and was happy to do so. The US intelligence community has publicly attributed several hacks and information dumps, including those targeting the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, to Russian activity. Russia has denied these allegations, which are central to ongoing investigations in the US House and Senate, as well as the Trump administration. Cheney also warned of Russia's military aggression and the potential destabilization posed by Putin, noting that the Russian president was actively seeking ways to undermine NATO. Reflecting on the post-Cold War period, Cheney nostalgically recalled the initial optimism, but lamented that times had changed for the worse in some respects. \"In the early years of the Bush administration, the US enjoyed a relatively strong relationship with Russia, but it significantly deteriorated by the end of his presidency and Cheney's tenure, largely due to the Iraq War, NATO's expansion since the Soviet Union's collapse, and Russia's aggressive actions in Eastern Europe.\"\n\nI made some minor changes to improve clarity and sentence structure, while maintaining the original meaning.

The representative, who remained anonymous, wrote in an email from a group-associated address: \"No communications, no channel. Stone is manipulating Democrats and journalists to boost his public profile and promote his books. He's thrilled to be in the spotlight because he has no real expertise and was dismissed from the Trump team long ago for his opportunistic behavior.\" The representative added that Stone is happy to be scrutinized because he knows he's not knowledgeable about anything and was pushed out of the Trump team for his self-serving actions.\n\nWikiLeaks has also denied any contact with Stone on Twitter, repeatedly stating that they have no connection with him.\n\nStone claimed throughout the final months of the campaign that he had backchannel communications with Assange and knew about forthcoming document dumps from WikiLeaks. At times, he said Assange had emails that Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills deleted. Later, Stone clarified that he only knew of forthcoming document dumps in a general sense.\n\nIn response to WikiLeaks' charges, Stone told CNN's KFile: \"Since I never communicated with WikiLeaks, I must be innocent of charges that I knew about the hacking of Podesta's email and the timing or scope of their subsequent disclosures. So, I'm either clairvoyant or a good guesser, because the limited things I predicted (October disclosures) all came true.\"\n\nWikiLeaks also accused Stone of leaking his own direct messages, which showed interactions with the hacker Guccifer 2.0. A recent article on The Smoking Gun featured direct messages (DMs) that showed Stone telling the hacker he was \"delighted\" that Twitter had reinstated his account. The screenshot also reveals that Stone (or someone with access to his device) is the source feeding misinformation to the hackers, who then spread false information, mistakenly believing they are uncovering a major scandal and bringing down Stone and the President, when in reality, they are simply perpetuating Stone's propaganda efforts.

        "Text": "According to officials, the latest engine trial is the third such test in recent weeks, utilizing similar technology. An initial assessment suggests that the engine technology may potentially be used in an intercontinental ballistic missile, although it is unclear whether any adjustments would be required to make it compatible with an ICBM. If North Korea were to acquire an intercontinental ballistic missile, it could potentially threaten the continental United States. Developing ICBM technology is considered challenging, as it requires advanced rocket design. The US is also uncertain about North Korea's ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to mount on a rocket, such as an ICBM, although Pyongyang claims to have achieved this capability and US officials factor it into their planning assumptions.\n\nIn a separate development, the US announced on Monday that it has deployed F-35B fighter jets to South Korea for the first time as part of a training exercise that began on Friday. According to Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis, this marks the first time the F-35B has been operated in the Republic of Korea. The new stealth strike fighter, capable of short takeoff and vertical landing, was only declared operational in July 2015. The deployment is part of a training exercise with the South Korean military, which Davis described as \"defensive in nature.\" \"It goes without saying that we are committed to defending the Republic of Korea and Japan against any North Korean aggression,\" Davis added.

Cyclone Debbie is forecast to bring sustained winds of up to 150 mph (240 kph) and potentially catastrophic storm surges of up to four meters, as well as flash flooding. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has announced that 3,500 residents have already been evacuated, with an additional 2,000 people in the Bowen area ordered to leave as the cyclone's trajectory has shifted farther south than initially predicted.\n\nPalaszczuk warned that the cyclone will be severe and urged residents to take immediate action, stating, \"This is going to be a nasty cyclone. There is no time for complacency... the window of opportunity to leave is drastically closing.\" She pleaded with residents to heed the warnings and prioritize their safety and the safety of their loved ones.\n\nCyclone Debbie is expected to be one of the largest and most destructive storms to hit Queensland since Cyclone Yasi in 2011, which caused widespread devastation and loss of life. Palaszczuk warned that Debbie could potentially be as severe as Yasi, which ripped homes from their foundations and destroyed farmland.\n\nAccording to John D Ginger, research director at the Cyclone Testing Station at James Cook University, coastal buildings are particularly at risk, particularly those in low-lying areas that are prone to storm surges. \"Houses in these areas will be vulnerable to significant damage,\" he warned. Cyclone Debbie is expected to make landfall at a time when a 12-foot tide is forecasted in Bowen, one of the highest tides of the year, according to CNN affiliate 7 News. Queensland police are urging those in storm surge zones to evacuate immediately, stating that it is not possible to shelter from a storm surge. The severe weather has already claimed one life, a 31-year-old woman, who died in a fatal car crash on Sunday night near Proserpine, according to Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart. In preparation for the storm, over 1,000 emergency service workers have been deployed to the affected region, and all schools remain closed until further notice, 7 News reports. ",

        "Text": "The White House has requested $999 million in its budget supplement for defense and border security spending, which would only cover 48 miles of new wall construction, according to documents obtained by CNN from the Department of Homeland Security. The documents outline the administration's plan to allocate the funds, which would include building 14 miles of new wall in San Diego, 28 miles of levee wall barriers, six miles of new wall in the Rio Grande Valley, and replacing 14 miles of fencing in San Diego with concrete elements. Despite President Donald Trump's campaign promise to build a wall along the entire US-Mexico border, the initial funding request has been modest, with the administration asking for $1 billion in 2017 and $2.6 billion in 2018 for border infrastructure and technology. Estimates for a full wall along the Southern border have ranged from $12 billion to over $20 billion. The budget request also reveals the administration's plan to increase border security measures elsewhere, including funding for detention facilities and legal support for building the wall. According to the documents, the Trump administration claims that its executive orders on immigration enforcement have already had an impact, with arrests up 50%, charges up 40%, and requests to detain deportable individuals up 80%. However, ICE was unable to provide information on what baseline was used to measure these increases. The distinction between a \"wall\" and a \"fence\" remains unclear. During his presidential campaign, Trump touted the idea of a tall, concrete wall along the border. However, career officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recommended a more secure option: see-through fencing, which would provide visibility on the other side. The government is currently seeking bids for two types of construction: one focused on concrete designs and another focused on alternative designs. W. Ralph Basham, a former Customs and Border Protection commissioner under the Bush administration, suggests that instead of building a concrete border wall, the government should invest in surveillance technology and strategic fencing construction, as recommended by DHS. \"What does border patrol need to get the job done?\" Basham asked. \"A lot of people think a concrete wall is a good idea, but when you break it down, it may not be the most effective use of taxpayer dollars.\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly testified to Congress in February that some border patrol agents expressed concerns about a solid, concrete wall, preferring see-through fencing instead. Experts at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing also noted that a border fence could have advantages over a concrete wall, as agents could more easily see across the border. Kelly acknowledged that the wall would take time to construct, saying, \"We're not going to be able to build a wall everywhere all at once.\" He did not provide a clear timeline or cost estimates, but suggested that the government could make progress on the wall within two years. \"This is going to take some time, but there are areas where we can address this problem immediately,\" Kelly said.

        "Text": "The new executive order marks a stark contrast between the views of President Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, on the role of the United States in addressing climate change. The order drastically shifts the government's approach to rising sea levels and temperatures, two consequences of climate change. According to a White House official briefed on the plan, the administration believes the government can simultaneously serve the environment and increase energy independence by focusing on its core mission: ensuring clean air and water. The official emphasized that protecting American jobs takes precedence over regulating climate change. \"Climate change is an issue that warrants attention,\" the official said, \"but the President has been clear that he will not pursue policies that jeopardize the US economy. It's a simple matter.\" The order, set to be issued on Tuesday, will initiate a review of the Clean Power Plan, lift the moratorium on coal mining on federal lands, and instruct federal agencies to identify regulations that hinder American energy independence. Specifically, the order will rescind at least six executive orders issued by Obama aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, including an executive order from November 2013 instructing the federal government to prepare for the impacts of climate change and a presidential memorandum from September 2016 highlighting the threat climate change poses to national security. \"The previous administration undervalued workers through their policies,\" the official said. \"We're saying that we can protect the environment and provide people with work.\" A White House official recently argued that the most effective way to protect the environment is to have a robust economy, citing countries like India and China as examples of nations that prioritize economic growth over environmental protection. \"When the economy is thriving and growing, that's the best way to safeguard the environment,\" the official stated. The executive order has also sparked widespread concern among climate change advocates, who had long feared that a Trump presidency would lead to this kind of rollback. \"These actions are a betrayal of American values and pose a threat to the health, safety, and well-being of every American,\" said Tom Steyer, president of NextGen Climate, in a statement. \"By gutting programs that create jobs and safeguards that protect our air and water, Trump is putting corporate polluters' profits ahead of the public's interests.\" Andrew Steer, CEO of the World Resources Institute, criticized the executive order, saying it demonstrates Trump's failure to lead on issues crucial to Americans' health, the environment, and the economy. While Democrats and climate advocates will undoubtedly criticize the order, it is consistent with Trump's past comments on climate change. Although Trump claimed to have an \"open mind\" on addressing climate change during his presidential campaign, he has also previously referred to it as a hoax. In 2012, Trump tweeted, \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" In 2016, he pledged to cancel all wasteful climate change spending from the Obama-Clinton administration. The Trump administration's changes do not signify a complete abandonment of environmental protection, but when asked about the human impact on climate change and the President's beliefs, officials were hesitant to confirm that all government officials in the White House acknowledge the role of human activity in climate change. Instead, they emphasized the enforcement of existing regulations that provide for clean air and water. According to the official, the President has made it clear that he wants the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to focus on its core mission, as defined by Congress. This shift in policy also reflects the views of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has a history of suing the EPA as Oklahoma's Attorney General. In a recent interview, Pruitt incorrectly stated that carbon dioxide is not the primary cause of climate change, contradicting the majority of scientific research. The executive order is also intended to fulfill the Trump administration's promise to revive the coal industry. Officials claimed that Obama's regulations were detrimental to the coal industry, and that the reversals are the President honoring his pledge to the coal industry. In a March 2017 event in Kentucky, Trump vowed to put coal miners back to work, stating that they had not been treated well but would be treated better now. He also declared, \"The miners are coming back.\"",

        "Text": "Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and a close adviser, is likely to face intense scrutiny from congressional investigators probing ties between Trump associates and the Russian government following his meeting with the chairman of a state-run Russian bank. In December 2016, Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, the chairman of VneshEconomBank (VEB), which has been under US sanctions for three years. The meeting raises further questions due to VEB's sanctions status and Kushner's own efforts to secure financing for a Manhattan building project. The White House claims Kushner was acting as a Trump adviser, not a private developer, during the meeting. White House press secretary Sean Spicer explained that Kushner was serving as a \"conduit\" to leaders, essentially a go-between until the State Department was fully functional. VEB confirmed the meeting in a statement to CNN, describing Kushner as the head of Kushner Companies, rather than a representative of Trump. According to VEB, the meeting was part of a series of discussions with top financial officials from around the world, including Kushner Companies' head, Jared Kushner. Experts agree that the meeting does not violate US sanctions, as the prohibitions only apply to doing business with sanctioned banks, not to having conversations with them. Paul Saunders, executive director of the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, D.C. think-tank, stated, \"I don't see any problem with having a meeting. The prohibitions relate to doing business, not to talking.\" During his presidential campaign, Trump expressed willingness to reconsider the sanctions against Russia. The US sanctions had a significant impact on Russia's financial sector, as they prohibited American individuals and companies from purchasing debt from Russian financial institutions, thereby limiting their ability to access capital. According to Alevtina Guseva, a Russian finance expert at Boston University, there was a widespread expectation in Russia that the sanctions would be lifted shortly after the election. VEB, a state-owned Russian corporation established in 2007, is closely tied to the Russian government and has a chairman appointed by the president. The Russian prime minister serves as the chairman of the bank's supervisory board. VEB has played a crucial role in rescuing financially struggling oligarchs and financing high-risk infrastructure projects, such as the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Last year, the bank restructured approximately $3.5 billion in debts associated with Sochi projects. It was revealed on Monday that Kushner agreed to testify before the Senate intelligence committee as part of its investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers also want to question Kushner about his December meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US. In 2014, President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions in response to Russia's annexation of part of Ukraine. ",

        "Text": "In the formal letter informing the European Union of Britain's intention to leave, Theresa May warned that failing to reach a deal on their future relationship would have significant consequences for security. According to the letter, a failure to agree on a future relationship would weaken cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. May mentioned security 11 times in the six-page letter. Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who oppose Brexit, criticized May's link between trade and security, calling it a \"shameful\" and \"blatant threat.\" \"Security should not be used as a bargaining chip,\" he said, predicting that it would backfire in negotiations and leave Britain even more isolated. Labour MP Yvette Cooper echoed the concerns, tweeting, \"Completely irresponsible to threaten, gamble or bargain on national security.\" In the House of Commons, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock read from the letter and asked, \"Is she really suggesting that the security of our country would be traded like a bargaining chip in these negotiations?\" May responded that negotiating a future deal on security was crucial. \"We have a relationship with the European Union in justice and home affairs, and we need to negotiate what the future relationship will be,\" she said. \"It's a simple and pragmatic approach aimed at ensuring cooperation on these matters.\" Britain is a member of Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, which coordinates the sharing of intelligence on terrorism and organized crime between member states. According to the Institute for Government, the union's strongest defense power is arguably the UK's. The institute notes that the UK is one of only two member states with \"full-spectrum\" military capabilities, including a nuclear deterrent, and one of only five countries that allocate 2% of their GDP to defense. Additionally, the UK holds a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and has the largest military budget within the EU.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson declined to elaborate on the letter, stating that the Prime Minister's words speak for themselves. They emphasized that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the arrangements currently in place as part of its EU membership will cease to exist.\n\nThe official start of the Brexit process occurred nine months after the UK's contentious referendum, which revealed deep divisions across the country. In her letter, Prime Minister May expressed the UK's desire to pursue a \"bold and ambitious\" free-trade agreement with the EU in forthcoming talks.\n\nIf the UK fails to secure a trade deal with the EU and defaults to trading under World Trade Organization rules, it is estimated that the country will lose 7.5% of its GDP over 15 years, according to the UK's own official estimates. May has made it clear that the UK will not remain in the EU's single market or customs union, which would have required keeping its borders open to all EU citizens.\n\nIn her letter, May sought to strike a conciliatory tone with the EU, reiterating her hopes for the UK and the union to remain the closest of allies and to establish a \"deep and special partnership.\" In addition to her previous statements, she emphasized her desire to avoid a no-deal scenario and proposed several guiding principles for negotiations. The key points from her letter are as follows:\n\nThe UK will not seek membership in the single market, a free-trade zone, but instead aims to negotiate a \"bold and ambitious\" free-trade agreement. The UK hopes to avoid a cliff-edge separation and ensure business certainty. It warns that European security will be at risk if a deal is not reached. The UK expects to grant greater powers to the devolved regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The government plans to repeal EU laws and automatically adopt them into UK law for review, with a White Paper outlining the process to be published on Thursday.\n\nTusk expressed a somber tone after receiving the Article 50 letter. \"Today is not a happy day, neither in Brussels nor in London,\" he said. \"Most Europeans, including nearly half of British voters, wished we would stay together, not drift apart. As for me, I won't pretend to be happy today.\" However, he noted that Brexit has strengthened the determination and unity of the 27 remaining EU nations. \"What can I add to this? We already miss you,\" he said.",

        "Text": "The tumultuous marriage between Britain and the European Union has finally come to an end, with the triggering of Article 50 marking the beginning of a two-year formal process. The divorce is expected to cost Britain tens of billions of pounds, but there is no turning back. The relationship between the two had been strained for years, with Britain repeatedly seeking concessions from the EU but ultimately feeling starved of compromise. The final blow came on June 24, when 51.9% of British voters chose to leave the EU. The marriage, which had been on again, off again since the early days of the Common Market, had once seemed promising. Britain had initially been wooed by the EU, with French President Charles de Gaulle being a major obstacle to the union. However, his death paved the way for Britain to join the EU in 1973. The early years of the marriage were marked by prosperity and a growing sense of equality between Britain and the founding members of the EU. However, over time, the relationship began to sour. The Common Fisheries Policy, which allocated dwindling sea stocks to the EU's benefit, became a major point of contention. Britain's fishermen, farmers, and car manufacturers were among those who felt they were being unfairly treated, leading to growing resentment and a sense of disillusionment. The marriage, which had once seemed so promising, had ultimately become a source of frustration and division. The British naval fleet suffered significant damage, ports were left idle, and European vessels approached British shores closer than ever before. What began as a minor national issue quickly escalated into a festering wound, particularly in fishing communities where the problems in the relationship could simmer and find expression. For farmers in 1984, the Common Agriculture Policy was a source of frustration, as they felt that European subsidies and pricing were undermining their livelihoods and transforming the British countryside. Meanwhile, the industrial landscape was rocked by factory closures, including the once-mighty British Leyland, which fell victim to European competition. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when the relationship began to deteriorate, but gradually, dissatisfaction and disillusionment grew. For some, the relationship became increasingly uncomfortable as the European Community evolved into the EU. In 1990, after years of political resistance, Britain finally joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which aimed to stabilize currency fluctuations and facilitate trade between member states. However, two years later, Britain was forced to withdraw from the mechanism due to its inability to prevent a pound crisis. The introduction of the single market and open borders in 1993 proved to be a catalyst for a long-dormant issue, as it enabled the free flow of goods, services, money, and people across the EU. While the union's goal was to promote economic integration, it also created an opportunity for economic migrants to leave behind their challenging circumstances and seek a better life in Europe. Regardless of its validity, many in Britain felt that their country was the one bearing the brunt of the relationship. What was once a harmonious partnership had devolved into a strained and unbalanced arrangement, with wounds, sores, disease, and inequality taking their toll. Following his unexpected victory in the 2015 general election, David Cameron was forced to keep a campaign promise and issued an ultimatum to Brussels, hoping to salvage the relationship. However, his decision ultimately led to the demise of the partnership, leaving the EU to limp along without Britain. The EU, determined to hold on to its remaining members, is now struggling to maintain a sense of unity and cohesion.",

        "Text": "David Cameron, the former British Prime Minister who lost the Brexit referendum, may be perplexed by the unexpected outcome of his defeat. His request for a \"variable geometry\" arrangement, which would have allowed the UK to opt out of certain EU principles, was rejected by Germany and France. However, as a direct result of Brexit, Germany and France are now embracing the concept of variable geometry as a potential solution for the EU. This paradox is more understandable when viewed through the lens of the traditional European practice of finding a silver lining in failure. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had long opposed the idea of a multi-speed Europe, where some countries are less integrated than others due to their domestic political situations, has now seemingly changed her stance. With the EU's legitimacy weakened by the euro crisis and Euroskeptics gaining momentum, Merkel and other EU leaders believe a multi-speed Europe is crucial to keeping the bloc together. Over the weekend, as EU leaders gathered to mark the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the remaining 27 member states signed the Rome Declaration, which states that they will \"act together, at different paces and intensity where necessary, while moving in the same direction, as we have done in the past.\" The EU's failure to maintain a unified path towards shared values, a single market, and a common currency will be rebranded as a new beginning, leading to a Europe where a coalition of willing members pursues the original goals, while others form outer circles connected to the core through unclear bonds. This multifaceted EU would enable Eastern countries to maintain their illiberal democracies, refusing to accept refugees or adhere to standards of press freedom and judicial independence considered essential by other European nations. Countries like Austria could erect electrified borders, and the door could remain open for the UK to rejoin as part of an outer circle. Whether one agrees with this vision or not, its prospects depend on a crucial prerequisite: a consolidated and stable eurozone. Recognizing this reality reveals the second paradox of our post-Brexit world: the current eurozone is unable to provide the stability the EU and Europe need to thrive. The European establishment's failure to address Greece's bankruptcy is a telling indicator of their capacity to stabilize the eurozone. Unfortunately, the prospects for a stabilized eurozone are bleak. The status quo – the establishment's preferred option – could soon lead to a major Italian crisis that the eurozone cannot withstand. The only alternative being discussed is a watered-down eurozone federation, featuring a tiny common budget that Berlin would agree to in exchange for direct control over French, Italian, and Spanish national budgets. Even if this scenario were to unfold, which is unlikely given the current political climate, it would likely come too late to salvage the eurozone. The harsh reality facing Europe today is that a unified federal government of 27 member states is no longer feasible, given the intense centrifugal forces tearing the continent apart. Meanwhile, a confederacy with a variable geometry, as proposed by David Cameron and potentially desired by the UK after 2019, would require a consolidated eurozone. However, this too seems an impossible feat in the current climate. The EU's approach of allowing member states to move at different speeds and pursue different policies is misguided, as it fails to address the diverse concerns of Europeans living in different countries and instead perpetuates divisions. In reality, Europeans are already united by two existential threats: involuntary under-employment, a consequence of austerity-driven underinvestment, and involuntary migration, a result of the concentration of investment in specific regions. To revive the European Union, each and every country must be stabilized and empowered to thrive. Europe cannot survive as a free-for-all or as an austerity-driven union built on depoliticized economic decision-making, where some countries are condemned to perpetual depression and debtors are denied democratic rights. Instead, Europe needs a New Deal, similar to the one proposed by my organization DiEM25 in Rome, which would span the continent, encompassing all countries regardless of their EU or eurozone membership.",

In Germany, newspapers are already reacting to the news, with Die Welt featuring a front-page image of Prime Minister Theresa May waving from a paper boat made of the Union flag as the sun sets over the sea, with the headline \"Farewell\" and the caption \"Today, the British Prime Minister officially announces the divorce of the EU. For the United Kingdom, it is a journey into the unknown.\" The Berliner Zeitung's front page shows a tattered UK flag against the EU flag, accompanied by a \"Letter to London\" that begins, \"Dear Theresa May!\" and continues, \"Great Britain is announcing its departure today. However, not all is lost yet.\" The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung describes the divorce as \"painful,\" stating, \"No one knows what this means or what will happen in the coming two years. However, one thing is certain: it won't be easy. As is often the case with divorces, it's all about the money. Some Brits are worried that Brussels might demand, 'I want my money back,' as Margaret Thatcher once said.\" Les Echos, a center-right business-focused newspaper, has the headline \"Brexit: Day One\" and highlights \"four traps\" that those negotiating the terms of Brexit will face in the coming months. Le Figaro's front page features a picture of Theresa May leaving 10 Downing Street, captioned \"March 29, 2017: The day the United Kingdom bid farewell to Europe.\" The front page of the French newspaper Libération features a striking image: a black bearskin cap, traditionally worn by the soldiers who guard Buckingham Palace, bears the headline \"Brexit: We miss you already\" in bold letters. The headline is followed by a subtle addition: \"Or not...\". The newspaper has envisioned two possible scenarios for Britain's future, one negative and one positive. Meanwhile, the Belgian newspaper L'Echo proclaims, \"Britain cuts itself off from the Union to dive into the unknown\", accompanied by a graphic depicting the iconic Elizabeth Tower, home to the famous Big Ben bell, being disconnected from a socket emblazoned with the EU's yellow stars on a blue background. In Belgium, La Libre's front page reads, \"Brexit: The cost of the divorce\", promising 12 pages of special coverage. Le Soir's headline is more dramatic: \"Theresa May signs the end of the Europe of 28\", featuring an image of the British Prime Minister signing the letter to be delivered to Brussels triggering Brexit. In Italy, La Stampa's front page declares, \"Brexit, the day of the divorce\". La Repubblica and Il Messagero, also from Italy, highlight the possibility that Brexit could lead to Scotland's exit from the United Kingdom. Finally, the question lingers: \"Brexit: How did we get here?\" ",

        "Text": "Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, stated at a press conference alongside committee vice-chairman Mark Warner that this investigation is one of the largest the Hill has seen during his time in the Senate. Burr has been serving in the Senate since 2005 and in the House since 1995. The committee leaders plan to interview 20 witnesses and have already scheduled five interviews. Burr and Warner expressed satisfaction that President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort have agreed to testify, although they have not yet determined the dates for their appearances. \"To date, we have made 20 requests for individuals to be interviewed by the committee,\" Burr said. \"As of today, five have already been scheduled, and we anticipate that the remaining 15 will have a scheduled date within the next 10 days. We may also invite additional individuals to be interviewed, and some of those interviewed may eventually become private or public hearings, but that has not been decided.\" The committee has reportedly spoken with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after misleading administration officials about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. \"It's safe to say we've had conversations with many people, and it's safe to say General Flynn is one of them,\" Burr said. The Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation has gained momentum as the House investigation has stalled due to partisan disagreements surrounding its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, and his communication with the White House regarding the incidental collection of President Donald Trump and his aides. \"A chorus of Democratic voices is urging Representative Devin Nunes to relinquish his position, whereas a majority of Republicans in the chamber are standing behind him. The committee is scheduled to convene its inaugural public hearing on Thursday.\" ",

        "Text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin was asked directly on Thursday whether Russia had interfered in the US election. In response, he said, \"I'm telling you, no.\" This is the most forceful denial he has made of the allegations to date, and the first time he has directly addressed the issue since Donald Trump took office in January. Despite Putin's denial, Russian officials and spokespeople have repeatedly dismissed the claims as a political \"witch hunt\". The denial comes as US intelligence committees from both the House and Senate investigate alleged Russian interference in the election, including possible ties between Russian officials and members of Trump's campaign team. The FBI is also conducting its own investigation. Putin also downplayed a meeting between Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and close adviser, and Sergey Gorkov, the chairman of the Russian state development bank VneshEconomBank, which has been under US sanctions since 2014. Kushner is expected to give voluntary testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Putin dismissed the meeting, saying, \"American bankers come to Russia and talk to us, don't they? It's only natural that they would hold meetings.\" He went on to say, \"I think it's not in the interest of the American people to take Russian-American relations to the point of absurdity, just to benefit the inner political agenda.\" Putin asked, \"What do we want? To break off diplomatic relations? Force the situation to the point of crisis? And what's next?\" He warned that reckless behavior could lead to a repetition of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Putin expressed hope that the situation would normalize \"and the sooner the better\". The Russian leader also expressed his willingness to meet with Trump on the sidelines of an Arctic summit in Finland in September, stating that his country would be pleased to participate and he would be happy to take part in the event. Despite Trump claiming they have never met, both leaders have repeatedly expressed their openness to a meeting. The US government publicly accused Russia of orchestrating the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and other political organizations affiliated with the Democratic Party in the run-up to the election, a claim they reiterated in October. In January, just before Trump took office, the US intelligence community concluded that Putin had authorized an \"influence campaign\" aimed at undermining Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. The hacked DNC emails, which were publicly released, contained damaging revelations about the Democratic Party and Clinton's campaign. Trump has changed his stance on the issue, initially dismissing the possibility of Russian involvement but later conceding that \"I think it was Russia.\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to the allegations in January, saying they were not supported by evidence and were presented in a \"very amateurish and emotional\" manner. Peskov characterized the situation as a \"full-scale witch hunt.\" Before leaving office, former President Barack Obama ordered a comprehensive review of hacking aimed at influencing US elections dating back to 2008.

The trailer continues to show devastating images of wildfires and floods, accompanied by audio clips of Trump promising to slash climate change funding, effectively positioning him as the film's antagonist. Coincidentally, Trump signed an executive order the same day the trailer was released, limiting the federal government's enforcement of climate regulations, giving the film's tagline - \"Fight like your world depends on it\" - a chilling new relevance. While it's premature to predict the box office performance of the sequel, its predecessor, \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" earned over $24 million domestically and even won two Academy Awards.  ",

        "Text": "Katie Walsh, the White House's deputy chief of staff, is leaving to join a nonprofit organization that supports the President's agenda, according to the President's top aides, who made the announcement on Thursday. This marks the second high-level departure from the White House in the first few months of the administration, following the forced resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn last month. The move also signals a significant shift in the leadership dynamics within the West Wing, as Walsh was a close ally of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Prior to joining the administration, Walsh served as Priebus' chief of staff when he was chairman of the Republican National Committee. She is set to become a senior adviser to America First Policies, a nonprofit group founded by former Trump campaign officials that has struggled to gain traction in the first months of Trump's presidency. A senior White House official emphasized that Walsh was not being forced out, and a source close to the White House described her departure as a \"tremendous loss.\" The source noted that frustration has been building inside the White House over the administration's failure to unite Republicans behind a health care bill supported by Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. According to the source, Walsh recognized the need to better organize external support for the White House's initiatives. \"It was a collective conversation that we could have moved the health care message more effectively,\" a White House official said. Two senior White House officials dismissed the idea that Walsh's departure might signal Priebus' own departure, with one official stating, \"Reince is not next.\" During Thursday's daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked if there would be further staff changes following Katie Walsh's departure. Spicer responded firmly, \"No.\" Top White House officials, including Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, and Jared Kushner, praised Walsh during a briefing in Priebus' West Wing office, where they met with a small group of reporters. Bannon described Walsh as \"the vital link that makes things happen,\" while Kushner referred to her as \"one of the unsung heroes of the campaign\" and commended her \"sacrifice.\" Priebus explained that the decision for Walsh to leave the White House for the outside political group, America First Policies, was made after it became clear that they lacked sufficient support during the health care debate. \"Nobody can fix this problem better than Katie Walsh,\" Priebus said. The three top presidential advisers revealed that they jointly agreed on Walsh's departure, but stated that the idea originated with Walsh herself. America First Policies, initially envisioned as the primary outside group to support Trump's political goals, has struggled in its early months, failing to air television advertisements in support of Trump's Supreme Court nomination and only beginning to spend on the final day of the health care debate. Just this week, the Mercer family, expected to be the group's primary funders, defected to a rival nonprofit, Making America Great, taking with them Dave Bossie, a Mercer operative who had served as deputy campaign manager.

        "Text": "A US District Court judge, Derrick Watson, blocked the core provisions of a revised executive order two weeks ago, ruling that it likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by unfairly targeting Muslims. However, Watson's initial decision was only a temporary restraining order, and the plaintiffs subsequently asked him to convert it into a longer-term preliminary injunction. Watson agreed, effectively blocking the President's 90-day ban on foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries and the 120-day ban on all refugees entering the country indefinitely, unless a higher court intervenes or the lawsuit is resolved. The Justice Department has announced that it will continue to defend the executive order, stating that it is within the President's lawful authority to protect national security. However, the department may now choose to immediately appeal the ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The implications of the decision are unclear, as the timeline for any appeals is uncertain. In his decision, Watson relied on Supreme Court precedent to conclude that the executive order is unconstitutional due to Donald Trump's campaign statements about Muslims. Watson wrote that the court cannot ignore the evidence and must take a stand against the order's discriminatory nature. A federal court has blocked Trump's new travel ban, ruling that the plaintiffs have a strong likelihood of success in their claim that the ban violates the Establishment Clause. The court's decision is significant, as it comes after Trump's own comments about his \"Muslim ban\" were cited as evidence in the case. Separately, the Department of Justice has appealed a different court's decision to halt the 90-day travel ban to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. ",

        "Text": "President Donald Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, will serve as an \"adviser\" to the President and will file her own Form 278, subjecting her to ethics rules. Critics argue that Trump's hiring of his daughter violates federal nepotism laws. On CNN's \"New Day\" program, Alisyn Camerota questioned Jason Miller, a Trump surrogate, about the appointment, asking, \"How is this not nepotism?\" Miller responded, \"It's not nepotism because she's not being paid.\" Camerota countered, \"She's the President's daughter, that's nepotism.\" Miller argued, \"She's volunteering her time and effort for the good of the country, and everyone from the White House counsel to the Department of Justice has said this doesn't violate any nepotism rules.\" Norman Eisen, former White House ethics czar, noted that both the Obama and Bush administrations interpreted the 1967 federal nepotism law to include the White House. The law prohibits public officials, including the President, from hiring or promoting relatives. However, it does provide an exemption for appointees who violate the law, stating that they are \"not entitled to pay\" from the federal government. This loophole allows Trump and Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, to forgo paychecks while still serving the administration. Kushner, a top Trump aide, is also serving as an unpaid government employee. According to a CNN source, the decision to make Ivanka Trump an official employee was made after concerns were raised about the nature of her voluntary role. \"I've taken note of the concerns some have raised about my advising the President in my personal capacity, and I will instead serve as an unpaid staff member in the White House Office, subject to the same ethical standards as all other federal employees. Throughout this process, I've been working collaboratively and in good faith with the White House counsel and my personal legal team to navigate the unique circumstances of my role.\" ",

        "Text": "The 51-50 vote ends Trump's toughest confirmation battle yet. Senate Democrats debated through the night and into Tuesday morning in a last-ditch attempt to derail DeVos, buoyed by support from Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. Throughout the fight, Democrats argued they needed \"Just one more!\" to lure away another Republican vote. But ultimately, the efforts fell short as DeVos was confirmed as the new Secretary of Education, despite strong opposition from Democrats and some Republicans. The confirmation marks a significant milestone for Trump's administration, with DeVos becoming the first cabinet member to be confirmed in a 51-50 vote.\n\nThe intense debate surrounding DeVos' nomination has been fueled by concerns over her lack of experience in public education and her support for charter schools and school vouchers. Democrats have also criticized her views on special education and her role as a philanthropist, which they argue has given her an unfair advantage in the education sector.\n\nThroughout the confirmation process, DeVos has faced fierce opposition from teachers' unions, education advocacy groups, and even some Republicans who have expressed concerns over her qualifications and ideology. In the end, however, it was not enough to sway the vote, and DeVos will now take up her new role as Secretary of Education.\n\nThe confirmation battle has been seen as a test of Trump's ability to navigate the Senate and push through his agenda, and has raised concerns over the future of public education in the United States. The outcome is likely to have significant implications for the education sector, with DeVos' confirmation paving the way for a major overhaul of the nation's education system.\n\nIn a statement, Trump congratulated DeVos on her confirmation, saying \"I am thrilled to announce that Betsy DeVos has been confirmed as the new Secretary of Education. She will be a fantastic Secretary and will do a tremendous job of promoting and protecting our nation's schools.\"\n\nDeVos is set to take up her new role immediately, and is expected to face a range of challenges as she works to implement Trump's education agenda. The confirmation battle has been a long and contentious one, but in the end, it was not enough to derail DeVos' nomination.",

        "Text": "The limited scope of DeVos' education policy experience has raised questions for many about whether she is suited to run the federal agency charged with making American public education first-rate for all children. But there is another subterranean element to this debate, which now should be surfaced, especially given our racially charged environment and the role that segregated schools have long played in our politics. Racial animus was a primary catalyst of the move toward private and religious K-12 education almost 50 years ago, and racial segregation remains a dominant factor in all schooling, public and private, today. DeVos' track record suggests that as secretary, she will do little to combat these trends. In the wake of the 1954 Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision, which famously declared that separate schools for black and white children were not equal, the federal government began -- albeit slowly -- to desegregate. This applied to schools in the South that were previously forbidden by law from educating children of different races together and to schools in the North plagued by de facto segregation. The backlash, now infamous but perhaps too familiar even today, was fierce. From Alabama Governor George Wallace's stance in the schoolhouse door and his proclamations of \"segregation now, segregation forever\" to Louise Day Hicks leading the Boston antibusing movement, the reaction to desegregation roiled American politics. But the Brown ruling did not apply to private schools. and therefore, private schools were able to maintain their segregated status. This created a two-tiered education system, where public schools were forced to integrate, while private schools remained segregated. This dichotomy has had lasting consequences, perpetuating racial and socioeconomic segregation in education.\n\nBetsy DeVos' support for voucher programs and charter schools, which often draw students away from public schools, raises concerns that she may inadvertently exacerbate this problem. Her emphasis on school choice, while touted as a means to increase competition and improve education, may ultimately lead to further segregation and a widening of the achievement gap.\n\nMoreover, DeVos' limited experience with education policy, combined with her lack of understanding of the historical and ongoing impacts of segregation, may lead to a lack of effective solutions to address these issues. Her confirmation hearings have already highlighted her unfamiliarity with the nuances of desegregation and integration, as well as her dismissive attitude towards the concept of systemic racism.\n\nThe implications of DeVos' policies on racial segregation in education are far-reaching. If implemented, they may lead to a further erosion of public schools, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority communities. This would not only perpetuate existing inequalities but also undermine the very fabric of our democratic society.\n\nIn light of these concerns, it is essential that we, as a society, demand more from our education leaders. We need individuals who understand the complex interplay between education, segregation, and systemic racism. We need leaders who are committed to promoting equity and access, rather than perpetuating the status quo.\n\nThe confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education is a critical moment in our nation's history. It is a moment that requires us to reflect on our values and priorities. Do we value equality and justice, or do we prioritize the interests of the privileged few? The answer to this question will have far-reaching consequences for the future of American education and the future of our democracy.",

Khamenei reportedly told the commanders: \"We however thank this new guy in the White House, since he largely did the job we had been trying to do in the past decades: to divulge the true face of the US. We had been working to show the world the depth of corruption in US government and ranks and files of the ruling elite; Trump did it in few days after coming to the White House.\" He added: \"Their claims to human rights are no longer tenable.\" Khamenei also made an apparent reference to the five-year-old son of an Iranian mother who was detained at a US airport following Trump's ban on visas for seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. According to the MEHR news agency, Khamenei said that the detention of the five-year-old boy, whose mother had been planning to visit her family in the United States, was a stark example of the \"brutality\" of the US government. He called it a \"child's blood\" and a \"crimes against humanity\" and said that it was a \"clear manifestation of the American government's hypocrisy and racism\".\n\nKhamenei's comments come at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the United States, following Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions on the country. The Iranian supreme leader has been a vocal critic of Trump's policies, and his comments are likely to be seen as a further escalation of the rhetoric between the two nations.\n\nThe Iranian air force commanders who were present at the gathering were reportedly left stunned by Khamenei's remarks, with one commander telling the MEHR news agency that it was \"unprecedented\" for the supreme leader to speak so bluntly about the US government.\n\nThe Iranian government has been working to present itself as a champion of human rights and a defender of Muslim communities around the world, and Khamenei's comments are likely to be seen as a challenge to that narrative. The US government has accused Iran of violating human rights and supporting terrorism, and Khamenei's remarks are likely to be seen as a further escalation of the rhetoric between the two nations.\n\nThe comments also come as the US is preparing to impose new sanctions on Iran, which could have significant economic implications for the country. The Iranian government has warned that it will respond to the sanctions with \"firm and decisive\" action, and Khamenei's comments are likely to be seen as a warning to the US that Iran will not be intimidated by the sanctions.\n\nOverall, Khamenei's comments are likely to be seen as a significant escalation of the rhetoric between Iran and the US, and could have significant implications for the future of relations between the two nations.",

        "Text": "In an 11-minute recording, AQAP leader Qassim al-Rimi condemned the January 29 raid, saying, \"The new fool of the White House received a painful slap across his face.\" The message was released online Saturday and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. In the recording, Rimi also claimed \"dozens of Americans were killed and wounded,\" a number starkly at odds with the US account, which reported the death of one Navy SEAL, Chief Petty Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens. Three additional SEALs also were wounded. Rimi acknowledged the deaths of 14 men and 11 women and children in the raid, a joint counterterrorism effort between the United States and United Arab Emirates. A senior US military official told CNN on Monday that Rimi was a target of the operation. The recording was released after last week's raid. The message, which was laced with vitriol and anti-American rhetoric, was a stark reminder of the escalating tensions between the US and AQAP. Rimi, who has been the leader of AQAP's Yemen branch since 2015, accused the US of launching the raid in an attempt to assassinate him, and vowed to exact revenge.\n\nThe US military has been carrying out a campaign of drone strikes and special operations raids against AQAP in Yemen for several years, but the January 29 raid was particularly intense and resulted in significant casualties on both sides.\n\nThe raid, which was authorized by President Donald Trump, was intended to gather intelligence on AQAP's plans and disrupt its ability to launch attacks against the US and its allies. However, it quickly went awry when the SEALs encountered heavy resistance from AQAP fighters, and the mission descended into chaos.\n\nIn the recording, Rimi also accused the US of \"spilling the blood of Muslims\" and said that the raid would only serve to increase AQAP's resolve to fight against the US and its allies. He called on Muslims around the world to rise up against the US and its allies, and vowed to continue to wage jihad against them.\n\nThe release of the recording is likely to further inflame tensions between the US and AQAP, and may also have implications for the ongoing conflict in Yemen. The war in Yemen, which has been raging for several years, has created a humanitarian crisis and has drawn in a number of foreign powers, including the US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.\n\nIn the meantime, the US military is reviewing the circumstances surrounding the raid and the subsequent release of the recording. The Pentagon has not commented publicly on the contents of the recording, but a senior military official told CNN that the US is \"evaluating the situation and considering its next steps.\"\n\nThe release of the recording is also likely to raise questions about the effectiveness of the US military's counterterrorism strategy in Yemen. The raid was intended to disrupt AQAP's ability to launch attacks against the US, but the group has already claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in recent months, including a bombing at a military parade in Yemen's capital city.\n\nIn the face of these challenges, the US military is likely to continue to rely on a combination of drone strikes and special operations raids to target AQAP's leadership and disrupt its ability to launch attacks. However, the release of the recording serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of the conflict in Yemen, and the need for a more nuanced and effective approach to counterterrorism.",

        "Text": "On Monday, the White House issued a list of 78 terror attacks to underscore President Donald Trump's assertion that the media is failing to adequately report them. Trump told enlisted service-members at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida that attacks were happening \"all over Europe\" and that \"it's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported.\" \"And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that,\" Trump added. Later, the White House distributed a list of the attacks Trump was citing, saying \"most did not receive adequate attention.\" The list of 78 terror attacks, released by the White House, spanned several years and included incidents in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many of the attacks were not well-known outside of their local communities, and some had received minimal media coverage.\n\nThe list included attacks such as the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris, which killed 12 people, and the 2016 Nice truck attack, which killed 86 people. It also included lesser-known attacks, such as a 2017 stabbing in a Munich shopping center that injured several people, and a 2018 suicide bombing in a Kabul restaurant that killed 14 people.\n\nThe White House claimed that many of the attacks had been underreported or ignored by the media, and that the list was intended to provide a more comprehensive picture of the threat posed by terrorism. However, many media outlets and terrorism experts questioned the accuracy and usefulness of the list, pointing out that it included a number of attacks that had been widely reported and others that were not necessarily related to terrorism.\n\nThe list also included a number of attacks that had been carried out by individuals or groups that were not considered to be terrorist organizations, such as a 2017 shooting in a Texas church that killed 26 people. This has led some to criticize the White House for using the list to further its own political agenda, rather than providing a genuine effort to inform the public about the threat of terrorism.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the list has also highlighted the ongoing debate about the role of the media in reporting on terrorism. Some argue that the media has a responsibility to report on all terrorist attacks, no matter how small or isolated, in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the threat posed by terrorism. Others argue that the media should focus on reporting on the most significant and impactful attacks, and not waste resources on minor incidents.\n\nThe White House has continued to defend its list, saying that it is an important tool for understanding the threat posed by terrorism and that it will continue to release similar lists in the future. However, many have questioned the usefulness and accuracy of the list, and the controversy is likely to continue for some time.",

        "Text": "The lawsuit, brought by attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota, has captivated the nation since last Friday when a federal district court judge put a stop to Trump's executive order restricting travel for foreign nationals, and as a result, temporarily opened US borders to immigrants once again. The hearing will be by telephone and livestreamed; here's what to listen for: What's the hearing about? US District Court Judge James Robart upended Trump's executive order nationwide Friday by temporarily halting the key provisions restricting travel for foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen) and refugee admissions. The central question for the appellate court is whether Robart abused his discretion by putting a temporary hold on the travel ban. No court has addressed the constitutionality of the executive order thus far. The players The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, filed the case and was later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota, Lori Swanson. The suit is being defended by lawyers at the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, DC. The randomly assigned three-judge panel includes Judge William C. Canby Jr, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Michelle T. Friedland; who was appointed by President Barack Obama; and Judge Richard R. Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush. When is this hearing? The appellate court has set an hour-long telephonic oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 6 p.m. The hearing is expected to focus on the legal merits of the executive order, with the judges questioning both sides on the constitutionality and legality of the travel ban. The attorneys general of Washington and Minnesota will likely argue that the order is discriminatory and violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from promoting one religion over another.\n\nThe Department of Justice, on the other hand, will likely argue that the order is a legitimate exercise of the president's national security powers and that it is necessary to protect the country from potential terrorist threats.\n\nThe judges may also ask questions about the impact of the travel ban on individuals and families who have been affected by it, including those who have been detained or deported, as well as those who have been unable to travel to the United States due to the ban.\n\nIn addition to the legal arguments, the hearing may also focus on the procedural issues surrounding the case, including whether Judge Robart overstepped his authority by issuing a nationwide injunction against the travel ban.\n\nThe outcome of the hearing is difficult to predict, but it is likely that the appellate court will issue a ruling in the coming weeks or months. If the court upholds Judge Robart's decision, the travel ban will remain blocked, and the US borders will remain open to immigrants. However, if the court reverses Judge Robart's decision, the travel ban will go back into effect, and the US borders will be closed to immigrants from the seven affected countries.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the hearing is likely to have significant implications for the ongoing debate over immigration and national security in the United States.",

        "Text": "President Klaus Iohannis said it is time for Romania to decide whether it wants to be a \"strong prosperous\" nation or a \"weak despised one\" -- and he called for a referendum so the people can have their say. Half a million citizens took to the streets on Sunday in the largest of a series of demonstrations over a bill that would have protected many politicians from being prosecuted for corruption. The Social Democrat-led government announced that day in a statement that it was repealing the decree, which had been approved last week without input from Parliament. However, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu indicated that he still planned to push through the amendments to the criminal codes via legislation that would be put to Parliament for approval. Protests continued over the issue Monday night -- albeit on a smaller scale -- with calls for the government to be removed. 'Transparent government' In his speech on Tuesday, Iohannis, a former National Liberal Party politician, said withdrawing the decree is too little. Although he stopped short of calling for a fresh election, he told members of the center-left government, which has been in power since December, \"Your first worry was to take care of the files of the convicted (politicians). Romanians are appalled. \"The withdrawal of Ordnance 13 is too little. Early elections, at this point, is too much. Who needs to come up with a solution? The Social Democrats, as they created the problem.\" The Romanian President's words were met with a mixed reaction from the government and opposition parties. Social Democrat leader Liviu Dragnea, who is also the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, accused Iohannis of \"interfering\" in the legislative process and called his remarks \"unpresidential\". Dragnea claimed that the President's comments were an attempt to undermine the government's efforts to reform the criminal code.\n\nIn response, opposition parties, including the National Liberal Party, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, welcomed Iohannis' call for a referendum, saying it was a necessary step to restore public trust in the government.\n\nThe leader of the opposition National Liberal Party, Raluca Turcan, said that the government's decision to repeal the decree was a \"PR stunt\" and that the people wanted a genuine change in the way politics was done in Romania. \"The government is trying to buy time, but the people will not be fooled,\" she said.\n\nThe protests that began on Sunday continued throughout the week, with thousands of people taking to the streets in major cities across the country. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, but there were reports of clashes between protesters and police in some areas.\n\nAs the political crisis deepened, international organizations and foreign governments began to take notice. The European Union's Commissioner for Justice, Vera Jourova, said that the situation in Romania was \"concerning\" and that the EU was closely following developments. The United States Embassy in Bucharest also issued a statement, calling for \"greater transparency and accountability\" in Romanian politics.\n\nIn the midst of the turmoil, Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu met with his cabinet to discuss the government's next steps. While he did not rule out the possibility of a referendum, he made it clear that the government would not be swayed by public pressure alone. \"We will not be dictated to by the streets,\" he said. \"We will continue to work towards our goals, and if that means facing opposition from the President or the opposition parties, so be it.\"\n\nAs the standoff between the government and the opposition continues, one thing is clear: the future of Romanian politics hangs in the balance. Will the government be able to push through its reforms, or will the people's desire for change ultimately prevail? Only time will tell.",

Now that Obama is free from many Secret Service-imposed restrictions that did not allow him to partake in activities like surfing, Branson offered Obama the chance to learn how to kitesurf. But to make things more interesting, Branson took on a challenge of his own. Branson announced that he would attempt to break the world record for the longest kitesurfing session. The two friends set up their equipment on the pristine white sands of Necker Island, Branson's private retreat, and prepared to take on the challenge.\n\nAs they hit the water, the crowd of onlookers cheered as Obama, donning a helmet and wetsuit, struggled to get the hang of kitesurfing. Meanwhile, Branson effortlessly glided across the waves, his skills honed from years of experience.\n\nBut just as Obama was starting to get the feel of it, Branson called out to her, \"Time to take it to the next level!\" He led her out to the open ocean, where the winds were stronger and the waves were bigger. The crowd gasped as they watched the two friends take on the challenging conditions.\n\nIn the end, Branson completed an impressive 4-hour and 22-minute kitesurfing session, shattering the previous record by over an hour. Obama, meanwhile, managed to stay on her board for a respectable 20 minutes before wiping out in a spectacular fashion.\n\nDespite the outcome, both friends were beaming with pride and excitement. \"That was an incredible experience!\" Obama exclaimed. \"I never knew how much fun kitesurfing could be!\" Branson grinned, \"And I never knew I could push myself to new heights...literally!\"\n\nAs they packed up their gear and headed back to shore, the two friends couldn't help but wonder what their next adventure would be. With their competitive spirits already fired up, it's clear that this is just the beginning of a long and thrilling friendship.",

        "Text": "And it's been this way for more than a century. But a new injectable gel that blocks sperm inside the body, preventing them from leaving while allowing seminal fluid to pass through, has proved effective in trials using monkeys. The researchers behind the product, known as Vasalgel, hope it could get trials in humans within a few years. \"What was important here was that this worked and was safe in animals similar to humans,\" said Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, the medical research organization behind Vasalgel that is also leading the trials. A new study, published Tuesday, involved 16 male monkeys receiving injections of Vasalgel who were released into social outdoor housing with females. Any adverse effects, as well as their ability to impregnate females, was compared with a historical sample of monkeys that had received vasectomies. \"It was a simple efficacy study,\" Lissner said, meaning the researchers merely set out to see whether the gel was safe and worked to prevent pregnancy. The social groups were monitored for at least one breeding season, and the team reported in its paper that none of the females in the group conceived during that time. One monkey had the gel inserted incorrectly, and another developed a sperm granuloma, or lump of sperm, but the majority tolerated the gel and saw little inflammation, Lissner said, adding that rates of granuloma and inflammation are usually higher after a vasectomy. The breakthrough comes at a time when vasectomy, a surgical procedure that cuts and seals the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm out of the body, has become increasingly popular as a form of birth control. However, the procedure is not without its drawbacks, including the risk of complications and the fact that it is not reversible.\n\nVasalgel, on the other hand, is a non-surgical, non-hormonal, and reversible form of birth control that could offer a more appealing option for men. The gel is made up of a polymer that is designed to block the vas deferens, preventing sperm from leaving the body while allowing seminal fluid to pass through.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the gel is easy to administer and can be inserted into the vas deferens using a simple injection. The procedure is also relatively quick, taking around 10-15 minutes to complete.\n\nThe team behind Vasalgel is now planning to move forward with human trials, which they hope will begin within the next few years. If the results are positive, the gel could potentially become a new option for men who are looking for a more effective and reversible form of birth control.\n\n\"We're excited about the potential of Vasalgel to provide a new and improved option for men who want to take control of their reproductive health,\" said Lissner. \"We believe that this could be a game-changer for men and their partners, and we're looking forward to seeing the results of our human trials.\"\n\nThe development of Vasalgel is part of a growing trend towards the development of new and innovative forms of birth control. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in developing new methods of birth control that are more effective, reversible, and user-friendly.\n\nThe Parsemus Foundation is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to advancing the field of medical research and developing new treatments for a range of conditions, including infertility and birth control. The organization has been working on the development of Vasalgel for several years and is committed to bringing the product to market as soon as possible.\n\nOverall, the development of Vasalgel is an exciting breakthrough that could potentially offer a new and improved option for men who are looking for a more effective and reversible form of birth control. The results of the human trials will be closely watched by researchers and medical professionals around the world.",

        "Text": "Japan controls the chain and calls them the Senkaku Islands, while China calls them the Diaoyu Islands. The sailing comes just days after US Defense Secretary James Mattis reaffirmed America's commitment to defending Japan and its disputed islands. According to Japanese broadcaster NHK, protests were lodged with the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo and in Beijing through the Japanese Embassy. Tensions have flashed numerous times in recent years over the disputed islands,-including face-offs between Japanese and Chinese air and naval forces-that have been termed dangerous by both sides. EXPLAINER: How an uninhabited island chain split Japan and China China's State Oceanic Administration, which oversees the country's Coast Guard, put out a statement late Monday saying the three ships \"cruised within China's Diaoyu Islands territorial sea.\" China's Defense Ministry, which is separate from the Oceanic Administration, posted a statement on its website confirming the Coast Guard ship movement. Japan's Coast Guard said the Chinese vessels spent two hours in Japanese territorial waters. It was the fourth time Chinese ships have entered Japan's waters this year, the Japanese Coast Guard said. The Japanese government has summoned the Chinese ambassador to Tokyo to protest the latest incursion, while the Chinese government has accused Japan of \"serious provocations\" and \"hyping up tensions\". The incident has raised concerns about the potential for further escalation in the region, with both countries holding significant military and economic interests in the area.\n\nThe Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are a small chain of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea, with Japan claiming sovereignty over the islands since 1895. China, on the other hand, has been making increasingly assertive claims to the islands in recent years, citing historical records and maps that date back to the Qing dynasty.\n\nThe latest incident has sparked widespread outrage in Japan, with many calling for the government to take a tougher stance against China's aggressive actions. The Japanese Coast Guard has been instructed to take all necessary measures to protect the country's territorial waters, and the government has announced plans to increase military spending to counter the growing threat from China.\n\nThe United States has also weighed in on the dispute, with a spokesperson for the US State Department urging both countries to resolve their differences peacefully and in accordance with international law. The US has long been a key ally of Japan and has repeatedly expressed its commitment to defending the country's territorial integrity.\n\nAs tensions continue to simmer in the region, many are left wondering what the long-term implications of this latest incident will be. Will it lead to further escalation and potentially even conflict, or will cooler heads prevail and the two countries be able to find a peaceful resolution to their dispute? Only time will tell.",

The start hut is cut into a rock face and the slick slope is so steep -- 100% or 45 degrees -- TV cameramen must abseil into positions wearing crampons. But the one skier able to conquer their fear and harness this breakneck speed will be crowned world downhill champion for the next two years. The race is the highlight of the 2017 World Championships, which start this week in the chic Swiss town. St. Moritz, the jewel of the Engadin valley, has been a longtime destination for the jetset and draws a well-heeled international clientele to its fine-dining restaurants and five-star hotels. Often dubbed the \"home of winter sports,\" St. Moritz has hosted two Winter Olympics and four previous World Championships. A total of 600 athletes from more than 70 countries will compete across six alpine skiing disciplines -- slalom, giant slalom, super-G, downhill, super combined (downhill and slalom) and the team event. Outside of the Olympics, it's the biggest event in the sport and carries more cachet than the World Cup circuit. As the world's top skiers prepare to descend upon St. Moritz, excitement is building in the picturesque town. The streets are adorned with flags and banners, and the sound of cheering crowds can already be heard echoing off the surrounding mountains.\n\nFor the athletes, the focus is on the slopes, where they will face a challenging course that has been carefully designed to test their skills and bravery. The men's downhill course, in particular, is expected to be a highlight of the championships, with its steep drop-offs and technical turns.\n\nAmong the favorites to win the men's downhill title is Marcel Hirscher of Austria, who has dominated the sport in recent years. However, he will face stiff competition from a talented group of young skiers, including Norway's Kjetil Jansrud and Switzerland's Beat Feuz.\n\nIn the women's events, the focus is on the battle for supremacy between Austria's Anna Veith and Slovenia's Ilka Stuhec. Both skiers have won World Cup titles in the past and are expected to be strong contenders for the overall championship.\n\nThe 2017 World Championships will also feature a new format for the team event, which will see countries competing in a series of relay-style events.

        "Text": "There is art in science -- the artistic precision of the scalpel, the cool aesthetics of the laboratory, and the intimate observations undertaken by scientists to discover new materials and microbes living unseen in the world. Bio-art, an artistic genre that took hold in the 1980s, solidifies, extends and enriches this organic relationship. According to the artist and writer Frances Stracey, it represents: \"a crossover of art and the biological sciences, with living matter, such as genes, cells or animals, as its new media.\" Bio-artists might use and incorporate imaging technologies within the artistic space; bringing living and dead matter into the gallery. They draw upon biology metaphors to imbue artwork with healing and wounding propensities. wounding propensities. This fusion of art and science has given rise to a new wave of creatives who are pushing the boundaries of traditional mediums. Bio-artists are no longer content to simply depict the natural world, but instead, they are actively engaging with it, manipulating its very essence to create works that are both beautiful and thought-provoking.\n\nOne such artist is Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who has gained international recognition for her work \"Grow Your Own Brain\". This installation features a series of glass jars filled with a gelatinous substance that resembles the human brain. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the \"brain\" is actually a collection of 3D-printed neurons, grown from the artist's own DNA.\n\nAnother notable bio-artist is Chiharu Shiota, who has created a series of intricate installations using thousands of red yarns to represent the neural connections in the human brain. Her work, \"The Key in the Hand\", is a testament to the beauty and complexity of the human mind.\n\nBio-art is not limited to visual art forms alone. Musician and composer, Christina Kubisch, has created a series of sound installations that use electromagnetic fields to generate music. Her work, \"Electrosmog\", uses sensors to detect the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the city, translating it into a symphony of sounds that are both haunting and beautiful.\n\nAs bio-art continues to evolve, it is clear that its impact will be felt across multiple disciplines. From medicine to environmental science, bio-art is pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible, and challenging us to rethink our relationship with the natural world.\n\nIn the words of Frances Stracey, \"Bio-art is not just about making art, it's about making a difference. It's about using art to understand the world, and to change it for the better.\" As we move forward into an uncertain future, the fusion of art and science may just hold the key to unlocking new possibilities, and redefining what it means to be human.",

In 2017, a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that looks like a dead gorilla was put up for sale on the internet. Well, we had a good run. but it seems that our world has taken a drastic turn for the absurd. The internet, once a platform for sharing knowledge and connecting with others, has devolved into a never-ending abyss of bizarre and bewildering wonders.\n\nThe Flamin' Hot Cheeto, which has been dubbed \"Gorilla-Cheeto\" by its creator, has sparked a frenzy of interest among collectors and enthusiasts. Bidding has reached an unprecedented level, with some speculating that the Cheeto could fetch upwards of $10,000.\n\nBut what's behind this sudden fascination with a bag of fried cornmeal and artificial cheese dust? Some say it's a commentary on the superficiality of modern society, where we're more concerned with fleeting trends and novelties than with substance and meaning. Others claim it's a cry for help, a desperate attempt to distract ourselves from the crushing bleakness of existence.\n\nWhatever the reason, one thing is certain: the world will never be the same again. The Pieta, once considered the pinnacle of artistic achievement, now seems like a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time when humanity valued beauty and creativity over fleeting fame and fortune.\n\nAs we gaze upon the Gorilla-Cheeto, we're forced to confront the fact that our priorities have shifted. We're no longer content with mere masterpieces; we crave the bizarre, the bizarre, and the utterly bewildering.\n\nAnd so, we'll continue to bid, to collect, and to marvel at the sheer audacity of it all. For in a world gone mad, even the most outlandish creations can become the norm.

        "Text": "But nature is not always kind. Fifty percent of the world's lion population lives in East Africa -- and lions like to eat livestock. Historically the Maasai would use deadly force to protect their herds, often heading out in revenge parties to hunt and kill lions. There were ritual killings also, known as \"Ala-mayo.\" Killing a lion, a symbol of strength and power, was a rite of passage for Maasai initiates into \"Morani,\" the warrior class. Armed with a spear, these youths became men in the process, returning to the tribe to be treated with new-found respect. The Tanzanian government banned ritual killing in the 1970s, but certain pockets of activity were silently condoned. In Ngorongoro Crater, north west of Tarangire National Park and a conservation area since 1959, the practice was judged sustainable due to the high lion concentration and low human presence. In the 1960s the tribe claimed no more than 10 animals per year, but as with so much of the world in the 20th century, the Maasai's population grew in Ngorongoro. Forty lions, if not more, are now under threat annually in the conservation area, and all over Tanzania lion numbers are declining. Conservationists know the problem needs to be addressed, and in a remarkable turnaround they've enlisted the very best gamekeepers to patrol the Maasai Steppe: the Maasai themselves. At around 5am the Maasai \"Wildlife Warriors\" rise to birdsong, nature's alarm clock. A bowl of porridge and cup of chai to start the day. Slipping on a pair of sandals, their soles recycled from old car tires, the Warriors head out of their \"kraal,\" a small sheltered community, to begin tracking. As they venture into the vast expanse of the Maasai Steppe, the Warriors' keen eyes scan the horizon for any sign of movement. Their mission is clear: to protect the lions that roam this land, while also safeguarding the Maasai's own livestock. It's a delicate balance, one that requires patience, skill, and a deep understanding of the natural world.\n\nThe Warriors move with a quiet purpose, their footsteps light on the dusty earth. They know every inch of this terrain, every rock, every tree, every watering hole. They've grown up here, learning the ways of the land from their fathers and grandfathers.\n\nAs they track, they're on the lookout for any signs of lion activity. They know that these majestic creatures can be unpredictable, and that a sudden attack on a Maasai herd can be devastating. But they also know that the lions are an integral part of the ecosystem, and that their loss would have far-reaching consequences.\n\nAfter several hours of walking, the Warriors come across a small herd of cattle grazing peacefully in a green valley. They move in quietly, not wanting to startle the animals or attract any unwanted attention from the lions. As they approach, they notice that one of the cows is limping, its leg injured from a recent attack.\n\nThe Warriors know that they need to act quickly to prevent further attacks. They carefully move the injured cow to a safe location, where it can receive medical attention. As they work, they're aware of the lions watching from a distance, their eyes fixed intently on the Maasai.\n\nThe Warriors know that they're not just protecting the livestock, but also the very fabric of their community. They're fighting to preserve a way of life that's been passed down through generations, a way of life that's deeply connected to the land and its creatures.\n\nAs the sun begins to set, the Warriors make their way back to their kraal, tired but triumphant. They know that their work is far from over, but they're determined to continue fighting for the future of their people and the animals they love. For the Maasai, the lions are not just predators, but also a symbol of their strength and resilience. And as they settle in for the night, they know that they'll be back out on the steppe again at dawn, ready to face whatever challenges come their way.",

        "Text": "But when you are the Dalai Lama, the deepest lines on your 81-year-old skin are laugh lines. His Holiness knows how to find joy in nearly everything and everyone, largely because of his sense of humor. It is something he uses regularly to quickly win over crowds and something he thinks everyone should embrace in order to have a better life. When he presided over the Emory-Tibet Symposium in December at an imposing temple owned by the Tibetan community in exile in Mundgod, India, he showed his teasing nature right away. Gathered were thousands of saffron-robed nuns and monks, world-renowned scientists, Tibetans and many interested followers, eager learn how to \"bridge science and Buddhism for mutual enrichment.\" The crowd looked as serious as the topic. As they waited in the temple, they murmured quietly and shifted in their seats. Finally, the low moan of a guttural chant began, and everyone quieted and sat up a little straighter. When His Holiness finally emerged from a side door, the sound of scraping plastic chairs echoed throughout the hall as the crowd stood and applauded. Some prostrated themselves on the ground. His Holiness walked in slowly, surrounded by monks in traditional robes and bodyguards in Western dress. Two monks gently guided him down a small set of steps. At the bottom, the Dalai Lama smiled with great joy, laughing and waving at the friends gathered in his honor. \"When you smile, I notice everyone around you smiles. I notice it is very contagious as well,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical correspondent, in an interview with His Holiness after the event. \"Basically, we are social animal,\" the Dalai Lama replied. \"We need friend. Here is the completed news article:\n\nAs the Dalai Lama made his way to the podium, the energy in the room shifted from serious to celebratory. He began his talk by poking fun at the elaborate setup of the temple, remarking that it was a \"very nice\" place to hold a meeting, but perhaps a bit too grand for a discussion about science and Buddhism.\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter, and the tension was broken. For the next hour, the Dalai Lama spoke about the importance of approaching both science and spirituality with an open mind and a sense of humor. He shared stories about his own experiences with science, including a humorous anecdote about a meeting with a group of scientists who were trying to explain the concept of \"nothingness\" to him.\n\n\"You see, my friends, as a Buddhist, I believe that even in the absence of something, there is still something,\" he said, chuckling. \"It's a bit like trying to explain the concept of 'nothingness' to a Tibetan monk. We're used to thinking about the interconnectedness of all things, so the idea of nothingness is quite foreign to us.\"\n\nThe audience was in stitches, and even the most serious-looking attendees couldn't help but crack a smile. Dr. Gupta, who was seated in the front row, was beaming with delight. \"His Holiness has a way of making even the most complex topics seem approachable and fun,\" he said in an interview after the event. \"He's a true master of the art of communication.\"\n\nAs the symposium came to a close, the Dalai Lama took questions from the audience, fielding queries about everything from the nature of consciousness to the best way to achieve inner peace. Throughout the discussion, he remained warm, witty, and engaging, using his humor to defuse any tense moments and keep the mood light.\n\nAs the attendees filed out of the temple, many of them were still grinning from ear to ear. \"I never would have thought that a discussion about science and Buddhism could be so entertaining,\" said one attendee, a young woman from Germany. \"But the Dalai Lama has a way of making even the most serious topics seem fun and accessible.\"\n\nFor His Holiness, the key to a happy and fulfilling life is simple: \"Laughter is the best medicine,\" he said, smiling. \"And when you combine it with compassion, kindness, and a sense of humor, you have a recipe for a truly joyful and meaningful existence.\"",

        "Text": "Trump was defending the Russian President after Fox's Bill O'Reilly called Putin a \"killer.\" His response, \"You think our country is so innocent,\" reveals Trump's dismissive attitude toward the most fundamental democratic norms that America has aspired to embody. Clearly, the United States has made many grave mistakes throughout history, but the country's guiding principles have remained unchanged: the fierce defense of individual liberties and an unshakeable commitment to democratic ideals. In Russia, by contrast, Putin has decimated the opposition, imprisoned critics and taken control of all branches of government. The free press is a faint shadow of its former self, and Putin's critics, including journalists, continue to turn up dead under suspicious circumstances. It is precisely this stark contrast between the two nations that makes Trump's defense of Putin so disturbing. By minimizing the atrocities committed by the Russian leader, Trump is not only condoning his actions but also eroding the very foundations of American democracy.\n\nThe President's response, \"You think our country is so innocent,\" is a classic example of moral equivalence, a tactic often employed by authoritarian regimes to justify their own abuses of power. It is a cynical attempt to shift the focus away from Russia's egregious human rights violations and towards perceived American shortcomings.\n\nBut Trump's words are not just a betrayal of American values; they are also a reflection of his own authoritarian tendencies. His administration has been marked by a consistent pattern of attacking the free press, silencing critics, and undermining the rule of law. The erosion of democratic norms is a global phenomenon, and Trump's defense of Putin is a stark reminder that the United States is not immune to this trend.\n\nAs the world watches in horror, Trump's words have sent a chilling message to would-be critics of authoritarian regimes: that the United States will no longer be a beacon of democracy and human rights, but rather a willing accomplice in the erosion of these fundamental values.\n\nIn the face of such blatant disregard for human rights and democratic norms, it is imperative that the American people demand more from their leaders. They must hold Trump accountable for his actions and demand that he uphold the values that America has always aspired to embody. The world is watching, and the future of democracy hangs in the balance.",

        "Text": "\"Whataboutism\" was a favorite Kremlin propaganda technique during the Cold War. It aimed to portray the West as so morally flawed that its criticism of the Soviet empire was hypocritical. Any criticism of the Soviet Union (the war in Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, persecution of dissidents) was met with a list of Western abuses (supporting fascist dictatorships, trampling trade unions, racial oppression). It was well encapsulated in a joke about the fictional Radio Yerevan (a staple of Soviet-era humor) in which a caller asks what is the average wage of an American manual worker. The real answer would undermine Soviet claims to economic superiority, so after a pause, the pundit replies: \"Over there they lynch Negroes.\" By the time the system collapsed, that phrase had become a derisive synecdoche for Soviet propaganda as a whole. As the Cold War drew to a close, the term \"whataboutism\" seemed to fade into obscurity, replaced by new challenges and controversies in the post-Soviet era. However, in recent years, it has experienced a surprising resurgence, particularly in the realm of social media and online discourse.\n\nIn the age of Twitter and Facebook, \"whataboutism\" has evolved into a potent tool for deflecting criticism and discredit opponents. It's often employed by individuals and groups seeking to shift the focus away from their own actions or policies, and onto perceived wrongdoings of others.\n\nThe tactic has been used by politicians, pundits, and even ordinary citizens to respond to criticisms, accusations, or simply to silence opposing viewpoints. By asking \"What about...?\" or \"But what about...?\", proponents of \"whataboutism\" aim to create a sense of moral equivalence, implying that the original criticism is invalid or hypocritical.\n\nThe revival of \"whataboutism\" has been attributed to various factors, including the proliferation of social media, the rise of populist politics, and the increasing polarization of society. Critics argue that this tactic undermines constructive dialogue, fosters a culture of blame-shifting, and diverts attention from real issues.\n\nIn recent high-profile cases, \"whataboutism\" has been employed to deflect criticism of everything from political scandals to social injustices. For instance, in response to allegations of corruption, a prominent politician might say, \"What about the corruption in other countries?\" or \"What about the corruption in the past?\" Similarly, in discussions about racial inequality, some individuals might counter with \"What about the racial discrimination against white people?\" or \"What about the injustices suffered by other groups?\"\n\nWhile \"whataboutism\" may have originated as a Soviet propaganda technique, its modern iteration is a more nuanced and insidious phenomenon. It's no longer limited to the realm of geopolitics, but has become a ubiquitous feature of online discourse, social media, and even mainstream politics.\n\nAs we navigate this increasingly complex and divided world, it's essential to recognize the dangers of \"whataboutism\" and to develop strategies for combating it. By promoting critical thinking, empathy, and respectful dialogue, we can work towards creating a more informed, engaged, and civically responsible public sphere.",

We all know his thin-skinned, humorless boss, President Donald Trump, has not taken kindly to SNL's countless spoofs, complaining on Twitter that SNL is \"unwatchable,\" \"totally biased\" and \"not funny.\" He's also said that Alec Baldwin's impersonation \"just can't get any worse.\" I happen to largely agree with that assessment. \"SNL\" has taken to merely mimicking Trump and his antics through Baldwin, rather than cleverly satirizing him. Despite plenty of material to work with, thus far, the Trump-SNL era has been, well, boring and predictable. Until this weekend, that is. The difference between the usual Trump spoofs and McCarthy's take on Spicer is that hers was actually hilarious. A podium-wielding McCarthy plays on Spicer's rocky start at the White House -- his oratorical stumbles, his new, Trump-like scorn for critical press, his equally Trumpian fact-manipulation -- with a well-studied ear for his tics and tone. Exaggerating a White House spokesman might sound like inside-the-beltway kind of humor that average viewers won't appreciate or find funny. But in the theatrical, reality-television era of Trump, everyone around him is a character, too. Here is the completed news article:\n\n...and in the theatrical, reality-television era of Trump, everyone around him is a character, too. McCarthy's portrayal of Spicer was a masterclass in character acting, capturing the essence of the beleaguered press secretary's awkwardness and anxiety. Her performance was a refreshing departure from the usual Trump spoofs, which often rely on cheap jokes and caricatures.\n\nThe scene opens with McCarthy, dressed in a Spicer-esque suit and sporting a receding hairline, stumbling through a press briefing. She awkwardly fumbles with her notes, trips over her words, and displays a telltale nervous twitch that has become a hallmark of Spicer's public appearances.\n\nBut what truly made the sketch stand out was its clever use of Spicer's infamous gaffes and controversies. McCarthy's Spicer launches into a series of bizarre and factually-challenged statements, including a claim that the White House is \"winning so bigly\" in the ratings. The sketch also pokes fun at Spicer's infamous \"alternative facts\" comment, with McCarthy's Spicer insisting that \"reality is what we say it is.\"\n\nThe audience was in stitches throughout the sketch, and even Baldwin's Trump couldn't help but crack a smile. It was a welcome respite from the usual SNL fare, and a testament to McCarthy's impressive comedic chops. Let's hope this is a sign of things to come from the usually stale Trump-SNL era.",

        "Text": "All of this is not good for the Trump brand, which only two years ago was synonymous for many with success, luxury, wealth, and elegance -- so much so that his children had successfully leveraged it to foster ventures in the wine and fashion industries. Wearing a Trump branded suit made a statement. The brand didn't appeal to everyone, but it had a generally positive association. but that was before the presidency. Over the past two years, the Trump brand has been tarnished by controversy, scandal, and divisive rhetoric. The once-luxurious brand is now often associated with politics, polarizing views, and drama.\n\nDonald Trump Jr.'s wine company, for example, has seen a significant decline in sales, with some retailers refusing to carry his products due to the family's political affiliations. The Trump Organization's efforts to expand into the fashion industry have also been met with resistance, with many designers and retailers choosing not to collaborate with the brand.\n\nThe Trump brand's image has also been damaged by the numerous lawsuits and controversies surrounding the Trump Organization, including allegations of fraud and embezzlement. The company's attempts to rebrand itself as a \"luxury lifestyle\" brand have fallen flat, with many consumers viewing the brand as tarnished and untrustworthy.\n\nIn addition, the Trump family's frequent use of social media to spread divisive and often false information has further eroded the brand's reputation. The constant stream of tweets and statements from the President and his family has created a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability, making it difficult for the brand to maintain a consistent message and image.\n\nAs a result, the Trump brand is struggling to maintain its previous level of success and prestige. The once-iconic \"Trump\" name is now often met with skepticism and even disdain, and the brand's value has taken a significant hit. While the Trump family still maintains a loyal following, the brand's overall reputation and value have suffered greatly in the wake of the President's presidency.",

He suggested that Americans -- at least those who don't get classified briefings -- don't understand the terror threat against the United States. \"Terrorism is a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand,\" Trump told a gathering of sheriffs in a Washington hotel. Seemingly hinting at information gleaned from his classified briefings, the President added: \"Believe me. I've learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand.\" Ari Fleischer, who served as Bush's White House press secretary during 9/11, said all presidents use \"realistic, worse-case scenarios\" to push their agendas. He cautioned the tactic could be abused and result in undermining an administration. \"Like anything, you can go too far. You can exaggerate, you can get facts wrong, you can hype it to a degree where you lose credibility,\" he said. \"But it is been a time honored tradition in American politics to use a worst-case scenario to drive an agenda.\" Here is the completed news article:\n\nTrump's Claim of Knowing More About Terrorism Raises Concerns\n\nPresident Trump's assertion that he knows more about terrorism than most Americans has sparked concerns among experts and former government officials. During a gathering of sheriffs in Washington on Wednesday, Trump claimed that terrorism is a \"tremendous threat\" that many Americans do not fully understand.\n\n\"I've learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,\" Trump said, seemingly referencing information gleaned from his classified briefings.\n\nHowever, some experts have questioned the President's motives for making such a claim.

But it is a time-honored tradition in American politics to use a worst-case scenario to drive an agenda.\"\n\nFleischer's comments were echoed by other experts, who expressed concerns that Trump's claim was an attempt to manipulate public opinion in support of his travel ban. The ban, which targets seven predominantly Muslim countries, has been widely criticized as discriminatory and unconstitutional.\n\n\"The President's statement is an attempt to create a sense of urgency and fear around the travel ban,\" said Zahra Billoo, a civil rights attorney. \"But the truth is, the ban is not about national security, it's about xenophobia and Islamophobia.\"\n\nThe White House has not commented on the controversy surrounding Trump's statement. However, the President's assertion has sparked widespread debate and criticism on social media, with many experts and ordinary citizens questioning the validity of his claims.\n\nIn the meantime, experts are urging the public to remain vigilant and critical of the information presented by the administration. \"It's essential that we not let our emotions get the better of us and that we demand accurate and transparent information from our leaders,\" said Dr. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications expert. \"We must hold our leaders accountable for their words and actions.\"",

        "Text": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Wednesday that Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee, told him he found Trump's attack on a federal judge on Twitter \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" Within a half-hour, Gorsuch spokesman Ron Bonjean, who was tapped by the White House to head communications for Gorsuch, confirmed that the nominee, Gorsuch, used those words in his meeting with Blumenthal. Several other senators, including Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, later relayed similar accounts of Gorsuch forcefully criticizing Trump's public attacks on the judiciary branch. Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch calls Trump's tweets 'disheartening' And on Thursday, Blumenthal said on MSNBC Gorsuch specifically told him he \"should feel free to mention what I said about these attacks being disheartening and demoralizing.\" But none of that stopped Trump from firing off a shot against Blumenthal -- and at the same time raising questions about the coherence of the White House's messaging. Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch calls Trump's tweets 'disheartening' \"Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. The tweet sparked outrage and confusion among Democrats and some Republicans, who saw it as an attempt to discredit Blumenthal's account of his conversation with Gorsuch. Blumenthal, a Vietnam War veteran, had indeed been criticized in the past for his claims about serving in the war, but he had since clarified that he did not serve in combat.\n\nIn a statement, Blumenthal's office fired back at Trump, saying, \"Senator Blumenthal has consistently spoken the truth about his service, and he will not be bullied by Donald Trump's attacks.\"\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, struggled to clarify the president's intentions behind the tweet. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump was simply \"pushing back\" against Blumenthal's \"inaccurate\" account of the conversation, but many saw the tweet as an attempt to undermine Blumenthal's credibility.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the tweet further muddied the waters around Gorsuch's nomination, which had already been the subject of intense debate. Some Republicans began to distance themselves from Trump's comments, with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) saying that \"anybody who serves in the military deserves respect and dignity.\"\n\nThe incident also raised questions about the tone and tenor of the White House's communications strategy, which has been marked by frequent Twitter attacks and divisive rhetoric. As the debate over Gorsuch's nomination continued, many wondered whether the controversy would ultimately damage the nominee's chances of confirmation.",

Garcia de Rayos was taken into custody Wednesday and ordered to be deported during her yearly check-in with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. Immigration officials said she was detained \"based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review which became final in May 2013.\" [Original story, published 11:39 a.m.] Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two, said a prayer before her yearly check-in with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. But her meeting Wednesday with immigration officials ended differently than others over the last eight years: She was taken into custody and ordered to be deported. \"Lupita has been doing yearly check-ins with ICE and nothing happened,\" said Lucy Sandoval, an activist who has been working with Garcia de Rayos' family. Garcia de Rayos, a 36-year-old mother of two U.S.-born children, had been living in the United States since 1998, when she entered the country illegally. She had been in deportation proceedings since 2008, but had been allowed to remain in the country while her case was pending.\n\nHer deportation has sparked outrage among immigration advocates, who argue that she was a low-priority case and that her removal was a harsh and unnecessary decision.\n\n\"This is a tragedy, and it's a result of the broken immigration system that we have in this country,\" said Carlos Garcia, director of Puente Arizona, an advocacy organization that has been working with Garcia de Rayos' family. \"Lupita has been a model immigrant, working hard, paying taxes, and raising her children. She has been a pillar of her community, and now she's being torn away from her family.\"\n\nGarcia de Rayos' family and supporters are now calling on the U.S. government to reconsider her deportation and to grant her a stay of removal.\n\n\"We are heartbroken and devastated by the news,\" said Lucy Sandoval, an activist who has been working with Garcia de Rayos' family. \"Lupita is not a priority for deportation. She is a mother, a wife, and a community member who has been contributing to this country for over 18 years. We demand that the government reevaluate her case and allow her to stay with her family.\"\n\nGarcia de Rayos' husband, Apolinar Garcia, is a U.S. citizen, and their two children, 14-year-old Jakelin and 8-year-old Dulce, are also U.S. citizens. The family has been living in Phoenix, Arizona, for over a decade.\n\nThe deportation of Garcia de Rayos comes at a time when the U.S. government is facing intense scrutiny over its immigration policies. President Donald Trump has made deportation a key part of his immigration agenda, and his administration has stepped up efforts to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nHowever, many immigration advocates argue that the government's deportation efforts are targeting low-priority cases, such as those of individuals who have been living in the United States for years and have established families and communities.\n\nGarcia de Rayos' case is just one example of the devastating impact that deportation can have on families and communities. Her removal has sparked widespread outrage and calls for action, and her family and supporters are now fighting to keep her in the United States.",

Pottery shards, broken scroll storage jars and their lids -- even neolithic flint tools and arrowheads -- littered the cave's entrance. Farther in, there appeared to be a cave-in. After a bit of work with a small pickax, the team made a monumental find: an unbroken storage jar with a scroll. and it was perfectly preserved, with no signs of damage or decay.

They discovered that the scroll was written in Hebrew, and initial translations suggested that it was a previously unknown text from the Second Temple period.\n\nNews of the discovery quickly spread, sending shockwaves through the archaeological community. Experts from around the world began to flock to the site, eager to catch a glimpse of the remarkable find.\n\n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,\" said Dr. Rachel Elior, a renowned Dead Sea Scrolls expert from Hebrew University. \"To find an unbroken scroll in such a remote location is a miracle. It's a testament to the incredible preservation of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the importance of continued archaeological research in the region.\"\n\nAs the team continued to study the scroll, they began to uncover more secrets about the people who lived in the region during the time of the Second Temple. The discovery was hailed as a major breakthrough, and it was clear that the excavation of the 12th cave would be a major milestone in the history of Dead Sea Scrolls research.",

The boy, who has not yet been named, was born with polymelia -- a rare congenital birth defect that results in extra limbs or organs, which are usually deformed. \"These are problems that happen from time to time and (are) irrespective of socio-economic status,\" said Dr. Sanjay Rao, a senior consultant pediatric surgeon at Narayana Health City who performed the procedure. Rao told CNN the boy's parents gave him permission to discuss the case publicly. 'Parasitic twin' Polymelia is a genetic disorder, which can be caused by chromosomal abnormalities or environmental agents, according to a paper in the Journal of Clinical Imaging Science. The condition can occur when an embryo develops into conjoined twins, but then one twin stops growing but continues to develop extra limbs or organs, which remain attached to the other twin. This was the case for the boy in Bangalore, according to Rao, and it's referred to as \"parasitic twins,\" according to a press release from the hospital. The presence of an extra twin made the surgery, which took place last week, all the more complex, Rao told CNN. The surgical team at Narayana Health City spent over five hours in the operating room to remove the extra limbs and organs, which were attached to the boy's lower abdomen. The procedure was a first-of-its-kind in India, according to hospital officials.\n\n\"It was a challenging surgery, but we were determined to give the boy a normal life,\" Dr. Rao said. \"The extra limbs were not only causing physical discomfort but also affecting his mental well-being. We had to carefully detach the parasitic twin without causing any harm to the boy's vital organs.\"\n\nThe boy, who is currently recovering in the hospital, is expected to make a full recovery. His parents are overjoyed with the outcome of the surgery and are grateful to the medical team for their expertise and care.\n\n\"We are thrilled that our son is doing well,\" said the boy's mother, who wished to remain anonymous. \"We were devastated when we first learned about his condition, but the doctors at Narayana Health City gave us hope and reassurance throughout the entire process. We are grateful for their professionalism and compassion.\"\n\nThe hospital has released a video of the surgery, which has gone viral on social media, raising awareness about the rare condition and the complexities of treating it. The hospital's chief executive officer, Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty, said that the hospital is committed to providing affordable and quality healthcare to all patients, regardless of their socio-economic status.\n\n\"This case is a testament to the hospital's commitment to pushing the boundaries of medical excellence and providing hope to patients with rare and complex conditions,\" Dr. Shetty said. \"We are proud of our team's expertise and dedication to providing the best possible care to our patients.\"",

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is investing millions in combating mosquito-borne diseases in Latin America. \"In every one of those cases, we've made huge progress. but Gates is not resting on his laurels. In a surprising announcement, he revealed that his foundation is shifting its focus to address a new and increasingly pressing issue: climate change.\n\n\"We've made tremendous progress in reducing poverty and disease, but climate change is a game-changer,\" Gates said in an exclusive interview with CNN. \"It's not just about polar bears and melting ice caps. Climate change is already affecting people's lives, from more frequent natural disasters to droughts and heatwaves. We need to act now to mitigate its effects.\"\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is committing $1 billion over the next five years to support climate change research, development of clean energy technologies, and adaptation efforts in vulnerable communities. Gates believes that his foundation's expertise in global health and development can be leveraged to address the climate crisis.\n\n\"We've learned how to scale up solutions to reach millions of people. We've developed strong partnerships with governments, NGOs, and private sector companies. We can apply those same skills to tackle climate change,\" Gates said.\n\nThe foundation will also be investing in climate-resilient agriculture, sustainable water management, and disaster risk reduction. Gates emphasized that climate change is a global problem that requires a collective response.\n\n\"This is not just a rich country problem or a poor country problem. Climate change is a human problem that affects us all. We need to work together to find solutions,\" Gates said.\n\nGates' announcement has sparked widespread interest and applause from climate advocates and world leaders. His commitment to addressing climate change is seen as a significant boost to global efforts to combat the crisis.\n\n\"This is a major wake-up call for all of us,\" said Dr. Fatima Khan, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. \"Bill Gates' foundation has a reputation for delivering results. If they're putting their weight behind climate change, we can be confident that they'll make a real difference.\"",

It's the steepest start gate in the world and can be found at the glamorous St. Moritz resort. It's not one for the fainthearted, and it's just the beginning of the men's downhill course for this month's Alpine World Ski Championships. which kicks off on February 7th and will attract the world's top skiers to the picturesque Swiss resort town. The steep incline, known as the \" Corviglia Piste\", is a daunting challenge even for the most experienced athletes, requiring lightning-fast reflexes and unshakeable nerves.\n\n\"It's a real test of courage and skill,\" said Swiss skier, Marco Odermatt, who has won numerous World Cup titles. \"You have to be fully focused and prepared to push yourself to the limit from the very start. One wrong move and you're out of the competition.\"\n\nThe course, which features 15 gates and 2,400 meters of vertical descent, is expected to be particularly treacherous due to the recent heavy snowfall in the region, which has left the slopes icy and unpredictable.\n\nOrganizers are taking no chances, with safety measures in place to ensure the well-being of both competitors and spectators. \"We're doing everything we can to minimize risks and provide a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone involved,\" said St. Moritz Mayor, Urs Schneider.\n\nThe Alpine World Ski Championships will feature a total of 11 events, including downhill, slalom, and combined, with top skiers from over 50 countries set to take part. The event is expected to draw a large crowd to the resort, with many fans planning to watch the action unfold from the slopes.\n\nAs the world's best skiers prepare to tackle the infamous Corviglia Piste, one thing is certain - only the bravest and most skilled will emerge victorious. Will it be a Swiss skier who takes the top spot, or will an international challenger steal the show? The world will be watching as the action unfolds in St. Moritz.",

Whether high on a hilltop or built into a bunker, beautiful wine storage solutions can now be found in some surprising places. \"Today, putting a wine cellar in your 33rd-floor apartment is just as easy as in an underground cellar,\" says James Molesworth, senior editor of Wine Spectator. \"In the past, wine storage required a specific set of conditions, including a constant temperature between 45°F and 65°F, and humidity levels between 50% and 80%. However, advancements in insulation, cooling systems, and climate control have made it possible to replicate these conditions almost anywhere.\n\nTake, for example, the wine cellar built into the side of a mountain in Napa Valley, California. The cellar, designed by architect Howard Backen, features a natural stone exterior and a stunning glass wall that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding vineyards. The interior is climate-controlled, with a temperature of 55°F and humidity levels of 60%.\n\nIn contrast, a wine cellar built in a 33rd-floor apartment in New York City may not have the same natural views, but it can still provide the perfect conditions for storing wine. The cellar, designed by interior designer Jennifer Post, features a sleek, modern design with a temperature of 58°F and humidity levels of 65%.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and wine enthusiasts are taking advantage of this new technology to create their dream wine storage solutions. Whether you're a wine connoisseur or just starting to build your collection, there's a wine cellar out there that can meet your needs.\n\nAs Molesworth notes, \"The days of having to choose between a wine cellar that's functional or one that's beautiful are over. With modern technology, you can have both.\" And with the right design and expertise, you can create a wine storage solution that's not only functional but also stunningly beautiful.\"",

        "Text": "Women with male characteristic brains are three times more likely to have autism than women with more \"female\" brains, the researchers say. Yet the reverse was not been proven true; no evidence indicates that men with more female-trait brains are less at risk for autism than men with typical brains. Autism is considered a neurodevelopmental condition, which means symptoms begin early and children fail to achieve typical milestones of maturity at appropriate ages. Common symptoms include difficulty with communication and repetitive behaviors. In the United States, about one in 68 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The term \"spectrum\" refers to the fact that symptoms, levels of disability and positive skills may vary from person to person. For example, some people along the spectrum cannot make eye contact or follow simple directions, while others may be exceptional at math. And, as they age, some children with autism will learn to function more or less normally, while others will require substantial support to perform basic activities. Autism spectrum disorder is two to five times more common in males than in females, according to Christine Ecker, lead author of the new study and a professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany. Though some researchers say sex differences in symptoms account for different rates of diagnosis, others hypothesize that sex-related variations in brain anatomy may contribute to the higher risk among males. Gender differences For the new study, Ecker and her co-authors examined whether brain anatomy differences led to a higher probability of autism in males. Here is the completed news article:\n\nThe researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to analyze the brain structure of 84 women and 84 men with autism, as well as 84 women and 84 men without the condition. They found that women with autism who had more \"male-like\" brain structures, particularly in regions involved in social cognition and language, were more likely to have the condition.\n\nIn contrast, men with autism did not show a similar association between brain structure and autism risk. The study suggests that women with autism may be more likely to have a combination of \"male\" and \"female\" brain traits, which could contribute to their increased risk of developing the condition.\n\nThe findings could have implications for understanding and diagnosing autism in women, who are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. \"The results highlight the importance of considering the potential impact of sex and gender on the brain structure and function in autism,\" said Ecker.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the results do not necessarily mean that men with \"female-like\" brain structures are immune to autism. More research is needed to determine whether there is a similar association between brain structure and autism risk in men.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry and was funded by the German Research Foundation and the European Union's Horizon 2020 program. The research team plans to continue studying the relationship between brain structure and autism risk in both men and women.",

It will kick off a series of high-profile sporting events in Asia over the next four years, with Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the host city for the Winter Olympics in 2022. READ: Ski like a South Korean To avoid any potential confusion with North Korea's capital Pyongyang, the PyeongChang resort -- which is 50 miles south of the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries -- has changed its name for the Games, capitalizing the C for the first time. A record 102 gold medals will be up for grabs in 15 disciplines at PyeongChang 2018, while four events will be making their Winter Olympic debuts, with the introduction of Big Air snowboarding -- athletes performing tricks after launching from large jumps -- giving the Games a youthful vibe. A $78 million, 50,000-capacity temporary Olympic Stadium, which will host the opening and closing ceremonies, is set to be completed in September. The PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics will also feature a number of innovative technologies and sustainable initiatives, aiming to reduce the environmental impact of the Games. The Olympic Stadium, for example, will be equipped with a state-of-the-art cooling system that uses a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation to minimize energy consumption.\n\nThe PyeongChang Organizing Committee has also implemented a number of initiatives to reduce waste and promote recycling. All venues and facilities will be equipped with recycling bins, and the committee has set a goal of recycling at least 70% of all waste generated during the Games.\n\nIn addition, the committee has partnered with several environmental organizations to promote sustainable transportation options. A fleet of electric and hybrid buses will be used to transport athletes, officials, and spectators around the city, and a number of bike-sharing stations will be set up throughout the venue area.\n\nThe PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics will also feature a number of cultural events and exhibitions, showcasing the best of Korean culture and hospitality. The opening ceremony will feature a traditional Korean drum performance, and a number of cultural festivals will be held throughout the city during the Games.\n\nThe PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics are expected to be a major boost to the local economy, with estimates suggesting that the Games will generate over $10 billion in economic benefits for the region. The Games will also provide a platform for international diplomacy, with the PyeongChang Organizing Committee working closely with the International Olympic Committee and the governments of South Korea and North Korea to ensure a successful and peaceful event.\n\nOverall, the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics are shaping up to be a truly unique and memorable event, combining world-class athletic competition with innovative technology, sustainable practices, and a celebration of Korean culture and hospitality.",

The pressure to settle down and start popping out offspring can be such that many young Chinese people rent actors -- for upwards of $200 a night -- to pretend to be their romantic partner through the Spring Festival holiday period, which ends Saturday, and help them stave off awkward questions. \"Young people are delaying marriage, but their parents still use the old standard to ask them to get married and have children 'on time',\" said Yue Qian, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia. According to a report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the trend of renting actors to play the role of a romantic partner is becoming increasingly popular among young Chinese adults, particularly in urban areas. The practice is often referred to as \"fake boyfriend\" or \"rent-a-beau\" and is seen as a way to avoid the pressure and scrutiny that comes with being single during the Spring Festival holiday.\n\nThe report suggests that the phenomenon is driven by a combination of factors, including the increasing independence and financial stability of young Chinese adults, as well as the changing values and expectations of Chinese society. Many young people are delaying marriage and starting a family, and instead choosing to focus on their careers and personal interests.\n\nHowever, this shift away from traditional family values and expectations is often met with resistance from older generations, who place a high value on marriage and family. As a result, young people are feeling pressure to conform to societal norms and are seeking ways to alleviate the stress and anxiety that comes with being single.\n\nThe report also highlights the economic benefits of the fake boyfriend industry, with some entrepreneurs reportedly earning significant profits by offering their services as a romantic partner. The industry is expected to continue growing in the coming years, as more young Chinese adults seek to avoid the pressure and scrutiny that comes with being single during the Spring Festival holiday.\n\nIn related news, the Chinese government has announced plans to introduce new policies aimed at addressing the country's low birth rate and aging population. The policies, which are set to be implemented in the coming months, include measures to increase financial support for young families and to encourage employers to offer more flexible working arrangements to help employees balance work and family responsibilities.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these policies will be effective in addressing the underlying issues driving the trend of renting actors to play the role of a romantic partner. However, one thing is clear: the pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations is likely to continue to be a major challenge for young Chinese adults in the coming years.",

        "Text": "For investigators attempting to track down sex traffickers and their victims, these online advertisements can contain critical clues. The smallest of details in a room could give away its location, but there are too many ads for law enforcement to scan each of them for clues. That's where TraffickCam comes in. It's a simple phone app that uses crowdsourced snapshots of hotel rooms to help law enforcement locate victims and prosecute sex traffickers. Any travelers pit stopping at a hotel can turn on their phone's GPS location and upload photos of the room from four different angles to TraffickCam's database. The idea is that law enforcement agencies can then check adverts featuring suspected trafficking victims in hotel rooms against TraffickCam's database of photos. Stand up to modern slavery on March 14 -- #MyFreedomDay TraffickCam's image analysis tools transform the photos into a number of data points, using features such as patterns on the carpet, paintings on the wall and landmarks out of the window. The various data points in the photos play an important role in matching the location. TraffickCam is the brainchild of Exchange Initiative and a team of researchers at Washington University. Since its launch, TraffickCam has gained significant traction, with thousands of users downloading the app and uploading photos of hotel rooms. The app's database now contains over 1 million images, making it a valuable resource for law enforcement agencies worldwide.\n\nThe app's impact has been significant, with several successful prosecutions already linked to TraffickCam's database. In one notable case, a sex trafficking victim was rescued after law enforcement used TraffickCam to match a suspect's hotel room advertisement to a photo uploaded by a traveler.\n\nThe app's creators are working closely with law enforcement agencies to ensure that TraffickCam is integrated into their operations. \"TraffickCam is a game-changer in the fight against sex trafficking,\" said Detective James Smith of the St. Louis Police Department. \"It's an invaluable tool that has already helped us to identify and rescue victims.\"\n\nThe app's success has also sparked interest from governments and organizations around the world. The US Department of State has recognized TraffickCam as a best practice in the fight against human trafficking, and the app has been adopted by several international organizations, including the International Justice Mission.\n\nDespite its success, TraffickCam's creators are aware of the challenges that lie ahead. \"We know that there is still much work to be done to combat sex trafficking,\" said Sarah Williams, executive director of the Exchange Initiative. \"But we are committed to using technology to make a difference, and we believe that TraffickCam can be a powerful tool in this fight.\"\n\nAs the fight against sex trafficking continues, TraffickCam remains a crucial tool in the effort to identify and rescue victims. By empowering travelers to take action and provide critical information to law enforcement, the app is helping to bring hope to those affected by this devastating crime.",

I recently listened to a panel of female CFOs warn an audience of thousands of women about these daily hits a woman can face as she climbs the ladder. One executive in her late 50s, the CFO of a $400 million company, recounted the time she was asked to take notes during a meeting with her male colleagues. It happened last year. (\"I laughed and said no,\" she said.) If you think this type of behavior is a fast receding relic of an earlier time when older white men ruled the country, you'd be wrong. It's actually a sign of the times: Listen to Sen. Lindsey Graham crow that silencing Warren was \"long overdue.\" and a sign of the persistence of gender bias in the workplace. Despite the progress made in recent years, women continue to face discrimination and marginalization in the corporate world. The panel of female CFOs warned that these daily hits can have a profound impact on a woman's career, making it harder for her to advance and be taken seriously.\n\nOne of the CFOs, who wished to remain anonymous, shared her own experience of being interrupted by a male colleague during a meeting. \"I was in the middle of presenting a proposal when he cut me off and started speaking over me,\" she said. \"I felt belittled and undervalued.

The US has also been pressing China to do more to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions, with President Donald Trump calling on Beijing to \"end the North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs once and for all.\"\n\nDespite the concerns, North Korea has shown no signs of backing down, with state media calling the latest test a \"perfect success\" and claiming that it had successfully demonstrated the country's ability to strike at targets in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe test has also been met with condemnation from Japan, which has been increasingly concerned about North Korea's missile program. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the test \"unacceptable\" and urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile development program.\n\nThe international community is now waiting to see how North Korea will respond to the latest round of sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council, which are aimed at curbing the country's nuclear program. Meanwhile, the US and South Korea are set to conduct joint military exercises later this month, which could further escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\"",

        "Text": "In his previous US visits, Trudeau found a leader almost exactly aligned with his liberal worldview and youthful image. In return, then-President Barack Obama met with Trudeau often, counseling his younger ally on how to best advocate for the progressive agenda he championed. Now, Trudeau is arriving to a very different White House. He will balance the need to maintain close ties with a mandate from anxious Canadians to press Trump on his more controversial views. The meeting is Trump's third official visit from a head of government at the White House. In his first three weeks in office, he's also welcomed the British and Japanese prime ministers, and will host Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday. As Trudeau stepped off Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, he was met with a stark contrast to the warm welcome he received from Obama just a year ago. The atmosphere was tense, with protesters lining the streets and chanting anti-Trump slogans. Despite the chilly reception, Trudeau remained optimistic, saying he was looking forward to a \"productive\" meeting with the new president.\n\nTrudeau's aides have been preparing him for a tough discussion with Trump, who has taken a number of positions on issues such as trade, climate change, and immigration that are at odds with Canada's values. Trudeau has been vocal about his concerns over Trump's proposed border wall and his plans to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.\n\nIn a pre-meeting statement, Trudeau emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong relationship with the United States, but also made it clear that he would not shy away from raising his concerns about Trump's policies. \"As a neighbor and a friend, we have a responsibility to speak up when we disagree,\" he said.\n\nThe meeting with Trump is expected to focus on a range of issues, including trade, energy, and national security. Trudeau will also be pushing for a renewed commitment to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Paris climate accord.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Trudeau remains confident that he can find common ground with Trump. \"We may have our differences, but we share a commitment to democracy, freedom, and the rule of law,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to a constructive conversation.\"\n\nThe meeting with Trump is a crucial test of Trudeau's diplomatic skills, and will be closely watched by Canadians and Americans alike. As he heads into the White House, Trudeau knows that he must balance his desire to maintain a strong relationship with the United States with the need to represent the interests of his anxious and divided country.",

The Queen Bey was visibly moved by Adele's heartfelt tribute, and the audience erupted into applause. The two music icons had long been admired for their respective talents, but this moment marked a rare display of public admiration and respect between two of the most successful female artists in the industry.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Adele acknowledged the impact Beyoncé's album \"Lemonade\" had on her own life and career. \"I was so inspired by that album,\" she said. \"It made me want to push myself creatively and be more bold in my own music.\"\n\nBeyoncé, who was seated in the front row with her husband Jay-Z and their daughter Blue Ivy, was beaming with pride. She later took to the stage to accept her own award, for best music video, and thanked Adele for her kind words.\n\nThe exchange between the two superstars was seen as a powerful moment of female solidarity in the music industry, where women often face challenges and biases. Fans and fellow artists alike took to social media to praise the moment, with many using the hashtag #AdeleLovesBeyonce to express their admiration.\n\nThe two artists have a long history of mutual respect and admiration, with Adele previously citing Beyoncé as one of her biggest influences. The feeling is clearly mutual, as Beyoncé has often spoken about the impact Adele's music has had on her own life and career.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Adele and Beyoncé shared a warm hug backstage, a moment that will likely be remembered for years to come as a testament to the power of female friendship and admiration in the music industry.",

        "Text": "The city has seen many of its irreplaceable antiquities, monuments and historic sites destroyed since the terror group first occupied it in May 2015. Russia's Defense Ministry released a statement Monday saying they have detected \"an upsurge in truck movement\" near the ancient site that indicates that ISIS is planning to cause even more damage to the ancient complex. \"We have detected an upsurge in truck movement near the ancient city amid Syrian troops' successful advance on Palmyra,\" the statement reads. \"This indicates that Daesh (ISIS) wants to bring in explosives to deal maximum damage to the remaining architectural relics before they leave.\" The statement from the Russian Defense Ministry has sent shockwaves through the international community, with many experts and historians expressing outrage and concern over the potential destruction of the ancient city. Palmyra, also known as the \"Bride of the Desert,\" is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, dating back to the 1st century BC.\n\nThe city has already suffered significant damage at the hands of ISIS, with many of its iconic landmarks and monuments destroyed or severely damaged. In 2016, the terrorist group blew up the famous Temple of Bel, a 2,000-year-old temple dedicated to the ancient Mesopotamian god Bel, as well as several other important structures.\n\nThe latest reports suggest that ISIS is planning to bring in explosives to cause even more extensive damage to the remaining structures before they are forced to leave the city. The Russian Defense Ministry's statement warns that the terrorist group is likely to use the explosives to destroy as much of the city as possible, in an attempt to erase its cultural and historical significance.\n\nThe Syrian government, backed by Russian military support, has been making gains against ISIS in recent weeks, and the city of Palmyra is seen as a key prize in the fight against the terrorist group. The Russian military has been providing air support to Syrian government forces, and has been instrumental in the recapture of several key cities and towns from ISIS.\n\nAs news of the potential destruction of Palmyra spreads, historians and archaeologists are speaking out in alarm, warning that the loss of the city's cultural heritage would be irreparable. \"Palmyra is an irreplaceable piece of human history,\" said Dr. Sarah Parcak, a renowned archaeologist. \"The destruction of this city would be a tragedy not just for Syria, but for the world. We cannot let this happen.\"\n\nThe international community is urging the Syrian government and its allies to take all necessary measures to protect the city and its cultural heritage. The United Nations has issued a statement calling for the protection of Palmyra and all other cultural sites in Syria, and many governments and organizations are offering their support to the efforts to preserve the city's cultural heritage.\n\nAs the situation in Palmyra continues to unfold, the world holds its breath, hoping that the city's cultural treasures will be spared from destruction and that the terrorist group will be defeated once and for all.",

        "Text": "The dam, which is the nation's tallest, remains intact. But the emergency spillway, which helps to ensure that the water does not rush over the top of the dam when the levels are high, was eroding Sunday. The damage prompted a mandatory evacuation for cities and counties near Lake Oroville amid fears it could endanger communities living downstream. Those orders remain in effect and Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said he did not know when they would be lifted. \"I'm not going to lift the evacuation order until I have better idea of what that means and what risk that poses,\" he said in a press conference late Sunday night. California Governor Jerry Brown issued a state emergency order to help local authorities with the situation and evacuations. What led up to the Sunday emergency This winter, heavy rainfall in Northern California has filled Lake Oroville to the verge of overflow. The lake also gets water from the northern Sierra Nevada mountain range which is experiencing one of its wettest seasons. This has triggered concerns over whether the water could overflow the dam and flood nearby communities. The Oroville Dam provides flood control for the region and is located about 75 miles north of Sacramento. As the situation unfolded, officials scrambled to assess the damage and determine the best course of action to mitigate the risk of catastrophic flooding. A team of experts from the California Department of Water Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was dispatched to the scene to inspect the dam and emergency spillway.\n\n\"We're working around the clock to get a better understanding of the situation and to develop a plan to address the erosion,\" said Mark Ghilarducci, Director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services. \"We're doing everything we can to ensure public safety and to prevent any potential disasters.\"\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Butte, Yuba, and Sutter counties were left to navigate the uncertainty of their situation. Many were forced to leave their homes and businesses behind, unsure of when they would be able to return.\n\n\"I've lived in this community my whole life, and I've never seen anything like this,\" said Karen Sullivan, a resident of Oroville who was evacuated from her home. \"I'm just hoping that the dam holds and that we can get back to normal soon.\"\n\nAs the situation continued to unfold, officials warned that the risk of flooding was still present, and that residents should remain vigilant and prepared for any potential evacuation orders.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to prevent a disaster, but we also need the public's cooperation,\" said Sheriff Honea. \"We urge everyone to stay informed and to follow any instructions from local authorities.\"\n\nThe situation at Lake Oroville remained fluid, with officials working around the clock to address the crisis. As the days went by, residents held their breaths, hoping that the dam would hold and that their communities would be spared from the worst of the flooding.",

The department has been working closely with local authorities and experts to mitigate the impact of the whale deaths on the environment and the community.\n\nThe 49 pilot whales that died in the mass stranding on Wednesday were the latest in a series of strandings to affect New Zealand's coastline in recent weeks. The cause of the stranding is still unknown, but officials are investigating a number of factors, including a possible link to a naval sonar exercise that was conducted in the area earlier this week.\n\n\"We understand that the sight of these dead whales is distressing for many people, but we're doing everything we can to ensure that the area is safe and that the whales are treated with respect,\" Grant said.\n\nThe department has also set up a viewing area for the public to pay their respects to the whales, while keeping a safe distance from the carcasses. The area will be open for a limited time only, to allow people to pay their respects and learn more about the whales and the conservation efforts.\n\nThe incident has sparked a wider conversation about the impact of human activities on marine life and the importance of protecting New Zealand's unique and diverse marine ecosystem. Conservationists are calling for greater protections for whales and other marine animals, and for increased research into the causes of mass strandings.\n\nIn the meantime, the department is working to ensure that the whales are disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner, and that the area is restored to its natural state as quickly as possible.",

        "Text": "A White House statement described their conversation as \"extremely cordial.\" Most importantly for Xi, Trump affirmed US commitment to the \"One China\" policy. This phone call, together with a personal letter from Trump to Xi two days earlier, which expressed US interests in seeking \"constructive relations\" with China, removed many of the uncertainties generated by Trump's earlier comments that the \"One China\" principle was negotiable. Trump's challenge to the \"One China\" principle and his threat during the election to slam 45% import duty on Chinese goods had caused widespread concerns that the two countries were on a collision course. Domestic setbacks One plausible explanation of Trump's apparent return to the \"One China\" principle could be his rising setbacks on the domestic front. When Trump threatened to link the \"One China\" principle with Chinese concessions in a number of issue areas, he was rolling with a sense of invincibility after the election. Foreign leaders were falling over each other to court him. At home and abroad, Trump looked mighty. However, after assuming the office, Trump has encountered massive domestic frustrations. His multiple new policy initiatives have run into fierce criticism and opposition by the public, media, and other branches of the government. According to a poll by CNN/ORC, a majority, 53%, disapprove of the way Trump handles his job, marking the highest disapproval for a new elected president since polls began to track these results. The challenges Trump is facing domestically have likely made him more cautious and pragmatic in his foreign policy approach, particularly with regards to China. By reaffirming the \"One China\" policy, Trump is sending a signal to Beijing that he is committed to maintaining a stable and constructive relationship with China, despite his earlier rhetoric.\n\nThe White House statement describing the conversation as \"extremely cordial\" suggests that Trump and Xi may have also discussed other issues of mutual interest, such as trade and security cooperation. Trump's decision to send a personal letter to Xi before the phone call also indicates a desire to establish a personal rapport with the Chinese leader, which could help to ease tensions and facilitate communication between the two countries.\n\nDespite the apparent thaw in relations, however, many experts believe that the underlying issues that led to the tensions in the first place remain unresolved. The \"One China\" principle, which acknowledges Taiwan as part of China, is a sensitive issue that has been a source of contention between the two countries for decades.\n\nIn the past, the US has maintained a delicate balance between its relationships with China and Taiwan, but Trump's earlier comments had raised concerns that he might abandon this policy and recognize Taiwan as a separate country. While Trump's reaffirmation of the \"One China\" policy may have alleviated some of these concerns, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to follow through on his commitments and avoid taking actions that could further destabilize the region.\n\nIn the meantime, the phone call between Trump and Xi is seen as a significant step towards easing tensions and restoring stability to the US-China relationship. However, it is also a reminder that the relationship between the two countries is complex and multifaceted, and that many challenges remain to be addressed before a lasting and peaceful resolution can be achieved.",

        "Text": "Trump held court during a news conference that lasted an hour and fifteen minutes, carving out a stunning moment in modern American political history. He displayed a sense of anger and grievance rarely vented by a President in public -- let alone one who has been in office for just four weeks. \"I have never seen more dishonest media, frankly than the political media,\" Trump said, later slamming leaks to the press from the intelligence community -- some of which led to the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn. \"The leaks are real. The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake,\" Trump said. While it was a marked contrast with the normal dynamics of a presidential news conference, the East Room show was vintage Trump. He touted his own poll numbers, victory over Hillary Clinton and discussed cable TV ratings and panel discussions. \"I'm here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.\" That was the kind of message -- directed at large numbers of voters disgruntled with the performance of Washington's political establishment and delivered in a plainspoken, unvarnished manner -- that helped Trump win the presidency against all odds. But his manner is also likely to offend or alarm other voters and may do little to alleviate skepticism towards Trump among political elites in Washington. As Trump spoke, his words were met with a mix of applause and murmurs of discontent from the assembled journalists and officials. Some in the room seemed taken aback by the President's tone, while others appeared to be nodding in agreement.\n\nThe President's criticism of the media was particularly noteworthy, as it came just days after he had accused the press of being \"so dishonest\" during a meeting with Congressional leaders. Trump's supporters have long claimed that the media is biased against him, and the President's comments were likely intended to energize his base and solidify his image as a champion of the \"forgotten men and women\" of America.\n\nHowever, Trump's remarks also sparked concerns among some lawmakers and civil liberties groups, who worry that the President's attacks on the media could have a chilling effect on the press and undermine the fundamental principles of a free press.\n\nAs the news conference drew to a close, Trump was asked about his plans to reform the intelligence community and address the leaks that have plagued his administration. The President vowed to take a \"stronger\" approach to dealing with leaks, but did not provide any specific details on how he intended to do so.\n\nThe news conference was the latest in a series of unorthodox events to occur in the early days of the Trump presidency. Just last week, the President had hosted a meeting with a group of CEOs and business leaders at the White House, during which he made headlines by boasting about the size of his inauguration crowd and attacking the \"fake news\" media.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his presidency, Trump remains popular among many of his supporters, who see him as a champion of their values and a disruptor of the Washington establishment. However, the President's divisive rhetoric and unconventional behavior are likely to continue to spark concerns among many Americans, and will be closely watched by political observers in the days and weeks ahead.",

        "Text": "\"The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision,\" said Trump during a news conference, referring to a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked his travel ban earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Justice Department filed a 47-page brief Thursday telling the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that it does not need a larger panel of judges to rehear its failed emergency challenge to a lower court's temporary suspension of Trump's executive order on immigration at this time because a new order is on the way. The Justice Department wrote at length about the \"seriously flawed\" Ninth Circuit ruling from last week, but neverthless said: \"(r)ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.\" The Justice Department's brief also attacked the Ninth Circuit's decision, calling it \"a gross distortion of the record\" and saying it was \"based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of the Constitution.\" The department argued that the court's decision was an overreach of its authority and that it had ignored the president's constitutional authority to control the nation's borders.\n\nThe brief did not provide any details about the new executive order, but it did say that it would be designed to address the concerns raised by the Ninth Circuit and to ensure that the president's authority to control the nation's borders is upheld.\n\nThe Justice Department's move is seen as a major shift in strategy by the Trump administration, which had previously vowed to fight the Ninth Circuit's decision all the way to the Supreme Court. The decision to rescind the original order and replace it with a new one is seen as a concession that the administration's legal arguments were flawed and that it was unlikely to win the case.\n\nThe move is also seen as a way for the Trump administration to avoid further embarrassing defeats in court. The Ninth Circuit's decision was seen as a major blow to the administration's efforts to restrict immigration and to implement its travel ban.\n\nThe new executive order is expected to be released in the coming weeks, and it is likely to face further legal challenges. The Trump administration is likely to face opposition from civil liberties groups and others who are concerned about the impact of the order on immigrant communities.\n\nIn the meantime, the Justice Department's brief is seen as a significant development in the ongoing legal battle over the travel ban. It is likely to be closely watched by legal scholars and activists, who are eager to see how the Trump administration's new strategy plays out.",

Asked if there was a candidate for national security adviser in sight, a White House official told CNN, \"Not that I'm aware of.\" The uncertainty surrounding the national security adviser position has raised concerns about the stability of the Trump administration's foreign policy team. The White House has been plagued by a series of high-profile departures and shake-ups in recent weeks, including the resignation of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the departure of several top aides.\n\nMeanwhile, Kellogg, who has been serving as acting national security adviser since Flynn's departure, is not a permanent replacement and is expected to return to his role as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank once a permanent nominee is confirmed.\n\nThe lack of a clear candidate for the position has also raised questions about the administration's ability to effectively address pressing national security issues, such as North Korea's nuclear program and the ongoing conflict in Syria.\n\n\"Having a strong national security adviser is crucial for ensuring the country's safety and security,\" said Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona. \"I hope the White House will move quickly to fill this position and provide stability to the administration's foreign policy team.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has been under fire for its handling of national security issues, including the President's controversial comments on NATO and his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. The lack of a permanent national security adviser has only added to the uncertainty and instability surrounding the administration's foreign policy efforts.",

        "Text": "Though he is seeking to reassure key allies such as Germany of US resolve on Russia and other issues that have rattled Western leaders, he himself faces questions about how much he's been looped in on President Donald Trump's thinking on the Kremlin. On Monday, Trump ousted his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, for misleading Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Pence, who had previously gone on television and repeated Flynn's prevarications, only discovered he was misinformed last Friday -- a full two weeks after Trump himself learned the Justice Department was looking into the matter. Even as Pence seeks answers about why he was hoodwinked, Trump himself has expressed little concern about the compromised position of his vice president. Instead, he's cast Flynn -- whom he asked to resign -- as unfairly brought down by illegal leakers of classified intelligence. \"The first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it?\" Trump said at a news conference Thursday. \"You know why? \"...because it's because of leakers, folks, big league leakers. And I'll tell you what, it's a terrible thing. But I'm going to find out who these leakers are, and I'm going to fire them, believe me. Because no one has the right to betray the trust of the American people like that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has been scrambling to contain the fallout from Flynn's resignation, with officials attempting to downplay the significance of the episode. Press Secretary Sean Spicer insisted that Trump was not aware of Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador until last week, and that Pence was also kept in the dark until then.\n\nHowever, sources close to the White House have told reporters that Trump was indeed briefed on the matter weeks ago, and that he had even discussed it with Flynn on several occasions. The White House has refused to comment on the matter, fuelling speculation that the administration is trying to cover up the truth.\n\nThe controversy has raised fresh questions about the level of trust and transparency within the Trump administration, and whether the President is truly committed to transparency and accountability. Many lawmakers and political analysts are calling for an independent investigation into the matter, citing concerns about national security and the integrity of the government.\n\nIn the meantime, Pence has been working to repair his reputation and regain the trust of the American people. In a statement released on Friday, he acknowledged that he had been misled by Flynn, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong and was committed to serving the country to the best of his ability.\n\nDespite the controversy, Trump remains defiant, insisting that he is the victim of a \"witch hunt\" and that his administration is being unfairly targeted by the media and the political establishment. As the drama continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the Trump administration is facing a crisis of trust and credibility, and it will take more than just words to restore faith in the government.",

        "Text": "The appointment is expected to be announced as early as Friday, the officials say. The expected appointment is rankling some inside the White House, with longtime Trump loyalists inside and outside the West Wing saying they would have preferred a veteran from the campaign. \"Dubke and his Crossroads friends did everything they could to kill the Trump movement and failed,\" one loyalist said. The surprise appointment is a departure from the usual protocol of choosing a seasoned political operative or campaign veteran to fill the role. Instead, the Trump administration is expected to tap Michael Dubke, a former journalist and communications strategist who has worked with various Republican groups, including the Crossroads GPS super PAC.\n\nAccording to sources, Dubke's lack of direct ties to the Trump campaign has raised concerns among some White House officials, who feel that he may not fully understand the president's inner circle or be able to effectively communicate the administration's message.\n\n\"Michael Dubke is a smart guy, but he's not a Trump guy,\" said one senior administration official. \"He's been involved in Republican politics for years, but he's never been part of the Trump machine. It's hard to see how he's going to be able to connect with the president or the rest of the team.\"\n\nThe appointment has also sparked criticism from some conservative pundits, who argue that Dubke's past work with Crossroads GPS, a group founded by Karl Rove, disqualifies him from serving in the Trump administration.\n\n\"Crossroads was a key player in the failed Romney campaign, and Dubke was right in the middle of it,\" said one prominent conservative commentator. \"It's hard to see how someone who was so deeply involved in the defeat of a Republican presidential candidate can now be trusted to communicate the message of the Trump administration.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, officials close to the White House say that Dubke has impressed Trump and his inner circle with his strategic thinking and ability to craft effective messaging.\n\n\"Dubke has a real talent for getting inside the head of the opposition and understanding how they think,\" said one White House official. \"He's been doing some great work behind the scenes, and we think he'll be a great addition to the team.\"\n\nThe appointment is expected to be officially announced on Friday, pending a final review of Dubke's background and qualifications. While some Trump loyalists may be disappointed by the choice, officials say that Dubke has the respect and admiration of the president, and is well-equipped to take on the challenges of the job.",

Tillerson's remarks, made in a brief on-camera statement after the meeting, may go some way to reassure US allies. \"As I made clear in my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people,\" Tillerson said. \"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. As we search for new common ground, we expect Russia to honor its commitment to the Minsk Agreements and work to deescalate the violence in the Ukraine.\" Here is the completed news article:\n\nThe meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Bonn, Germany, comes at a time of strained US-Russian relations and turmoil in Washington as the new Trump administration finds its feet.\n\nTillerson's remarks, made in a brief on-camera statement after the meeting, may go some way to reassure US allies. \"As I made clear in my Senate confirmation hearing, the United States will consider working with Russia when we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people,\" Tillerson said. \"Where we do not see eye to eye, the United States will stand up for the interests and values of America and her allies. As we search for new common ground, we expect Russia to honor its commitment to the Minsk Agreements and work to deescalate the violence in the Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Minsk Agreements, a peace deal brokered by France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine in 2015, aim to bring an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists. However, implementation of the agreements has been slow, and fighting has continued.\n\nTillerson's statement was seen as a sign of a possible thaw in relations between the two nations, which have been strained since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The US has imposed sanctions on Russia in response, and relations have remained tense.\n\nHowever, some analysts warned that the meeting was unlikely to mark a significant turning point in the relationship, and that the US would need to see concrete actions from Russia before it would consider easing sanctions.\n\n\"This is just a meeting, and we need to see what kind of substance comes out of it,\" said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution. \"Russia has a long history of making promises it doesn't keep, and we need to see some real action on the ground before we can start talking about lifting sanctions.\"\n\nThe meeting with Lavrov was Tillerson's first face-to-face encounter with a top Russian official since taking office, and comes as the Trump administration is seeking to re-evaluate its relationship with Russia. The administration has been criticized for its slow response to Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election, and for its willingness to work with Russia on issues such as counter-terrorism.\n\nIn his statement, Tillerson did not address the issue of Russian interference in the election, but said that the US was committed to working with Russia on areas of mutual interest, such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation.\n\nThe meeting with Lavrov was seen as a key test of the Trump administration's willingness to engage with Russia, and could have significant implications for the US's relationship with its allies in Europe and around the world.",

Kim Jong Nam died after being attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Monday. South Korean officials claim he was poisoned. Three people have been arrested so far in relation to Kim's murder: an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and another woman carrying Vietnamese identification. Four days after the killing many questions remain unanswered. Here's what we know so far. What happened? Kim was on his way to catch a flight Monday morning to see his family in Macau, where he's lived since his departure from North Korea years ago. As Kim Jong Nam walked through Kuala Lumpur International Airport's departure gate, he was suddenly confronted by two women who sprayed a unknown substance into his face. The 45-year-old half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed on the floor, prompting a frantic response from airport staff and security.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the two women, later identified as Siti Aisyah, an Indonesian national, and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese national, were seen arguing with Kim before the attack. The motive behind the assassination remains unclear, but speculation has centered on North Korea's alleged attempts to silence Kim, who had been critical of his family's regime.\n\nThe Selangor Police Chief's insistence on requiring DNA from a next of kin to release the autopsy report has raised questions about the pace of the investigation. The delay has left many wondering if the authorities are dragging their feet to avoid revealing crucial evidence.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the Malaysian government has come under pressure to ensure that the case is handled impartially and transparently. The country's reputation as a neutral hub for international air travel and tourism is at stake, and any perception of political interference could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nIn the meantime, Kim's family in Macau is waiting anxiously for answers about his death. His wife, Lee Hye Kyung, has been seen at the airport, searching for any information about her husband's final moments. The South Korean government has also offered its condolences and assistance to the Malaysian authorities, urging them to bring those responsible to justice.\n\nThe case has sent shockwaves around the world, with many wondering what led to the brazen attack on the airport floor. As the investigation unfolds, one thing is clear: the world is watching, and the truth behind Kim Jong Nam's death must be revealed.",

More 200 people were injured in the attack, and many had been transferred to bigger hospitals in other cities of Sindh province, he said. Thousands of worshipers, including families with their children, had gathered at the more than 800-year-old shrine for the Sufi ritual of Dhamal, which involves music, chanting and prayer. As the sun set over the shrine, the sounds of chanting and music filled the air, a sense of tranquility and devotion spreading among the thousands of worshipers. But the peaceful atmosphere was shattered in an instant, as a suicide bomber detonated his explosives, sending a wave of destruction and chaos through the crowded courtyard.\n\n\"It was like a scene from hell,\" said Muhammad Ali, a worshiper who was injured in the blast. \"I was praying with my family, and then suddenly everything went black. I remember feeling a massive explosion, and then I was lying on the ground, surrounded by bodies and debris.\"\n\nThe attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group, was the deadliest in Pakistan in over a year, and has sent shockwaves of grief and outrage throughout the country. The Pakistani government has vowed to bring those responsible to justice, and has launched a manhunt for any remaining suspects.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the focus is on identifying the bomber and determining the motives behind the attack. The Sufi shrine, which is a revered site of pilgrimage for Muslims and non-Muslims alike, has been the target of previous attacks in the past. But this latest attack has raised concerns about the growing threat of extremist violence in the region.\n\n\"We condemn this heinous attack in the strongest possible terms,\" said Prime Minister Imran Khan in a statement. \"We will do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice, and to ensure that such attacks never happen again.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the blast, the people of Sehwan are struggling to come to terms with the devastating loss of life and the destruction of their beloved shrine. As the city begins the process of rebuilding and healing, one thing is clear: the attack on the shrine has only strengthened the resolve of the Pakistani people to stand together against terrorism and to protect their sacred sites.",

New Zealand calls a 1.8 million square mile land mass known as Zealandia home.\n\nIn a surprising discovery, geologists have revealed that Zealandia, a submerged continent that was previously thought to be a collection of underwater mountains and hills, is actually a fully formed continent. The finding has significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's geography and could have major consequences for the two countries' relationships.\n\nFor decades, New Zealand and Australia have been crowded together, with the two countries sharing a border and a complex history. But with the revelation that Zealandia is a separate continent, it seems that the two nations may finally have some space to breathe.\n\n\"We're thrilled to have finally confirmed that Zealandia is a continent in its own right,\" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading geologist on the project. \"This discovery has major implications for our understanding of the Earth's geography and could have significant consequences for the two countries' relationships.\"\n\nThe discovery of Zealandia has also raised questions about the continent's history and what it might have looked like before it was submerged. \"We believe that Zealandia was once above water, with its own unique ecosystem and wildlife,\" said Dr. Smith. \"It's a fascinating area of study and one that could reveal a lot about the Earth's history.\"\n\nFor now, the discovery of Zealandia has given New Zealand and Australia a new sense of perspective and a fresh perspective on their relationship. \"This is a great opportunity for us to re-evaluate our relationship and to think about how we can work together to build a stronger and more collaborative future,\" said a spokesperson for the New Zealand government.\n\nThe discovery of Zealandia has also sparked interest from other countries and organizations, with many experts already making plans to study the continent further. \"This is a major breakthrough and one that could have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's geography,\" said a spokesperson for the Australian government. \"We're excited to be a part of this new chapter in the history of Zealandia.\"",

While it is true that many of his supporters still see the person who \"tells it like it is\" and isn't afraid to punch back against his critics, this is not a way to conduct the presidency. The style that we saw on display at this news conference highlighted many parts of President Trump that are causing deep concern, certainly among Democrats, but also with some Republicans. When he continues to traffic in false statements about massive voter fraud, he demonstrates his willingness to circulate false information from the highest levels of power. The consequences of such behavior are far-reaching and damaging to the integrity of the office and the country. By refusing to acknowledge the will of the people and the results of the election, President Trump is undermining the very foundation of our democracy. His actions are not only hurting his own reputation, but also eroding trust in institutions and fostering a sense of disillusionment among the public.\n\nFurthermore, his refusal to accept facts and reality is not only a breach of presidential decorum, but also a disservice to the American people. As the leader of the free world, the President has a responsibility to uphold the truth and to provide accurate information to the public. Instead, President Trump is perpetuating a culture of misinformation and deceit, which is having a corrosive effect on our political discourse.\n\nThe President's actions are also causing concern among his own party, with some Republicans speaking out against his behavior. While they may still support his policies, they are increasingly uncomfortable with his style and the damage it is causing to the country. As one Republican strategist noted, \"The President's behavior is not only embarrassing, but it's also hurting our party's brand and causing us to lose credibility with voters.\"\n\nUltimately, the consequences of President Trump's behavior will be far-reaching and difficult to undo. As long as he continues to traffic in false information and refuse to accept the results of the election, he will continue to erode trust in the presidency and the country. It is up to Congress, the media, and the American people to hold him accountable and to demand a higher standard of behavior from their leaders.",

Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were in Mexico to try to smooth the relationship and address some of the differences that have emerged between the United States and its neighbor. Their visit to Mexico City follows months of charged rhetoric from President Donald Trump and US immigration measures announced this week that have dramatic implications for the country, including potentially sending significantly more migrants back over the southern border. \"We have expressed our concern about the increase of deportations,\" Osorio Chong said of meetings he and other Mexican officials had Thursday with Kelly and Tillerson. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, speaking ahead of Osorio Chong, was also quick to raise some of these tensions, telling reporters that there was a perception in Mexico that the Trump administration was pursuing \"policies that might be hurtful for Mexicans.\" Mexican officials expressed frustration and concern over the Trump administration's recent measures, including the announcement of a new border wall and the decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Osorio Chong emphasized that Mexico is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with the US, but that the recent measures have created tension and uncertainty.\n\n\"We understand that there are differences between our countries, but we do not agree with the measures that have been taken,\" Osorio Chong said. \"We have expressed our concerns and we hope that they will take into account the impact that these measures will have on Mexico and on the relationship between our countries.\"\n\nKelly and Tillerson met with Mexican officials, including Osorio Chong and Videgaray, to discuss the issues and try to find a way forward. The meeting was seen as an effort to ease tensions and prevent further deterioration in the relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe visit comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Mexico, with the Trump administration's rhetoric and policies on immigration and trade causing concern in Mexico. The Mexican government has been critical of the Trump administration's handling of the issue, and has expressed concerns about the impact of the new border wall and the end of DACA on Mexico's economy and society.\n\nDespite the tensions, Kelly and Tillerson emphasized the importance of the US-Mexico relationship and the need for cooperation on issues such as trade, security, and immigration. They also acknowledged the concerns of the Mexican government and pledged to work together to find solutions that benefit both countries.\n\nThe visit was seen as a critical moment in the relationship between the US and Mexico, and the outcome will be closely watched by both governments and the international community.",

A court has ordered her arrest, but she is not yet in police custody. Sen. Leila de Lima is accused of having abetted the illegal drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison when she was justice secretary from 2010 to 2015. A judge in the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court on Thursday afternoon found \"sufficient probable cause for the issuance of the Warrants of Arrest\" against de Lima and two others. A team from the Philippine National Police headed to the embattled lawmaker's residence south of Manila and then to the Senate, where de Lima sought refuge upon learning the warrant would be served Thursday evening. At the Senate, the sergeant-at-arms agreed to serve the warrant Friday morning, in line with an earlier televised request of the senator. \"The haste is deplorable,\" her fellow party members in the Senate said in a statement. Here is the completed news article:\n\nThe news of Sen. Leila de Lima's arrest warrant sent shockwaves through the Philippine Senate, with her colleagues and supporters denouncing the move as a political vendetta.\n\nDe Lima, a former justice secretary, has been accused of having abetted the illegal drug trade in the New Bilibid Prison when she was in office from 2010 to 2015. The charges against her are based on the testimony of several convicted drug lords who claimed that she accepted bribes and other forms of payment in exchange for her protection.\n\nThe senator has consistently denied the allegations, calling them a \" fabrication\" and a \"witch hunt\" orchestrated by the government of President Rodrigo Duterte. Her supporters have rallied around her, accusing the government of using the courts to silence her and punish her for her criticism of the administration's brutal war on drugs.\n\nThe Senate's sergeant-at-arms has agreed to serve the warrant on Friday morning, allowing de Lima to avoid arrest for the time being. However, it is unclear what her next move will be, as she has vowed to continue fighting the charges against her.\n\nThe development has also sparked concerns about the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary in the Philippines. Critics have accused the government of using the courts to harass and intimidate its political opponents, and of attempting to undermine the Senate's power and independence.\n\nThe Philippine National Police has defended the arrest warrant, saying that it was based on a thorough investigation and that de Lima has a case to answer. However, many have questioned the timing and motivation behind the move, which comes just days after de Lima criticized the government's handling of the war on drugs.\n\nThe standoff between de Lima and the government is likely to continue in the coming days, with many predicting a long and bitter battle ahead. For now, the senator remains free, but the tension is palpable, and the future is uncertain.",

Kim, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, died last Monday after a suspected poisoning while on his way to catch a flight to the Chinese territory of Macau from Kuala Lumpur. North Korea has furiously denied any involvement in Kim's death, publishing a strongly-worded article on Thursday in the country's state media, KCNA. It quoted a spokesman for the Korean Jurists Committee who said responsibility for Kim's death lay with Malaysia, as he had died on their territory, and criticized the investigation. \"If you look at Malaysian police's investigation from crime investigation perspective and legal perspective, everything is full of weak points and contradictions,\" it said. Embassy official, airline employee sought Interpol notices are issued to police in 190 different countries to help track fugitives and share information about wanted criminals. Malaysian police have previously said the four suspects who are the subject of the alert are believed to be back in Pyongyang. According to Inspector-General Khalid, the Interpol notice was issued to help track down the four suspects, who are believed to be hiding in Pyongyang, North Korea. The notice includes detailed descriptions of the suspects, including the North Korean embassy's second secretary, who is wanted for questioning.\n\n\"We are working closely with Interpol to ensure that these suspects are brought to justice,\" Inspector-General Khalid said. \"We have reason to believe that they are hiding in Pyongyang, and we are working with international authorities to track them down.\"\n\nThe Inspector-General also confirmed that Malaysian police had received a response from the North Korean embassy, but declined to disclose further details.\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation into Kim's death continues, with Malaysian police still analyzing evidence and interviewing witnesses. The autopsy report is expected to be released soon, but details of the findings have not been made public.\n\nThe case has sparked a diplomatic row between Malaysia and North Korea, with North Korea accusing Malaysia of conducting a biased investigation and interfering with its sovereignty. Malaysia has denied any wrongdoing and has called for North Korea to cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\nIn related news, the airline employee who was present at the airport when Kim was attacked has come forward to speak about the incident. The employee, who has not been named, told reporters that he saw a group of people surrounding Kim before he fell ill.\n\n\"I was just doing my job, checking the passengers' boarding passes,\" the employee said. \"I didn't think much of it at the time, but looking back, it's clear that something was very wrong.\"\n\nThe employee's testimony has raised more questions about the events surrounding Kim's death, and Malaysian police are expected to interview him further as part of their investigation.",

It is that: scandal.\" \"But what is scandal? Scandal is saying one thing and doing another.\" In the Catholic Church, causing scandal also a grave offense. Examples of such sins abound, the Pope said, from money launderers to business owners who take beach vacations while stiffing their employees. Francis' sermon, as is customary, was an extended riff on Thursday's Mass readings, which include a passage from the Gospel on Mark. In it, Jesus says it is better to be drowned than to cause others to sin. The Pope's words echoed through the chapel, striking a chord with the gathered faithful. He went on to emphasize that causing scandal was not just a matter of publicly flaunting one's sinful behavior, but also of hypocrisy. \"It's not just about doing something wrong, but about doing it with a facade of piety,\" he said. \"It's about pretending to be a good Christian while secretly living a life of selfishness and greed.\"\n\nFrancis also highlighted the importance of authentic witness, saying that Christians must strive to live out their faith in a way that is consistent with their words. \"We must be careful not to create the impression that our faith is just a label, a superficial identity that we wear on Sundays but forget about the rest of the week,\" he cautioned.\n\nThe Pope's remarks came as a wake-up call to many in the congregation, who were reminded of the need to examine their own consciences and ensure that their actions were in line with their professed beliefs. \"It's a challenge to us all to take a hard look at our own lives and ask ourselves, 'Am I causing scandal by my actions? Am I living out my faith in a way that honors God and inspires others?'\" said one parishioner, who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nAs the Mass came to a close, Francis prayed for the grace to avoid causing scandal and to be good witnesses to the faith. \"May we be people who live out our faith with authenticity and integrity, and may our actions be a source of inspiration and joy to those around us,\" he said.\n\nThe Pope's sermon sparked a lively discussion among the faithful, who left the chapel with a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment to living out their faith in a way that honors God. As one priest observed, \"The Pope's words are a reminder that our faith is not just about what we believe, but about how we live. May we strive to be faithful witnesses to the Gospel, and may our actions bring glory to God.\"",

        "Text": "\"I think one of the most pivotal moments in modern American history was his immediate withdrawal from TPP. It got us out of a trade deal and let our sovereignty come back to ourselves,\" he said, referring to the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. That decision, which he called just a first step in re-imagining US trade policies, was just one of three Bannon pointed to as the most important steps Trump has taken since becoming president just over a month ago. On the national security front, Bannon highlighted Trump's executive orders on building a border wall and beefed up immigration enforcement policies. And thirdly, he stressed the importance of Trump's moves to begin a \"deconstruction of the administrative state\" by appointing individuals from the private sector to key economic Cabinet positions who will help strip down federal regulations. Bannon joined White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus onstage at CPAC, which Bannon credited with helping launch Trump's political career. The two men discussed Trump's electoral victory, the administration's agenda and railed against the media together as they worked to dispel notions that they are rivals competing for power and influence within the West Wing. and emphasized that their differing backgrounds and personalities were a strength, not a weakness. \"We're not two guys who are going to be at each other's throats,\" Bannon said, describing Priebus as a \"great leader\" and a \"good man\". \"We're two guys who are going to work together to get the job done.\"\n\nThe duo's comments came as the Trump administration faces growing scrutiny over its first month in office. Critics have accused the administration of being slow to respond to the opioid crisis, and of lacking a clear plan for healthcare reform.\n\nBannon, who has been a key architect of Trump's nationalist agenda, defended the administration's approach, saying that it was focused on delivering on its campaign promises. \"We're not going to be held hostage by the Beltway establishment,\" he said, referring to the Washington, D.C. political elite. \"We're going to do what we said we were going to do, and we're going to do it quickly.\"\n\nPriebus, who has been criticized for his close ties to the Republican establishment, also defended the administration's approach, saying that it was focused on finding common ground with lawmakers from both parties. \"We're not going to be ideological purists,\" he said. \"We're going to work with anyone who wants to get things done.\"\n\nThe two men's comments were met with applause from the crowd of conservative activists gathered at CPAC, who have been enthusiastic supporters of Trump's candidacy. However, their comments may also have raised eyebrows among some Trump supporters who were hoping for more radical change from the administration.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bannon and Priebus both expressed confidence in Trump's ability to deliver on his campaign promises. \"He's a winner,\" Bannon said. \"He's a champion. And he's going to make America great again.\"",

        "Text": "But a White House official said late Thursday that the request was only made after the FBI indicated to the White House it did not believe the reporting to be accurate. White House officials had sought the help of the bureau and other agencies investigating the Russia matter to say that the reports were wrong and that there had been no contacts, the officials said. The reports of the contacts were first published by The New York Times and CNN on February 14. The direct communications between the White House and the FBI were unusual because of decade-old restrictions on such contacts. Such a request from the White House is a violation of procedures that limit communications with the FBI on pending investigations. Late Thursday night, White House press secretary Sean Spicer objected to CNN's characterization of the White House request to the FBI. \"We didn't try to knock the story down. We asked them to tell the truth,\" Spicer said. According to sources familiar with the matter, the White House official who made the request to the FBI was National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who is a close confidant of President Trump. The official said that McMaster was acting on behalf of the President, who was frustrated by the widespread media coverage of the alleged contacts between his associates and Russian officials.\n\nThe White House official's request to the FBI was met with resistance by the bureau's officials, who are said to have been skeptical of the White House's claims. The FBI officials reportedly told McMaster that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election was ongoing and that they could not comment on the accuracy of the reports.\n\nDespite the FBI's reluctance to get involved, the White House continued to push for a statement from the bureau, arguing that the reports were damaging to the President's reputation and undermining public trust in the administration. However, the FBI's refusal to comment only added to the controversy, with many interpreting the White House's request as an attempt to exert pressure on the investigation.\n\nThe incident has raised fresh questions about the relationship between the White House and the FBI, and whether the President's administration is trying to influence the outcome of the investigation. The FBI's investigation into Russian interference is ongoing, and the bureau has already charged several former Trump campaign officials with crimes related to the matter.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said that it would not comment on the White House's request, citing the ongoing nature of the investigation. The White House has also declined to comment further on the matter, other than to reiterate Spicer's statement that the administration was simply seeking to \"tell the truth\" about the reports.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a heated debate among lawmakers and legal experts, with some arguing that the White House's request was a clear violation of the bureau's independence and others saying that the FBI's refusal to comment was a necessary step to protect the integrity of the investigation. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen whether the White House's request will have any further impact on the outcome of the case.",

But she broke her silence over 24 hours later in a tweet and video message. Clad in a pink \"pussy bow\" blouse, Jenner spoke directly to the camera. \"I have a message for President Trump from well, one Republican to another. This is a disaster. And you can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community,\" she said, holding up her hand like a mock telephone. \"Call me.\" After Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee in June, Jenner told STAT she believed he would be better for women than Hillary Clinton. \"Everybody looks at the Democrats as being better with these [LGBT] issues. but now, she's having second thoughts. \"I was wrong,\" Jenner said, her voice laced with regret. \"I didn't realize the depth of his animosity towards the LGBTQ community. I thought he was just a showman, a businessman who would make deals and get things done. But his actions have shown me that he's willing to sacrifice our rights and dignity for his own political gain.\"\n\nJenner's words were met with widespread applause from the LGBTQ community, who had been vocal in their criticism of Trump's policies. Many took to social media to express their gratitude for her change of heart, with some even calling her a \"hero\" for speaking out against the administration.\n\nBut not everyone was pleased with Jenner's newfound stance. Some of her fans and supporters accused her of being hypocritical, pointing out that she had previously endorsed Trump and praised his business acumen. \"You can't just switch sides because it's convenient,\" one fan tweeted. \"You need to own up to your mistakes and apologize.\"\n\nJenner has since responded to the criticism, saying that she was \"ashamed\" of her previous endorsement and that she was \"trying to make amends\" by speaking out against Trump's policies. \"I know I made a mistake, but I'm trying to learn from it,\" she said in a statement. \"I hope that my voice can be a catalyst for change and that we can work together to create a more inclusive and accepting society for all.\"\n\nThe controversy has sparked a heated debate about the role of celebrities in politics and the impact of their endorsements on the LGBTQ community. While some argue that celebrities like Jenner have a platform and a responsibility to use it to speak out against injustice, others believe that they should stick to their area of expertise and leave politics to the politicians.\n\nRegardless of where one stands on the issue, it's clear that Caitlyn Jenner's words have had a significant impact on the conversation around LGBTQ rights and the Trump administration's policies. As the debate continues to rage on, one thing is certain: Caitlyn Jenner is no longer just a reality TV star - she's a force to be reckoned with in the world of politics.",

        "Text": "But the Florida Republican stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena those returns. Gaetz, a first-term congressman from the Sunshine State's panhandle, has stood by Trump, campaigning with him over the past weekend and closing his raucous one-hour town hall at the Oops Bowling Alley here Thursday night by saying he wanted to \"make America great again.\" But he surprised the audience when he said, \"Absolutely, Donald Trump should release his tax returns.\" Donna Waters, a 56-year-old lawyer from Pensacola, became emotional Thursday night as she pressed Gaetz for an answer. \"I'm the descendant of an immigrant, he came to America in 1607 to a town called Jamestown, and my family's been here ever since,\" Waters said, noting that her family members have fought in every major US war, including both sides of the Civil War. \"Whenever there's a threat to this country, my family has stepped forward,\" Waters said, tearing up. \"There are allegations that a hostile foreign country is committing acts of undeclared war by infiltrating the highest levels of our government.\" Waters continued: \"You are on the Judiciary Committee. You have said they are going to investigate the Russian allegations. \"So, Congressman Gaetz, what are you going to do about it?\" Waters asked, her voice shaking. The audience fell silent, awaiting Gaetz's response. After a moment of hesitation, he replied, \"I think it's important for the American people to have transparency in government. And I think that includes the President's tax returns.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause, with some shouting \"Thank you!\" and \"That's right!\" Gaetz's words were a departure from his earlier stance, which was more in line with Trump's reluctance to release his tax returns. However, Gaetz quickly backpedaled, saying that he didn't think Congress should subpoena the returns, but rather that Trump should voluntarily release them.\n\nThe unexpected turn of events left many in attendance feeling stunned and confused. \"I'm not sure what just happened,\" said Mark Thompson, a 32-year-old contractor from Fort Walton Beach. \"One minute he's saying he wants to make America great again, and the next he's saying Trump should release his tax returns. It's like he's trying to have it both ways.\"\n\nGaetz's office later released a statement attempting to clarify his position, saying that he believes in transparency in government, but also respects the President's right to privacy. However, many in attendance at the town hall remained skeptical, feeling that Gaetz was trying to have it both ways.\n\nThe incident has sparked a heated debate about the role of Congress in investigating the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and whether Trump's tax returns are relevant to the investigation. Gaetz's comments have also raised questions about the loyalty of Republican lawmakers to Trump, who has been a polarizing figure in American politics.\n\nIn the end, Gaetz's surprise statement may have done more to fuel the debate than to resolve it. As one attendee put it, \"It's like he's trying to have his cake and eat it too. We'll see if he follows through on his words or just goes back to business as usual.\"",

Without naming China, KCNA, North Korea's official state news agency, said Thursday a \"neighboring country\" had taken \"inhumane steps\" to block trade. On Friday, the Global Times, a provocative state-sanctioned tabloid, shot back. It said the ban had \"left Pyongyang reeling with pain and fury.\" The Global Times' editorial accused North Korea of being \"whiny\" and \"selfish\" for expecting China to continue importing its low-quality coal despite the US-led international sanctions. The article also questioned the North Korean government's ability to manage its economy, saying that the country's reliance on coal exports was a \"symbol of its outdated and inefficient industrial structure\".\n\nThe article went on to say that China's decision to ban coal imports from North Korea was a \"necessary step\" to comply with international sanctions and to protect its own economy from the negative impact of North Korea's nuclear program. The Global Times also criticized North Korea's leadership for its \"bizarre\" and \"illogical\" behavior, saying that it was \"hard to understand\" why the country was so upset about the coal ban.\n\nThe tensions between North Korea and China have been escalating in recent weeks, with North Korea's state media outlets repeatedly criticizing China for its failure to support the country's economy and its alleged betrayal of the North Korean people. China, on the other hand, has been trying to distance itself from North Korea and to emphasize its commitment to international sanctions and diplomacy.\n\nThe dispute over coal imports is just the latest in a series of tensions between the two countries, which have been allies for decades but have grown increasingly estranged in recent years. The US has been trying to isolate North Korea and to pressure China to take a harder line against the country, and the ban on coal imports is seen as a key part of that effort.\n\nDespite the tensions, analysts say that it is unlikely that the dispute will lead to a complete breakdown in relations between North Korea and China. However, the situation is likely to remain volatile and could have significant implications for the region and the global economy.",

        "Text": "It marks a dramatic turnaround from more than four decades of the country's one-child policy when there were harsh penalties for having more than one, including fines and forced abortions. Wang Peian, the vice-minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), said the commission is considering \"birth rewards and subsidies\" for second children, the state-owned China Daily reported on Tuesday. Wang made the announcement on Saturday during a meeting of the China Social Welfare Academy, a Chinese NGO that works closely with the government. A spokesperson for the organization declined commenting on Wang's speech to CNN. The announcement was in part prompted by a survey the NHFPC carried out in 2015, showing that 60% of families polled were reluctant to have a second child because of financial constraints, according to China Daily. One-child policy China overturned its one-child policy in October 2015, allowing couples across the country to have two children. Birth rates have risen since then, but the government is trying to meet higher birth rate targets as the population ages. The Chinese government is looking to introduce \"birth rewards and subsidies\" for families who have a second child, in a bid to boost the country's declining birth rate. The move is a significant shift from the previous one-child policy, which was enforced for over four decades and imposed harsh penalties on families who had more than one child.\n\nAccording to Wang Peian, the vice-minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), the commission is considering a range of incentives to encourage families to have a second child. These could include cash handouts, tax breaks, and other benefits.\n\nThe announcement was made during a meeting of the China Social Welfare Academy, a Chinese NGO that works closely with the government. The academy has been involved in promoting the country's family planning policies for many years.\n\nThe decision to introduce \"birth rewards and subsidies\" was prompted by a survey carried out by the NHFPC in 2015, which showed that 60% of families polled were reluctant to have a second child due to financial constraints. The survey also found that many families were struggling to make ends meet, and that the cost of raising a child was a major concern.\n\nChina's birth rate has been declining in recent years, with the country's population aging rapidly. The government has been trying to boost the birth rate to meet its higher targets, and the introduction of \"birth rewards and subsidies\" is seen as a key part of this strategy.\n\nThe one-child policy was introduced in the 1970s, and was enforced for over 35 years. During that time, couples who had more than one child were subject to fines, forced abortions, and other penalties. The policy was relaxed in 2015, allowing couples to have two children, but the birth rate has continued to decline.\n\nThe government has been trying to find ways to encourage families to have more children, and the introduction of \"birth rewards and subsidies\" is seen as a key part of this strategy. The move is also seen as a way to address the country's aging population, which is placing a strain on the country's healthcare and pension systems.\n\nThe introduction of \"birth rewards and subsidies\" is likely to be popular with many families, who have been struggling to make ends meet. The move is also seen as a way to promote economic growth, as families with more children are likely to spend more money on consumer goods and services.\n\nOverall, the introduction of \"birth rewards and subsidies\" is a significant shift from the previous one-child policy, and is likely to have a major impact on China's birth rate and population growth.",

Opponents and critics will note that, in its substance, Trump did little to back down from his most controversial plans. But his nods to the more conventional tropes of the genre created an unlikely juxtaposition. Let's compare then -- and now.\n\nPresident Trump's inaugural address was a fiery call to action, with many of the same themes and rhetoric that defined his campaign. He promised to \"cancel\" certain policies and \"make America great again.\" It was a speech that was met with both enthusiasm and alarm, depending on one's perspective.\n\nFast forward to his speech to Congress, and a different tone was palpable. Gone were the divisive attacks on his opponents, replaced by a more measured and traditional approach. Trump's words were peppered with nods to American history and the principles of democracy, echoing the speeches of his predecessors.\n\nIn his address, Trump referenced the Constitution, the Founding Fathers, and the \"hallowed halls\" of the Capitol. He praised the work of the men and women who serve in Congress, and acknowledged the challenges facing the country. It was a speech that was more focused on the problems facing the nation, rather than the individual who is supposed to solve them.\n\nOf course, Trump's opponents will still find plenty to criticize in his words. His plans for healthcare, taxes, and immigration are still controversial, and many of the same issues that defined his campaign remain unresolved. But in terms of tone and style, Trump's speech was a departure from the more confrontational approach he took in his inaugural address.\n\nIn the end, Trump's speech to Congress was a reminder that even the most unlikely of politicians can adapt and evolve. It remains to be seen whether this newfound tone will translate into meaningful policy changes, but for one night at least, Trump's words were more about unity and cooperation than division and conflict.",

Lois Frankel, the chair of the working group, said in a statement. The members are wearing white to show support for Planned Parenthood, affordable health care, reproductive rights, equal pay, paid leave, affordable child care and \"lives free from fear and violence,\" the statement also said. The symbolic gesture was made as the House Democratic Women's Working Group held a press conference to address the administration's policies and actions that they believe negatively impact women's rights. The group, which is comprised of representatives and delegates from across the country, emphasized their commitment to protecting and advancing women's rights and access to healthcare.\n\n\"We will not stand idly by as the Trump administration attempts to roll back the progress we've made,\" said California Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier, a member of the working group. \"We will continue to fight for the rights of women and families, and we will not be silenced.\"\n\nThe group also used the occasion to announce their support for the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which aims to strengthen labor protections and prevent union-busting. They also reiterated their opposition to the administration's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its attempts to undermine the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\n\"We will not let the Trump administration's attempts to undermine our progress go unchallenged,\" said Illinois Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky, another member of the working group. \"We will continue to stand together and fight for the rights of women and families.\"\n\nThe press conference was attended by several other members of the House Democratic Women's Working Group, as well as representatives from Planned Parenthood and other women's rights organizations. The event was held in the Capitol Building and was broadcast live on social media.\n\nThe symbolic act of wearing white was seen as a powerful statement of solidarity and a reminder of the ongoing struggle for women's rights. The group's message was clear: they will continue to fight for the rights of women and families, and they will not be silenced by the Trump administration's attempts to roll back progress.",

The sudden change of plans came as Trump and his top advisers returned to the White House, where they huddled in an emergency meeting to reassess the timing of the executive order.\n\nAccording to sources, the meeting was tense and contentious, with some advisors urging Trump to stick to the original plan and sign the order as previously announced. However, others, including Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon, argued that the positive reaction to the speech was an opportunity to be seized, and that delaying the order would allow the administration to maximize its political capital.\n\nAfter more than an hour of deliberation, Trump reportedly sided with Bannon's argument, and the decision was made to push back the announcement of the executive order. The move was seen as a strategic one, designed to maintain the momentum and goodwill generated by the president's speech, and to avoid any potential backlash that might have arisen from signing the order in the immediate aftermath of the address.\n\nThe delay is expected to give the administration an extra day to refine the language and details of the executive order, which is intended to restrict travel to the United States from several predominantly Muslim countries. The order is still expected to be signed on Thursday, but the exact timing and circumstances of the signing remain unclear.\n\nThe decision to delay the announcement has been met with widespread criticism from Democrats and human rights groups, who argue that the administration is using the issue of national security as a pretext to discriminate against Muslims and other minority groups. The move has also raised questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability, with some arguing that the delay is an attempt to avoid scrutiny and criticism.\n\nDespite the controversy, the White House remains defiant, with officials insisting that the delay is necessary to ensure that the executive order is implemented in a fair and effective manner. \"We are taking the time we need to get this right,\" said a senior administration official. \"We will not rush into anything that could compromise our national security or our values.\"",

Pelosi, clad in white as an homage to women's suffrage, shook her head and pursed her lips. Other Democrats, like Rep. Jackie Speier, were very clear in their response to the idea of repealing Obamacare, giving it a thumbs-down. As the President continued to outline his plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the Democratic Leader's expression only grew more stern. She was joined by other top Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who stood firmly behind her, his arms crossed in a clear display of opposition.\n\n\"This is a reckless and irresponsible plan that will only benefit the wealthy and powerful at the expense of the most vulnerable members of our society,\" Pelosi declared, her voice firm and resolute. \"We will not stand idly by while millions of Americans are left without access to healthcare. We will fight tooth and nail to protect the Affordable Care Act and ensure that every American has the healthcare they deserve.\"\n\nThe President, undeterred by the backlash, pressed on with his pitch, touting the benefits of his proposed replacement plan. But the Democratic Leader was quick to pounce on his claims, pointing out the numerous flaws and shortcomings in his plan.\n\n\"This is not a plan, Mr. President,\" Pelosi said, her voice dripping with disdain. \"This is a half-baked idea that has been cobbled together by a group of wealthy donors and special interest groups. It is a plan that will only serve to further enrich the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical companies, while leaving millions of Americans without access to the healthcare they need.\"\n\nAs the debate continued, the tension in the room grew thicker, with the Democratic Leader and the President engaging in a heated and acrimonious exchange. But in the end, it was clear that the President's plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was dead on arrival, and that the Democratic Leader and her colleagues would continue to fight to protect the healthcare of the American people.",

A Justice official said Sessions didn't mislead senators during his confirmation. The Washington Post first reported on Sessions' meetings with the official. Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and spy-recruiters in Washington, according to current and former senior US government officials. Russian officials dispute this characterization. Sessions met with Kislyak twice, in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention, and in September in his office when Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Services committee.

Announcing the result of the vote on whether to lift the immunity, Parliamentary President Antonio Tajani said a \"clear majority\" of members backed the motion. European Parliament Votes to Lift Immunity of French MEP Over ISIS Tweets\n\nThe European Parliament voted on Thursday to lift the immunity of French MEP Marine Le Pen, allowing French prosecutors to investigate her over tweets she sent in December 2015. The tweets in question showed images of killings by ISIS militants, which are prohibited under French law as they constitute the distribution of violent images or incitement of terrorism.\n\nThe vote was a result of a complaint filed by a French citizen, who argued that Le Pen's tweets were an attack on human dignity and a violation of French law. The European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs had previously recommended lifting Le Pen's immunity, and the full parliament voted in favor of the motion by a \"clear majority\", according to Parliamentary President Antonio Tajani.\n\nLe Pen, who is the leader of the National Rally party, has denied any wrongdoing and claimed that her tweets were meant to expose the brutality of ISIS. However, French prosecutors have been investigating her since 2015, and the lifting of her immunity is seen as a significant step towards potentially charging her with a crime.\n\nThe move is likely to be seen as a major blow to Le Pen, who has been a vocal critic of European Union policies and has been accused of promoting anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment. The National Rally party has been gaining popularity in France in recent years, and Le Pen has been seen as a potential candidate for the French presidency.\n\nThe decision is also likely to have implications for Le Pen's role in the European Parliament, where she has been a vocal critic of EU policies and has often clashed with other MEPs. Le Pen has been a prominent figure in European politics for many years, and the lifting of her immunity is seen as a significant development in the ongoing debate over free speech and hate speech in the EU.",

Still, the bar was where the friends laughed and were able to unwind after a hard day's work. It was a place where people knew them, a place where they felt comfortable. Now, burdened with a memory he is struggling to come to terms with, Madasani's words are heartrending. \"I just wish we didn't go there that night.\" Last Wednesday night, as a University of Kansas basketball game played on the bar's big screen television, Madasani remembers that he and Kuchibhotla were talking on the nearby patio. They weren't really watching the game, he said. That day the two friends were engaged in their own conversation. \"We were laughing. We were talking.\" \"Something is wrong\" Minutes into their first beers, around 6:15p.m., a stranger approached. It was a man they had never seen before. He was pointing a finger at them. \"And all of a sudden, this elderly looking gentleman with anger on his face -- you know that something is wrong the way he approaches you,\" Madasani said. Madasani recalls that he didn't speak to the man, but his friend Kuchibhotla did to be polite. \"He said, 'No sir, we are here legally, we are on H1B, we are from India.'\" After the exchange, Madasani got up from a chair on the patio and went into the bar. \"I had no reason to engage that gentleman in conversation,\" he said. Madasani was surprised at the randomness of the encounter. \"Typically, those things happen after two, three hours and people see you, you've been hanging around for awhile, they come to you and start a conversation. It was a half an hour that day when this happened. It was just out of the blue; we didn't even talk to him or say anything that can provoke it.\" As the man's anger grew, he pulled out a gun and began firing. Madasani remembers the sound of the shots, the screams of those around them, and the feeling of chaos and panic. Kuchibhotla, a 39-year-old engineer, was struck multiple times and fell to the ground. Madasani, who was uninjured, rushed to his friend's side, trying to stem the bleeding with his shirt.\n\n\"I was trying to keep him calm, I was trying to keep him talking,\" Madasani said, his voice shaking with emotion. \"He was slipping away from me, and I was trying to keep him with me.\"\n\nAs the police arrived and the gunman was subdued, Madasani's thoughts turned to his friend's family, his wife, and their two young children. He thought about the long journey they had taken to come to the United States, the sacrifices they had made, and the dreams they had pursued.\n\n\"I just wish we didn't go there that night,\" Madasani said, his voice cracking with grief. \"I just wish we didn't go there that night.\"\n\nThe shooting at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas, has left the community reeling and raised questions about immigration and hate crimes. Kuchibhotla, who was an engineer at Garmin, was killed in the attack, and Madasani was left to pick up the pieces and try to make sense of the senseless violence.\n\nAs the investigation continues, Madasani's words serve as a poignant reminder of the devastating consequences of hate and intolerance. \"We were just two guys trying to make a living, trying to provide for our families,\" he said. \"We were just trying to be normal.\"",

Kim, the older half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was killed February 13 before he was supposed to board a flight to the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau. Two women have been charged with the murder of Kim, who police said was killed by smearing VX, a deadly nerve agent, on his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Ri was the only North Korean to have been detained in the case, but investigators have named four North Korean suspects who are believed to be back in Pyongyang. According to Ali, the investigation into Kim's murder has been challenging due to the lack of cooperation from North Korea. \"We have requested assistance from North Korea, but they have not provided any substantial evidence or cooperation,\" Ali said. \"We have also asked for information from other countries, but they have not provided any significant leads.\"\n\nThe Malaysian government has been under pressure to resolve the case, which has sparked international attention and concerns over North Korea's involvement. Ali emphasized that the investigation is ongoing, but without sufficient evidence, there is little they can do to charge Ri or any of the other North Korean suspects.\n\nThe decision to deport Ri to North Korea has been met with criticism from human rights groups, who argue that he will likely face harsh treatment and possibly even execution for his alleged involvement in the assassination. \"This is a deeply concerning development,\" said a spokesperson for Amnesty International. \"Ri Jong Chol should be treated as a suspect in a murder investigation, not handed over to a regime known for its human rights abuses.\"\n\nThe Malaysian government has defended its decision, citing the lack of evidence and the need to maintain good relations with North Korea. \"We understand that this decision may be controversial, but we must prioritize the principles of justice and diplomacy,\" said a government spokesperson.\n\nThe case of Kim's murder remains a mystery, with many questions still unanswered. The two women charged with the murder, Siti Aisyah and Gooi Soon Wong, are set to face trial later this year. The investigation is ongoing, but it seems unlikely that Ri Jong Chol will ever face justice in Malaysia.",

I can only quote what the media said today -- this all looks like a witch hunt.\" Citing current and former senior US government officials CNN reported that Kislyak is considered by US intelligence to be one of Russia's top spies and spy recruiters in Washington. But Russia's Foreign Ministry has angrily rejected allegations that its top diplomat in Washington is a spy amid controversy over meetings he held with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Thursday insisted Kislyak was \"a well-known, world-class diplomat.\" \"He was deputy minister of foreign affairs in Russia, who has communicated with American colleagues for decades in different fields, and CNN accused him of being a Russian spy ... of recruiting? Oh my God!\" Sessions recuses himself on Russia inquiry Sessions on Thursday recused himself from any investigation related to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Sessions made the decision after it emerged that he had failed at his Senate confirmation hearing to disclose two pre-election meetings with Kislyak to Washington, at a time when Russia was accused of interfering in the presidential race. Pressure for Sessions to recuse himself from any involvement in a Justice Department probe into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow grew Thursday as prominent Republicans broke ranks with the administration. He is also facing calls to resign. But shortly before Sessions' recusal announcement, Trump backed his attorney general. The controversy surrounding Kislyak's meetings with Sessions has sparked a heated debate in Washington, with some lawmakers calling for Sessions to resign or be fired. The White House has defended Sessions, saying that his meetings with Kislyak were routine and did not constitute a conflict of interest.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI is investigating whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The investigation, which is being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, is also looking into whether Trump or his associates sought to obstruct the investigation.\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, Trump has been facing growing pressure from lawmakers and the public to release his tax returns and other financial documents. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, citing an audit and claiming that they are not relevant to the investigation.\n\nDespite the controversy, Trump's approval ratings have remained steady, with many of his supporters defending him against allegations of wrongdoing. However, the investigation has also led to increased scrutiny of Trump's business dealings and relationships with foreign leaders, which could potentially lead to further revelations and consequences.\n\nIn related news, the Trump administration has announced plans to impose new sanctions on Russia in response to its alleged interference in the 2016 election. The sanctions, which are expected to be announced in the coming days, could have significant economic and diplomatic implications for Russia.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the controversy will ultimately play out. One thing is certain, however: the investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia's alleged interference in the election is likely to be a major story for months to come.",

        "Text": "Kushner and Flynn sat down in December at Trump Tower with Sergey Kislyak, according to a senior administration official, who described it as an \"introductory meeting\" and \"kind of an inconsequential hello.\" The meeting lasted for about 10 minutes, the official added. Who is Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States? Flynn was fired from his role as a national security adviser after he misled the administration about his conversations with Kislyak, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday said he would recuse himself from investigations into the Trump campaign relationship with Russia after news emerged that he too had spoken privately with the ambassador. According to sources, Kislyak is a career diplomat who has served as the Russian ambassador to the United States since 2008. He is known for his close ties to the Russian government and has been a key player in Russian diplomatic efforts in Washington.\n\nThe meeting between Kushner, Flynn, and Kislyak has raised concerns among lawmakers and intelligence officials, who are investigating whether the Trump campaign had any improper contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nKislyak has been at the center of the controversy surrounding the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and his meetings with Trump officials have been scrutinized by investigators. In addition to his meetings with Flynn and Kushner, Kislyak also met with Sessions, who was a member of Trump's transition team, during the campaign.\n\nThe revelation of Kislyak's meetings with Trump officials has sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability from lawmakers. \"The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened during the campaign and whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government,\" said Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nThe FBI is also investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and Kislyak's meetings with Trump officials are believed to be a key part of that investigation. The FBI has been looking into whether any Trump officials had improper contacts with Russian officials, and whether those contacts were related to the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the election.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear what, if any, evidence has been uncovered so far. However, the revelation of Kislyak's meetings with Trump officials has raised concerns about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and has sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability.",

He's wanted for questioning over the death of Kim, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's estranged brother, who was killed with a VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13. A request has also been sent through the Foreign Ministry seeking the cooperation of Hyon Kwang Song, second secretary at the North Korean embassy, in relation to the investigation, Bakar said. The inspector general's statement comes as Malaysia and North Korea have been engaged in a diplomatic row over the murder of Kim Jong Nam, with both sides accusing each other of involvement. Malaysia has maintained that the investigation into the murder is ongoing and that it has not ruled out any country or individual as a suspect.\n\nBakar said that the warrant for Kim Uk Il's arrest was issued as part of the investigation into the murder, and that the suspect is believed to be in Malaysia. He urged anyone with information on Kim's whereabouts to come forward and assist in the investigation.\n\nThe inspector general also revealed that Malaysian authorities have sent a request to the Foreign Ministry seeking the cooperation of Hyon Kwang Song, the second secretary at the North Korean embassy, in relation to the investigation. Bakar did not elaborate on what specific assistance the authorities were seeking from Song, but said that the request was made in an effort to gather more information about the murder.\n\nThe murder of Kim Jong Nam has sparked a major diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea, with both countries accusing each other of involvement in the killing. North Korea has denied any involvement in the murder, and has instead accused Malaysia of colluding with South Korea and the United States to harm the North Korean government.\n\nMalaysian authorities have maintained that the investigation into the murder is ongoing, and that they are working to gather more evidence and interview witnesses. The case has raised questions about the security of Malaysian airports and the country's ability to protect its citizens and visitors.\n\nThe inspector general's statement is the latest development in the ongoing investigation into the murder of Kim Jong Nam. The case is expected to continue to be a major focus of diplomatic efforts between Malaysia and North Korea in the coming days and weeks.",

        "Text": "May, addressing the Scottish Conservative Party conference in Glasgow, insisted there would be no benefit to Scotland going it alone when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. Uncertainty over Brexit has led to speculation that the Scottish National Party could call for a second independence referendum: in last year's referendum, 62% of voters in Scotland wanted to remain in the European Union. May accused the SNP, which controls the devolved administration in Edinburgh, of holding an \"obsession\" with independence and neglecting other domestic issues. She said that a \"tunnel-vision nationalism, which focuses only on independence at any cost, sells Scotland short.\" \"May also warned that a second independence referendum would be a \"distraction\" from the important issues facing Scotland, such as tackling poverty and inequality. She called on the SNP to focus on improving public services and creating jobs, rather than pursuing independence.\n\nThe Prime Minister's comments were met with a mixed reaction from the Scottish Conservative Party conference, with some delegates applauding her words, while others looked on with concern.\n\nMeanwhile, the Scottish National Party has rejected May's claims, accusing her of being out of touch with the Scottish people. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said that the Prime Minister's refusal to consider a second independence referendum was \"disappointing but not surprising\".\n\nSturgeon also reiterated the SNP's stance that Scotland should have the right to hold a second referendum on independence, citing the significant shift in public opinion since the 2016 vote. She said that the SNP would continue to push for a referendum, despite May's opposition.\n\nThe debate over a second independence referendum is likely to continue in the coming months, as the UK prepares to leave the European Union. The Scottish Government has already published a paper outlining its plans for an independent Scotland, which includes a proposal for a new Scottish currency.\n\nThe UK Government has yet to respond to the paper, but May's comments suggest that it will be opposed to any moves towards a second referendum. The row highlights the deep divisions between the UK and Scottish governments, and the ongoing uncertainty over Scotland's place in the UK.\"",

Capers told reporters. Two of the students -- Nisa Mickens, 15, and Kayla Cuevas, 16 -- were beaten with baseball bats and a machete, Capers said. The girls attended Brentwood High School in Brentwood, a working-class community in Suffolk County, about 45 miles east of New York City. At the time, police said there appeared to be gang involvement in the girls' deaths and the deaths of two others, whose skeletal remains were found after they had been missing for months. Police have not announced arrests in the latter two deaths. \"The Brentwood family has spent the last six months in mourning, but today marks the beginning of the healing process for this beautiful and resilient community,\" Suffolk County Police Commissioner Timothy Sini said. Kayla was involved in a \"series of disputes\" with MS-13 gang members and associates months earlier, authorities said. She and friends then became involved in an altercation at Brentwood High a week before the girls' deaths, authorities said. MS-13 members vowed to seek revenge. According to the indictment, the MS-13 gang members used violence and intimidation to maintain control over the streets of Brentwood and surrounding areas. The indictment alleges that the gang members, including some who were students at Brentwood High School, committed a range of crimes, including murder, attempted murder, assault, and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that MS-13 members used social media and other forms of communication to spread fear and intimidation, and to recruit new members. The gang members are accused of using violence and threats to silence witnesses and intimidate potential victims.\n\nThe indictment was the result of a long-term investigation by the Suffolk County Police Department, the FBI, and other law enforcement agencies. The investigation was led by Suffolk County Police Detective Michael Hoffman, who has been working on the case for over a year.\n\nThe indictment is a major breakthrough in the investigation, and it marks a significant step towards justice for the families of the victims. The families of the victims have been vocal in their demand for justice, and they have been working closely with law enforcement to bring the perpetrators to account.\n\nThe indictment is also a testament to the strength and resilience of the Brentwood community, which has been deeply affected by the violence and gang activity. The community has come together to support the families of the victims, and to demand an end to the violence and gang activity.\n\nThe case is now headed to federal court, where the defendants will face trial. If convicted, they could face up to life in prison. The indictment is a major victory for law enforcement, and it marks a significant step towards bringing an end to the violence and gang activity in Brentwood.",

        "Text": "A government act on Thursday reintroduced compulsory military service in the country for the first time since 2010, and for the first time on a gender-equal basis. Peter Hultqvist, Sweden's minister of defense, cited Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014 as one of the triggers for the decision. \"After the Russian annexation of Crimea against international law, and their increased military exercises close to the border, we have a new security situation,\" Hultqvist said. Hultqvist added that Sweden is \"strengthening its military cooperation with Finland and with the NATO partners.\" Sweden is not a NATO member but it has contributed to NATO-led operations and enjoys bilateral ties with the alliance through the Partnership for Peace and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The country suspended conscription in 2010 and instead adopted a recruitment system which relied on volunteers. The new law, which takes effect in 2023, requires all Swedish citizens between the ages of 18 and 47 to serve in the military for a minimum of 265 days. This includes both men and women, who will be treated equally under the new system. The previous conscription law, which was suspended in 2010, only applied to men.\n\nThe decision to reintroduce conscription was met with mixed reactions from the public and politicians. Some argue that it is necessary to strengthen Sweden's national defense and deter potential threats from neighboring countries, while others see it as a step backward in terms of individual freedom and autonomy.\n\n\"The government's decision is a clear sign that they are taking the security situation seriously,\" said Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister. \"However, it's also important to ensure that the conscription system is fair and does not disproportionately affect certain groups of people.\"\n\nCritics of the decision argue that it will lead to a decrease in the number of volunteers joining the military, as some may see conscription as a less desirable option. They also point out that the country's military is already facing challenges in recruiting and retaining personnel, and that conscription may exacerbate these problems.\n\nDespite these concerns, the government remains committed to the decision. \"We believe that a strong and well-prepared military is essential for Sweden's security and stability,\" said Hultqvist. \"And we are confident that our new conscription system will help us achieve that goal.\"\n\nThe reintroduction of conscription is also seen as a sign of a shift in Sweden's foreign policy, which has traditionally been focused on peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. The country's increased military cooperation with NATO and its neighboring countries is also seen as a response to the changing security landscape in the region.\n\nIn related news, the Swedish military has announced plans to increase its troop levels and modernize its equipment in response to the new security situation. The country is also planning to invest in its cyber defense capabilities and intelligence gathering infrastructure.\n\nThe reintroduction of conscription is set to take effect in 2023, and the government has promised to provide more details on the new system in the coming months. In the meantime, many Swedes are left wondering what this means for their country's future and whether the decision will ultimately make them safer.",

Palmyra was seized from regime forces by ISIS in December after hundreds of the jihadist group's militants launched a coordinated attack in and around the city.\n\nPalmyra is seen as strategically important to both sides in Syria's more than five year civil war. Located in Homs province, in central Syria, it is around 225 kilometers (140 miles) from Raqqa, considered ISIS' headquarters in Syria.\n\nThe recapture of Palmyra is a significant blow to ISIS, which had been using the city as a base to launch attacks on government forces and civilians. The city's ancient ruins, including the famous Temple of Baalshamin, were also a major tourist attraction before the conflict began.\n\nThe Syrian army, backed by Russian air power, launched a major offensive to retake Palmyra in March, after ISIS militants had been using the city as a stronghold to launch attacks on government forces.\n\nThe city's recapture is seen as a major victory for the Syrian government, which has been fighting to regain control of key cities and territories from ISIS and other rebel groups.\n\nThe United States, which has been providing air support to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighting ISIS in eastern Syria, welcomed the news of Palmyra's recapture. \"The liberation of Palmyra is a significant milestone in the fight against ISIS,\" said a State Department spokesperson. \"We will continue to support our partners on the ground in their efforts to defeat ISIS and bring stability to Syria.\"\n\nThe recapture of Palmyra is also seen as a boost to the Syrian government's efforts to reassert its control over central Syria, which has been largely outside of its control since the outbreak of the civil war in 2011.\n\nThe city's recapture is expected to have significant implications for the conflict in Syria, which has seen multiple factions and foreign powers involved in the fighting. The Syrian government, backed by Russia, is seeking to regain control of key cities and territories, while the United States and its allies are supporting Kurdish and Arab forces fighting ISIS.",

        "Text": "After expressing concern about Wikileaks' release of documents allegedly revealing CIA surveillance techniques, Spicer quickly muddled his message. He connected the latest WikiLeaks document dump to surveillance efforts under the Obama administration, days after President Donald Trump's leveled his unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama tapped the GOP candidate's phones during the 2016 campaign. And then he took to arguing forcefully that there was a \"double standard\" when it comes to the level of outrage elicited by different leaks. 'I love Wikileaks' The White House has repeatedly argued that too much public and political attention has been devoted to the investigation into contacts between Trump campaign officials and suspected Russian operatives and not enough to the leaks of that confidential information. According to Spicer, the media's fixation on the Russia investigation is a prime example of this double standard. \"We're talking about a leak that's potentially compromising national security, and yet the outrage is nowhere to be found,\" he said, referring to the latest WikiLeaks release. \"Meanwhile, we have leaks from the intelligence community that are clearly political in nature, and everyone's losing their minds over those.\"\n\nSpicer's comments sparked immediate backlash from critics, who accused him of downplaying the severity of the WikiLeaks disclosures and attempting to shift attention away from the Russia probe. \"The White House is trying to distract from the real issue here, which is the president's own connections to Russia,\" said Senator John McCain, a prominent Republican critic of Trump. \"The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened during the election, and we can't let the White House spin this to cover their tracks.\"\n\nThe controversy comes as the White House faces growing pressure to provide a clearer explanation of Trump's claims about Obama's alleged wiretapping. Trump has repeatedly accused Obama of ordering the wiretapping, but there is no evidence to support this claim, and the Obama administration has denied it. The FBI and NSA have also denied that any wiretapping occurred.\n\nMeanwhile, the CIA has confirmed that the latest WikiLeaks release includes authentic documents, but officials have emphasized that the leaks did not compromise any sensitive intelligence operations. The agency has also condemned the release of the documents, calling it a \"grave threat\" to national security.\n\nAs the debate rages on, Trump himself weighed in on Twitter, claiming that the media was \"so dishonest\" and that the leaks were \"fake news.\" His tweet sparked a fresh round of criticism, with many accusing the president of attempting to bully and intimidate the press. \"The president's tweet is a clear attempt to silence the media and distract from the real issues,\" said the Washington Post's editorial board. \"It's a sad day when the leader of the free world feels the need to attack the press corps.\"",

He made the remark as he discussed the rise of encryption since 2013 disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed sensitive US spy practices. \"Even our communications with our spouses, with our clergy members, with our attorneys are not absolutely private in America,\" Comey added. According to FBI Director James Comey, the notion of absolute privacy in the United States is a myth. He made this statement at a cybersecurity conference hosted by Boston College, where he addressed the growing use of encryption in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations about the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance practices in 2013.\n\nComey's comments sparked controversy among privacy advocates, who argue that the government's increasing reliance on surveillance and data collection is a threat to individual liberties. The FBI director, however, emphasized that the need to balance national security concerns with the need to protect individual privacy.\n\n\"We need to find a way to make sure that we can access the communications of terrorists and other criminals while also respecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens,\" Comey said. \"This is a difficult challenge, but it's one that we must face head-on.\"\n\nComey's remarks come as the FBI and other law enforcement agencies face growing challenges in accessing encrypted data. Many technology companies, including Apple and Google, have implemented strong encryption methods to protect their users' data, making it increasingly difficult for authorities to intercept and analyze communications.\n\nThe debate over encryption and privacy has taken on new urgency in recent years, with many experts warning that the proliferation of unbreakable encryption could make it difficult for law enforcement to track and prevent terrorist attacks. At the same time, privacy advocates argue that the government's efforts to compromise encryption could have far-reaching consequences for individual privacy and civil liberties.\n\nIn his speech, Comey acknowledged that the FBI's efforts to access encrypted data had been met with resistance from technology companies. He called on Congress to pass legislation that would require technology companies to provide law enforcement agencies with access to encrypted data in certain circumstances.\n\n\"We need to work with Congress to pass legislation that will allow us to access the communications of terrorists and other criminals while also respecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens,\" Comey said. \"This is a complex issue, but I am confident that we can find a solution that balances our national security needs with our commitment to individual privacy.\"",

But Luis Enrique's side made a barnstorming start to the match and early in the second half a Lionel Messi penalty gave them a 3-0 lead in the Camp Nou. RELATED: See fans go wild The home side were coasting, but just past the hour Uruguayan striker Edison Cavani's volley seemingly put PSG back in control, with Barca needing to score three more times, given the French side now had a crucial away goal. However, with two minutes of normal time remaining Neymar's exquisite free-kick gave Barca renewed hope and two goals in stoppage time completed the most incredible of comebacks. 'Unbelievable' Those five minutes of stoppage time almost defy description. In the 91st minute Luis Suarez, who had given Barcelona an early lead, won a penalty, which Neymar converted. With time running out Barcelona threw everyone forward -- even their goalkeeper Marc-Andr¨¦ ter Stegen. And almost with the last kick of the game Barca's sixth goal came from the most unlikely of sources -- not their famed strikers -- Messi, Neymar or Suarez -- but defender Sergio Roberto, who was born in Catalonia and is a product of Barca's youth academy. who celebrated his unlikely goal with tears of joy, as the Camp Nou erupted in a frenzy of noise and color. The final score was 6-1 to Barcelona, the greatest comeback in Champions League history, and a testament to the team's never-say-die spirit.\n\nThe victory sent shockwaves around the football world, with pundits and fans alike struggling to find words to describe the magnitude of Barca's achievement. \"This is a night that will be remembered for generations to come,\" said Luis Enrique, beaming with pride in the post-match press conference. \"My players have shown that they have the heart of lions. We never gave up, even when it seemed like all hope was lost.\"\n\nThe win sets up a mouth-watering quarterfinal tie against Manchester City, who had earlier overcome a 2-1 deficit to defeat Monaco 3-2. The English champions will undoubtedly be wary of Barca's newfound confidence and determination, but they will also be aware that they have the talent and resources to take down the Spanish giants.\n\nFor now, though, Barcelona will bask in the glory of their incredible comeback, and the knowledge that they have written themselves into the annals of Champions League history. As the team celebrated on the pitch, the fans in the stands sang and danced, knowing that they had witnessed something truly special. It was a night that will be remembered for a long, long time.",

        "Text": "The US-backed fighters are preparing to move in the coming weeks to assault the city of Raqqa, ISIS' self-declared capital, according to the officials. The Pentagon and the Marine Corps have declined to confirm the deployment because of security concerns in the region. They have also declined to specify the exact location of the forces or how many are there. The Washington Post was the first to report the deployment of the Marines. According to sources close to the operation, the US-backed forces are expected to launch a multi-pronged assault on Raqqa, which has been the de facto capital of the Islamic State (ISIS) since 2014. The city has been a key hub for the terrorist group's operations in the region, and its capture would be a significant blow to ISIS's ability to wage war.\n\nThe US-backed forces, which include Kurdish and Arab fighters, are expected to move into position over the coming weeks, with the goal of launching a coordinated attack on the city. The operation is expected to be supported by US airstrikes and special operations forces, who will provide intelligence and logistical support to the ground troops.\n\nThe deployment of US Marines to the region has raised concerns about the potential for escalation in the conflict. However, Pentagon officials have emphasized that the deployment is intended to support local forces in their efforts to defeat ISIS, rather than to engage in direct combat with the terrorist group.\n\n\"The US is committed to supporting our partners in the region as they work to defeat ISIS,\" said a senior Pentagon official. \"We believe that the capture of Raqqa would be a significant milestone in that effort, and we are willing to do what it takes to support our partners in achieving that goal.\"\n\nThe US-backed forces are expected to face significant resistance from ISIS fighters, who are known to be highly trained and well-equipped. However, the group has been losing ground in recent months, and the capture of Raqqa would be a significant blow to its ability to wage war.\n\nThe operation is expected to be complex and challenging, with multiple forces moving into position over the coming weeks. However, the US-backed forces are confident in their ability to succeed, and are preparing for a long and difficult battle.\n\n\"We are ready to take on ISIS and defeat them,\" said a senior Kurdish commander. \"We have been preparing for this moment for months, and we are confident in our ability to succeed. We will not rest until ISIS is defeated and the people of Raqqa are safe.\"",

        "Text": "Namely, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump wasn't referring to wiretapping when he tweeted about wiretapping. \"I think there's no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election,\" Spicer said. \"The President used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities.\" Wiretapping is a narrowly defined surveillance activity that involves tapping into \"a telephone or telegram wire in order to get information,\" according to Merriam-Webster dictionary. Spicer also said that Trump was referring to the Obama administration broadly -- and not accusing Obama of personal involvement -- when he tweeted that \"Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower\" and accused Obama of being a \"bad\" or \"sick guy.\" The clarification from Spicer sparked a mix of reactions from lawmakers and the public, with some demanding more transparency from the Trump administration and others defending the President's use of language.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Spicer's explanation \"completely unconvincing\" and demanded that Trump release any evidence supporting his claims.\n\n\"This is not a game, Mr. President,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"The American people deserve the truth, and they deserve it now.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also expressed skepticism, saying that Trump's tweets had \"raised serious questions\" about his administration's commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\n\"I think it's very important that we get to the bottom of this,\" McCain said. \"I don't think it's fair to the American people to just dismiss this as a big misunderstanding.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some conservative commentators and lawmakers defended Trump's use of language, arguing that Spicer's clarification was reasonable and that the President was simply using a colloquialism to describe a broader range of surveillance activities.\n\n\"This is a classic example of the media trying to create a scandal where none exists,\" said Fox News host Sean Hannity. \"The President is using a term that's commonly used in everyday language, and the media is trying to twist it into something sinister.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, the Trump administration continued to face questions about the nature of the surveillance activities Trump had claimed to have experienced. The FBI and the NSA have both denied that they conducted any wiretapping of Trump Tower during the 2016 election, and the Obama administration has also denied any involvement in such activities.\n\nAs the debate raged on, many were left wondering what exactly Trump meant by his tweets, and what evidence, if any, he had to support his claims. The White House has yet to provide any concrete evidence or documentation to back up Trump's assertions, leading many to question the President's motives and the accuracy of his statements.",

        "Text": "The House Intelligence Committee has set a Monday deadline for the DOJ to provide the evidence, a source familiar with the matter has told CNN, and has sent letters throughout the intelligence community this week to obtain records related to Russia. Former President Barack Obama has denied the allegations through a spokesman, and his former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, also has publicly denied them. Sources have told CNN that FBI Director James Comey also pushed back against Trump's claim. Trump has not publicly provided any evidence for his allegations, first made more than a week ago. Sunday night, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to the President, appeared to expand the allegations by suggesting to the Bergen Record there could have been even wider spying of the Trump campaign, including the use of microwaves and television sets. Like the President, however, she did not provide any evidence, and later said she was speaking generally about surveillance. The development comes as the White House faces growing scrutiny over Trump's claims, with many experts and lawmakers questioning the accuracy and credibility of the allegations. The House Intelligence Committee's request for evidence has been met with skepticism by some, who argue that the committee's Republican majority may be more interested in investigating Trump's political opponents than in uncovering any wrongdoing.\n\nDespite the controversy, Trump has remained steadfast in his claims, using his Twitter account to repeatedly accuse Obama and his administration of engaging in widespread surveillance of his campaign. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that \"Nixon had nothing on this\" and that \"the Obama Administration was TAPED SPYING ON ME.\"\n\nThe allegations have also sparked a heated debate about the balance between national security and individual privacy, with some arguing that the government's surveillance powers must be carefully limited to prevent abuse. Others have called for greater transparency and accountability in the intelligence community, particularly in light of recent revelations about the NSA's bulk data collection programs.\n\nThe controversy has also taken a toll on Trump's approval ratings, with many Americans expressing concern about the President's handling of the situation. In a recent poll, 62% of respondents said they did not believe Trump's claims about Obama, while 55% said they were concerned about the potential for abuse of government surveillance powers.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the White House and the intelligence community. \"The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened during the election,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \"We cannot allow the President's baseless claims to undermine the integrity of our democratic institutions.\"\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of Russia in the 2016 election, with some experts arguing that the allegations of surveillance may be a distraction from the real issue of Russian interference. \"We need to focus on the real threat to our democracy, which is the Russian government's attempts to influence our election,\" said Sen. John McCain. \"We cannot let the President's distractions divert us from this critical issue.\"",

The Turkish government has been at odds with the Netherlands over the past week, with tensions escalating after the Dutch government refused to allow Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to fly to Rotterdam to address a rally of Turkish citizens living in the Netherlands.\n\nCavusoglu's interview with CNN's Connect the World on Monday sparked further outrage, as he expressed his frustration and disappointment at the decision. \"Why this time am I a terrorist?

The spat erupted as citizens prepare to cast their ballots in votes that could radically alter the political landscape in both countries. What's going on? How did the quarrel begin? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been intent on rallying the roughly 4.6 million expatriate Turks living in western Europe to vote in an upcoming Turkish constitutional referendum. If passed, the referendum would transform Turkey's parliamentary system into a presidential one, effectively consolidating the power of three legislative bodies into one executive branch under Erdogan. Germany, Austria and Switzerland sought to prevent referendum rallies taking place on their soil -- citing security and overcrowding concerns. citing security and overcrowding concerns. Erdogan responded by accusing the European countries of \"Nazi measures\" and \"fascist practices\", further escalating the tensions. The Turkish leader also called on his citizens living in Europe to boycott German products and urged them to return to Turkey.\n\nIn response, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government condemned Erdogan's remarks, calling them \"unacceptable\" and \"unfriendly\". Austria and Switzerland also weighed in, with Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz saying that Erdogan's comments were \"unacceptable and unbecoming\".\n\nThe spat has not only caused diplomatic friction, but also sparked widespread unrest among Turkish expatriates living in Europe. Many have taken to social media to express their support for Erdogan and their opposition to the European countries' attempts to restrict their right to vote.\n\nThe Turkish government has also launched a series of rallies and protests across Europe, with thousands of people turning out to show their support for the referendum. However, the events have been marred by violence and clashes with police, with several people injured and arrested.\n\nThe controversy has also raised concerns about the potential impact on relations between Turkey and the European Union. The EU has been critical of Erdogan's government over issues such as human rights and democracy, and the spat has only added to the tensions.\n\nAs the referendum approaches, it remains to be seen how the crisis will unfold. Will Erdogan's government be able to rally its supporters and secure the necessary votes to pass the referendum? Or will the controversy and unrest ultimately scuttle the plans? One thing is certain, however: the drama is far from over, and the world is watching with bated breath.",

When rebuffed by Germany a week and half ago and by the Netherlands this week, he accused both of Nazi inclinations. His incendiary words brought sharp rebuke from both countries, the Dutch reminding him of the 200,000 people killed by Nazi forces. This weekend his ministers were due to address expat Turks in the Netherlands to get their support for a Turkish referendum that will transfer and consolidate Turkey's powers in Erdogan's hands alone. But in attempting to further eclipse democracy in his country, Erdogan appears to have overlooked Holland's impending elections where immigration is a key issue. The Netherlands -- where his Foreign Minister and Minister of Families were denied permission to address rallies -- goes to the polls on Wednesday. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he doesn't think Erdogan was intent on upsetting the Dutch elections but that his ministers tried to force their way in to his country against the direct wishes of the Dutch government. As a result, the Dutch government has taken a strong stance against Erdogan's attempts to intervene in their domestic affairs. The country's Deputy Prime Minister, Hugo de Jonge, has accused Erdogan of trying to \"divide\" the Netherlands and its people, and has warned that any further attempts to interfere in the election will be met with swift action.\n\nThe Turkish government's plans to address expat Turks in the Netherlands have also been dealt a blow, with many of the planned rallies being cancelled or postponed due to concerns over public safety and national security. The Dutch government has also taken steps to limit the activities of Turkish officials and diplomats in the country, citing a need to protect its citizens and prevent any potential unrest.\n\nErdogan's remarks have also sparked widespread outrage and condemnation across Europe, with many politicians and leaders expressing their shock and dismay at his comments. The European Union has issued a statement condemning Erdogan's remarks as \"unacceptable\" and \"divisive\", and has called on him to respect the sovereignty and democratic processes of its member states.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, many Dutch citizens are now questioning the wisdom of allowing Turkey to join the European Union, with some calling for the country's membership bid to be put on hold or even revoked. The issue is expected to be a major topic of discussion in the upcoming Dutch elections, with many parties vowing to take a tougher stance on Turkey's relations with the EU.\n\nFor Erdogan, the controversy is a major setback and a blow to his reputation as a leader who is able to shape international events to his advantage. His comments have been widely criticized as an attempt to bully and intimidate other countries, and have raised concerns about his commitment to democratic values and the rule of law.\n\nIn the end, the Dutch elections may prove to be a major test of Erdogan's abilities as a leader, and his ability to navigate the complex and often treacherous waters of international diplomacy. As the controversy continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the world is watching, and Erdogan's actions will have far-reaching consequences for his country and the world at large.",

According to sources close to the meeting, Trump's enthusiasm was met with skepticism from some of his Cabinet members, who expressed concerns about the feasibility of the proposed healthcare overhaul. The President's comments came as lawmakers began drafting a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which has been a cornerstone of his campaign promises.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the bill's passage, Trump emphasized the need for swift action, stating that \"the system is broken\" and that Americans are \"paying too much\" for healthcare. He also hinted at the possibility of a \"temporary\" phase-out of certain Obamacare provisions, such as the individual mandate, in order to \"give people relief.\"\n\nHowever, the meeting was marked by disagreement over the scope and timing of the proposed changes. Some Cabinet members, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, advocated for a more gradual approach, citing the potential risks of disrupting the healthcare system. Others, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, pushed for a more aggressive overhaul, arguing that the current system is \"unsustainable\" and must be \"fixed\" quickly.\n\nThe meeting ended with no clear consensus on the details of the replacement bill, leaving many wondering what the future holds for the American healthcare system.

Egypt's Court of Cassation upheld an earlier verdict, making the acquittal final. Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president, was set to walk free from prison on Thursday after a court ordered his release, according to reports. The news comes nearly a decade after Mubarak was initially arrested and charged with ordering the killing of protesters during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that led to his downfall.\n\nMubarak's release was met with widespread criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians, who accused the government of corruption and nepotism. The former president's sons, Gamal and Alaa, were also acquitted of charges related to the uprising and are expected to be released from prison soon.\n\nThe decision to release Mubarak was made by Egypt's prosecution office, which cited a lack of evidence linking the former president to the killings of protesters. The acquittal was upheld by the Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, making it final.\n\nMubarak, who was 82 years old at the time of his arrest, had been in prison since 2011. He was convicted of corruption and embezzlement, but acquitted of the most serious charges related to the killing of protesters.\n\nThe decision to release Mubarak has sparked widespread protests and demonstrations across Egypt, with many calling for the government to reconsider the decision. The country's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has faced criticism for his handling of the situation, with many accusing him of prioritizing the interests of the country's elite over those of the general public.\n\nMubarak's release is seen as a major setback for human rights in Egypt, where the government has faced criticism for its treatment of political prisoners and opposition figures. The decision has also raised concerns about the country's commitment to accountability and justice for human rights abuses.\n\nThe Egyptian government has defended the decision to release Mubarak, saying that it is in line with the country's laws and regulations.

        "Text": "The addition of the Izumo helicopter carrier, which specializes primarily in anti-submarine missions, marks a rare show of naval force from Japan amid growing tensions across Asia and highlights the Trump administration's intention to maintain a cooperative military presence in the region. The Malabar military exercises have taken place on a rotational basis in the West Pacific and Indian oceans since Japan became a regular participant in 2007. To get to the Indian Ocean, the shortest route will take the Izumo through the contested South China Sea. China has already made its dissatisfaction with the exercises clear. The deployment of the Izumo, which was previously used as a helicopter carrier, has sparked concerns among regional countries, particularly China, which has been increasingly assertive in its territorial claims in the South China Sea. The exercises are seen as a display of military might by Japan, which has been quietly building up its naval capabilities in recent years.\n\nThe Malabar exercises, which will involve warships from the United States, Japan, and India, are aimed at promoting regional security and stability. However, China has accused the countries of \"sowing discord\" and \"undermining regional peace and stability\" through the exercises.\n\nThe Izumo, which is equipped with F-35B stealth fighter jets, is expected to play a key role in the exercises, which will focus on anti-submarine warfare, air defense, and maritime security. The ship's deployment is seen as a message from Japan to China and other regional countries that it is willing to take a more assertive stance in defending its interests.\n\nThe exercises come at a time of heightened tensions in the region, with China and the United States engaged in a trade war and a series of military confrontations in the South China Sea. The deployment of the Izumo is seen as a response to China's growing military presence in the region, which has raised concerns among regional countries.\n\nJapan's defense ministry has said that the Izumo will be deployed in the Indian Ocean for several weeks, and will participate in a series of exercises with the US and Indian navies. The ministry has also emphasized that the deployment is not aimed at any specific country, but rather is part of Japan's efforts to maintain regional security and stability.\n\nThe Malabar exercises have been taking place annually since 2007, and have involved a range of military exercises, including anti-submarine warfare, air defense, and maritime security. The exercises are seen as an important symbol of the military cooperation between the three countries, and are aimed at promoting regional security and stability.\n\nIn recent years, the exercises have become increasingly complex, with the addition of new military assets, including F-35 fighter jets and advanced submarines. The exercises have also become more focused on anti-submarine warfare, in response to China's growing submarine fleet.\n\nThe deployment of the Izumo is seen as a significant development in the region, and is likely to be closely watched by regional countries. The exercises are expected to send a strong message to China and other regional countries that Japan is willing to take a more assertive stance in defending its interests.",

        "Text": "The announcement came a week after North Korea shot off four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, and while the US and South Korea are conducting their annual joint military exercises. \"The stationing of this company, which will be assigned to the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, directly supports the US Army's strategic plan to add one Gray Eagle company to each division in the Army,\" USFK said in a news release. \"The UAS adds significant intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability to US Forces Korea and our ROK (Republic of Korea) partners.\" The Gray Eagle Unmanned Aerial System is capable of staying in the air for 24 hours and is equipped with Hellfire missiles, according to a profile on the US Army website. The system has upgraded reconnaissance and surveillance technology over that of the Predator drones, which the US military has used widely in operations around the globe, said Corey Wallace of the Graduate School of East Asian Studies at Freie Universit?t Berlin. It can also integrate with Apache helicopters, which could help when it comes to avoiding bad weather on the Korean Peninsula. The US military began rotating 24 AH-64D Apaches into South Korea earlier this year. \"The US and its regional partners see the importance of demonstrating that they also have the upper hand in conventional deterrence and readiness, and not just as a reaction to a full DPRK (Democratic Republic of Korea) attack,\" Wallace told CNN in an email. Trouble on the Peninsula The move is likely a show of force in reaction to increased provocations from North Korea, said Daniel Pinkston, a professor at Troy University in Seoul. Pyongyang has conducted a series of test missile launches in recent months, a worrying development for the US and its allies in the region because it means that North Korea is likely refining its missile technology. The deployment of the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to South Korea is a significant development in the region, as it marks a shift in the US military's strategy towards North Korea. The USFK's announcement comes as tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high, with North Korea conducting a series of test missile launches in recent months.\n\nThe Gray Eagle UAS is a highly advanced system that is capable of staying in the air for 24 hours and is equipped with Hellfire missiles. It is also equipped with upgraded reconnaissance and surveillance technology, which makes it a valuable asset for the US military in terms of gathering intelligence on North Korean military activities.\n\nThe deployment of the Gray Eagle UAS to South Korea is likely a show of force in reaction to increased provocations from North Korea, said Daniel Pinkston, a professor at Troy University in Seoul. \"The US and its regional partners see the importance of demonstrating that they also have the upper hand in conventional deterrence and readiness, and not just as a reaction to a full DPRK attack,\" Pinkston said.\n\nThe move is also seen as a response to North Korea's continued development of its missile technology. In recent months, North Korea has conducted a series of test missile launches, including the launch of four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan last week. The launches have been met with condemnation from the international community, and have raised concerns about the potential threat posed by North Korea's missile program.\n\nThe Gray Eagle UAS is a significant addition to the US military's capabilities in South Korea, and is likely to be used to gather intelligence on North Korean military activities. It is also capable of being integrated with Apache helicopters, which could help to improve the US military's ability to conduct operations in the region.\n\nThe deployment of the Gray Eagle UAS to South Korea is a significant development in the region, and is likely to be closely watched by both the US and North Korea. It is a clear demonstration of the US military's commitment to the security of South Korea and the region, and is likely to be seen as a show of force in response to North Korea's continued provocations.",

        "Text": "With the first round of the French presidential election just over a month away and Germany headed to the ballot box later this year, the Dutch battle is being closely watched for clues to wider political trends. Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte is facing a tight battle with far-right rival Geert Wilders, whose anti-immigrant, anti-Islam tirades have landed him in court -- but also won him widespread support in a country that is increasingly polarized by austerity and immigration issues. Rutte's Party for Freedom and Democracy, the VVD, leads the latest Peilingwijzer poll of polls by Leiden University, but Wilders' Freedom Party, the PVV, is hot on its heels. The Dutch political landscape is splintered, with 28 parties on the ballot, and the country's system of proportional representation means some form of coalition government is almost guaranteed. and many experts believe that the outcome of the election will have significant implications for the future of European politics. The rise of far-right parties across the continent has been a growing concern, and Wilders' popularity has been seen as a bellwether for the sentiment.\n\n\"If Wilders wins, it will be a major wake-up call for European leaders,\" said Dr. Julia Mummert, a political scientist at the University of Amsterdam. \"It will show that the far-right is a force to be reckoned with, and that they can't just be dismissed as fringe elements.\"\n\nRutte, on the other hand, has been touting his party's moderate stance on immigration and economic issues, and has been trying to paint Wilders as a divisive figure who would create more problems than he would solve.\n\n\"The PVV is a party that only cares about one thing: getting attention and stirring up hatred,\" Rutte said in a recent campaign speech. \"We need a government that works for all Dutch people, not just a select few.\"\n\nDespite the rhetoric, many voters are torn between the two candidates. Wilders has been able to tap into a deep-seated frustration among some Dutch citizens about the country's handling of immigration and integration, and his party has been gaining ground among younger voters and those in rural areas.\n\nRutte, meanwhile, has been trying to appeal to voters who are concerned about the country's economic future and the impact of austerity measures on ordinary citizens. His party has been seen as more business-friendly and has received support from the country's powerful trade unions.\n\nThe election is also being closely watched by European leaders, who are eager to see how the outcome will affect the continent's politics. The European Union is facing a number of challenges, including the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the rise of nationalist movements across the continent.\n\n\"We're watching the Dutch election closely because it will give us a sense of whether the far-right is going to continue to gain ground,\" said a senior official at the European Commission. \"We're concerned about the implications for European stability and cohesion.\"\n\nThe election is set to take place on March 15, and the outcome is far from certain. But one thing is clear: the winner will have a significant impact on the future of European politics.",

North Korea's missile program is getting quicker and smarter, threatening the United States and its two key East Asian allies -- Japan and South Korea. The latter is reeling after the ouster of its president. As South Korea struggles to recover from the political crisis, President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol is set to embark on a diplomatic tour of the region, seeking to ease tensions and strengthen alliances. His first stop will be Tokyo, Japan, where he will meet with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss security concerns and economic cooperation.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States is urging caution as North Korea continues to test its military capabilities. The Pentagon has confirmed that the reclusive regime has successfully launched multiple ballistic missiles in recent weeks, including a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that flew over Japan.\n\n\"This is a clear threat to regional stability and global security,\" said a senior US defense official. \"We are working closely with our allies in the region to ensure that we are prepared to respond to any provocation.\"\n\nThe situation is particularly sensitive given the recent ouster of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who had been a key player in regional diplomacy. The sudden change in leadership has raised concerns about the stability of the Korean peninsula and the potential for miscalculation.\n\nYoon Suk-yeol, a conservative politician who won the presidential election last week, has vowed to take a tougher stance on North Korea and has pledged to strengthen the country's military capabilities. His first trip to Asia is seen as an opportunity to send a strong message to Pyongyang and to reassure allies of the United States' commitment to regional security.\n\nThe visit to Tokyo is also expected to focus on economic cooperation, as South Korea and Japan seek to strengthen their trade ties and counterbalance China's growing influence in the region. The two countries have been working together to develop a joint strategy for addressing the North Korean threat, and the meeting between Yoon and Kishida is seen as an important step in that process.\n\nAs Yoon embarks on his diplomatic tour, the region is holding its breath, waiting to see how the situation will unfold. With tensions running high and the threat of military conflict ever-present, the stakes could not be higher.",

According to Whitehouse, Comey assured them he would confirm if an investigation exists \"and the scope of their Russia/Trump investigation because he had not been able to at that point say that there was one.\"\n\nWhitehouse and Graham both asked the Justice Department last week to provide any evidence that would support Trump's claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. The two are leading one of three Congressional investigations into Russia's interference in the US elections.\n\nThe development comes as tensions between Trump and the FBI continue to escalate. Earlier this week, Trump tweeted that he was \"somewhat\" surprised by the news, but said he had \"absolute\" confidence in Comey. The President has been under fire for his handling of the investigation, which he has repeatedly denied having any knowledge of.\n\nThe meeting between Comey, Whitehouse, and Graham was not publicly disclosed until now, but Whitehouse confirmed the details in an interview with CNN. He said that Comey told them he would not be able to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, but would provide information on the scope of the probe.\n\n\"This is a very serious matter, and we need to get to the bottom of it,\" Whitehouse said. \"We need to know what the FBI is doing, and we need to know what the Justice Department is doing.\"\n\nGraham, who has been a vocal critic of Trump's handling of the investigation, also expressed frustration with the lack of transparency. \"I think it's outrageous that the FBI is not being transparent about what they're doing,\" he said. \"We need to get to the truth, and we need to get to it quickly.\"\n\nThe revelation has sparked renewed calls for Comey to testify before Congress, which he has thus far refused to do. The FBI director has said that he will not comment on the investigation, citing the ongoing nature of the probe.\n\nThe controversy has also led to a heated debate over the scope of the investigation, with some Republicans accusing the FBI of overstepping its bounds. Democrats, on the other hand, have called for the investigation to continue, saying that it is essential to uncover the truth about Russia's interference in the election.\n\nAs the investigation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the public is demanding answers, and it's up to Comey and the Justice Department to provide them.",

READ: Lithium-ion batteries banned on passenger planes \"I just grabbed my face which caused the headphones to go around my neck,\" she said. The woman, who was not identified, said she tore off the headphones and threw them to the floor, where she saw they were shooting off sparks and small flames. \"As I went to stamp my foot on them the flight attendants were already there with a bucket of water to pour on them. They put them into the bucket at the rear of the plane,\" she said. The incident occurred on a flight from Sydney to Melbourne, Australia, and the woman's account is part of a report issued by the ATSB to warn other passengers about the dangers of lithium-ion batteries on flights.\n\nAccording to the report, the explosion was caused by a lithium-ion battery that had been left in the woman's carry-on bag. The battery, which was used to charge her phone, had apparently overheated and caught fire.\n\nThe woman's quick thinking and the prompt response of the flight attendants likely prevented a more serious incident from occurring. The flight attendants were able to extinguish the flames and contain the damage, and the plane was able to make an emergency landing in Melbourne.\n\nThe ATSB report is warning passengers to be vigilant about the dangers of lithium-ion batteries on flights. The agency is urging passengers to ensure that their batteries are properly charged and stored, and to avoid leaving them in carry-on bags.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a series of incidents involving lithium-ion batteries on flights. In recent years, there have been several reports of batteries overheating and catching fire on planes, and some airlines have banned the use of lithium-ion batteries on their flights.\n\nThe ATSB report is urging passengers to take extra precautions to ensure their safety on flights. The agency is also working with airlines and manufacturers to develop new safety standards for lithium-ion batteries.\n\nIn the meantime, passengers are being advised to take the following precautions:\n\n* Ensure that your lithium-ion batteries are properly charged and stored\n* Avoid leaving them in carry-on bags\n* Keep them away from heat sources, such as cigarettes or electronic devices\n* Follow the manufacturer's instructions for charging and use\n\nBy taking these precautions, passengers can help to minimize the risk of a lithium-ion battery fire on a flight.",

Wilders, a far-right firebrand, tweeted: \"PVV voters thanks. We won seats, first victory is in. Rutte hasn't got rid of me yet.\" Other parties expected to win seats are: GroenLinks (Green left), the Socialist Party and the Labour (PVDA), led by Deputy Prime Minister Lodewijk Asscher. The vote was widely seen as a test of just how far populist sentiment has spread across Europe, in the wake of US President Donald Trump's victory and the Brexit referendum vote in the UK. Controversial anti-immigrant, anti-European Union figure Wilders had run on a \"de-Islamification\" platform, calling for Islamic schools to be closed and the Quran and burqa to be banned. The Dutch general election has resulted in a fragmented parliament, with no party securing a majority. The VVD, led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, won 33 seats, while the three-way tie for second place included PVV with 20 seats, CDA with 19 seats, and D66 with 19 seats.\n\nThe outcome is a significant victory for Geert Wilders, who has long been a controversial figure in Dutch politics. His party's gains are seen as a reflection of growing anti-immigrant and anti-establishment sentiment in the country.\n\nWilders' PVV campaigned on a platform that included a promise to ban the Quran and burqa, as well as to close Islamic schools. His party's success has raised concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Europe, and has sparked debate about the role of Islam in Dutch society.\n\nThe election was also seen as a test of the impact of the Trump presidency and the Brexit referendum on European politics. Wilders has been a vocal supporter of Trump, and has praised his policies on immigration and trade.\n\nOther parties that won seats in the election include GroenLinks, which won 14 seats, and the Socialist Party, which won 6 seats. The Labour Party, led by Deputy Prime Minister Lodewijk Asscher, won 5 seats.\n\nThe fragmented parliament is likely to lead to a period of coalition-building, as parties try to form a government. Rutte has indicated that he is willing to work with other parties to form a government, but has ruled out working with Wilders' PVV.\n\nThe outcome of the election has been met with widespread criticism from human rights groups and other organizations that advocate for tolerance and inclusivity. The European Union has also expressed concerns about the rise of far-right nationalism in Europe.\n\nIn a statement, the EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said that the election result \"is a reminder of the importance of standing together against xenophobia, racism and discrimination.\" She also emphasized the need for European countries to work together to address the challenges facing the continent.\n\nThe Dutch election is just the latest in a series of elections across Europe that have seen the rise of far-right and nationalist parties.

The stolen information was then used to send spam emails and steal personal information, including login credentials and credit card numbers.\n\nThe hack was particularly significant because it targeted high-profile individuals, including Russian journalists, government officials and private-sector employees.

The meeting included a handful of conservative senators who have expressed deep concerns with the bill. According to multiple aides, Vice President Mike Pence made a short visit to the closed-door briefing with lawmakers. Another senior Republican aide to a senator in the room said that the White House is \"definitely looking at pretty big changes to the Ryan bill.\" \"There is no possible way a bill can be drafted by an individual or a handful of people and shoved down the throats of 535 people.

One of the senators who attended, Ted Cruz of Texas, said talks are \"productive.\" \"The conversations continue to be productive and they're moving forward well. The conversations are ongoing with the White House, the administration and the House and the Senate,\" Cruz said Wednesday. \"The House has a current bill that personally I don't think gets the job done.

The administration is also looking at ways to address the concerns of moderate Republicans, who have expressed concerns about the bill's impact on pre-existing conditions and the ability of people to purchase insurance across state lines.\n\nDespite the challenges, lawmakers remain optimistic that a deal can be reached. \"I think we're making progress,\" said Senator John McCain of Arizona, who attended the meeting. \"We're having a good discussion, and I think we're getting closer to a solution.\"\n\nThe White House has set a deadline of September 30th to pass a bill, and lawmakers are working to meet that deadline.

Voter turnout was 81%, according to state broadcaster NOS, the highest in three decades. With 94% of the vote counted, Rutte's VVD party is projected to win 33 seats out of a total 150, ahead of Wilder's PVV party which won 20 seats, only one more than the mainstream Christian Democratic Appeal and D66 parties. Despite the celebrations, Rutte's party won eight fewer seats than in the 2012 vote, when it claimed 41. The election was widely seen as a test of populist right-wing sentiment in Europe, ahead of the French Presidential election in April and the German national vote in September. Wilders, who is staunchly against mass immigration and the European Union, made a defiant speech Wednesday night claiming he was \"part of the winners.\" claiming that his party's 20 seats was a significant achievement, considering they had not held any seats in the previous parliament. \"We have taken a big step forward tonight,\" Wilders said, adding that his party's message of limiting immigration and reducing the influence of the EU had resonated with many voters.\n\nDespite the mixed results, Rutte's victory was seen as a blow to populist forces in Europe, with many analysts interpreting the outcome as a rejection of Wilders' anti-immigrant and anti-EU rhetoric. \"This is a clear message to all those who want to divide us, who want to play on our fears,\" Rutte said, in a clear reference to Wilders and his PVV party.\n\nThe outcome of the election also has significant implications for the future of the Dutch government.

At the time of his nomination, Obama issued a blanket statement describing him and six other nominees to US District Courts as qualified and ready to serve. \"These individuals have demonstrated the talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness Americans expect and deserve from their judicial system,\" Obama said at the time. Here is the completed news article:\n\nIn a 43-page ruling, US District Court Judge Derrick Watson issued a scathing rebuke just hours before Trump's revised travel ban was to go into effect Thursday. \"The illogic of the Government's contentions is palpable,\" he said of the ban, which would have temporarily barred travelers from six Muslim countries from entering the United States.\n\nWatson's ruling came after he heard Hawaii's case against the revised ban.

At the time of his nomination, Obama issued a blanket statement describing him and six other nominees to US District Courts as qualified and ready to serve. \"These individuals have demonstrated the talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness Americans expect and deserve from their judicial system,\" Obama said at the time.\n\nHe has a strong background in public service: Before becoming a judge, Watson served as a state representative in Hawaii from 1994 to 2002. He was also the state's Deputy Attorney General from 2002 to 2006.\n\nHe's a Hawaii native: Watson was born and raised in Hawaii, and he has deep roots in the state's legal community. He graduated from the University of Hawaii's William S. Richardson School of Law and began his legal career as a lawyer in private practice.\n\nHe's been a judge since 2012: Watson was confirmed by the Senate in 2012 and has been serving as a US District Court judge for the District of Hawaii ever since. He has presided over a wide range of cases, including civil disputes, criminal trials, and immigration cases.\n\nHe's not afraid to speak his mind: Watson's ruling against the revised travel ban was just the latest example of his willingness to stand up for what he believes is right. In his ruling, he criticized the government's argument that the ban was necessary to protect national security, saying that it was based on \"a flawed record\" and \"a flawed methodology.\" He also took issue with the government's assertion that the ban was necessary to prevent terrorism, saying that it was based on \"a flawed understanding\" of the evidence.",

        "Text": "The 297-foot (90.6 meter) MS Caledonian Sky crashed into the reefs at Raja Ampat on March 4. Raja Ampat is frequently included on lists of the the world's most beautiful coral reefs and is often described as an \"untouched\" beach paradise. \"The destruction of Raja Ampat coral reefs, which were developed by nature for hundreds of years, was done in less than one day by Caledonian Sky and its captain,\" Djoko Hartoyo, of the Information and Law Bureau of the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs, said in a statement. \"It is simply impossible to restore that part of Raja Ampat. Fish that were normally seen in that particular area were all gone.\" Nearly 140,000 square feet (more than 13,000 square meters) of reef were destroyed, Ketut Putra, the vice president of Conservation International Indonesia, told CNN. The ship crashed into one of the best diving areas, he said. Noble Caledonia, the cruise company that operates the vessel, apologized for the incident. It said in a statement that the ship went aground, but did not give a reason why. The incident has sparked widespread outrage and concern among marine conservationists and local communities. Raja Ampat is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to an incredible array of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 600 species of coral, and many other creatures.\n\nThe destruction of the reef has also had a significant impact on the local fishing industry, with many fishermen reporting a significant decline in their catch. The reef was also a popular destination for tourists, with many scuba diving and snorkeling trips being offered to the area.\n\nConservation International Indonesia has called for an investigation into the incident and is urging the government to take action to protect the remaining coral reefs in the area. The organization is also working with local communities to develop sustainable tourism practices that can help to support the conservation of the reef.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the safety of cruise ships and the measures that are in place to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. The captain of the Caledonian Sky has been criticized for his role in the incident, with some calling for him to be held accountable.\n\nThe Indonesian government has promised to take action to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The country's Minister of Maritime Affairs, Luhut Pandjaitan, has said that the government will work to improve safety measures and to increase awareness among cruise ship operators about the importance of protecting the country's marine environment.\n\nThe incident is a reminder of the importance of protecting our oceans and the marine life that call them home. It is also a reminder of the need for greater cooperation and coordination between governments, conservation organizations, and the private sector to protect the world's most vulnerable ecosystems.",

Kim was at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on his way to Macau when two women wiped his face with the highly lethal VX nerve agent, killing him in 20 minutes, Malaysian police said. Both South Korea and Malaysia accuse Pyongyang of killing Kim. North Korea strongly denies the allegation. Malaysian authorities didn't publicly identify Kim's body until last week after obtaining a DNA sample \"from the child of the deceased,\" Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Wednesday. The investigation into Kim's death has been ongoing for several weeks, with Malaysian authorities working closely with South Korean and North Korean officials to gather evidence and piece together the events surrounding the assassination.\n\nDespite the lack of a public identification of the body, Malaysian authorities were able to obtain a DNA sample from the child of the deceased, which was used to confirm the identity of the victim.\n\nThe two women suspected of carrying out the assassination, who were identified as Siti Aisyah and Siti Fatima, were arrested at the airport and are currently being held for questioning.\n\nAccording to Malaysian police, the women were part of a group of 11 people who were hired to carry out the assassination, and were paid a total of $100,000 to complete the task.\n\nThe motive behind the assassination is still unclear, but it is believed that Kim was killed due to his involvement in a plot to overthrow North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe assassination has sent shockwaves throughout the region, and has raised concerns about the potential for further violence and instability in the region.\n\nIn the aftermath of the assassination, North Korea has been criticized for its handling of the situation, with many accusing the country of trying to cover up the truth about Kim's death.\n\nThe United States has also weighed in on the situation, with Secretary of State John Kerry condemning the assassination and calling for a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Kim's death.\n\nAs the investigation continues, it remains to be seen what further information will come to light, and what the consequences will be for those involved in the assassination.",

        "Text": "A group of dairy drivers argued that they deserved overtime pay for certain tasks they had completed. The company said they did not. An appeals court sided with the drivers, saying that the guidelines themselves were made too ambiguous by, you guessed it, a lack of an Oxford comma. This is what the law says about activities that do NOT merit overtime pay. Pay attention to the first sentence: The canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of: (1) Agricultural produce; (2) Meat and fish products; and (3) Perishable foods. That's a lot of things! But if we're getting picky, is packing for shipment its own activity, or does it only apply to the rest of that clause, i.e. i.e., to the agricultural produce, meat and fish products, and perishable foods listed in the preceding clauses? The drivers' union argued that \"packing for shipment\" was a distinct activity that required separate consideration, and that the lack of an Oxford comma made the sentence unclear.\n\nThe appeals court agreed, stating that the ambiguity was a result of the company's failure to include the Oxford comma, which would have clarified the intended meaning of the sentence. Without it, the sentence could be read as either \"packing for shipment or distribution\" or \"packing for shipment, or distribution.\"\n\nThe court ruled that the drivers' union was correct in their interpretation, and that the drivers were entitled to overtime pay for the task of packing for shipment. The company was ordered to reclassify the drivers' work and provide the necessary compensation.\n\nThe decision has sent shockwaves through the dairy industry, with many companies re-examining their overtime policies in light of the ruling. The Oxford comma, once a subject of grammatical debate, has emerged as a key factor in determining the rights of workers. As one lawyer involved in the case noted, \"This ruling highlights the importance of clarity in language, particularly in legal documents. The Oxford comma may seem like a minor issue, but in this case, it made all the difference.\"",

        "Text": "The paper's authors warn that the resilience of the planet's largest living structure is waning rapidly. Data from a series of aerial and underwater surveys shows that a heatwave in summer 2016, which saw sea temperatures in Australia reach record levels, triggered the most damaging and widespread coral bleaching event on record. Almost 50% of the reef is now \"extremely\" bleached and 91% shows at least some signs of bleaching, Sean Connolly, program leader of a government-funded coral reef center at James Cook University, Queensland and the paper's co-author told CNN. \"Coral cover [on the Great Barrier Reef] has halved over the last 27 years,\" Connolly said. The devastating impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef is not limited to the recent coral bleaching event. According to the study, the reef's overall health has been declining steadily over the past three decades.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from a network of underwater cameras and monitoring stations to track changes in the reef's coral cover, sea grass, and fish populations. The results are stark: the study found that the reef's coral cover has declined by 50% since 1990, with some areas experiencing losses of up to 90%.\n\n\"This is a catastrophic decline,\" said Dr. Terry Hughes, a co-author of the study and a professor at James Cook University. \"We're not just talking about a decline in coral cover, we're talking about a collapse of the reef's ecosystem.\"\n\nThe study's findings are particularly concerning given the reef's importance to the Australian economy and the global environment. The Great Barrier Reef is not only one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet, but it also provides a vital source of income for thousands of people through tourism and fishing.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the reef, including the establishment of marine protected areas and the development of more sustainable fishing practices. However, experts say that more needs to be done to address the root cause of the problem: climate change.\n\n\"We need to take immediate action to reduce our carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources,\" said Connolly. \"If we don't, we risk losing this incredible ecosystem forever.\"\n\nThe study's authors are calling on world leaders to take urgent action to address the crisis facing the Great Barrier Reef. They are urging governments to set aside differences and work together to develop a global plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the world's most vulnerable ecosystems.\n\n\"The fate of the Great Barrier Reef is a global issue,\" said Hughes. \"It's a wake-up call for all of us to take action to protect our planet's most precious natural resources.\"",

So we have 20 years of a failed approach,\" Tillerson said at a news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. China will formally present its own proposal to Tillerson on Saturday, a senior Chinese diplomat told CNN Thursday. The Chinese plan calls for North Korea to suspend its ballistic missile tests and nuclear activities, and for the United States and South Korea to halt large-scale military exercises that annually antagonize Pyongyang. \"(North Korea) would like to see the Americans move first and take some actions first to show their sincerity, and vice versa,\" Xiao Qian, the director general of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN in an exclusive interview. \"So China's proposal is, why not do these things at the same time?\" This is the second time in as many weeks that China has floated this plan. A similar proposal by Foreign Minister Wang Yi was rejected by the US State Department last week. \"There's no equivalence between North Korea's illegal missile and nuclear activities and what is our lawful, longstanding joint security exercises with our allies in the region,\" said Mark Toner, the acting State Department spokesman, in response to Wang's initial pitch. The Chinese proposal has been met with skepticism by the Trump administration, which has maintained that North Korea must take concrete steps towards denuclearization before any easing of sanctions or military exercises.\n\nTillerson's comments in Tokyo suggest that the US is not willing to compromise on its demands, and that it will not be swayed by China's proposal. \"We're not going to negotiate with North Korea from a position of weakness,\" Tillerson said. \"We're going to stand firm on our principles and our values, and we're going to work with our allies to achieve a common goal.\"\n\nThe US has been pushing for a complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, and has been demanding that Pyongyang take steps to dismantle its nuclear program before any concessions are made.\n\nThe situation on the Korean peninsula remains tense, with North Korea continuing to test ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, and the US and South Korea conducting joint military exercises. The UN has imposed tough sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear program, and the US has been pushing for further sanctions to be imposed.\n\nThe Chinese proposal has been seen as an attempt by Beijing to play a more active role in resolving the crisis, and to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula. However, it remains to be seen whether the US will be willing to engage with China's proposal, or whether the situation will continue to escalate.",

In footage, which will be shown as part of a documentary in France, Loeuillet played down the systematic murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust. \"I don't think there were that many deaths,\" he said. \"There weren't six million\". In a statement on his Facebook page, Loeuillet denied the allegations and said he would take legal action against the journalists involved. French law strictly prohibits Holocaust denial. The suspension of Loeuillet comes as a shock to many in the region, particularly the Jewish community, who have been vocal in their condemnation of his comments. The National Front, the party Loeuillet represents, has also distanced itself from his remarks, stating that they do not reflect the party's official stance on the Holocaust.\n\nThe documentary, which is set to air on French television next week, features footage of Loeuillet making his comments at a private gathering. The event was secretly recorded by a group of journalists who were investigating anti-Semitic activity in the region.\n\nLoeuillet's denial of the Holocaust has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for his immediate expulsion from the National Front. The French government has also weighed in, with a spokesperson stating that \"Holocaust denial is a serious offense and will not be tolerated in our country.\"\n\nThe suspension of Loeuillet is seen as a significant blow to the National Front, which has been struggling to distance itself from its extremist past. The party's leader, Marine Le Pen, has been working to rebrand the party as a mainstream force in French politics, but comments like Loeuillet's have undermined her efforts.\n\nThe Jewish community in France has also spoken out against Loeuillet's comments, with the head of the Jewish Community of France, Jonathan Levy, stating that \"the Holocaust is a historical fact and any attempt to deny it is an affront to the memory of the six million Jews who were murdered during World War II.\"\n\nLoeuillet's suspension is likely to be the first of many consequences for his actions. The National Front is expected to hold an emergency meeting to discuss his fate, and there are already calls for him to be expelled from the party. Loeuillet's legal action against the journalists who recorded him is also expected to be closely watched, with many arguing that his comments were a serious offense that warrants punishment.",

He did not apologize to the British government after it said that the report of UK surveillance was \"ridiculous.\" Turning to Merkel, who was angry to find out after leaks by Edward Snowden that the US National Security Agency had tapped her phone, Trump said \"at least we have something in common\". Trump appeared to be irritated to be asked the question by the German reporter, in the latest twist of a two-week controversy ignited by early morning tweets by the President that claimed that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps against him last year. The President's remarks drew a mixture of laughter and gasps from the assembled journalists, and the atmosphere in the room became increasingly tense. Merkel, who was seated next to Trump, remained expressionless, her eyes fixed on the President.\n\nTrump continued to deflect the question, saying \"I think it's very sad what's going on with the wiretapping. I think it's a very, very serious situation. And I think it's something that we're going to get to the bottom of, believe me.\"\n\nWhen pressed further by the reporter, Trump claimed that he had \"never even seen\" the Fox News report, and that it was \"just a rumor\" that had been spread by his opponents. He also denied that his administration had used the GCHQ to wiretap Trump Tower, saying that it was \"not possible\" for the British government to have done so without his knowledge.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a heated debate in Washington, with many lawmakers calling for an investigation into the President's claims. The White House has so far refused to provide any evidence to support Trump's allegations, and the British government has reiterated its denial of any involvement in wiretapping Trump Tower.\n\nThe President's remarks also drew criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accused him of trying to distract from the real issue at hand. \"This is just another example of the President's attempt to divert attention from his own scandals,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer. \"We need to focus on the facts, not the President's conspiracy theories.\"\n\nThe controversy has also sparked a diplomatic row between the US and the UK, with many British lawmakers calling for an explanation from the Trump administration. The British government has issued a statement saying that it \"categorically\" denies any involvement in wiretapping Trump Tower, and has called on the US to provide evidence to support its claims.\n\nThe President's remarks have also sparked a backlash on social media, with many people calling for the President to apologize for his comments. \"Trump's attempt to downplay the wiretapping scandal is just another example of his lack of accountability,\" said Twitter user @JenKlein. \"He needs to take responsibility for his actions and apologize to the British government.\"\n\nThe controversy is expected to continue to dominate the headlines in the coming days, as lawmakers and the public demand answers from the President and his administration.",

McMaster spoke with his British counterpart on Thursday about press secretary Sean Spicer's comment from the White House podium about a Fox News report that said British intelligence helped wiretap Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, a White House official said Friday. The official described the conversation as \"cordial\" where McMaster described Spicer's comment as \"unintentional.\" McMaster also told his counterpart that \"their concerns were understood and heard and it would be relayed to the White House.\" The official said there were \"at least two calls\" from British officials on Thursday and that the British ambassador to the United States called Spicer to discuss the comment. \"Sean was pointing to the breadth of reporting, not endorsing any specific story,\" the official said. A senior administration official told CNN that Spicer and McMaster offered what amounted to an apology to the British government. White House officials later told CNN that it was British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May, who \"expressed their concerns to Sean Spicer and Gen. McMaster\" in two separate conversations on Thursday. The controversy surrounding Spicer's comment comes as the Trump administration is facing growing scrutiny over its relationship with the British government. The White House has been accused of leaking sensitive information to the press, and the comment about British intelligence wiretapping Trump Tower has raised concerns about the administration's trustworthiness.\n\nThe British government has been tight-lipped about the matter, but sources close to the situation say that the UK is \"disappointed\" with the White House's handling of the issue. \"We take the security of our allies very seriously, and we expect the same level of professionalism from our partners,\" said a senior British official.\n\nThe incident has also sparked concerns about the Trump administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. Critics argue that the administration's willingness to make unfounded claims and accusations without evidence undermines the credibility of the White House and erodes trust in the government.\n\nThe controversy has also raised questions about the role of Fox News in perpetuating false information. The network has been accused of promoting conspiracy theories and misinformation, and the incident has sparked calls for greater scrutiny of the network's reporting.\n\nIn the aftermath of the controversy, the White House has announced that it will be conducting an internal review of Spicer's comments and the administration's handling of the situation. The review is expected to be completed within the next week.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration is facing growing pressure to provide clear and concise information about the situation. The administration has been accused of being opaque and evasive, and the incident has sparked calls for greater transparency and accountability.\n\nAs the controversy continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the Trump administration will respond to the growing criticism and what steps it will take to restore trust in the government. One thing is clear, however: the incident has highlighted the importance of accuracy and truthfulness in government communications, and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the White House.",

But during an appearance on CNN's Erin Burnett \"Outfront,\" Santorum warned that Trump's insistence on standing by his wiretap allegations poses a problem for the President. \"We're not in an election anymore, and it's not his opponent he's throwing off,\" Santorum said. \"I think it's him that he's throwing off.\" Santorum's comments came as Trump continues to insist that President Barack Obama had his phones wiretapped at Trump Tower during the 2016 election, despite a lack of evidence to support the claim. The President has also tweeted that Obama was behind a \"Nixon/Watergate\" style conspiracy, which has been widely criticized by lawmakers from both parties.\n\nSantorum, a former presidential candidate himself, said that Trump's fixation on the wiretap allegations is not only hurting his own reputation but also undermining the public's trust in the government. \"When the President of the United States makes a claim like that, it's not just a political issue, it's a national security issue,\" Santorum said. \"And when he can't provide any evidence to back it up, it's a problem for the country.\"\n\nThe former senator also expressed concern that Trump's behavior is creating a sense of chaos and unpredictability in Washington, which is making it difficult for lawmakers to do their jobs. \"I think the President needs to take a step back and think about the consequences of his actions,\" Santorum said. \"He's not just hurting himself, he's hurting the country.\"\n\nSantorum's comments were met with applause from the audience and nods of agreement from Burnett, who has been critical of Trump's behavior in the past. The exchange highlighted the growing concern among some Republicans that Trump's behavior is becoming increasingly erratic and damaging to the country.",

        "Text": "Speaking in Seoul at a joint press conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, Tillerson said Washington's policy of \"strategic patience\" had ended. \"Certainly, we do not want things to get to a military conflict ... but obviously, if North Korea takes actions that threatens the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response,\" he said, in response to a question from CNN. \"If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe that requires action, that option is on the table,\" Tillerson added. Later Friday morning, President Donald Trump denounced North Korea, tweeting, \"North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!\" Tillerson's remarks come at a time when the US intelligence community and the Defense Department are increasingly anticipating that North Korea will soon undertake a new round of testing of its missile and nuclear program, half a dozen US officials have told CNN. According to US officials, North Korea has been preparing for a new round of nuclear and missile tests, which could potentially include the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland. The tests are expected to be a major escalation of the regime's weapons program, which has been the subject of increasing international concern in recent months.\n\nThe US has been warning North Korea against taking such actions, but Pyongyang has shown no signs of backing down. In recent weeks, North Korea has launched several ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, and has threatened to conduct a \"seventh nuclear test\" if the US and South Korea continue to conduct joint military exercises.\n\nThe situation has sparked concerns among US allies in the region, including Japan and South Korea, which are both vulnerable to North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. The US has been working closely with these countries to develop a unified response to the crisis, and has been pressing China to do more to rein in North Korea's behavior.\n\nChina, which is North Korea's largest trading partner and only major ally, has been criticized for not doing enough to curb the regime's nuclear and missile programs. In recent weeks, the US has imposed new sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals who have done business with North Korea, in an effort to pressure Beijing into taking a tougher stance.\n\nThe situation is also raising concerns about the potential for conflict on the Korean Peninsula. The US and South Korea have been conducting joint military exercises, which North Korea sees as a threat to its security. The exercises have been ongoing for several weeks, and are expected to continue until the end of the month.\n\nThe US has a significant military presence in South Korea, and has been working closely with the South Korean military to develop a plan for responding to any potential North Korean aggression. The plan, which is known as the \"Korean War Operational Plan,\" calls for a swift and decisive response to any North Korean attack, and includes the use of US and South Korean military forces to defend against any North Korean aggression.\n\nDespite the tensions, there are still hopes for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. The US and North Korea have been engaged in talks in recent weeks, and there are reports that the two sides are making progress on some issues. However, it remains to be seen whether these talks will be successful in preventing a major escalation of the crisis.",

        "Text": "Even now, as bipartisan agreement has emerged that no such thing happened, Trump has dug in, leaving Trump aides and allies fumbling for excuses and explanations -- like that spying microwaves are apparently a thing, according to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a Friday news conference, Trump showed that he was not ready to quit the wiretapping story, giving it another boost, even if it meant embarrassing a world leader. Many people are saying -- that Trump drives conspiracies and gossip \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" Trump said, gesturing to Merkel, whose phone was once tapped by the National Security Agency. Trump's embrace of conspiracy theories is, of course, not new. Despite the lack of evidence to support his claims, Trump continued to push the wiretapping conspiracy theory, claiming that he had \"something in common\" with Merkel because her phone had been tapped by the NSA. The comment was met with awkward silence from Merkel, who looked uncomfortable and seemed to try to change the subject.\n\nThe White House's explanation for Trump's continued push on the issue was that he was simply \"raising awareness\" about the importance of national security and the need to protect Americans' privacy. But many critics saw it as a thinly veiled attempt to distract from the ongoing investigations into his campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats and some Republicans in Congress are calling for Trump to apologize for spreading misinformation and to focus on more pressing issues, such as the country's healthcare system and the economy.\n\nThe controversy has also sparked a renewed debate about the dangers of conspiracy theories and the importance of fact-checking in politics. Many experts are warning that Trump's continued embrace of these theories could have serious consequences for the country's ability to address real issues and build trust with foreign leaders.\n\nIn related news, the FBI has released a statement confirming that it has found no evidence to support Trump's claims of wiretapping, and that any claims of such activity are \"without merit.\" The agency also reiterated its commitment to conducting thorough and impartial investigations into any allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nDespite the mounting criticism, Trump showed no signs of backing down, instead using his Twitter account to continue pushing the conspiracy theory and attacking his critics. The episode has once again raised questions about Trump's fitness for office and his ability to lead the country in a responsible and truthful manner.",

When asked if the DOJ's documents would confirm Trump's as of yet wholly unsubstantiated allegations, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes told CNN, \"I don't think so\" as he walked into a room to read the report. Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said he was \"absolutely confident\" the DOJ report would not back up Trump's allegation. According to the sources, the classified report from the Department of Justice (DOJ) is expected to reveal new information about the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential election. The report is said to be a comprehensive summary of the investigation into Russian interference in the election, and it is expected to shed light on the extent of any potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nThe sources described the report as \"damning\" and said it would likely be a significant blow to the Trump administration's claims of no collusion. The report is expected to detail numerous instances of communication between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives, as well as evidence of attempts to conceal those communications.\n\nThe report's findings are expected to be made public in the coming days, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are bracing for a major showdown over the document's contents. The White House has refused to comment on the report, but sources close to the administration say that Trump is growing increasingly anxious about the potential fallout.\n\nThe tension on Capitol Hill was palpable as lawmakers prepared to receive the report.

Ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, was more skeptical, saying that he was \"absolutely confident\" that the report would not back up Trump's allegations of no collusion.\n\nThe report's release comes as the Trump administration is facing growing scrutiny over its handling of the investigation. The White House has faced criticism for its efforts to discredit the investigation and its findings, and the report's release is expected to further inflame tensions on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn the meantime, lawmakers are gearing up for a heated debate over the report's contents. The report is expected to be the subject of intense scrutiny, with lawmakers from both parties vying for control of the narrative. The White House, meanwhile, is bracing for a major public relations battle, as it attempts to spin the report's findings to its advantage.\n\nAs the drama unfolds, one thing is clear: the report's release will be a major turning point in the investigation, and its findings will have far-reaching implications for the Trump administration and the country as a whole.",

The attacker was known to police and intelligence services, and was involved in a shooting at a police traffic stop north of Paris that morning, Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux said at a news conference. He fled the scene. A police officer injured in that incident is undergoing treatment, he said. At the airport, the attacker tried to tackle the soldier and grab her weapon, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. He was shot dead by two of the soldier's colleagues. The incident occurred at Orly Airport, a major international hub located 13 miles south of Paris, during a morning flight arrival. The airport was evacuated and flights were grounded as a precautionary measure, causing disruptions to travel plans for thousands of passengers.\n\nThe attacker, identified as Zied Ben Belgacem, 39, was a French national of Tunisian descent who had a history of radicalization and had been previously flagged by intelligence agencies. According to sources, Belgacem had been radicalized by ISIS propaganda and had attempted to travel to Syria to join the terrorist group.\n\nFrench President François Hollande condemned the attack, calling it a \"terrorist act\" and vowing to do everything in his power to ensure the safety and security of the French people. The incident has raised concerns about the threat of terrorism in France, which has been on high alert since the November 2015 attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other locations in Paris.\n\nThe airport has since reopened, and investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of the attacker's connections to terrorist organizations and whether he was acting alone or as part of a larger plot. The French government has also increased security measures at all airports and transportation hubs across the country.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, tributes have poured in for the soldier who shot the attacker, with many praising her bravery and quick thinking in preventing a potentially catastrophic outcome. The injured police officer is expected to make a full recovery, and the nation is coming together to mourn the loss of life and condemn the senseless act of violence.",

Baratov wrote he was suspended from high school for \"threatening to kill my ex-friend as a joke.\" \"At first, I felt really upset as I have never got into trouble before,\" he wrote. \"But the time off allowed me to work on my online projects 24/7, and really move(d) my business to the next level.\" Baratov's social media showed a thrill seeker finding ways to entertain himself in the posh community of Ancaster, about an hour outside of Toronto. The Kazakh native describes being able to afford a BMW 7 Series while still in high school and to pay off the mortgage on his first house. \"By the time my suspension was done, I changed my whole life plan!\" wrote Baratov, now 22. It's unclear, though, the exact nature of Baratov's online work. Amedeo DiCarlo, a Toronto attorney, referred to his client as an \"entrepreneur.\" He wouldn't elaborate on the kind of work Baratov did, or how he was able to afford his lavish lifestyle. But federal prosecutors in Northern California have laid out how they believe the Canadian made at least some of his money. They say he was a hacker who worked with three other people -- including two Russian intelligence officers -- to get names, email addresses and passwords from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts. According to court documents, Baratov's hacking scheme began in 2014 and continued until 2017. He and his co-conspirators allegedly used sophisticated techniques to gain access to Yahoo's database, including spear-phishing emails and malware attacks. Once they had access, they stole sensitive information, including names, email addresses, and passwords, which they then sold on the dark web.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Baratov and his co-conspirators made millions of dollars from their illegal activities, with Baratov himself earning a significant share. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have been working to track down the hackers and bring them to justice.\n\nBaratov's arrest and indictment have sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity community, with many experts expressing concern about the ease with which hackers can steal sensitive information. \"This is a wake-up call for all of us,\" said cybersecurity expert, John Smith. \"We need to be more vigilant and take steps to protect our personal information.\"\n\nThe case against Baratov is expected to go to trial later this year. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. His co-conspirators are also facing charges and could face similar penalties.\n\nIn the meantime, the FBI is urging anyone who may have been affected by the hack to take steps to protect their personal information. \"We are working to identify and notify all affected individuals,\" said FBI spokesperson, Jane Doe. \"But we also urge everyone to take steps to protect their personal information, including changing passwords and monitoring their accounts for suspicious activity.\"",

Ukrainian officials said the US has not responded to those requests. Under a \"mutual legal assistance\" treaty, the two countries have agreed to regularly assist each other in law enforcement efforts, such as gathering statements and other evidence for prosecutions. US authorities confirmed to CNN that the requests were received but declined further comment. Manafort served as Trump's campaign chief until being pushed out in August 2016. The official requests from a special prosecution unit in Kiev started in December 2014, and involve a corruption case targeting Ukraine's former Justice Minister Oleksandr Lavrynovych. Manafort has not been charged with a crime. Prosecutors want him to testify, Ukraine's prosecutor for special investigations Serhiy Gorbatyuk said. Prosecutors allege that Lavrynovych illegally diverted more than $1 million in government funds to a prominent New York City law firm \"?Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Lavrynovych had hired Skadden to review the 2011 jailing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who had received a seven-year sentence for allegedly harming Ukraine's interests in gas supply negotiations with Russia. The Ukrainian prosecutors' efforts to question Manafort come as a surprise to many, given the former campaign manager's close ties to the Trump administration. Trump has been a vocal supporter of Manafort, and the two have been spotted together on several occasions.\n\nThe requests for assistance were made through official channels, including the FBI and the US Department of Justice. However, Ukrainian officials say they have received no response to their requests.\n\n\"This is a clear violation of our treaty obligations,\" said Serhiy Gorbatyuk, Ukraine's prosecutor for special investigations. \"We are seeking to cooperate with the US authorities to gather evidence and statements from Mr. Manafort, but they are not responding to our requests.\"\n\nThe case against Lavrynovych, Ukraine's former Justice Minister, is seen as a major corruption scandal in Ukraine. Prosecutors allege that he illegally diverted government funds to the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which was hired to review the jailing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nTymoshenko, a political rival of Ukraine's current President Petro Poroshenko, was jailed in 2011 for allegedly harming Ukraine's interests in gas supply negotiations with Russia. The case was widely seen as politically motivated, and Tymoshenko's imprisonment sparked widespread protests and international condemnation.\n\nManafort's ties to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom are of particular interest to Ukrainian prosecutors. The law firm's report on Tymoshenko's jailing was widely criticized as a whitewash, and Manafort's role in promoting the report has been questioned.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has been pushing for a thorough investigation into the case, and the non-response from US authorities is seen as a major setback.\n\n\"This is a clear example of the US authorities not taking corruption seriously,\" said Gorbatyuk. \"We will continue to seek justice and hold those responsible accountable, regardless of their connections to the US government.\"\n\nThe case has sparked widespread debate in Ukraine, with many calling for a full investigation into the corruption allegations. The Ukrainian government has promised to release more information about the case in the coming days.",

That means 30 feet tall, although the officials wrote that \"designs with heights of at least 18 feet may be acceptable.\" The wall must also be impossible to climb without a ladder, and should make it difficult to use \"common and more sophisticated climbing aids,\" like grappling hooks.

The wall must also be designed to withstand extreme weather conditions, including high winds, heavy rainfall, and extreme temperatures.\n\nThe bidding process is expected to attract contractors from across the country, with the government estimating that the project will require a total of 20 million linear feet of wall construction. The project is expected to take several years to complete, with the first phase of construction expected to begin in the coming months.\n\nThe announcement comes as tensions between the US and Mexico continue to escalate over the issue of immigration and border security. President Trump has long been a proponent of building a wall along the US-Mexico border, and has repeatedly stated that Mexico will pay for the project. However, Mexico has repeatedly refused to pay for the wall, and the US government has announced plans to fund the project through a combination of federal funding and private donations.\n\nThe release of the requirements for the wall has sparked controversy among some lawmakers and civil rights groups, who argue that the project is unnecessary and will disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color. Others have expressed concerns about the environmental impact of the project, as well as the potential for the wall to be used as a symbol of division and xenophobia.\n\nDespite the controversy, the government is moving forward with the project, with officials stating that they are committed to building a wall that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. The government is expected to release additional information about the project in the coming weeks, including details about the bidding process and the timeline for construction.",

        "Text": "The statement from the Secret Service came after a source told CNN earlier Friday about the length of the incident and the agency's resulting investigation. In its statement Friday afternoon, the Secret Service offered some information about the incident and said the \"investigation is ongoing,\" so far including more than 50 interviews and a review of radio transmissions and video footage. The review found that the intruder climbed a five-foot fence and an eight-foot gate and then hopped a three-and-a-half foot fence while Secret Service members struggled to locate him. House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday that the intruder even managed to rattle a door handle at the South Portico entrance to the White House, although he did not make it inside. \"That's why we spend billions of dollars on personnel and dogs and technologies and fences and undercover people and video surveillance,\" the Utah Republican said. \"And yet the person is able to get up close to the White House and spend 17 minutes before he's apprehended. That's unbelievable.\" The Secret Service statement added that \"immediate steps\" had been taken, including \"additional posts, technology enhancements, and response protocols.\" \"The men and women of the Secret Service are extremely disappointed and angry in how the events of March 10 transpired,\" the statement said. The source explained to CNN earlier Friday that the intruder, Jonathan Tran, set off several alarms, but was able to avoid other sensors. The source said \"the response to the alarm was lacking, and found (the suspect) vulnerabilities in the system.\" The Secret Service has faced criticism in the past for its handling of security breaches, and this incident is likely to raise further questions about the agency's effectiveness. The fact that the intruder was able to spend 17 minutes on the White House grounds before being apprehended has sparked concerns about the adequacy of the security measures in place.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the background and motivations of the intruder, Jonathan Tran. According to the Secret Service, Tran is a 26-year-old man from California who has no known ties to any terrorist organizations or extremist groups. However, officials have not yet released any information about Tran's mental health or any potential political or ideological motivations for the incident.\n\nThe Secret Service has launched an internal investigation into the incident, and officials have promised to take immediate steps to improve security at the White House. The agency has also notified Congress about the incident and has pledged to provide regular updates on the investigation.\n\nThe incident has also sparked a debate about the need for further security measures at the White House. Some lawmakers have called for the installation of additional fencing and barriers around the White House, while others have suggested that the Secret Service should be given more resources and personnel to improve its response to security breaches.\n\nThe Secret Service has been responsible for protecting the White House and its occupants since 1902, and the agency has a reputation for being one of the most elite and effective law enforcement agencies in the world. However, the agency has faced criticism in the past for its handling of security breaches, and this incident is likely to raise further questions about its effectiveness.\n\nIn the meantime, the Secret Service is working to improve its security protocols and to ensure that the White House is safe and secure for the President and his family. The agency is also working to identify and prosecute those responsible for the incident, and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.",

Tillerson's statements are not as radical as they seem, but there is still no visible coherent strategy for the region. \"Strategic patience\" was the Obama-era policy toward North Korea. \"Strategic patience\" seems similar to \"doing nothing,\" but that is only true in a vacuum. The Trump administration's new approach to North Korea was met with skepticism and concern from many experts, who worry that the lack of a clear strategy could lead to a catastrophic conflict.\n\nTillerson's comments came as tensions on the Korean Peninsula continue to escalate, with North Korea conducting a series of missile tests and the United States and South Korea staging joint military exercises. The North has also threatened to test a nuclear weapon over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDespite the tough rhetoric, many experts believe that a military solution is unlikely to be effective and could even be counterproductive. \"The idea that we can just use military force to solve this problem is a fantasy,\" said John Park, a North Korea expert at the University of Boston. \"It would only lead to a cycle of escalation and could even prompt North Korea to use its weapons.\"\n\nInstead, many experts are calling for a return to diplomatic efforts, such as negotiations and sanctions, to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear program. \"We need to go back to the negotiating table and work with China and other countries to impose real pressure on North Korea,\" said Daniel Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. \"We can't just rely on military force or sanctions alone.\"\n\nThe lack of a clear strategy has also raised concerns about the administration's ability to effectively respond to a crisis on the Korean Peninsula. \"We're not seeing a coherent strategy from the administration, and that's very concerning,\" said Bonnie Glaser, a Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"We need to see a clear plan for how we're going to deal with this crisis and prevent it from escalating further.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the United States and its allies are bracing for the possibility of a military conflict with North Korea. The Pentagon has deployed additional troops and military equipment to the region, and the US Navy has sent an aircraft carrier to the area.\n\nDespite the tensions, many experts believe that a diplomatic solution is still possible, but it will require a concerted effort from the international community. \"We need to work together to find a solution to this crisis,\" said Park. \"It's not just a US problem, it's a global problem, and we need to work together to find a solution.\"",

But its beat and its sensibility were just as deeply rooted in the predominantly white traditions of country blues and western swing. and rock and roll. Chuck Berry's unique blend of styles and genres helped to define the sound of a generation, and his music continues to influence artists to this day.\n\nBerry's rise to fame was meteoric, with his debut single \"Maybellene\" topping the charts in 1955. He went on to release a string of hits, including \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" \"Johnny B. Goode,\" and \"Little Queenie.\" His music was characterized by its driving rhythms, distinctive guitar riffs, and witty, storytelling lyrics.\n\nBerry's impact on popular music was profound. He helped to popularize rock and roll, a genre that had previously been largely confined to the South and urban areas. His music also influenced a wide range of other artists, from The Beatles and The Rolling Stones to Eric Clapton and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nDespite his many achievements, Berry's career was not without its challenges. He faced racism and discrimination throughout his life, and was even arrested and jailed in 1959 for violating the Mann Act, a federal law that prohibited the transportation of women across state lines for \"immoral purposes.\" Berry was accused of transporting a 14-year-old girl across state lines, and was sentenced to three years in prison. He served only 18 months, but the experience had a profound impact on him.\n\nIn the years that followed, Berry continued to tour and record music, but his output slowed significantly. He released his final studio album, \"Chuck,\" in 1989, and continued to perform live until his health began to decline. Berry passed away on March 18, 2017, at the age of 90, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and influence musicians around the world.",

Rodney Hess' video does not show the officers shooting and his relatives asked any witnesses to come forward. Hess was shot after Crockett County sheriff's deputies approached his sport utility vehicle because it was parked at a perpendicular angle along Highway 412 near the west Tennessee town of Alamo, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said in a statement. Officers reported that Hess refused officer commands, made erratic statements and tried to strike officers at least twice with his vehicle, DeVine said. \"During the escalation of events, at least one Crockett County deputy fired his service weapon through the front windshield of the vehicle driven by Hess, striking him,\" DeVine said. \"At this time, we do not believe Hess used a firearm in connection to this incident.\" Hess' video shows officers standing near the car and he can be heard saying, \"I would like the higher commands to come out.\" The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) is investigating the shooting and has released few details, but the incident has sparked outrage and calls for justice from the community.\n\nHess' family has been vocal about their concerns, with his mother, Tammy Hess, posting on Facebook that her son was \"executed\" and that the officers involved should be held accountable.\n\n\"We want answers,\" Tammy Hess wrote. \"We want justice for Rodney. We want the truth to come out.\"\n\nThe family has also set up a GoFundMe page to help cover funeral expenses and to support the investigation.\n\nAs the investigation continues, many are calling for body camera footage and dash cam footage to be released, as well as for the officers involved to be identified and held accountable.\n\n\"This is a clear case of police brutality,\" said local activist, Rev.

The Wall Street Journal first reported that Conway -- a corporate lawyer -- was expected to be tapped for the position. Conway had previously been considered for the post of US solicitor general, according to sources who spoke to CNN in December. Conway, a longtime critic of the Trump administration, would be a surprise pick for the role, given his vocal opposition to many of the President's policies. If confirmed, he would head the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice to the President and executive branch agencies.\n\nConway's appointment would be seen as a significant move by the White House, as it would put a vocal critic of the administration in a key position. The move has already drawn criticism from some Republicans, who see Conway's opposition to Trump's policies as a liability.\n\n\"It's a strange choice, to say the least,\" said Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"I'm not sure what kind of advice he would be giving the President, given his history of criticizing the administration.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, Conway's supporters argue that his legal expertise and experience would make him an excellent choice for the role. \"George Conway is a highly respected lawyer with a deep understanding of the law,\" said Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"I think he would be a great addition to the Office of Legal Counsel.\"\n\nThe nomination is still pending before the Senate, and it is unclear when a vote will be held. If confirmed, Conway would replace Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, who has been serving in the role on an acting basis since last year.\n\nConway's appointment would be the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to shake up its legal team. Earlier this year, the administration announced that it would be replacing several high-ranking lawyers in the Justice Department, including the Solicitor General and the Acting Solicitor General.\n\nThe news of Conway's potential nomination has sparked widespread speculation about the motivations behind the move. Some have speculated that the administration is trying to send a message to its critics, while others have suggested that Conway's appointment would be a way to undermine the administration's opponents.\n\nRegardless of the motivations, Conway's potential appointment is likely to be closely watched by legal observers and political analysts alike. As the administration continues to face legal challenges to its policies, Conway's expertise and experience would be crucial in navigating the complex legal landscape.",

The country has been pursuing a policy of self-reliance in defense technology, and the successful test of the rocket engine is seen as a major step forward in this effort.\n\nThe test comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the United States and South Korea conducting regular military exercises and the North Korean government continuing to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The development of the rocket engine is seen as a key component of North Korea's military strategy, and its successful test is likely to be viewed as a significant achievement by the country's leaders.",

The Syrian military said the jets struck a military site near Palmyra, while Israel says they targeted a weapons shipment to Iran-backed Hezbollah. Syria claims their missiles downed one Israeli jet and hit another, which Israel rejected as \"absolutely untrue.\" \"Our central problem, and this above and beyond all of the other issues, is the transfer of advanced weapons from Syria to Lebanon,\" Liberman said. \"Every time we identify a transfer like this, we will work to prevent the transfer of game-changing weapons. On this issue there will not be any compromise,\" the outspoken Defense Minister added. Liberman has not shied away from threatening rhetoric since taking over the Defense Ministry last year. Rising tensions Friday's encounter was the most serious clash between Israel and Syria since the start of the Syrian civil war six years ago. The Israeli Defense Minister's bold statement has sparked widespread concern and debate in the region. Many experts are warning of the potential for a full-blown conflict between Israel and Syria, while others are calling for restraint and diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue.\n\nThe Syrian government has issued a statement condemning Liberman's remarks, calling them \"aggressive and irresponsible.\" The Syrian military has also vowed to continue defending its airspace against Israeli aggression.\n\nHezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group, has also weighed in on the issue, saying that any attack on its supply lines would be met with a fierce response. The group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has called on the international community to condemn Israel's actions and support Syria's right to defend itself.\n\nThe United States has urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any actions that could escalate the situation. A State Department spokesperson said, \"We are concerned about the rising tensions between Israel and Syria, and we urge both sides to take steps to de-escalate the situation and avoid any actions that could lead to further violence.\"\n\nThe European Union has also called for calm, saying that any military action would be \"unacceptable\" and could have serious consequences for regional stability.\n\nThe Israeli government has defended Liberman's remarks, saying that they are necessary to ensure the country's security. A government spokesperson said, \"Israel will not tolerate any attempts to transfer advanced weapons to Hezbollah, and we will take all necessary measures to prevent it.\"\n\nThe situation remains tense, with both sides continuing to trade threats and rhetoric.

But before he ran for office, Trump was the most fervent critic of the fact that President Barack Obama regularly hit the links with friends, aides and advisers, arguing that it showed the president was unserious about fixing America's problems. Now that Trump is President, the comments are coming back to complicate his golf habit.\n\nTrump has visited the two courses near his Mar-a-Lago estate -- Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter -- 10 times in the first two months of his presidency. His frequent golf outings have raised questions about the cost of the trips and whether they are a distraction from his duties as president.\n\nTrump's golf habit has also drawn comparisons to Obama's, who was criticized by Trump and other Republicans for his frequent golf outings. At the time, Trump tweeted that Obama was \"golfing with his rich friends\" and accused him of being \"out of touch\" with the American people.\n\nBut Trump's own golf habit has been met with a mix of criticism and admiration. Some have praised his ability to use the golf course as a way to build relationships and negotiate with world leaders, while others have criticized the cost of the trips and the time spent away from Washington.\n\nThe president's golf habit has also raised questions about the role of his golf courses in his presidency. Critics have accused Trump of using his golf courses as a way to line his own pockets, while supporters have argued that the courses are a legitimate business venture.\n\nDespite the controversy, Trump has shown no signs of slowing down his golf habit. In fact, he has said that he plans to continue playing golf throughout his presidency, and has even invited world leaders to join him on the course.\n\nThe president's love of golf has also sparked a debate about the role of the presidency in American culture. Some have argued that the president's golf habit is a reflection of the country's obsession with sports and celebrity culture, while others have argued that it is a way for the president to connect with the American people and build relationships with world leaders.\n\nUltimately, the controversy surrounding Trump's golf habit is likely to continue to be a topic of debate and discussion in the months and years ahead. But one thing is clear: Trump's love of golf is not going away anytime soon.",

Schiff's remarks are at odds with the statements of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who said two weeks ago that he had not seen any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. \"I was surprised to see Director Clapper say that because I don't think you can make that claim as categorically as he did,\" Schiff said.

According to Schiff, the committee has received numerous reports of suspicious interactions between Trump's associates and Russian officials, which he believes warrant further investigation. \"We've had multiple sources come forward with information that suggests there was more to these interactions than just a casual meeting or two,\" he said. \"We need to get to the bottom of what was going on and who was involved.\"\n\nSchiff also expressed frustration with the Trump administration's handling of the investigation, accusing them of stonewalling the committee's requests for information. \"We've been asking for documents and testimony from key officials for months, but we've gotten very little cooperation,\" he said. \"It's like they're trying to hide something.\"\n\nThe congressman's comments come as the committee prepares to take testimony from FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers about the administration's investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the US election. Schiff said he is particularly interested in learning more about the FBI's investigation into Russian hacking and whether it was connected to any attempts by Trump's associates to collude with Russian officials.\n\n\"We need to know whether the FBI's investigation was focused solely on the hacking or if they were also looking into whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia,\" Schiff said. \"We also need to know what the NSA's role was in the investigation and whether they had any information that could have helped the FBI.\"\n\nThe testimony from Comey and Rogers is expected to be a key moment in the investigation, and Schiff said he is hopeful that the two officials will provide the committee with the information it needs to get to the bottom of the matter. \"We're going to do our best to get to the truth and hold those responsible accountable,\" he said.",

The rebel fighters began the attack from the district of Jobar in northeastern Damascus, an area split between rebel and government control. The rebel factions seem to have prepared for this offensive, Rahman said. The clashes erupted early in the morning, with rebel fighters launching a barrage of rockets and mortar shells at government-held areas of the city. The Syrian government responded with its own artillery fire, causing widespread destruction and panic among civilians.\n\nAccording to reports from the ground, the fighting was intense, with both sides suffering significant losses. The rebels claimed to have made gains in several neighborhoods, but the government denied this, saying it had repelled the attacks and was in control of the situation.\n\nThe city's residents were caught in the middle, with many fleeing their homes to seek safety in other parts of the city. The sounds of explosions and gunfire echoed through the streets, causing widespread fear and disruption.\n\nThe international community has condemned the violence, with the United Nations calling for an immediate ceasefire and a return to peace talks. The US and other Western powers have also issued statements calling for restraint and an end to the violence.\n\nThe cause of the clashes is unclear, but analysts say it may be related to the government's recent military gains in other parts of the country. The rebels, who have been weakened by years of fighting, may be trying to regain momentum and attention from the international community.\n\nThe situation in Damascus is fluid and developing, with reports of new clashes and casualties emerging by the hour. The city's residents are bracing for a long and difficult night, with no end to the violence in sight.",

Abadi said he hoped the US and other allies would continue to offer economic assistance to Iraq, which he said faced a financial crisis as a result of the war against the militant group. The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, arrived in Washington D.C. on Monday, where he is expected to meet with senior US officials to discuss the ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS. Abadi's visit comes as Iraqi forces have made significant gains against the terrorist group, recapturing key cities and territories in recent months.\n\nAccording to sources close to the meeting, Abadi is expected to urge the US to continue providing military aid and training to Iraqi forces, as well as economic assistance to help rebuild the country's infrastructure and economy. The US has been a key ally in the fight against ISIS, providing significant military support and airstrikes against the group's strongholds.\n\nIn addition to the military and economic assistance, Abadi is also expected to discuss the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) with US officials. Iraq has been hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees and IDPs fleeing violence and persecution in other parts of the region, and Abadi is expected to ask the US to provide additional support to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe meeting between Abadi and US officials is seen as an opportunity to strengthen ties between the two countries and to coordinate efforts to defeat ISIS. The US has been a key partner in the fight against the terrorist group, and Abadi's visit is seen as a chance to reaffirm the commitment of both countries to defeating ISIS and stabilizing the region.\n\nAbadi's visit to the US comes as the US is also facing its own challenges in the fight against ISIS, including the recent loss of the city of Ramadi to the terrorist group. The US has been working to rebuild its military presence in the region, and Abadi's visit is seen as an opportunity to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the two countries.\n\nIn a statement, the US State Department said that Abadi's visit would be an opportunity to \"reaffirm our commitment to the defeat of ISIS and to discuss ways to support the Government of Iraq in its efforts to stabilize the country and rebuild its economy.\" The statement also noted that the US would be discussing ways to support Iraq's efforts to address the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict, including providing aid to refugees and IDPs.",

The Republicans gathered for an emotional pre-vote caucus in the basement of the Capitol. As they departed, many said it was one of the most impressive conferences they had ever attended. But when House Speaker Paul Ryan offered little more than a brief statement and dashed off without answering reporters' questions, the signs of defeat were apparent. Having practiced his usual method of deal-making, Trump then walked away from the hard work of political negotiating. White House spokesman Sean Spicer, insisting there was no \"plan B,\" predicted victory. While Ryan tried to get his House in order, the President climbed into a big-rig tractor parked outside the White House, sounded the horn like an excited boy and pretended he was driving. (He hadn't looked so happy in weeks.) Despite all these expressions of confidence, the Republicans who run Washington never could come together behind Trumpcare. Hours before the vote, The Daily Beast reported that, according to officials in the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump's top adviser, Steve Bannon, wanted him to make a list of his House GOP enemies so they might be punished. When this last tough-guy tactic failed, Trump and Ryan slammed on the brakes and canceled the showdown vote. In a stunning turn of events, the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was abandoned just hours before the scheduled vote. The move came after it became clear that the party's leaders did not have the votes to pass the bill.\n\nAccording to sources on Capitol Hill, several Republican lawmakers had expressed serious concerns about the bill's provisions, particularly its impact on the Medicaid program and the potential loss of coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nIn the wake of the collapse of the healthcare bill, President Trump took to Twitter to express his frustration and disappointment. \"SAD! Just found out that votes are no,\" he wrote. \"Don't think it's possible to repeal and replace the ACA. Guess we'll have to try again.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan also issued a statement, saying that the party would \"regroup and move forward\" in its efforts to reform the healthcare system.\n\nThe failure of the healthcare bill was a major blow to the Trump administration, which had made it a key priority of its first 100 days in office. The president had promised to repeal and replace the ACA, also known as Obamacare, on his first day in office, but the process has been much more complicated than anticipated.\n\nThe collapse of the bill also raised questions about the future of the Republican Party's legislative agenda. The party had hoped to pass a number of other bills, including tax reform and infrastructure spending, but those efforts are now in jeopardy.\n\nAs the dust settles, it remains to be seen what the future holds for healthcare reform in the United States. One thing is certain, however: the process will be long and difficult, and will require compromise and collaboration from both parties.",

Upset with Republicans Debby Goodwin, a 63-year-old from Arkansas, said she was ashamed that she voted Republican and was happy the House didn't vote on a bill Friday. \"Our family is going through a lot of undue stress because of Trump and the Republicans not caring about people in our economic level and they need to start listening to us,\" she told CNN. Goodwin's son, whose family is not on Obamacare, said he was glad there was no vote. \"It shows that the citizens were heard. and frustrated with the lack of progress on healthcare reform. \"It's a total disaster,\" said Tom Harris, a 45-year-old small business owner from Ohio. \"We need a solution, not a bunch of empty promises and partisan bickering.\"\n\nSome conservatives, however, were relieved that the bill did not pass. \"It's a huge victory for freedom and a huge defeat for the swamp in Washington,\" tweeted Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican.\n\nThe bill's withdrawal comes after a tumultuous week in Washington, marked by protests and intense lobbying from both sides of the aisle. The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the American Nurses Association were among the many medical groups that opposed the bill, citing concerns about its impact on patient care and the stability of the healthcare system.\n\nThe White House had been pushing hard for the bill's passage, with President Trump tweeting his support for the measure on Thursday. But despite the administration's efforts, the bill struggled to gain traction on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe defeat is a significant setback for House Speaker Paul Ryan, who had been a key proponent of the bill. Ryan announced earlier this week that he would delay a vote on the bill until Friday, but ultimately decided to pull it from consideration altogether.\n\nThe move is likely to be seen as a victory for Democrats, who have been opposed to the bill from the start. \"Today, the American people won,\" tweeted Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent. \"The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that all Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare.\"\n\nThe withdrawal of the bill leaves the future of healthcare reform in limbo. It is unclear what will happen next, but many lawmakers are already calling for a new approach to healthcare reform.\n\n\"We need to start from scratch and work together to find a solution that works for everyone,\" said Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican. \"We can't keep going back and forth on the same old ideas and expecting different results.\"",

        "Text": "And after nearly three full months into the year, he now has to face a head-on a challenge that is likely to haunt his tenure as speaker for the foreseeable future: seemingly irreconcilable differences among his fellow Republicans. \"Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,\" Ryan told reporters Friday. \"And well, we're feeling those growing pains today.\" The stunning setback was particularly excruciating for the 47-year-old, who made his name in Washington as a conservative policy wonk committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act and ascended to the powerful position of House speaker in fall 2015. The bill that too many of his fellow colleagues ultimately rejected was based on Ryan's signature policy agenda, called \"A Better Way.\" \"I don't know what else to say other than Obamacare is the law of the land. It'll remain law of the land until it's replaced,\" he said. \"We're going to be living with Obamacre for the foreseeable future.\" It's a rough reminder that life is different for Ryan now than before Trump was elected. As the House speaker, Ryan had been touting the American Health Care Act (AHCA) as a replacement for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. However, on Friday, a majority of his Republican colleagues rejected the bill, dealing a significant blow to Ryan's leadership and his party's ability to repeal the ACA.\n\nThe defeat was a surprise to many, as the AHCA had been touted as a major achievement of the Trump administration and the Republican Party. Ryan had spent months negotiating with moderate and conservative Republicans to find a compromise, but ultimately, the bill fell short of the 216 votes needed to pass.\n\nThe failure of the AHCA has sent shockwaves through Washington, with many lawmakers and analysts questioning Ryan's ability to lead the party. Some have called for his resignation, while others have urged him to try to find a new path forward.\n\nDespite the setback, Ryan remains committed to repealing the ACA, and has vowed to continue working with his colleagues to find a solution. However, the failure of the AHCA has made it clear that the process will be more difficult and complicated than initially thought.\n\nAs the dust settles, many are left wondering what's next for Ryan and the Republican Party. Will they be able to find a new path forward on healthcare, or will they continue to struggle to find common ground? Only time will tell.",

Soon after, the area would be engulfed in horror, and Keith Palmer, the 48-year-old police officer who smiled politely for her photograph would be dead. Martin, who is from West Palm Beach, Florida, traveled to London to visit her son who is studying abroad. While taking a tour of the city, her son showed her Parliament. As they walked towards the iconic building, Martin couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and awe at the grandeur of the British government's seat. Her son, who was studying abroad, had been raving about the history and significance of the location, and she was excited to see it for herself.\n\nAs they approached the entrance, Martin noticed a police officer standing guard outside the gates. She had always been fascinated by the role of law enforcement, and she couldn't resist asking the officer if she could take a photo with him. The officer, Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old veteran of the Metropolitan Police Service, smiled politely and agreed.\n\nThe two of them posed for a brief moment, with Martin beaming from ear to ear. She thanked Keith and continued on her way with her son, unaware of the tragedy that was about to unfold.\n\nJust minutes later, a loud explosion rocked the area, followed by the sound of gunfire.

She and her son quickly made their way back to their hotel, where they were met with a mix of shock and sadness from the other guests.\n\nAs news of the attack spread, Martin found herself thinking of Keith, the police officer who had so briefly and kindly posed for her photo. She couldn't help but wonder what had gone through his mind in those final moments, and how his family and colleagues would cope with the loss of such a brave and dedicated public servant.\n\nThe attack on Westminster would go down in history as one of the most devastating and tragic events in recent British history, and Martin's chance encounter with Keith Palmer would serve as a poignant reminder of the human cost of terrorism.",

        "Text": "Among the recent deaths were five Russian diplomats. Some of the deaths appeared natural and governments have ruled out foul play. In some cases, though, questions remain. That's either because the facts have changed over time, details are hard to come by, or the deaths are still under investigation. Self-proclaimed online sleuths and conspiracy theorists have filled the information void with speculation that the deaths were somehow related to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. No evidence has surfaced to make such a connection. Here's a rundown of the eight deaths-and one near fatality: Russian politician who fled to Ukaine shot dead Denis Voronenkov, 45, was gunned down Thursday outside a hotel in Kiev. Voronenkov and his wife both spoke out against Putin after they left Russia for Ukraine in October. Voronenkov also helped Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian influence, testifying in a treason trial against ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was perceived as a puppet politician for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine's president called the shooting a \"Russian state terrorist act.\" The investigation into Voronenkov's death is ongoing, but Ukrainian authorities have already arrested several suspects, including a former Ukrainian MP with alleged ties to Russian intelligence. The motive behind the killing remains unclear, but Ukrainian officials have hinted that it may be linked to Voronenkov's high-profile testimony in the Yanukovych trial.\n\nAnother death that has sparked controversy is that of Zakharchenko, the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) in eastern Ukraine. He was killed in a blast at a restaurant in Donetsk on August 31. The DPR, which is backed by Russia, has accused Ukraine of being responsible for the attack, while Ukraine has denied any involvement.\n\nThe death of Nikolai Glushkov, a Russian businessman and Putin critic, is also shrouded in mystery. He was found dead in his London apartment on April 15, with police ruling out foul play. However, some have questioned the official account, citing a lack of transparency and the fact that Glushkov had been receiving threats.\n\nThe remaining five diplomats who died under suspicious circumstances were all found in their homes or hotels in Moscow. The cause of death in each case has been attributed to natural causes, but some have expressed skepticism about the official explanations.\n\nDespite the lack of concrete evidence linking the deaths to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, conspiracy theories continue to spread online. Many have pointed to the timing of the deaths, which coincides with the ongoing investigation into Russian election meddling and the growing tensions between Russia and the West.\n\nHowever, experts have cautioned against jumping to conclusions, citing the complexity of the investigations and the lack of concrete evidence. \"It's important to remember that just because there are a lot of coincidences, it doesn't mean there's a conspiracy,\" said Dr. Rachel Denber, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"We need to wait for the facts to come out before making any conclusions.\"",

The documents describe exactly where the administration hopes to put its first installment of the border wall, as it described its modest 2017 funding ask. The money will fund 14 miles of new border wall in San Diego, 28 miles of new levee wall barriers and six miles of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley region and 14 miles of replacement fencing in San Diego. The fencing would likely include concrete elements, a source familiar with the plans told CNN. President Donald Trump made building a border along the entire US Southern border a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, and repeatedly pledged Mexico would pay for it, but the initial ask for funds to start building has been modest. The administration requested $1 billion in its supplemental for 2017, and another $2.6 billion for border infrastructure and technology in 2018. Estimates for a full wall along the Southern border have ranged from $12 billion to more than $20 billion. The budget request documents also make clear that the Trump administration is looking to ramp up border security elsewhere, specifying millions to bolster detention facilities and legal support for building the wall. According to the documents, the Trump administration is seeking to increase the number of detention facilities along the border, with a focus on processing and holding asylum seekers. The request includes $137 million to expand the capacity of the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, and $85 million to upgrade the facilities at the Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes City, Texas.\n\nThe administration is also seeking to bolster legal support for its border wall efforts, requesting $10 million to hire additional lawyers and $5 million to fund legal assistance for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn addition to the physical barriers and detention facilities, the administration is also seeking funding for technology and surveillance systems to support border security efforts. The request includes $120 million for surveillance cameras, $50 million for motion sensors, and $20 million for radar systems.\n\nThe budget request also highlights the administration's efforts to improve the processing of asylum seekers and migrants at the border. The request includes $30 million to fund additional asylum officers and $20 million to support the expansion of the Central American Minors Program, which allows minors from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to apply for lawful permanent residence in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration's border security request has been met with criticism from some lawmakers and advocacy groups, who argue that the funding is insufficient to address the root causes of migration and that the administration's focus on physical barriers and detention facilities is misguided. Others have praised the request as a necessary step to secure the border and protect national security.\n\nThe budget request is expected to be debated in Congress in the coming weeks, with lawmakers likely to offer amendments and alternative funding proposals. The outcome of the debate remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Trump administration's border security priorities will continue to be a contentious issue in Washington.",

Eighteen people were injured when the escalator at Mong Kok's Langham Place switched direction from up to down. One man suffered a head injury and was in serious condition, according to CNN affiliate CCTV. Hong Kong authorities have launched an investigation into the sudden malfunction of an escalator at a popular shopping mall in Mong Kok, which sent 18 people tumbling to the ground on Saturday.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the escalator at Langham Place suddenly changed direction, switching from an upward to a downward motion, causing chaos and panic among shoppers. The incident occurred around 4:30 pm local time, when the mall was busy with holiday shoppers.\n\nAmong the injured, one man suffered a serious head injury and was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. The others sustained minor to moderate injuries, including bruises, cuts, and sprains.\n\nPolice investigators believe that the suspects may have tampered with the machine's parts, which could have caused the malfunction. The escalator was inspected and found to be in good condition before the incident, but authorities are still trying to determine the exact cause of the malfunction.\n\n\"We are taking this incident very seriously and are working closely with the mall management and the manufacturer to determine what went wrong,\" said a police spokesperson.\n\nThe mall has since been closed for the day, and an investigation is ongoing. The authorities have also launched a manhunt for the suspects, who are believed to have fled the scene immediately after the incident.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the safety of public transportation and infrastructure in Hong Kong, which is known for its efficient and reliable public transportation system.

A White House official briefed on the plan said Monday the administration believes the government can both \"serve the environment and increase energy independence at the same time\" by urging the EPA for focus on what the administration believes is its core mission: Clean air and clean water. More important than regulating climate change, the official said, is protecting American jobs. \"It is an issue that deserves attention,\" the official said of climate change. \"But I think the President has been very clear that he is not going to pursue climate change policies that put the US economy at risk. It is very simple.\" Tuesday's order will initiate a review of the Clean Power Plant initiative, rescind the moratorium on coal mining on US federal lands and urge federal agencies to \"identify all regulations, all rules, all policies ... that serve as obstacles and impediments to American energy independence,\" the official said. Specifically, the order will rescind at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, including Obama's November 2013 executive order instructing the federal government to prepare for the impact of climate change and the September 2016 presidential memorandum that outlined the \"growing threat to national security\" that climate change poses. \"The previous administration devalued workers by their policies,\" the official said. \"We are saying we can do both. The Trump administration's move to roll back climate change regulations has sparked widespread criticism from environmental groups and scientists, who argue that the decision will have devastating consequences for the planet.\n\n\"This is a catastrophic mistake,\" said Dr. Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist. \"By rescinding these regulations, the Trump administration is putting the entire planet at risk. Climate change is not just an environmental issue, it's a national security issue, and it's a moral issue.\"\n\nThe order has also been met with resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who argue that the move will harm the economy and create jobs.\n\n\"I understand the concerns about climate change, but we can't just shut down our economy to address it,\" said Senator John McCain (R-AZ). \"We need to find a balance between protecting the environment and creating jobs.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to rescind the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, has been particularly criticized. The plan was seen as a key step in reducing the country's carbon footprint and meeting its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.\n\n\"The Clean Power Plan was a critical step in our efforts to address climate change,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. \"By rescinding it, the Trump administration is sending a message that they don't care about the future of our planet.\"\n\nThe move has also been criticized by international leaders, who have expressed concern about the implications for global efforts to address climate change.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed by the Trump administration's decision to roll back climate change regulations,\" said European Union Commissioner for Climate Action Miguel Arias Cañete. \"Climate change is a global issue that requires global action. We urge the Trump administration to reconsider its decision and work with us to address this critical issue.\"\n\nDespite the criticism, the Trump administration remains committed to its plan to reduce regulations and promote American energy independence.\n\n\"We are going to make America great again, and that includes being energy independent,\" said Trump in a statement. \"We will not be held back by outdated regulations and international agreements that are hurting our economy.\"\n\nThe order is expected to have significant implications for the energy industry, with some experts predicting that it could lead to an increase in coal production and a decrease in renewable energy development.\n\n\"This is a major setback for the clean energy industry,\" said Tom Kimbis, CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \"We are extremely disappointed by the Trump administration's decision to rescind the Clean Power Plan and urge them to reconsider.\"\n\nThe order is also expected to have significant implications for the country's efforts to address climate change, with some experts predicting that it could lead to a increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in the country's ability to meet its climate goals.\n\n\"This is a catastrophic mistake,\" said Dr. Mann. \"By rescinding these regulations, the Trump administration is putting the entire planet at risk.

Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, the chairman VneshEconomBank, or VEB, in December 2016. The meeting raises additional questions because VEB has been under US sanctions for three years, and because Kushner has been trying to attract financing for a building project of his in Manhattan. According to sources familiar with the meeting, Kushner and Gorkov met at Trump Tower in New York City on December 13, 2016, just weeks before Trump's inauguration. The meeting was not publicly disclosed until several months later, in May 2017, when it was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nKushner's lawyers have said that the meeting was a routine meeting to discuss VEB's potential interest in investing in Kushner's company, Kushner Companies. However, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are skeptical of the explanation, citing the fact that VEB is a state-run bank and that Kushner has been trying to secure financing for his building project, a 41-story skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\n\"It's certainly a suspicious meeting,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut. \"The fact that VEB is under US sanctions and that Kushner is trying to attract financing for his building project raises serious questions about what was discussed and what was promised.\"\n\nThe meeting is also likely to be scrutinized by investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The FBI and congressional committees have been investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials to influence the outcome of the election.\n\nGorkov has ties to the Russian government, having previously served as the rector of a prestigious Moscow university. He was also a close associate of Igor Sechin, the CEO of Rosneft, a Russian oil company that was the subject of a major deal with ExxonMobil in 2013.\n\nKushner's meeting with Gorkov is just one of several contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials that have been revealed in recent months. In January, it was reported that Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak just days before Trump's inauguration.\n\nThe White House has declined to comment on the meeting, but Kushner's lawyers have said that he did not discuss sanctions with Gorkov and that the meeting was not related to the presidential transition.\n\nThe investigation into Trump's ties to Russia is ongoing, and lawmakers are likely to continue to press for more information about Kushner's meeting with Gorkov. In the meantime, the meeting has raised new questions about the extent of Trump's connections to the Russian government and whether his associates may have sought to profit from their relationships with Russian officials.",

That footprint, found in Bolivia, was the biggest ever from a carnivorous dinosaur. \"The giant footprints are no doubt spectacular,\" Steve Salisbury, the lead author of the study and a professor at the University of Queensland, told CNN of the record-setting fossil.\n\nThe new discovery was made in the southwestern region of Bolivia, in a desert area known as the Chorrera Formation. The team of researchers, led by Salisbury, excavated the fossilized footprint from a layer of sedimentary rock that dates back to the Early Cretaceous period, around 125 million years ago.\n\nThe sauropod's massive footprint is estimated to have belonged to an individual that was around 30 meters (98 feet) long and weighed around 50 tons. The fossil provides valuable insights into the behavior and habitat of these ancient creatures, which were among the largest land animals to have ever lived.\n\n\"This find is a significant addition to our understanding of sauropod biology and ecology,\" said Salisbury. \"It shows that these massive animals were able to roam the Earth during the Early Cretaceous period, and that they were capable of producing extremely large footprints.\"\n\nThe discovery is also significant because it provides evidence of the diversity of sauropod species that existed during the Early Cretaceous period. Until now, most sauropod fossils found in Bolivia have been from smaller species, and this new find suggests that there were also larger species present in the region.\n\nThe research team plans to continue excavating the site and searching for more fossils to learn more about the sauropods that lived in Bolivia during the Early Cretaceous period. The findings are expected to be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal Scientific Reports.",

Thieves Make Off with Valuable Gold Coin from Berlin Museum\n\nBERLIN - In a daring heist, thieves stole a massive 20-inch diameter gold coin from the Bode Museum in Berlin early Monday morning. The coin, which weighs over 200 pounds, is valued at 3.7 million euros, or approximately $4 million.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the thieves entered the museum through an unlocked side door around 2 a.m. local time. They then made their way to the museum's coin collection, where they carefully removed the gold coin from its display case.\n\n\"It was like a scene from a movie,\" said one museum employee, who wished to remain anonymous. \"I was on my way to get a cup of coffee when I heard a loud noise. I turned around and saw two men in black suits walking out of the museum with something big and shiny. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I realize what happened.\"\n\nPolice were called to the scene shortly after the theft was discovered, and a investigation is currently underway. Authorities are reviewing security footage and questioning museum staff and visitors who were in the area at the time of the theft.\n\nThe stolen coin, known as the \"Big Berlin Gold Coin,\" is one of the largest and most valuable gold coins in the world. It was minted in 1888 and features a portrait of German Emperor Wilhelm I.\n\nThe theft is a major blow to the Bode Museum, which is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Berlin. The museum is home to a vast collection of art and cultural artifacts, including works by famous artists such as Monet and Picasso.\n\nThe Berlin police have appealed to the public for any information that may help them catch the thieves and recover the stolen coin. The museum has also offered a reward for any information that leads to the safe return of the coin.\n\nIn the meantime, the Bode Museum has been closed to the public while police continue their investigation. Visitors are being asked to avoid the area and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities.",

        "Text": "In the formal letter that notified the European Union of Britain's intention to leave, May warned that the failure to strike a deal on any future relationship would have consequences for security. \"In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened,\" she wrote in the letter. In all, May mentioned security 11 times in the six-page letter. 'Shameful threat' Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, who oppose Brexit, said her link between trade and security was \"shameful\" and a \"blatant threat.\" \"Security is too important to be used as a bargaining chip and this will backfire in any negotiations, which rather than building up alliances will leave Britain even more isolated,\" he said. Labour MP Yvette Cooper echoed the concerns. \"Completely irresponsible to threaten, gamble or bargain on national security,\" she wrote on Twitter. Speaking in the Commons, Stephen Kinnock of the opposition Labour Party read out an excerpt from the letter and asked, \"Is she really saying the security of our country will be traded like a bargaining chip in these negotiations?\" May replied that it would be important to negotiate a future deal on security. May's comments came as a surprise to many, as the UK and EU had previously agreed that security would not be directly linked to trade negotiations. The move has been seen as a sign of desperation by the British government, which is facing increasing pressure to deliver a successful Brexit deal.\n\nDespite the backlash, May's office maintained that the letter was simply a reflection of the government's commitment to national security. \"The Prime Minister is absolutely clear that the security of our country is of the utmost importance, and we will do everything in our power to protect it,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, many experts have expressed concern that the link between trade and security could have serious consequences for the UK's relationship with its allies. \"This is a classic example of a 'divide and conquer' strategy, where the UK is trying to drive a wedge between the EU and its member states,\" said Dr. Emma DeAngelis, a security expert at the University of Oxford.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU has refused to comment on the letter, but sources close to the negotiations have indicated that the UK's demands are unlikely to be met. \"The EU will not be bullied into accepting a deal that is not in its best interests,\" said a senior EU official.\n\nAs the negotiations continue, the UK and EU are facing increasing pressure to reach a deal. With the deadline for Brexit looming, time is running out for the two sides to come to an agreement. Will the UK's threat to link trade and security be enough to persuade the EU to make concessions, or will it backfire and leave Britain even more isolated? Only time will tell.",

        "Text": "David Cameron -- May's predecessor who lost the Brexit referendum -- has reason to be puzzled by the upshot of his defeat. Britain is now leaving the EU because of his request for a \"variable geometry\" -- allowing Britain to opt out of basic EU tenets -- which was unceremoniously turned down by Berlin and, less consequentially, by Paris. Yet, as a direct result of Brexit, Berlin and Paris are now adopting the idea of variable geometry as the way forward for the EU. This first paradox is easier to understand when seen through the lens of the conventional European practice of making a virtue out of failure. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, had for years opposed the idea of a Europe that proceeds at different speeds -- allowing some countries to be less integrated than others, due to their domestic political situation. due to their domestic political situation. However, with the rise of populist and nationalist movements across the continent, Merkel's stance has undergone a significant shift. In a recent interview, she acknowledged that the EU's one-size-fits-all approach was no longer sustainable and that a more flexible framework was necessary to accommodate the diverse needs and priorities of its member states.\n\nThis pivot is not limited to Germany alone. France, too, has shown a willingness to re-examine its stance on variable geometry. French President Emmanuel Macron, who had previously been a vocal critic of the concept, has now expressed his support for a more flexible EU framework. In a speech to the European Parliament, Macron emphasized the need for the EU to adapt to the changing global landscape and to find ways to engage with countries that are not yet ready to join the EU.\n\nThe implications of this shift are far-reaching. For one, it could pave the way for the UK to re-engage with the EU on a more favorable terms. Cameron's idea of a \"variable geometry\" may have been rejected in 2016, but the concept is now gaining traction as a means of addressing the EU's internal divisions and external challenges.\n\nFurthermore, the adoption of variable geometry could also lead to a more decentralized EU, with greater autonomy granted to its member states. This, in turn, could help to reduce tensions between the EU's central authorities and its member states, which have been a source of frustration for many Europeans.\n\nWhile the journey ahead will undoubtedly be complex and fraught with challenges, the EU's willingness to consider variable geometry as a way forward is a positive step towards a more inclusive and flexible European project. As Cameron himself has acknowledged, the Brexit referendum was a wake-up call for the EU, and its aftermath has led to a renewed focus on finding creative solutions to the continent's pressing problems.",

Russian officials and spokespeople for Putin, however, have brushed off the claims several times as a political \"witch hunt.\" The denial comes as intelligence committees from both the House and Senate in the US investigate the alleged interference in the US election, including possible ties between Russian officials and members of Trump's campaign team. The FBI is also conducting its own investigation. The investigation, led by the Senate Intelligence Committee, is focusing on whether Russia's alleged interference was aimed at influencing the outcome of the election, and whether any Trump campaign officials were aware of or involved in the efforts. The committee has subpoenaed several individuals, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, to testify about their ties to Russia.\n\nIn a separate development, the Justice Department announced on Thursday that it had appointed a special counsel to investigate the alleged Russian interference and any potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is a former FBI director who has a reputation for being a seasoned investigator.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has continued to downplay the allegations, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer saying on Thursday that the administration is \"not concerned\" about the investigation. However, the controversy has taken a toll on the administration's approval ratings, with a new poll showing that 62% of Americans believe the President and his campaign had some level of contact with Russian officials during the election.\n\nThe denial by Putin comes as the international community is increasingly divided over the issue. While some countries, including the UK and Germany, have condemned Russia's alleged interference, others, such as China and Iran, have refused to comment or have defended Russia's actions as a legitimate exercise of its sovereign rights.\n\nThe controversy has also led to calls for greater transparency and accountability from lawmakers and the public. \"The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened in the election,\" said Senator John McCain, a leading Republican critic of the President. \"We cannot allow foreign powers to interfere in our democratic process without taking swift and decisive action.\"",

The trailer features footage of melting glaciers, drought-stricken landscapes, and endangered species, as well as interviews with world leaders, scientists, and activists.\n\nThe sequel also delves into the economic and social impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and displacement of communities. Gore argues that the consequences of inaction will be dire, but that there is still time to take action and avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\nThe trailer ends with a call to action, urging viewers to demand that their leaders take bold action to address the climate crisis. \"The truth is inconvenient, but the consequences of ignoring it are catastrophic,\" Gore says. \"It's time to face the truth and take action to protect our planet.\"\n\n\"An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power\" is set to be released in theaters on September 22.

        "Text": "Katie Walsh, the White House's deputy chief of staff, will join a nonprofit group supporting the President's agenda, the President's top aides said Thursday. The move marks the second departure of a senior White House official in the first months of the administration, following national security adviser Michael Flynn's forced resignation last month. It also represents a major change in the makeup of the White House's top staff that could shift the power dynamics within the West Wing as Walsh was a close ally of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. Walsh was Priebus' deputy, joining him in the administration after serving as his chief of staff when he was chairman of the Republican National Committee. The news article continues:\n\nAccording to sources, Walsh's departure is expected to be effective at the end of the month, and she will join the nonprofit group, \"America Forward,\" which is a key supporter of the President's policy initiatives. The group was founded in 2004 and has been a major player in promoting conservative policies and candidates.\n\nWalsh's departure is seen as a significant loss for the White House, particularly given her close relationship with Priebus. The two have worked together for many years, and Walsh was widely seen as a key strategist and advisor to the White House chief of staff.\n\nThe move is also seen as a sign of the ongoing shake-up within the White House staff, which has been marked by a series of high-profile departures and hires. In recent weeks, several other senior officials have left the administration, including Flynn, who resigned after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian officials.\n\nThe White House has been working to fill the vacancies left by these departures, and several new hires have been announced in recent days. However, the constant turnover has raised concerns about the stability and coherence of the administration's policy-making process.\n\nIn a statement, Priebus praised Walsh for her service to the administration, saying that she had been a \"tireless advocate\" for the President's agenda. \"Katie has been an invaluable member of our team, and I am grateful for her dedication and expertise,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not provide further details about the circumstances surrounding Walsh's departure or the timing of her move to the nonprofit group. However, sources close to the administration said that the decision was made jointly by Walsh and Priebus, and that it was seen as a natural progression for her career.\n\nWalsh's departure is likely to have significant implications for the administration's policy-making process, particularly given her close relationship with Priebus. However, the White House has said that it will continue to function smoothly, and that the departure will not disrupt the administration's ability to carry out its agenda.",

        "Text": "US District Court Judge Derrick Watson blocked the core provisions of the revised executive order two weeks ago, concluding that the order likely violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution by disfavoring Muslims. But Watson's earlier decision was only a limited freeze of the executive order through a temporary restraining order. Read the ruling As a result, the plaintiffs asked the judge to convert that decision into a longer-term preliminary injunction and Watson agreed Wednesday night, meaning that the President's 90-day ban on foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries and the 120-ban on all refugees entering the country are now blocked indefinitely, unless any higher court changes Watson's order or the state's lawsuit is otherwise resolved. The ruling is a major setback for the Trump administration, which had argued that the revised executive order was necessary to protect national security and prevent terrorism. The order, which was announced in September, targeted citizens from six predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen - and all refugees worldwide.\n\nThe plaintiffs, who are challenging the order in court, argued that it was unconstitutional and discriminated against Muslims. They pointed out that the order singled out Muslim-majority countries and did not apply to other countries with similar security concerns.\n\nThe judge's decision to convert the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction means that the ban will remain in place until the lawsuit is resolved or a higher court intervenes. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling has sparked outrage from the Trump administration and its supporters, who have accused the judge of overstepping his authority and ignoring the national security concerns at play. \"This is a disaster for our country,\" tweeted White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. \"The judge has once again put the interests of political correctness above the safety and security of the American people.\"\n\nBut civil rights groups and immigration advocates have hailed the decision as a victory for justice and equality. \"Today's ruling is a powerful reminder that the Constitution protects all Americans, regardless of their religion or country of origin,\" said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project. \"We will continue to fight to ensure that our government does not discriminate against anyone based on their faith or national origin.\"\n\nThe dispute over the executive order is just the latest in a series of legal battles between the Trump administration and the courts over immigration and national security policies. The case is expected to continue to wind its way through the courts, with a potential Supreme Court showdown looming in the future.",

Critics, however, claim that Trump's hiring violates federal nepotism laws. CNN's Alisyn Camerota asked Jason Miller on \"New Day\" Thursday: \"The one thing I don't understand is how is this not nepotism?\" Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign, responded by saying that Ivanka Trump's role would be similar to that of a policy analyst, and that she would be working on issues such as women's empowerment and economic development. Miller claimed that Ivanka's role was not a direct result of her being the President's daughter, but rather her expertise and qualifications in the field.\n\nHowever, critics were quick to point out that Ivanka's hiring would still be a clear example of nepotism, and that it would undermine the integrity of the administration. \"This is a clear violation of the spirit of the nepotism laws,\" said ethics expert Kathleen Clark. \"It's not just about the letter of the law, it's about the appearance of impropriety. It looks like the President is giving his daughter a special deal because she's his daughter.\"\n\nIvanka Trump's hiring has also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. As a senior advisor, she would have access to sensitive information and would be in a position to influence policy decisions. Critics worry that she would use her position to advance her own business interests, rather than the interests of the American people.\n\nThe White House has not yet released any details about Ivanka's compensation package, or how she will be held accountable for her actions as a senior advisor.

        "Text": "The law, called the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, was passed and signed by Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, and goes into effect later this year. It prohibits dismemberment abortion, the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions. A clause in the law states that the husband of a woman getting the abortion can sue the doctor to stop his wife's abortion. The husband has to be the father of the child. The law has sparked controversy and criticism from reproductive rights advocates and medical professionals who argue that it interferes with a woman's right to choose and undermines the doctor-patient relationship. They also point out that the clause allowing the husband to sue the doctor raises concerns about privacy and autonomy for pregnant individuals.\n\nOpponents of the law are considering legal challenges in order to block its implementation, citing concerns about its constitutionality and potential harm to women's health. Many believe that the law is a step backwards in terms of reproductive rights and could set a dangerous precedent for further restrictions on abortion access in the state.\n\nProponents of the law, on the other hand, argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of unborn children and promote a culture of life. They see it as a way to prevent what they consider to be a barbaric and inhumane procedure.\n\nThe debate over the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act reflects the ongoing controversy and division surrounding abortion rights in the United States. As the law goes into effect later this year, it is likely to continue to be a contentious issue with implications for women's health and reproductive freedom.",

        "Text": "The human rights group says as many as 13,000 people have been executed at Saydnaya prison, north of the capital Damascus in a \"hidden\" campaign authorized by senior regime figures. Amnesty's report, Human slaughterhouse, says prisoners are moved in the middle of the night from their cells under the pretext of being transferred. They are taken to the grounds of the prison, where they are hanged, likely unaware of their fate until they feel the noose around their neck, Amnesty alleges. The report is the culmination of a year-long investigation, including interviews with 84 witnesses including security guards, detainees, judges and lawyers, Amnesty says. Most of those hanged were civilians \"believed to be opposed to the government,\" the report finds. \"The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" Lynn Maalouf, the deputy director for research at Amnesty's Beirut office, said in a statement announcing the report. Amnesty International says there are two detention centers at Saydnaya prison. In the \"red building,\" the majority of detainees are civilians who have been arrested since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, according to the organization. In the \"white building,\" the detainees are mainly military officers and soldiers. CNN has asked the Syrian government for comment. The report contends that the executed detainees were given a sham trial by \"a so-called Military Field Court.\" \"The judge will ask the name of the detainee and whether he committed the crime. Amnesty International says that the lack of due process and the secretive nature of these executions make them extrajudicial killings, which are in violation of international law. The Syrian government has consistently denied allegations of human rights abuses in the country, but Amnesty's report adds to the mounting evidence of atrocities being committed.\n\nThe report also highlights the inhumane conditions at Saydnaya prison, with prisoners being subjected to torture, deprivation of food and water, and other forms of mistreatment. Many of the detainees are held in overcrowded cells, with inadequate sanitation and ventilation.\n\nAmnesty International is calling for an immediate investigation into the atrocities at Saydnaya prison and for the perpetrators to be held accountable for their actions. The organization is urging the international community to put pressure on the Syrian government to end these human rights abuses and to ensure that all detainees are treated humanely and afforded their basic rights.\n\nThe report serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing crisis in Syria and the urgent need for justice and accountability for the victims of the conflict. It is a testament to the bravery of those who have come forward to speak out against the horrors they have witnessed, and a call to action for the international community to take a stand against these atrocities.",

When she was tired and wanted to go home, the people asked her to stay and talk and have a drink. Next thing she knew, she had been smuggled across the border to China. \"At that time, I wanted to leave,\" says Lan. \"There were other girls there in the car but there was people to guard us.\" The villages along the Vietnamese-Chinese border are a hunting ground for human traffickers. Girls as young as 13 say they are tricked or drugged, then spirited across the porous border by boat, motorbike or car. Young Vietnamese women are valuable commodities in China, where the one-child policy and long-standing preference for sons has heavily skewed the gender ratio. To put it simply, Chinese men are hungry for brides. \"It costs a very huge amount of money for normal Chinese man to get married to a Chinese woman,\" explained Ha Thi Van Khanh, national project coordinator for the U.N.'s anti-trafficking organization in Vietnam. Traditionally, Chinese men wishing to marry local women are expected to pay for an elaborate banquet and to have purchased a new home to live in after the wedding. \"This is why they try to import women from neighboring countries, including Vietnam.\" Diep Vuong started the Pacific Links Foundation to combat trafficking in Vietnam. The foundation has been working tirelessly to rescue and reintegrate victims of human trafficking like Lan. Thanks to their efforts, Lan was eventually able to escape and return to Vietnam. \"I was lucky to have survived and been rescued,\" Lan says, her voice filled with gratitude.\n\nBut for many other young girls and women in Vietnam, the threat of being trafficked to China remains very real. The lure of a better life, combined with the promise of marriage to a wealthy Chinese man, can be too tempting for some to resist. This is why organizations like the Pacific Links Foundation play a crucial role in educating communities about the dangers of human trafficking and providing support to those most at risk.\n\nVuong and her team are dedicated to raising awareness about the issue and empowering women to make informed choices about their future. Through various programs and initiatives, they are working to prevent trafficking, support survivors, and advocate for stronger laws and policies to combat the trade.\n\nAs for Lan, she now dreams of pursuing her education and helping other girls avoid the same fate she experienced. \"I want to use my own story to raise awareness and protect other girls from falling into the hands of traffickers,\" she says, determination shining in her eyes.\n\nWith organizations like the Pacific Links Foundation leading the way, there is hope for a future where young women in Vietnam can pursue their dreams without fear of being exploited or trafficked. But until then, the fight against human trafficking continues.",

The officers were suspended pending an inquiry into accusations that they used excessive force while arresting the young man, identified only as Th¨¦o, during an identity check last week. All four officers involved in the February 2 incident have been charged with aggravated assault, while one was also charged with rape, according to the Interior Ministry. Victim describes the incident Th¨¦o said that he was walking with his headphones on when he was approached by the police. \"When I realized how violent their tone was, I said to myself 'they seem pretty serious.' So I stood against the wall, and then, one of the policemen beat me,\" Th¨¦o told France's BFM television channel on Tuesday. \"I saw one of them take his baton and stick it into my bum. As soon as he did that, I fell on my belly. I felt weak. It was as if my body had given up on me. Théo's allegations have sparked outrage and protests in the community, with residents demanding justice for the young man and calling for an end to police brutality. The incident has also reignited discussions about racial profiling and discrimination in France, where many people of African and Arab descent have long complained about being unfairly targeted by law enforcement.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron tweeted his support for Théo, calling the incident \"unacceptable\" and promising that justice would be served. Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin visited Théo in the hospital, where he is being treated for injuries sustained during the arrest.\n\nThe officers involved in the incident have denied the allegations of rape, claiming that the baton accidentally slipped and entered Théo's rectum. However, they have admitted to using excessive force during the arrest, leading to the charges of aggravated assault.\n\nThe case has put a spotlight on the need for police reform in France, with calls for better training, accountability, and oversight of law enforcement officers. The government has announced plans to review police procedures and training to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, Théo's supporters continue to hold demonstrations and rallies in Aulnay-sous-Bois, demanding justice and an end to police violence. The young man remains determined to seek justice for the violation he suffered at the hands of those who were supposed to protect him.",

If the White House loses its immigration case before the courts, blame the judges. And if there's some sort of attack, it's their fault, too. Trump tweets: \"If something happens, blame him (the Washington state judge) and court system.\" Likewise, if there was confusion at airports worldwide, don't blame the President's hastily arranged travel ban rollout, blame a Delta computer outage, protesters and, of course, the tears of Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer. And what about the actual decision to sign the executive order? Instead of owning it, the President made it clear that, well, he wanted to take more time on implementation, but \"the law enforcement people\" told him otherwise. \"So I wanted to give like a month, then I said, well what about a week? But ultimately, the blame game being played by the White House seems to be deflecting attention from the real issue at hand - the controversial executive order itself. The order, which temporarily bans travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspends the US refugee program, has sparked widespread protests and criticism both domestically and internationally.\n\nWhile the administration continues to point fingers at others for the chaos and confusion surrounding the travel ban, many are questioning the intentions and motivations behind the order. Critics argue that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional, targeting people based on their religion and nationality rather than their actual threat to national security.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, it is imperative for the White House to take responsibility for its actions and decisions, rather than trying to shift blame onto others. The American people deserve transparency and accountability from their government, especially on issues as important as national security and immigration policy.\n\nAs the legal battle over the travel ban continues to unfold in the courts, it remains to be seen whether the White House will continue to play the blame game or finally take ownership of its controversial policy. One thing is clear - the buck should stop at the President's desk, not be passed onto others.",

And it's a military operation.\" The remarks from Trump come as his administration continues to face backlash over its immigration policies, particularly the separation of families at the border. Critics have denounced the approach as inhumane and called for more compassionate solutions to the complex issue of immigration.\n\nDespite the criticism, Trump has remained defiant in his stance on immigration, often pointing to the need for strong borders and national security. The President has also called on Congress to pass legislation to address what he describes as \"loopholes\" in the immigration system.\n\nMeanwhile, advocates for immigrants have renewed their calls for reform and urged the Trump administration to prioritize the well-being of immigrant families. They argue that mass deportations and aggressive enforcement tactics only serve to further disrupt communities and tear families apart.\n\nAs the debate over immigration continues to divide the nation, it remains to be seen what impact the Trump administration's policies will have on undocumented immigrants and the broader immigration system as a whole.",

        "Text": "Malaysian police said in a statement Friday that tests on Kim's eyes and face revealed the presence of the substance. Nerve agents are the most toxic and fast-acting substance known in chemical warfare -- and VX is the most potent of all of them, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Kim, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, died on February 13 before he was scheduled to board a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Macau. Malaysian police claim two women wiped his face with some sort of liquid at the instruction of four North Koreans. He started to feel dizzy minutes later and died shortly after on his way to the hospital. North Korea rejects that version of events, saying that the women would be dead if they had put a lethal chemical on their hands. North Korea has denied any involvement in Kim Jong Nam's death, which has sparked international intrigue and tensions. The use of VX nerve agent in a public place has raised concerns about the potential for more deadly chemical attacks in the future. The Malaysian police have named several North Korean officials as suspects in the case, but they have all left the country and have not been apprehended.\n\nThe international community is closely monitoring the situation, with many countries calling for justice to be served for Kim Jong Nam. The US has condemned the use of chemical weapons and has called for a thorough investigation into the incident. South Korea has also expressed its outrage over the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, who had been living in exile for several years.\n\nThe use of VX nerve agent in such a high-profile assassination has brought renewed attention to the issue of chemical weapons and their potential use by rogue nations. The international community must work together to prevent the proliferation of such deadly substances and hold those responsible for their use accountable. The death of Kim Jong Nam serves as a grim reminder of the dangers posed by chemical warfare and the need for continued vigilance in preventing such attacks in the future.",

        "Text": "VX nerve gas was first developed in the UK in the 1950s as a deadly chemical warfare agent, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Experts say the formula has been replicated in the past by the US, Russia, Syria and Iraq. Here's what we know: What is it? VX nerve agent is an oily liquid that's amber in color, but it's both odorless and tasteless. Nerve agents, like VX, are the most toxic and deadly chemical warfare agents -- they're chemically similar to pesticides, although far stronger. VX is the most potent of all nerve agents, including Sarin, which was developed in Germany in 1938 as a pesticide. As a highly lethal chemical substance that can potentially kill large numbers of people, VX is considered a weapon of mass destruction. How does it work? VX, if in vapor form, is the quickest and deadliest form of the killer gas. As a liquid, it could potentially be released into a water supply or used to poison someone's food. VX nerve agent works by disrupting the normal functioning of the nervous system, leading to muscle paralysis and ultimately death. It can be absorbed into the body through the skin, inhalation, or ingestion. Even a tiny amount of VX can be fatal, making it an extremely dangerous substance.\n\nThe recent use of VX nerve agent in the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has brought renewed attention to the deadly capabilities of this chemical weapon. The attack, which took place at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, resulted in Kim Jong Nam's rapid and agonizing death. The brazen use of VX in a public place has raised concerns about the potential for terrorists to use chemical weapons in future attacks.\n\nThe international community is now grappling with how to prevent the proliferation of VX and other nerve agents, as well as how to respond effectively in the event of a chemical weapons attack. The use of VX in the assassination of Kim Jong Nam serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by chemical weapons and the importance of vigilance in monitoring and controlling these deadly substances.",

'False reports' \"The ministry controls and monitors the public and party officials. It was detected that false reports were made for Kim Jong Un,\" Lee Cheol-woo, another lawmaker who was present, added. According to the NIS briefing, the deputy minister-level officials were accused of providing inaccurate information to Kim Jong Un, which may have displeased the North Korean leader. This revelation sheds light on the harsh realities of working in the State Security Ministry and the consequences of failing to meet the expectations of the regime.\n\nThe use of anti-aircraft guns for executions is a brutal tactic that has been employed by the North Korean regime in the past. It is a stark reminder of the oppressive and authoritarian nature of the government, where even high-ranking officials are not immune to extreme punishment if they are perceived as disloyal or incompetent.\n\nAs the investigation into the state security chief Kim Won Hong continues, there is a sense of fear and uncertainty among working-level officials in North Korea. The possibility of further executions looms over those who may have been involved in providing false reports to Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe revelations from the NIS briefing highlight the precarious and dangerous environment in which officials operate in North Korea. The control exerted by the State Security Ministry over all aspects of public life underscores the grip that the regime has on its people. The recent executions serve as a stark warning to those who dare to betray the trust of Kim Jong Un and his inner circle.",

Several Syrian opposition activists also reported al-Masri was killed by a missile strike.

The questioning agitated some callers. Some community centers have implemented enhanced security measures in response to the threats, including increased police presence and additional staff training.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, has called for swift action to address the rise in anti-Semitic threats and harassment.

        "Text": "Attorneys for the state filed a new 40-page request just before midnight on Tuesday, asking a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order blocking implementation of the new executive order. Trump signed a new executive order Monday banning foreign nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days and banning all refugees for 120 days. In a statement, Hawaii attorney general Douglas Chin said the filings ask the court to declare sections 2 and 6 of Trump's executive order contrary to the constitution and laws of the United States. The attorneys argue that the new executive order still discriminates against individuals based on their religion, citing remarks made by Trump during his presidential campaign calling for a \"complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the country. They also argue that the order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from favoring one religion over another.\n\nIf the temporary restraining order is granted, it would prevent the new executive order from going into effect as scheduled on March 16. This would be a significant blow to the Trump administration's efforts to implement its controversial travel ban, which has been the subject of numerous legal challenges since its initial introduction in January.\n\nThe Trump administration has defended the new executive order as necessary for national security, arguing that the six countries included in the ban - Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen - pose a heightened risk of terrorism. However, critics have pointed out that there have been no fatal terrorist attacks in the United States carried out by individuals from these countries since 2001.\n\nThe legal battle over Trump's travel ban is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, with both sides preparing for a protracted fight in the courts. In the meantime, travelers from the six countries included in the ban are left in a state of uncertainty, unsure of whether they will be able to enter the United States in the coming months.",

Farrar has long been an advocate of women's health in a state that has made it extremely difficult for women to get abortions. And the bill, by pointing out a sexist double standard, is meant to shine a light on the obstacles women deal with when it comes to their health care. \"Let's look at what Texas has done to women,\" Farrar told CNN. \"What if men had to undergo the same intrusive procedures?\" Even the name is a jab Farrar's bill would penalize men for masturbation because such behavior is a failure to preserve the sanctity of life and \"an act against an unborn child.\" The bill, titled the \"Man's Right to Know Act,\" includes provisions such as requiring men to read a booklet called \"A Man's Right to Know\" before obtaining a prescription for Viagra or undergoing a vasectomy or colonoscopy. The booklet would include information on the potential risks and side effects of these procedures, as well as alternatives to them.\n\nIn addition to the waiting period and booklet requirement, the bill also includes a provision that would require men to undergo a rectal exam before receiving a prescription for Viagra, similar to the transvaginal ultrasound that women in Texas are required to undergo before obtaining an abortion. \n\nFarrar's bill has sparked controversy and debate, with some critics calling it a waste of time and resources. However, Farrar maintains that the bill is necessary to highlight the disparities in healthcare access and decision-making between men and women in Texas.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that the bill will pass, Farrar hopes that it will start a conversation about gender equality and reproductive rights in the state. \"If we're going to talk about women's health, let's talk about men's health too,\" Farrar said. \"It's time for men to understand the obstacles women face when it comes to their health care decisions.\"",

While Tillerson will tell Beijing that the US is tired of Chinese companies helping facilitate Pyongyang's weapons program, he'll also seek to engage Chinese support for a broader attempt to rein in North Korea -- resembling the international coalition that created the Iran nuclear deal. He'll do this as he lays the groundwork for Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the US in April. Tillerson will also engage on the usual areas of US-Chinese tension, including the country's claims to contested waters in the South China Sea; trade; the status of Taiwan; and the recent US deployment of a defensive missile system and drones to South Korea. RELATED: Tillerson looks to global effort on Iran as model for North Korea But none of these issues are as fraught or potentially dangerous as the situation with Pyongyang, which seems to have accelerated its nuclear program in the last few months with the aim of perfecting a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver it as far as the US. \"China has been part of the problem rather than part of the solution,\" said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who describes North Korea as a global military threat. Tillerson's trip to Asia comes at a crucial time, as tensions between the US and North Korea continue to escalate. The North Korean regime has conducted multiple missile tests in recent months, in defiance of international sanctions and warnings. The US has responded with a show of force, including the deployment of a naval strike group to the region.\n\nIn this context, Tillerson's visit to China takes on added significance. As North Korea's largest trading partner and ally, China has the most leverage over the regime in Pyongyang. However, Beijing has been reluctant to exert too much pressure on Kim Jong Un's regime for fear of destabilizing the region or triggering a refugee crisis on its border.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tillerson is expected to push for greater Chinese cooperation on North Korea during his meetings in Beijing. The US Secretary of State will likely emphasize the need for a united front against the North Korean threat, similar to the international coalition that successfully negotiated the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nTillerson's visit to China is just the first stop on his tour of Asia, which will also include stops in Japan and South Korea. In both countries, the focus will be on coordinating a response to the growing threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\n\nAs Tillerson navigates these complex diplomatic waters, all eyes will be on how China responds to US pressure on North Korea. The outcome of this high-stakes diplomatic dance could have far-reaching implications for peace and security in the region.",

Eight people have been injured, including those with shock, a French Interior Ministry spokesman told BFMTV, adding that the headteacher was among those hurt. The person arrested wasn't known to police, the spokesman said. Authorities said the attack was not considered a terrorism incident. A student named as Andreas, interviewed on BFMTV, described a scene of chaos and said someone he knew had suffered a hand injury. The incident has shocked the community and raised concerns about school safety in France. Parents of students at the Alexis de Tocqueville school gathered outside, anxiously waiting for news about their children. \n\nOfficials are investigating how the 17-year-old suspect was able to bring such a cache of weapons into the school undetected. The motive behind the attack is still unclear, and authorities are working to determine if the assailant acted alone or had accomplices. \n\nThe injured individuals are receiving medical treatment, and counselors are on hand to provide support to students and staff who witnessed the terrifying event. The headteacher, who was targeted in the attack, is said to be in stable condition.\n\nAs the community comes to terms with this act of violence, there are calls for increased security measures in schools to prevent such tragedies from happening in the future. The French Interior Ministry has assured the public that they are taking the incident seriously and will do everything in their power to ensure the safety of students and faculty members.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, more details are expected to emerge about the shooter and the events leading up to the attack. In the meantime, the community is coming together to support one another and heal from the trauma of this senseless act of violence.",

The agent described the incident as a compromise of national security, according to one of the officials. Also stolen were the agent's lapel assignment pins that gave her access to security details that protected Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, the pope and the United Nations General Assembly. The stolen laptop and lapel pins were taken from the agent's vehicle, which was parked in her driveway at her home in Brooklyn, officials said. The agent, who works for the Secret Service, reported the theft on Thursday morning when she discovered her car had been broken into. Authorities are currently investigating the incident and trying to determine who may have been responsible for the theft.\n\nThe Secret Service has strict protocols in place to prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands, but this breach has raised concerns about the agency's ability to safeguard critical data. Officials are urging anyone with information about the stolen laptop and lapel pins to come forward and assist in the investigation.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after the theft was reported, the Secret Service emphasized the importance of protecting information related to the security of high-profile individuals and events. The agency is working closely with local law enforcement to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to recover the stolen items and prevent any further breaches of security.\n\nMeanwhile, security measures have been increased around Trump Tower and other locations where the agent's access may have posed a risk. The Secret Service is also conducting a thorough review of its protocols and procedures to identify any potential weaknesses that may have contributed to the theft.",

        "Text": "Xi told Tillerson that there are far more shared interests between the two countries than disputes, emphasizing the need for more communication and coordination on matters involving \"regional hotspots,\" according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry. The meeting occurred hours after North Korea claimed success in testing a new type of rocket engine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a successful test of a high-thrust engine, state-run KCNA reported early Sunday, saying the event had \"historic significance\" that could lead to the \"new birth\" of the country's indigenous rocket industry. Beijing was Tillerson's final stop on his first official trip to Asia, which also included visits to Japan and South Korea. The trip followed a string of North Korean missile launches, escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and prompting fears that Pyongyang is preparing for another nuclear test. North Korea's only ally China is Pyongyang's only major global ally, with bilateral trade accounting for 70% of North Korea's total of the country's trade, providing a political and economic lifeline to Kim's increasingly isolated regime. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called on Beijing to use its leverage over its unpredictable neighbor. He singled out China again Friday, tweeting, \"North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been 'playing' the United States for years. China has done little to help!\" During their meeting, Xi also emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, urging all parties to exercise restraint and avoid actions that could escalate tensions. Tillerson reiterated the United States' commitment to defend its allies in the region, including South Korea and Japan, in the face of North Korean aggression.\n\nThe growing threat posed by North Korea's missile and nuclear programs has dominated discussions during Tillerson's tour of Asia. In Japan, he reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to the defense treaty with Japan and warned of an \"existential threat\" posed by North Korea's weapons programs. In South Korea, Tillerson declared that the U.S. would stand shoulder to shoulder with its ally in the face of North Korean provocations.\n\nAs Tillerson wraps up his tour of Asia, the world watches with bated breath to see how the United States and China will navigate the increasingly volatile situation on the Korean Peninsula. The need for cooperation and communication between the two superpowers has never been more crucial in order to prevent a potential crisis.",

        "Text": "There is quite a bit to look out for. But five key players will determine how much bigger this story gets. 1. The enigma: James Comey Comey's \"October Surprise\" is viewed by many Democrats as hurting Clinton's electoral odds, but Comey is likely not on anybody's side. Indeed, it was reported that he was unhappy with the Trump team and the false allegations by the President that President Obama had the FBI spy on him. 2. The wildcard: Rudy Giuliani\nGiuliani, a former mayor of New York City and a key Trump ally, has been a vocal critic of the FBI's handling of the Clinton email investigation. His possible involvement in the \"October Surprise\" could further complicate the situation and add another layer of intrigue.\n\n3. The strategist: Roger Stone\nStone, a longtime confidant of President Trump, has a history of dirty tricks and political sabotage. His connections to WikiLeaks and possible collusion with Russian hackers could play a significant role in the ongoing investigation.\n\n4. The defender: Rod Rosenstein\nAs the Deputy Attorney General, Rosenstein is responsible for overseeing the Russia probe. His decision to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel was seen as a significant step in the investigation, but his loyalty to Trump has been questioned. How he navigates this delicate balance will be crucial in determining the outcome of the investigation.\n\n5. The influencer: Vladimir Putin\nAs the President of Russia, Putin has been accused of interfering in the 2016 election to help Trump win. His possible involvement in the collusion and hacking of Democratic emails could have far-reaching implications for both Trump and Clinton. Keeping an eye on Putin's actions and statements will be key in understanding the full scope of the investigation.",

        "Text": "But last year a long-standing river pact that governs how the two countries share crucial water resources came under threat as violence flared in the disputed region of Kashmir. On Monday, after a period of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, the two nations are due to come together for much-anticipated talks on the contentious Indus Water Treaty. The enormous Indus River system, which supports livelihoods across Pakistan and northern India, originates in Tibet, flowing through China and Indian-controlled Kashmir before reaching Pakistan. The Indus Water Treaty dates from 1960 and governs how the fractious neighbors manage the vast volume of water, which is vital resource for both countries. However, the discussions in Islamabad come seven months after Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, suspended water talks with Pakistan. This week's discussions are expected to focus on India's plans to use the rivers to provide hydropower -- something which Pakistan has strenuously objected to. Modi announced in September he wanted to review the terms of their 57-year old water-sharing agreement -- a move some analysts interpreted as a threat to the deal. \"Blood and water cannot flow at the same time,\" Modi was quoted by his spokesperson Shri Gopal Baglay after an uptick in violence in contested Kashmir. What is the Indus Water Treaty? The Indus Water Treaty was brokered by the World Bank in 1960 and has survived three wars between India and Pakistan. It grants Pakistan control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while India has rights to the waters of the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers. The treaty has been seen as a rare success in resolving water disputes between hostile neighbors. However, tensions have been rising in recent years as both countries face growing water scarcity and seek to harness the potential of the Indus River system for agricultural and energy purposes.\n\nFor Pakistan, the Indus River is a lifeline, providing water for the country's agriculture and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people. Any changes to the treaty that would reduce the flow of water to Pakistan could have devastating consequences for the country's economy and food security. Pakistan has accused India of violating the treaty by building dams and hydropower projects on rivers allocated to Pakistan under the agreement.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, argues that it has the right to harness the waters of the rivers flowing through its territory for its own development needs. Indian officials have also raised concerns about Pakistan's alleged support for terrorism in the region, linking the issue of water sharing to the broader security dynamics between the two countries.\n\nThe upcoming talks in Islamabad are crucial for both countries to address their concerns and find a way forward in managing their shared water resources. The outcome of the discussions will have far-reaching implications for the stability and security of the region. As the two nuclear-armed neighbors navigate these sensitive negotiations, the world will be watching closely to see if they can find a path towards cooperation and mutual benefit in the face of long-standing tensions.",

        "Text": "Nadia Murad, along with her counsel, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, described her ordeal to Zakaria. It began in 2014 after ISIS militants arrived at her village in Sinjar, Kurdistan, she said. \"Early morning on August 3, 2014, they attacked us,\" she recalled. \"Nearly 6,500 women and children from the Yazidi were abducted and about 5,000 people from the community were killed during that day. For eight months, they separated us from our mothers and our sisters and our brothers, and some of them were killed and others disappeared.\" Murad's mother and six of her brothers and stepbrothers were executed. Murad, along with other unmarried women, was taken as a sex slave and passed around various ISIS militants. At one point, she told the UN Security Council in 2015, as punishment for a failed escape attempt, she was gang raped until she passed out. All of this, she said, was considered legal under ISIS rule -- which dictates that Yazidis, because they do not practice Islam, can be taken as slaves on religious grounds. \"They sold girls, girls that were underage, because ISIS considered that permissible under Islamic law,\" Murad said. Murad's harrowing account shed light on the atrocities committed by ISIS militants against the Yazidi community. She has since become a prominent advocate for victims of human trafficking and sexual violence. In 2018, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her courageous efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.\n\nClooney, who represents Murad, has been instrumental in bringing attention to the plight of the Yazidi community and seeking justice for the victims. She has called for accountability for the crimes committed by ISIS militants and has urged the international community to do more to protect vulnerable populations.\n\nDespite the trauma she has endured, Murad remains resilient and determined to seek justice for herself and others who have suffered similar abuses. Through her advocacy work, she continues to raise awareness about the horrific crimes committed against the Yazidi people and to push for meaningful action to prevent such atrocities from happening again.\n\nAs the world listens to Murad's story and the stories of countless others who have been affected by conflict and violence, it serves as a reminder of the urgent need to address the root causes of such atrocities and to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. Murad's courage and strength in the face of unimaginable adversity are an inspiration to us all.",

Stone, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, has been under scrutiny for his alleged involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying that he played no role in inciting the violence that day.\n\nDespite the denials from the group's representative, questions remain about Stone's potential ties to the organization. Some observers have pointed to his past connections to far-right groups and individuals as a cause for concern.\n\nStone himself has remained defiant in the face of these allegations, insisting that he is being unfairly targeted for his political beliefs. However, with ongoing investigations into the events of January 6th, it is likely that Stone's role in the riot will continue to be scrutinized in the days and weeks to come.",

One official said that the initial assessment indicates that the engine technology could possibly be used in an eventual intercontinental ballistic missile. It was not clear whether the engine would require some adjustment to be used in an ICBM, if it can indeed be used that way at all. A spokesperson for the government stated that these tests are a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions prohibiting North Korea from developing and testing ballistic missile technology. The spokesperson emphasized that the international community must respond strongly to deter North Korea from further pursuing this dangerous technology. The latest engine test only adds to the growing concerns about North Korea's military capabilities and intentions.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned North Korea's continued provocations and reiterated their commitment to ensuring peace and stability in the region. South Korea also expressed its strong concerns over the latest test, calling it a serious threat to regional security.\n\nExperts have warned that North Korea's advancements in missile technology pose a significant risk to global security. The regime's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has raised alarm bells around the world, prompting calls for increased sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang.\n\nThe international community is closely monitoring the situation and is prepared to respond with appropriate measures to address the growing threat posed by North Korea's missile program.
